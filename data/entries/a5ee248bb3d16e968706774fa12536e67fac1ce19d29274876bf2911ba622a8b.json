{"title":"Eucalyptus scab and shoot malformation: a new disease in South Africa caused by a novel species, Elsinoe masingae","link":"https://academic.oup.com/forestry/article/97/2/327/7203813?rss=1","date":1687219200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A serious new disease of <span>Eucalyptus</span> was detected in South African plantations of these trees during the summer of 2021/2022. The first symptoms are minute dark spots on young leaves, petioles and shoots, becoming scab-like as the spots age. On highly susceptible <span>Eucalyptus</span> genotypes, leaves and shoots can become malformed leading to a ‘feathering’ appearance in the tree canopies and in the case of heavy infections, leaf and shoot death occur. Isolations made directly from developing scabs resulted in slow-growing cultures. These were identified, based on phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data for the ITS, LSU, <span>TEF1</span> and <span>RPB2</span> regions, as a novel species of <span>Elsinoe</span> (Elsinoaceae, Myriangiales), described here as <span>E. masingae.</span> Inoculations of an <span>Eucalyptus grandis</span> × <span>Eucalyptus nitens</span> hybrid variety produced the same symptoms as those observed under natural conditions and the pathogen could be re-isolated from the emerging lesions. <span>Elsinoe masingae</span> is closely related to, but clearly distinct from, the recently described <span>Elsinoe necatrix</span> that causes a serious scab and shoot malformation disease on <span>Eucalyptus</span> in Indonesia. Field surveys revealed significant variation in the susceptibility of different <span>Eucalyptus</span> genotypes, with the most severely affected genotypes including an <span>E. grandis</span> × <span>nitens</span> and an <span>E. grandis</span> × <span>urophylla</span> hybrid variety and <span>E. grandis</span>. The disease has also been observed on <span>Eucalyptus amplifolia</span> and on <span>Eucalyptus dunnii</span>, which had mild infections. The observed variation in susceptibility of <span>Eucalyptus</span> planting stock should provide opportunities to avoid serious damage because of scab caused by <span>E. masingae</span> in the future.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Forestry: An International Journal of Forest Research Current Issue","siteHash":"674daa49a10aca976a546578a4b89e6a296c5e7ca75e6f3ff66a7154daf5b0cb","entryHash":"a5ee248bb3d16e968706774fa12536e67fac1ce19d29274876bf2911ba622a8b","category":"Environment"}
