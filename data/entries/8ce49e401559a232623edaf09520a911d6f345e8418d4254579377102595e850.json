{"title":"Multifrequencial Electrical Impedance Tomography Images for Swines Pneumonia Detection Using Conductivities Differences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0722/v1","date":1710317440000,"content":"This article introduces a new MfEIT UDESC Mark I system, which consists of a 32-electrode setup featuring a modified Howland current source, low cost, portable and non radiation. The system is capable of reconstruction of electrical conductivity tomographic images at a rate of 30.624 frames per second and about 5 minutes for imaging. The current source employs 0.5 mA, adjacent current application pattern with frequencies ranging from 10 kHz to 1 MHz. The article outlines the hardware, firmware, and software design specifications, which include the design of the current source, calibration procedures, and image reconstruction process. Tomographic images of conductivity were reconstructed in ex vivo healthy pig lungs and those with pneumonia, as a proof of concept for future applications in live pigs. The high spectral power density, combined with real-time system calibration provides clinical advantages in veterinary medicine. The goal is to identify lung areas affected by Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in pigs, through the analysis of electrical conductivity difference, offering a valuable tool to assist veterinarians for to obtain images of respiratory diseases. The reconstruction method (GREIT) was evaluated with experimental data and It was compared with the Gauss-Newton and Total Variation methods, where GREIT proved to be superior.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ce49e401559a232623edaf09520a911d6f345e8418d4254579377102595e850","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
