{"title":"Advancements in Query-Based Tabular Data Retrieval: Detecting Image Data Tables and Extracting Text using Convolutional Neural Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0108/v1","date":1722582338000,"content":"The detection and recognition of tables in image-based documents is a challenging and essential task for automated data extraction and anal- ysis. This paper introduces a methodology that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to address this problem. By harnessing the ro- bust visual recognition abilities of CNNs, the proposed method effectively detects and extracts tables from image-based documents. Additionally, an Encoder-Dual Decoder (EDD) architecture is employed to extract the textual content from table cells, enabling the transformation of visual data into structured, machine-readable formats. This structured data is then further processed using a Vector Space Model (VSM)-based language modeling technique for query-based table retrieval. The methodologyâ€™s accuracy is assessed by analyzing the spatial relationships between the extracted cells and comparing them against a pre-defined table structure. The results provide an evidence to the effectiveness of the proposed ap- proach, with an impressive 85% accuracy rate and a corresponding error rate of 15%. This accurate extraction and recognition of tables from image-based documents can significantly enhance applications in data analysis, information retrieval, and knowledge extraction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91fbb4213f3db68bfcbdce39405dbcf652b1282e7620c34f64cc594049121cb4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
