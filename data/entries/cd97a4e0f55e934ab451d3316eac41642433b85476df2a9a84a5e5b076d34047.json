{"title":"Synthesis and Biological Study of New Cu(II) and Au(III) Com-Plexes of 2,4-Dithiouracil and Its Derivatives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0929/v1","date":1720769989000,"content":"The goal of this study is to synthesize, determine the structure, and examine the antimicrobial properties of novel metal complexes of 2,4-dithiouracil and its derivatives. These complexes were obtained by mixing aqueous solutions of the corresponding metal salts with the ligand dissolved in DMSO and aqueous NaOH, using a metal-to-ligand ratio of 1:4:2. The structures of the new compounds were analyzed by melting point determination, microwave plasma atomic emission spectrometry (MP-AES) for Cu and Au, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) for S, ATR, solution and solid-state NMR and Raman spectroscopy. The interpretation of the complex spectra was aided by data for 2,4-dithiouracil obtained from 1H-1H COSY, DEPT-135, HMBC, and HMQC spectra. Additionally, the antimicrobial activity of these complex-es and the free ligands was evaluated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as yeasts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd97a4e0f55e934ab451d3316eac41642433b85476df2a9a84a5e5b076d34047","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
