{"title":"Research on Stator Sections Switching Process of High thrust Linear Motors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1629/v1","date":1726841752000,"content":"The high thrust linear motor used for electromagnetic launch is switched with the anti-shunt thyristor as the switch. During the switching process, different current path states will appear, which will lead to changes in motor parameters and current fluctuation. Aiming at the air-core synchronous linear motor with parallel and series power supply, this paper analyzes the change of current path caused by the change of trigger signal of anti-parallel thyristor in the process of sectionalized stator switching. The motor circuit model of the switching process is derived. A new sectionalized stator switching method is proposed to realize the smooth switching of the sectionalized stator powered linear motor. Finally, the correctness of the analysis and modeling is verified by simulation, and the effectiveness of the sectionalized stator switching method is tested by using the test prototype.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ebacecbffdd904448e6bfc852c01a917ffa16fc9e11810bbd69775407cf4505","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
