The dynamic nature of cyber threats complicates the efficient allocation of the location of network intrusion detection sensors, a critical component of a robust cybersecurity framework. Our research introduces an approach that integrates the precision of biomimetic optimization algorithms with the adaptability of Deep Q–Learning. By employing different biomimetic algorithms enhanced with deep learning, we aim to refine the deployment of sensors in network infrastructures, balancing the network security imperative against deployment costs. The results of computational tests demonstrate that the improved iterations leveraging Deep Q–Learning have outperformed their native counterparts. These findings underscore the importance of reinforcement learning, specifically through Deep Q–Learning, as a powerful tool to enhance the effectiveness of metaheuristics in addressing optimization challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93f78c639f263450d6853f77096ce4e5272c81fbf1c818f40d5f2d798ed21376","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
