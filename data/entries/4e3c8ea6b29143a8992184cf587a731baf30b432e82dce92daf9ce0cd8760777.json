{"title":"DiabetesCheck: A Mobile Application for Predicting the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Health Care","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0583/v1","date":1710147762000,"content":"The late diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus can occur due to lack of access to the primary health care system and the non-manifestation of symptoms. Faced with this problem, this work presents the creation of a mobile application, called DiabetesCheck, for predicting the risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. A mathematical model is used, which classifies the risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for a group of patients with intervention and for a comparative group, using Fuzzy Classification and Decision Trees. The proposed application allows the health professional to monitor patients through the history stored in a database, allowing a representation of the evolution of patients and indication of medications. Therefore, this proposal aims to carry out the diagnosis in the initial phase of the disease and help in the prescription of more effective treatments and in the proposition of public policy strategies in epidemiology and screening.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e3c8ea6b29143a8992184cf587a731baf30b432e82dce92daf9ce0cd8760777","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
