{"title":"Osmoregulatory physiology of the angel wing bivalve Cyrtopleura costata (Pholadidae), an estuarine intertidal burrowing mollusc","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mollus/article/doi/10.1093/mollus/eyad025/7525776?rss=1","date":1705104000000,"content":"<span><div>ABSTRACT</div><span>Cyrtopleura costata</span> is a pholadid bivalve that inhabits tidal flats inside burrows <span>c.</span> 40 cm deep, and its visceral mass outgrows its shell significantly. Thus, unlike other bivalves, it cannot isolate its soft tissues from the external environment through complete valve closure. One can thus hypothesize that this bivalve would be inevitably more exposed and susceptible to the tidal changes in salinity. No information regarding its osmoregulatory physiology has been found in the literature. We thus investigated how its fluids would respond to seawater dilution and seawater concentration, and how its tissues would be able to keep their moisture content. Individuals of <span>C. costata</span> were acclimated to 30‰ and then independently exposed stepwise (1 h for each 5‰ change) to 25, 20, 15 and 10‰ or to 35, 40, 45 and 50‰. Isolated tissue slices obtained from control animals (30‰) of siphon, mantle and muscle were exposed <span>in vitro</span> to salines corresponding to salinities of 10, 30 and 50‰. <span>Cyrtopleura costata</span> responded as a typical euryhaline osmoconformer between 25 and 40‰, with haemolymph and mantle cavity water being isosmotic to the external medium. However, some ‘buffering’ of haemolymph osmolality was displayed in the most extreme salinities, 10–20‰ and 45–50‰. This could result from muscle contraction and other cellular responses, reducing ‘apparent permeability’ and diffusive fluxes; the muscle was the tissue with the highest capacity to maintain constant hydration despite significant osmotic challenge. Both <span>in vivo</span> and <span>in vitro</span> experiments indicated a higher tolerance of salinity increases than decreases. Thus, if global and local changes in climate and precipitation rates result in more frequent seawater dilution in its habitat, the area occupied by its realized niche may be reduced.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Molluscan Studies Current Issue","siteHash":"50e5bd74f9c9bc6ffdefd16d0eef1528d858cc544080b551025ae62157896b1d","entryHash":"668e7255dc6f5d82dc54eb1b44ece394cbc63ab00445ef8daa240d3419be9a4b","category":"Environment"}
