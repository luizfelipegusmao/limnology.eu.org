Chondrocyte ferroptosis contributes to the progression of OA. PUM2 is shown to exacerbate ischemia–reperfusion-induced neuroinflammation by promoting ferroptosis, but its role in OA remains unexplored. Here, primary mouse chondrocytes were stimulated with IL-1β to mimic OA chondrocyte injury in vitro. And PUM2 was upregulated in OA cartilage tissues and IL-1β-induced chondrocytes. Silencing PUM2 alleviated IL-1β-induced chondrocyte inflammation and ECM degradation. Mechanistically, PUM2 facilitated the degradation of NEDD4 mRNA by binding to the 3′UTR of NEDD4 mRNA, which in turn inhibited NEDD4 induced PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. Consistently, NEDD4 silencing reversed the ameliorative effect of PUM2 knockdown on chondrocyte injury, and overexpression of PTEN abolished the improved role of NEDD4 in chondrocyte injury. Moreover, PTEN aggravated IL-1β-induced ferroptosis in chondrocytes through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway by increasing the levels of Fe<sup>2+</sup>, ROS, MDA, and ACSL4 protein, decreasing the activity of SOD and the levels of GSH and GPX4 protein, and aggravating mitochondrial damage. Additionally, destabilized medial meniscus (DMM) were conducted to establish the OA mouse model, and adenovirus-mediated PUM2 shRNA was administered intra-articularly. Silencing PUM2 attenuated OA-induced cartilage damage in vivo. In conclusion, PUM2 promoted OA progression through PTEN-mediated chondrocyte ferroptosis by facilitating NEDD4 mRNA degradation.</p>","author":"Yu Meng, \nLi Chen, \nYuxia Chai, \nWeili Meng, \nGuohui Yang, \nJia Ren, \nHongshuai Li, \nPeiyi Qi, \nJuwu Chen, \nNan Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"c9a7e6cb4adc16f966ea8884a4fb4f06eddf3b397289c48f53ac34b6fcb4f7da","category":"Environment"}
