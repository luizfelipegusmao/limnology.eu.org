{"title":"A Framework for Requirements Management to Develop Safety Management and Operation of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1342/v1","date":1718939426000,"content":"Following technological advances, autonomous and remote-controlled ships are performing trials in some sea areas; a mandatory goal-based MASS code, expected to enter into force on 1 January 2032, is under discussion in the International Maritime Organization (IMO). However, there are no unified standards regarding verification methods to define operating limitations for cutting-edge technologies, which are expected to be elements of MASS, so it is difficult to assess the risk factors for the management and operation of MASS. This paper outlines the regulatory framework for MASS, followed by a discussion of its application, considering the differences between MASS and automated driving, and how to develop safety management and operation using standards for automated driving. A requirements management framework developed as a system and software engineering standards to build safety management and operation of MASS is proposed. It is also suggested that the requirements management framework could be used not only for MASS development but also for regulatory review from a requirements management view.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76d24b7cd8e5fd93df51b2a143b4b1ca40e755de1bd1d6a70992c5dba1c25844","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
