{"title":"Impact of Parity and Delivery Type on Pelvic Floor Muscle Strength","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1417/v1","date":1724140005000,"content":"Background: Parity and vaginal delivery may contribute to female urinary incontinence prev-alence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of parity and type of child delivery on pelvic floor muscle strength (PFMS).\nMaterial and Methods: 140 healthy women were prospectively evaluated and distributed into 4 groups: G1 (n=34) 30-40 years old; G2 (n=38) 41-50; G3 (n=35) 51-60 and G4 (n=33) over 60. De-mographic data, and body mass index (BMI) were obtained using a clinical questionnaire. Sub-jective PFMS assessments were performed using transvaginal digital palpation (TDP), and ob-jective evaluation was obtained using a portable perineometer.\nResults: BMI was significantly higher in G4 compared to G1. There was a positive linear rela-tionship between age and BMI. The number of pregnancies was higher in G4 compared to G2 and vaginal delivery was more frequent in G4 compared to G1 and G3. There was no statistical correlation among different groups in PFMS assessed either by TDP and perineometer. Like-wise, we did not observe any negative linear relationship between PFMS and parity or number of vaginal deliveries.\nConclusion: Our data demonstrates that both the number of pregnancies and of vaginal deliv-eries had no impact on PFMS in continent women.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3fea18ff3652863e7a5705fa1e2a3b5e9f2f6da73ecdb473b6598388a13853cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
