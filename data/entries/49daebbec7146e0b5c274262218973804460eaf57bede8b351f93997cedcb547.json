{"title":"Comparison of &ldquo;Bupivacaine, Bupivacaine + Dexmedetomidine and Bupivacaine + Dexamethasone&rdquo; Applications As Ultrasound-Guided Transversus Abdominis Plain Block Approach in Relieving Pain After Cesarean Section: Is Body Mass Index Effective Factor?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2106/v1","date":1717136126000,"content":"Background: The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has gained increasing importance as a very effective pain relief in for caesarean section. This study aimed to compare bupivacaine (Group B), bupivacaine with dexmedetomidine (Group BD) and bupivacaine with dexamethasone (Group BDx) applied in ultrasound-guided TAP block in the treatment of CS postoperative pain.\nMaterial and Method: American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II pregnant women who underwent cesarean section were included in the study. Forty patients were admitted in each group. All patients were applied TAP block with ultrasound guidance by administering the medications of the group in which they were included.\nResults: Body mass index (BMI) and operation duration were higher in Group B (p*=0.01 and 0.004, respectively). Instant tramadol requirement and amount were higher in Group B at some of follow up times. Patient satisfaction scale were better in Group BD and Group BDx.\nConclusion: TAP block significantly reduces pain after cesarean section, prolongs the time to first analgesic request, and reduces the need for additional opioid analgesics. The addition of adjuvant to the TAP block usually improves the postoperative clinical condition. However, some special conditions such as body mass index (BMI) may negatively affect the clinical situation. Comprehensive, standardized, randomized controlled studies are needed to compare results under different conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49daebbec7146e0b5c274262218973804460eaf57bede8b351f93997cedcb547","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
