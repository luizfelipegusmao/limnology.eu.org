In these applications, it is desirable to understand the details of the microstructure and distribution of defects because these may impact the performance and degradation of these materials over their useful lifetime. Nano- and atomic-scale characterization of functional Pd powders requires thinning them to electron transparency for transmission electron-based characterization methods. However, thinning powders often presents additional challenges compared to bulk specimens [<a href=\"#ozae044.983-B5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.983-B6\">6</a>]. One way to prepare powder samples is to embed them in highly crosslinked polymer such as epoxy to make a bulk-like sample that can be thinned using a focused ion beam (FIB). Embedding any powder into an epoxy mount has its own challenges. Small amounts of powder can be difficult to position into the tip of a BEEM capsule, resulting in a sparse distribution of particles. After the BEEM capsule is potted into the epoxy metallographic mount, the mount is polished to expose the powder particles to the surface of the mount. It is difficult to “endpoint” while polishing in this way, and it is easy to inadvertently polish through the area with the highest particle density.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b64d9a08c0f17dccc708e181a6f04b9b94fe328144c34f10b34c7f9fd7c47dae","category":"Environment"}
