{"title":"Performance evaluation and development of FE modeling for passive greenhouse solar dryer for potato chips drying","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14373?af=R","date":1722427964000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Food losses and hunger around the world are majorly attributed to the lack of diverse food processing technologies and standardized methods. Solar energy is a potential solution for drying agricultural products, but traditional solar drying methods are not yet widely used. This study developed a finite element model using COMSOL Multiphysics to assess the performance of a passive greenhouse dryer for drying food products. The proposed model was used to simulate the drying of potato slices, and the results showed that the dryer was able to reduce the moisture content of the potato slices from 1 to 0.005 in 3â€‰h. The drying efficiency was 20.52%, the relative humidity inside the drying chamber was 25.2%, and the energy and exergy efficiencies were 63.46% and 94.01%, respectively. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the passive greenhouse dryer is a suitable drying method for potato chips. The model developed in this study can be used to further optimize the design of the dryer and to evaluate its performance for other food products.</p>","author":"Lalan Kumar, \nOm Prakash, \nAsim Ahmad, \nBiplab Das, \nL.
