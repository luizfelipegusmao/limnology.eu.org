{"title":"Study of Contactless Computer Vision-based Road Condition Estimation Methods within the Framework of an Operational Design Domain Monitoring System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2591/v1","date":1722482943000,"content":"Deployment of Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban environments is significantly constrained by adverse weather conditions, limiting their operation to clear weather due to safety concerns. Ensuring that AVs remain within their designated Operational Design Domain (ODD) is a formidable challenge, making boundary monitoring strategies essential for safe navigation. This study explores the critical role of an ODD monitoring system (OMS) in addressing these challenges. It reviews various methodologies for designing an OMS and presents a comprehensive visualization framework incorporating trigger points for ODD exits. These trigger points serve as essential references for effective OMS design. The study also delves into a specific use case concerning ODD exits: the reduction in road friction due to adverse weather conditions. It emphasizes the importance of contactless computer vision-based methods for road condition estimation (RCE), particularly using vision sensors such as cameras. The study details a timeline of methods involving classical machine learning and deep learning feature extraction techniques, identifying contemporary challenges such as class imbalance, lack of comprehensive datasets, annotation methods, and the scarcity of generalization techniques. Furthermore, it provides a factual comparison of two state-of-the-art RCE datasets. In essence, the study aims to address and explore ODD exits due to weather-induced road conditions, decoding the practical solutions and directions for future research in the realm of AVs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"98c501046e0543f7e8be87b74d384eb9459b0137c3a37292da46428aeba1b58f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
