{"title":"313 Many farmers want a prediction of future performance, not necessarily breeding potential","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/51/7757252?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>High heritability is a characteristic of many performance traits in cattle translating to a relatively strong correlation between an (accurate) estimated breeding value for an animal and its (future) production potential. However, the broad sense heritability (i.e., numerator in the formula includes both additive and non-additive genetic variance) is often larger than the narrow sense heritability (i.e., numerator includes only the additive genetic variance) especially for low heritability traits like reproductive performance. Moreover, the repeatability of a trait can be greater again, the difference between the heritability and repeatability is the inclusion of a permanent environmental variance in the numerator. Accurate and pertinent omic-based animal-level features can contribute to an increase in narrow sense heritability owing to a possible reduction in the residual variance; such data can also provide insights into both non-additive genetic variance and the permanent environmental variance. Even at the level of the contemporary group, omic-level data from the likes of bulk blood/saliva/milk sample, can improve how systematic environmental effects are modeled in the mixed model equations thus also reducing the residual variance. The greater heritability will contribute to a strengthening of the correlation between future phenotypic performance potential and estimated additive genetic merit. Importantly, omic measures for individual animals can help predict the permanent environmental effect of that animal capturing the yet untapped contributor to phenotypic variance. Irrespective, predictions need to be replaced by prescriptions; end users are inundated with data yet crave actionable information. Animal breeders have a lush (pardon the pun!) history of distilling estimates of genetic merit for a plethora of traits into a single value per animal (i.e., breeding indexes); this is the first step in transitioning from predictions to prescriptions. Given the familiarity of end users with breeding indexes, the potential exists to develop production indexes to rank commercial animals on future expected performance taking cognizance of genetic and non-genetic effects. Such production indexes align well with the associated breeding index but where the estimates of genetic merit for the traits in question are replaced by estimates of production merit; these estimated production values are the sum of the additive genetic, non-additive genetic and permanent environmental effects. The weighting factors in the production indexes are more short-term using current costs and prices as opposed to breeding indexes which are longer term. In comparison with the breeding indexes, the production indexes can include ancillary information like gender, age, and month of calving/birth. Like breeding indexes, they are updated in real time. Examples of the application of genome-enabled production indexes are guides for valuing animals for purchase or culling.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"c09eab23ba51e2ae6155e22b6303667e40ccb4044fa7f9f3b744682da14c9670","category":"Environment"}
