{"title":"IoT Wearable Sensors for Automatic Boxing Punch Recognition and Classification Based on Upper Limb Biomechanics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1093/v1","date":1720919500000,"content":"Identifying punch types as part of punch kinematic analysis is a key component for both coaches and players, providing critical insights into the variety and effectiveness of punches, which are essential for refining overall performance. Existing research indicates that punch type classification typically relies on data from either wearables or video data. Both approaches have their merits and demerits but require a significant amount of labeled data for modeling the classification algorithm. In this work, we propose a novel approach that significantly reduces the labeling effort by one-sixth by leveraging video data to enhance the training information of sensor data. This enriched training phase enables more accurate punch classification with reduced labeled data. Subsequently, the real-time punch identification and classification use only the wearable data. On a real dataset, with 15% of the labeling efforts, our approach achieved an accuracy rate of 91.41% for rear hand punch recognition and 91.91% for lead hand punch recognition, along with 92.33% and 94.56% for punch classification, respectively. Through the development of our Smart Boxer system, we aim to revolutionize punch analytics in boxing, providing comprehensive insights while enhancing the overall training and competitive experience for athletes and enriching fan engagement with the sport.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64255342bd603c50b6e3c217ae4b64f6e129455077313177a1ed2cba275b02f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
