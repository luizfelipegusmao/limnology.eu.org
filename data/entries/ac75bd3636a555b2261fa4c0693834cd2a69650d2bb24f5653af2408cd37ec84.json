{"title":"An Overview of Cardiovascular Risk in Pituitary Disorders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0588/v1","date":1715248535000,"content":"Cardiovascular morbidities are the main cause of mortality in pituitary disorders accruing either from hormonal excess or deficiency. Cushing disease is associated with various cardiovascular abnormalities;visceral obesity, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia and hypercoagulability, structural and functional changes in heart, which do not seem to reverse completely even after remission. Acromegaly is related with insulin resistance, but also with structural and functional heart changes which consist acromegalic cardiomyopathy. Patients with prolactinomas demonstrate an aggravation of metabolic parameters, obesity, dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism and endothelial dysfunction. On the other hand, hypopituitarism and conventional hormonal replacement which is far from ideal contribute to an unhealthy metabolic status which leads to atherosclerosis and premature mortality. This review aims to update literature on cardiovascular risk and relevant morbidities in pituitary disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac75bd3636a555b2261fa4c0693834cd2a69650d2bb24f5653af2408cd37ec84","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
