{"title":"Juvenile production technology for tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon, through different stocking density using a recirculation system","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13055?af=R","date":1707477521000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Aquaculture recirculation technology has evolved in recent years, as it can save water use and maintain good water quality during tiger shrimp fry rearing and ultimately increase juvenile production. The recirculation technology in this experiment is expected to be adopted by small-scale tiger shrimp seed farmers. This study aims to develop the technology for producing a juvenile tiger shrimp recirculation system to support shrimp cultivation in ponds. The recirculation system container comprises a biofiltration tank filled with oysters, seaweed, and tilapia. Containers to keep tiger shrimp larvae alive in the recirculation system use a round-shaped container with a volume of 2 m<sup>3</sup>. Tiger shrimp larvae were cared for at; A. density of 2000 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>; B. density of 1500 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>; and C. density of 1000 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>. This study found that the survival rate of tiger shrimp in treatments C and B were high, reaching 96.800<sup>b</sup> ± 2.716% and 91.62<sup>b</sup> ± 3.432%, respectively, while survival in treatment A was the lowest, at 81.700<sup>a</sup> ± 4.715%.</p>","author":"Brata Pantjara, \nRomi Novriadi, \nErfan A.
