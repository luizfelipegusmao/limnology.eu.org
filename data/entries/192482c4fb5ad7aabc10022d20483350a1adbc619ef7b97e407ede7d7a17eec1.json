Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) permits label-free imaging of structures using vibrational contrast inherent in the sample. Here we present the application of CARS imaging to evaluate (sub)cellular changes in neurodegenerative and demyelinating activity in animal models and <span>in vitro</span>. Towards these ends we evaluate cellular changes in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and cuprizone models of demyelination as well as in a 3D printed synthetic myelination assay platform. Multiplexed CARS signals within individual cellular subtypes, myelin imaging and second harmonic generation (SHG) were used to identify degenerative pathology, treatment response and evaluated using novel computational techniques.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"192482c4fb5ad7aabc10022d20483350a1adbc619ef7b97e407ede7d7a17eec1","category":"Environment"}
