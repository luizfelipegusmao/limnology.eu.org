{"title":"Detailed Investigation on Ambiguity Validation of Long-Distance RTK","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0220/v1","date":1719913609000,"content":"Long-distance Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning is crucial for applications in remote areas, such as maritime environments. Achieving 2-3 cm accuracy with RTK requires successful ambiguity resolution, which involves two main two steps: identifying the best integer ambiguity candidate and confirming its validity. While previous research has largely concentrated on the first step, including the development of Cascading Ambiguity Resolution methods, and reducing tropospheric delay, studies on the validation of ambiguity for long-distance RTK are limited.  \nThis study conducts a thorough examination of ambiguity validation for long-distance RTK, focusing on two prevalent methods: the theoretical success rate and the R-ratio test. The results reveal several key insights. Firstly, the six commonly used bounds for the theoretical success rate are not accurate reflection of the actual success rate, making them unsuitable for long-distance RTK applications. Secondly, the R-ratio test proves to be dependable when the threshold is set above 1.7, assuming there is a minimum observation period of one minute and at least ten satellites are visible. However, the probability of successfully resolving ambiguities with the R-ratio test does not surpass 50%. Additionally, if ambiguity resolution is not achieved within 20 minutes, simply prolonging the observation time is generally unproductive.\nTo improve the performance of ambiguity resolution in practical situations that require extended observation times, this research proposes a novel ambiguity validation method. This new approach is based the duration for which an integer ambiguity resolution candidate maintaining the best status. This method aims to provide a reliable means of validating ambiguities in case that the R-ratio test fails.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b459305390b11efb6c7e5c3a8ed74519adc758a1b5e27d92ec038a51f643833","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
