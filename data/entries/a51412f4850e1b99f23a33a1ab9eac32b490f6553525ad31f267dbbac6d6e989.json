{"title":"&ldquo;A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Analysis of Viral Sari in Pregnant Women in Southern Brazil&rdquo;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0419/v1","date":1718016048000,"content":"Pregnant women (PW) are at a higher risk of diseases and hospitalization from viral respiratory infections, specially influenza, due to cardiopulmonary and immunological changes. This study assessed the impact of viral respiratory infections on PW hospitalized with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). It´s a cross-sectional study with 42 PW and 85 non-pregnant women (NPW) admitted with SARI to two tertiary hospital between January 2015 and December 2019. The rate of virus prevalence, SARI hospitalization, length of hospital stay, oxygen supplementation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death were comparable between PW and NPW. Multivariate analysis showed that PW had a higher rate of viral SARI hospitalizations (OR = 2.37; 95% CI =1.02 - 5.48) compared to NPW, with influenza virus being the most prevalent (aOR =7.58; 95% CI =1.53 - 37.66). Length of hospital stay (aOR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.73 – 0.95) and admission to the ICU (aOR=0.028; 95% CI=0.004 - 0.25) were lower in PW compared to hospitalized NPW. Respiratory viruses had a greater impact on the frequency of SARI in the group of PW. Although PW had a higher rate of influenza SARI, they had a better outcome than NPW due to the treatment they received.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a51412f4850e1b99f23a33a1ab9eac32b490f6553525ad31f267dbbac6d6e989","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
