{"title":"Affectation of COVID-19 pandemic on the use and abundance of wild resources in Tabasco, Mexico: A qualitative assessment","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299744","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by José Luis Martínez-Sánchez, Carolina Zequeira Larios, Florisel Hernandez Ramirez</p>\r\n\r\nSouthern Mexico is particularly rich in natural resources, yet unemployment has risen to 8% during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of the pandemic on the use and abundance of Tabasco’s wild resources was examined through personal surveys. By using Microsoft Forms<sup>®</sup> with cell phones 1,963 surveys were collected. Cronbach’s alpha, Z-value, and chi<sup>2</sup> were calculated using the MAXQDA Analytics Pro program. A higher abundance of wild resources before the pandemic than today (57% vs. 11%) was observed. During the pandemic, people referred more to a high use (28%) of resources than to a low use (20%). This caused the low abundance or scarcity of wild products to be greater during the pandemic than before the pandemic (43% vs. 4%). Wild foods and timber were the most used products. The pandemic has produced a greater use of natural resources probably due to the high unemployment rate in rural areas. Future studies of wild products should address the relevant products in the locality and their even sampling. Finding suitable respondents is highly recommended.","author":"José Luis Martínez-Sánchez","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"acdf7e03f6fa892ee623e80a8277905d6bb3cfd98410107d89d45de6d0d2db37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
