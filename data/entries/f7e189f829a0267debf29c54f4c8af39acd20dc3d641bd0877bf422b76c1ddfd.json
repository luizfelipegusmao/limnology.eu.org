{"title":"Cauchy-Riemann Equations for Treons","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0103/v1","date":1719833218000,"content":"We explored an extension of the Cauchy-Riemann equations to the algebra of treons, recently described by Alejandro Bermejo, whose elements are ordered 3-tuples. We leveraged the isomorphism between the algebra of treons and algebra B, and deduced the Cauchy-Riemann equations for the algebra of treons, establishing the necessary conditions for analyticity in this algebraic structure. This work significantly broadened our horizons in complex analysis and introduced new possibilities for applications across various fields of advanced mathematics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f7e189f829a0267debf29c54f4c8af39acd20dc3d641bd0877bf422b76c1ddfd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
