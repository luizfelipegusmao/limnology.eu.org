Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a key second messenger of the cell, it can regulate cell metabolism. The present study investigated the effect of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal on the activity of key enzymes of carbon metabolism and related gene expression in yeast under high sugar fermentation.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The expression of genes encoding hexokinase was up-regulated in the high sugar environment, the activity of hexokinase was increased, glucose transmembrane transport capacity was enhanced, the ability of glucose to enter into glycolytic metabolism was increased, and the expression of genes related to pentose phosphate metabolism, glycerol metabolism and trehalose metabolism was up-regulated in the high glucose with Ca<sup>2+</sup> group.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal regulates the cellular metabolism of glycerol and trehalose and optimizes the allocation of carbon flow by regulating the key enzymes and related gene expression to enhance the resistance of yeast to high sugar stress. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Dongdong Xie, \nJiaxin Zheng, \nYingqi Sun, \nXing Li, \nShuncheng Ren","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"921dd1c44e32072ac0957abda8bf20abcc14dc91842161e6f88ab453c8d0b679","category":"Environment"}
