{"title":"Circular Economy Development Metrics for E-waste Residuals and Attendant Economic Consequences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1780/v1","date":1719326500000,"content":"As the global overprovisioning of electronic devices continues to rise, the management of electronic waste (e-waste) has developed as a significant challenge. E-waste is comprised of hazardous materials; moreover, the toxic constituents in them can impact the environment and public health through improper disposal. On the beneficial side, this e-waste also contains some valuable materials. If the valuable materials are recovered, they can reduce the dependence on new, raw materials. Conventional linear models of production and consumption have led to a momentous buildup of e-waste, posing environmental and economic risks. This paper examines how the adoption of a circular economy approach can improve e-waste recycling in Nairobi by evaluating its economic recovery potential and e-waste residuals. It introduces metrics to assess the development of circular economy practices to help in the handling of e-waste residuals and examines the economic consequences associated with the adoption of circular strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"348a6492c9aa6ffa044e8aa83e1a261f4784c75a92322f438f434744b2898321","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
