Nanofluidic channels are critical features of these technologies, determining their transport properties and, as a result, their overall performance. Nanotubes are ideal candidates to develop these nanofluidic channels. The nanotube’s tunable dimensions and regular surfaces, with well-defined chemical properties, result in platform from which a range of measurements can be conducted. A nanotube porin approach is one avenue to achieve short channel lengths in a nanofluidic platform. The porin approach embeds short nanotube segments into lipid bilayers, creating biomimetic membranes. Using this method, carbon nanotube porins (CNTPs) ∼10 nm long and ∼1.5 nm in diameter have been synthesized [<a href=\"#ozae044.871-B1\">1</a>]. Boron nitride nanotube porins (BNNTPs) are ideal candidates to advance the study of nanofluidics as their size can be controlled in a manner similar to CNTPs but with notably different surface properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b80154bd4165df7d6ba699a39aad6f0b616a50550a2d43a74769564aa5d3057d","category":"Environment"}
