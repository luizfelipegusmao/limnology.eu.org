Furthermore, the study examined the correlations between capillary function and other health-related indicators. \nDesign\nA single- center pilot trial \nSetting\nFaculty of Health, Tsukuba University of Technology, Japan\nParticipants\n hypertensive community-dwelling elderly people\nIntervention\nMicrocirculation was observed before and 1 min after arm-curl exercise by means microscopy of capillary with non-exercised limb. Additionally, we examined other health-related indicators. \nOutcome measures: Acute effects of reperfusion on nailfold density, flow, and diameters. Secondary outcomes included the correlations between microvascular parameters and other health-related indicators. We hypothesized that brief exercise could enhance microcirculation reperfusion and correlate with other health-related parameters.　\nResults:\nThere were 20 participants with a mean (SD) age of 67.1 (5.8) years. The capillary flow rate changed from 2.3±6.7 to 2.7±0.2 log µm/s (P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"175244265de0708f3f1bfd042517c21ca845881dd17d631e66f45384385be87a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
