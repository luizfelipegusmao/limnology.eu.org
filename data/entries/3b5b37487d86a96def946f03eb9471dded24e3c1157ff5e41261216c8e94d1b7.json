{"title":"Therapeutic Potential of Various Intermittent Fasting Regimens in Alleviating Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Prediabetes: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1139/v1","date":1718613846000,"content":": Intermittent fasting has drawn significant interest in the clinical research community due to its potential to address metabolic complications such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Various intermittent fasting regimens include alternate-day fasting (24 hours of fasting followed by 24 hours of eating), time-restricted fasting (fasting for 14 hours and eating within a 10-hour window), and the 5:2 diet (fasting for two days and eating normally for the other five days). Intermittent fasting is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus-related complications and can slow their progression. The increasing global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus highlights the importance of early management. Since prediabetes is a precursor to type 2 diabetes mellitus, understanding its progression is essential. However, the long-term effects of intermittent fasting on prediabetes are not yet well understood. Therefore, this review aims to comprehensively compile existing knowledge on the therapeutic effects of intermittent fasting in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus and prediabetes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b5b37487d86a96def946f03eb9471dded24e3c1157ff5e41261216c8e94d1b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
