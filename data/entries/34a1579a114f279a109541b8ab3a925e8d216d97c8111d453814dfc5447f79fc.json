{"title":"Assessing equity in the uptake of remote foot temperature monitoring in a large integrated US healthcare system","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301260","date":1711980000000,"content":"<p>by Alyson J. Littman, Andrew K. Timmons, Kenneth T. Jones, Suzanne Shirley, Jeffrey Robbins, Ernest Moy</p>\r\nObjective <p>We assessed equity in the uptake of remote foot temperature monitoring (RTM) for amputation prevention throughout a large, integrated US healthcare system between 2019 and 2021, including comparisons across facilities and between patients enrolled and eligible patients not enrolled in RTM focusing on the Reach and Adoption dimensions of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.</p> Material and methods <p>To assess whether there was equitable use of RTM across facilities, we examined distributions of patient demographic, geographic, and facility characteristics across facility RTM use categories (e.g., no RTM use, and low, moderate, and high RTM use) among all eligible patients (n = 46,294). Second, to understand whether, among facilities using RTM, there was equitable enrollment of patients in RTM, we compared characteristics of patients enrolled in RTM (n = 1066) relative to a group of eligible patients not enrolled in RTM (n = 27,166) using logistic regression and including all covariates.</p> Results <p>RTM use increased substantially from an average of 11 patients per month to over 40 patients per month between 2019 and 2021. High-use RTM facilities had higher complexity and a lower ratio of patients per podiatrist but did not have consistent evidence of better footcare process measures. Among facilities offering RTM, enrollment varied by age, was inversely associated with Black race (vs. white), low income, living far from specialty care, and being in the highest quartiles of telehealth use prior to enrollment. Enrollment was positively associated with having osteomyelitis, Charcot foot, a partial foot amputation, BMIâ‰¥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and high outpatient utilization.</p> Conclusions <p>RTM growth was concentrated in a small number of higher-resourced facilities, with evidence of lower enrollment among those who were Black and lived farther from specialty care. Future studies are needed to identify and address barriers to uptake of new interventions like RTM to prevent exacerbating existing ulceration and amputation disparities.</p>","author":"Alyson J.
