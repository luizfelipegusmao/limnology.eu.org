{"title":"Smart Transportation and Carbon Emission from the Perspective of Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, and Blockchain: A Review for Sustainable Future","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0328/v1","date":1728263061000,"content":"Background: Transportation logistics is undergoing a transformative shift driven by innovative technologies to overcome human-generated obstacles. Governments and city authorities are increasingly keen on these technological advancements because they can reduce traffic and carbon emissions despite logistical and legal hurdles. Methods: Employing a methodology grounded in IMRAD principles and the PRISMA framework, guided by seminal work of Paraskevas et al., this study critically reviews existing literature to examine and integrate advancements in road transportation and carbon emission reduction through intelligent technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain (BC), and Internet of Things (IoT). This study also considers other issues like eliminating traffic congestion, improving traffic control systems, incorporating cutting-edge logistical technologies, and transforming policies in light of the development of smart cities. Results: The findings shed light on strategies to expedite travel and streamline logistics, fostering economic equity by adopting innovative, cost-effective, sustainable, and environmentally friendly transport solutions. Conclusion: This research sets the stage for future studies to incorporate additional variables and conduct quantitative assessments, thus paving the way for optimized enhancements in modern city transportation systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e2c7079f914c92df290b946096c104cf4d458bdc499f66f70d870035e540338f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
