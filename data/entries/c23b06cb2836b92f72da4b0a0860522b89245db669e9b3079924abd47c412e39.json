{"title":"Specific Characteristics of Numerical Simulation of Mechatronic Systems with PWM-Controlled Drives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0246/v1","date":1719919105000,"content":"The paper explores the features of numerical simulation to analyze the dynamic behavior of drives controlled by pulse-width modulators. Modern motor control systems widely use pulse width modulation. Effective numerical modeling of such systems has specific features because the models employed are continuous-event and have hybrid behavior due to the presence of nonlinear links with discontinuities of the first kind. Therefore, it is essential to have special integration methods with variable steps, which should be factored in when developing the model. The paper shows how these problems are solved when modeling an electric drive with a DC motor in the SimInTech software.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c23b06cb2836b92f72da4b0a0860522b89245db669e9b3079924abd47c412e39","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
