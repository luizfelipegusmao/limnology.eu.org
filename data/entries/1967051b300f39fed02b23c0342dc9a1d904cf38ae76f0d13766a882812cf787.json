{"title":"Implementing Agile Method for Developing Nutritious School Lunch Program Web Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0054/v1","date":1719837989000,"content":"The issue of sufficient nutrition and appropriate distribution in school lunch programs presents a significant challenge that must be addressed. Many schools struggle to provide food that meets all of their students’ nutritional needs. Additionally, inconsistencies in nutritional information and administrative difficulties often hinder the efficient operation of these programs. Developing technology to better manage school lunch programs is critical to addressing these issues. The goal of this project is to create a web application that ensures the fair distribution of nutritional information while also increasing the efficiency of lunch program administration. The methodology used in this research is Agile. Agile approaches are employed throughout the development process, allowing for rapid iteration and responsiveness to user feedback. The end result is a web tool called Nourishify, designed to streamline the management and dissemination of nutritional information. Implementing Nourishify led to substantial improvements in access to nutrition information and operational efficiency, making it an innovative solution for school lunch programs. This project demonstrates that integrating technology can significantly enhance the administration and transparency of nutrition programs, ultimately benefiting students' health and well-being. Moreover, Nourishify’s user-friendly interface and real-time data capabilities ensure that all stakeholders, including parents, administrators, and nutritionists, can easily collaborate and access crucial information.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1967051b300f39fed02b23c0342dc9a1d904cf38ae76f0d13766a882812cf787","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
