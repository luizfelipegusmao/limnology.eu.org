{"title":"Development of Mineral Fillers for Acid Resistant Filling Composites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0541/v1","date":1715305001000,"content":"The article presents the results of research on the production of effective inorganic fillers and chemically resistant composite polymer-mineral materials based on industrial waste.   The aim of the work is to develop the technological foundations for the production of inorganic fillers and highly filled filling compositions for use in chlorine-containing media. Materials with high resistance to hydrochloric acid are graphite and quartz sand. Thermal power plant (TPP) ash was used as an acid-resistant filler in the compositions. The simplex lattice planning method was used to determine the areas of compositions with the best properties. Two components were selected: formaldehyde rubber resin and mineral filler (TPP ash) as a binder. As the third component, hydrolytically active fillers were used - anhydrite, phosphogypsum and phosphorus production slag. A preliminary operation was performed to remove hygroscopic moisture from the filler.The influence of the nature of mineral fillers on the chemical stability and durability of the obtained composites is investigated. The nature of the interaction of mineral fillers with a polymer binder was determined, and chemical interaction of the hydroxyl groups of the filler and the methyl groups of the polymer took place. The mathematical planning method was used to optimize the chemical resistance and durability of the compositions of the studied substances. Based on the results of this study, optimal compositions of compositions, anhydrite, phosphogypsum and phosphoric slag were selected. These composites, with the highest possible degree of filling, have high target characteristics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10facd736654fbbcb8387adbd1edb97e2fe85f57e4d5ead6169a3e5a85efe90f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
