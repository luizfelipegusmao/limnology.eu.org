{"title":"A protocol to simultaneously examine cardiorespiratory, cerebrovascular and neurophysiological responses inside a hypobaric chamber","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312622","date":1729778400000,"content":"<p>by Evan A.

Doesburg</p>\r\n\r\nWe describe a protocol to examine neurophysiological (electroencephalography, EEG), cerebrovascular (ultrasound assessments of middle cerebral artery blood velocity, MCAv) and cardiorespiratory (blood pressure, oxygen saturation, end-tidal gases, respiratory rate) responses inside a hypobaric chamber. This procedure aims to standardize the methodology in experiments conducted within a hypobaric chamber such as comparing normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia. This is important because current understanding of relationships between neurophysiological activity, and cerebrovascular and cardiorespiratory responses under varying environmental conditions remains limited. This procedure combines simultaneous neurophysiological, cardiorespiratory and cerebrovascular evaluations, allowing a comprehensive understanding of electro-neurophysiological activity. Our protocol requires an hour and a half of equipment setup, 1â€“1.5 hours of participant set-up, and 30 minutes of experimental data collection. Since multiple simultaneous physiological recordings, including EEG in this environment, can be fraught with pitfalls, we also provide practical considerations for experimental design and recording setup. Advanced knowledge of hypobaric chamber operation is required, alongside expertise in EEG and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Following our procedure one will acquire simultaneous recordings of neurophysiological, cerebrovascular and cardiorespiratory data.","author":"Evan A.
