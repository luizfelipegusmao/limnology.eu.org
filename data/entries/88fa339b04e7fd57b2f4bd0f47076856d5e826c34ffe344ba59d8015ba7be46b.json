{"title":"Exploring the Influencing Factors of Dietary Transition towards Vegetarianism in Korea&rsquo;s Southern Provinces.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0712/v1","date":1712739635000,"content":"This study explores the elements that influence consumer vegetarian diet choices in parts of South Korean provinces. The study examines these explanatory variables: ethical-animal-welfare, health, environment, social issues , mood-emotion, and religious-beliefs with vegetarianism serving as the dependent variable. The Likert scale data from 264 respondents were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Results show that health, ethical-animal-welfare ideals as well as environmental concerns emerge as significant variables influencing the decision to embrace a vegetarian diet. This shows that consumers (international students) in Korea are becoming more aware of and concerned about health, ethical and sustainable dietary choices. Secondly, health plays a crucial role in the vegetarian diet selection, indicating that health-conscious people are more inclined to choose a vegetarian lifestyle. Religious belief and mood have various degrees of influence on the vegetarian diet decision. The findings of this study have consequences for consumer behavior, marketing managers, and decision-makers. Businesses in the food industry, in particular, can gain from catering to the needs and tastes of consumers that prioritize ethical-animal welfare ideals, as well as those that value health and environmental sustainability. Creating and advertising vegetarian and vegan choices in local restaurants can effectively attract and serve this specific target demographic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88fa339b04e7fd57b2f4bd0f47076856d5e826c34ffe344ba59d8015ba7be46b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
