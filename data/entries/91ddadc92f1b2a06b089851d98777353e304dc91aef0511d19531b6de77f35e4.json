{"title":"Secreted Adipocytokines in Harvested Visceral Fat Differ over Age and Diet in Control and High-Fat Diet Fed Female C3H/Hej Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1040/v1","date":1710759331000,"content":"Excess consumption of a high-fat diet has been identified as one of the contributing factors for obesity. Women are at higher risk for adult obesity than men, predisposing them to a different set of detrimental disease conditions. Furthermore, aging studies show that physiological decline also has a serious impact on changes in the endocrine properties of white adipose tissue. Howev-er, there is still relatively little known about the factors associated with obesity and aging and their compounding impact on women’s health. To investigate adipocytokine secretion profile changes, female C3H/HeJ mice were induced to obesity through long-term consumption of a high-fat diet. Weight gain measurements and Echo MRI analysis of fat composition showed in-creases were a due solely to the high fat content in the diet. Adipocytokine secretions were ana-lyzed in media conditioned from harvested visceral fat tissue that was organ cultured ex-vivo. Adipocytokine analysis across diets and age showed significant increases in Adiponectin and Leptin secretion in high-fat diets, accelerated increases in Resistin secretion with high-fat diets. Aging induced increased secretion of Lipcalin-2, Pentraxin-3 and Serpin E1, MCP-1 and ICAM-1, regardless of diet. Furthermore, comparisons of organoid cultured protein secretions and flash-frozen tissue samples differed greatly, suggesting the WAT organoid cultures may yield information more reflective of in situ conditions. Taken together, our results show that diet and aging significantly impact secretions from adipose tissue, that may contribute to women’s health issues.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91ddadc92f1b2a06b089851d98777353e304dc91aef0511d19531b6de77f35e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
