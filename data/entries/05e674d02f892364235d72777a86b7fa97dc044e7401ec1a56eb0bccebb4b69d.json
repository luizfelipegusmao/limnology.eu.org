{"title":"Climate Change Impacts on Mediterranean Coral Oculina Patagonica: Reproductive Resilience and Thermal Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1436/v1","date":1716374597000,"content":"Global climate change, particularly rising sea surface temperatures, profoundly impacts coral ecosystems, disrupting reproduction synchrony, symbiotic relationships with algae from the Symbiodiniceae family, and causing widespread bleaching and mortality among coral populations.  Oculina patagonica, a temperate scleractinian coral dominant in Mediterranean coastal waters, tolerates an annual temperature range of 10- 31°C. Moreover, in the past three decades, sea surface temperatures have rapidly risen in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. O. patagonica offers insight into evolutionary adaptation to rapid environmental changes. This study investigated the effects of temperature changes on O. patagonica reproductive development, synchrony, and thermal sensitivity. Monthly monitoring of O. patagonica colonies for a year reveals no disruption in gonad development compared to previous studies, suggesting an unaffected sexual reproduction capacity.
