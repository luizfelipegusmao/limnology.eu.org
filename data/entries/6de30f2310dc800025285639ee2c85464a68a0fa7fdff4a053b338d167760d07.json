{"title":"THz Wave Power Enhancement Using a Microstrip Line-based Combiner Integrated with Arrayed UTC-PDs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1534/v1","date":1713885507000,"content":"Recent advancements in semiconductor photonic and electronic devices such as Uni-travelling-carrier photodiodes (UTC-PDs), have played a significant role in the development of Terahertz communication technology. However, a major challenge that still persists is the limited output power from a single UTC-PD required for practical transmission distances. To enhance the output power, we propose and demonstrate a novel Terahertz wave power combining technique using a photomixer device that comprises of two arrayed UTC-PDs monolithically integrated with a microstrip line-based 2 Ã— 1 Wilkinson power combiner and a rectangular patch antenna on a Silicon Carbide (SiC) substrate at 300 GHz. At photocurrents of 8 mA and 10 mA from the two UTC-PDs, the device experimentally exhibited a 7.3 dB increase in power relative to the power obtained with 8 mA UTC-PD and a 4.4 dB increase in power relative to the power obtained with 10 mA UTC-PD, when both UTC-PDs were irradiated. This implies that power can be enhanced by a factor of N2 if the photocurrent is multiplied by a factor of N. This technology presents a holistic and cutting edge platform for further power multiplication by further increasing the number of arrayed UTC-PDs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6de30f2310dc800025285639ee2c85464a68a0fa7fdff4a053b338d167760d07","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
