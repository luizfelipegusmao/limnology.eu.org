{"title":"Factors Associated with Communities&rsquo; Satisfaction of Receiving Curative Care Administered by Community Health Workers in the Health Districts of Bouss&eacute; and Boussouma in Burkina Faso, 2024","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1329/v1","date":1713513859000,"content":"Background: Since 2010, Burkina Faso has developed and initiated community-based management of childhood illnesses. Following the increased presence of community health workers and the adoption of free community health care, this study aims to assess community satisfaction with curative care administered by community health workers. Methodology: It was a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study. Data were collected in the health districts of Bouss√© and Boussouma from 20 February to 30 March 2023 for quantitative data and from 12 to 30 January 2024 for qualitative data using a questionnaire (household survey) and an interview grid (focus groups). Analyses were conducted using SPSS IBM 25 and Nvivo 14. Results: Households benefit from oral curative care when using CHWs, but are not satisfied with the temporal accessibility of these community health workers. Temporal accessibility and awareness during care have a significant influence on household satisfaction. Conclusion: Curative care by community health workers is effective, but its use could be improved by addressing the unavailability of community health workers, inputs and better communication during care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d84eda00f3606eb31a741bb5b69c9f9157cdd213e01bdcd61d7a28e6d5612e53","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
