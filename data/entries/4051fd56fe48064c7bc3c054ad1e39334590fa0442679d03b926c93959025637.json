{"title":"Cub Survival in a Wild Leopard (Panthera pardus fusca) Population","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0806/v1","date":1723464398000,"content":"We investigated the cub’s survival in a wild Indian Leopard (Panthera pardus fusca) population in the Jhalana Forest Reserve, India. The research focuses on the survival analysis of leopard cubs during their first two years of life and determining the critical period of the reproductive cycle that influences survival. Survival functions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method using data collected with trail cameras over four years from 2018 to 2021.  We found that the mean survival probability of cubs during the 2-year period they depend on their mother was 0.618, the first year – 0.739, and higher during the second year of life (0.831).  The results also indicate that the first 12 months of a leopard cub's life are crucial for survival. These findings allow for understanding critical periods in the life history of individuals and are essential for effective conservation strategies in fragmented habitats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4051fd56fe48064c7bc3c054ad1e39334590fa0442679d03b926c93959025637","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
