The study integrates stakeholder participation, prioritization of variables, literature review, and model validation, emphasizing sustainability considerations throughout the process. Methodologically, it involved a literature review using Scopus, focusing on innovation management models, open innovation, and sustainability, particularly within the leather sector. The search identified 43 documents in Scopus, of which 15 were directly relevant; this analysis was complemented by 18 articles from Google Scholar. Three surveys were conducted to prioritize variables, utilizing Lik-ert-scale questions to assess relevance and congruence. Conceptual innovation models were validated graphically. Initial variables were identified, with 53 selected for the entry stage, 36 for the transformation stage, and 31 for the exit stage. These variables were classified for each stage, resulting in three innovation management models for validation. Key findings included 26 critical variables covering aspects such as agricultural and technological innovation in platforms and projects, capacity development, R&amp;D activities, supply chain dynamics, innovation management processes, knowledge and technology integration, business model adaptation for sustainable development, and environmental impact assessment. The prioritized innovation model is in-tended to assist stakeholders in the leather sector's innovation system by promoting open inno-vation strategies, sustainable and regenerative innovation generation, and enhancing strategic and technological capacities. The prioritized innovation model aims to assist stakeholders in the leather sector's innovation system by promoting open innovation strategies, sustainable and re-generative innovation generation, and enhancing strategic and technological capacities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"099529e9379ecf6533472843eb024127608818741a092296565b0eaa882d952c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
