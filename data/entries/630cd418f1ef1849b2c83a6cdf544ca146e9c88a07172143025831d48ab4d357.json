{"title":"CFD Simulation of Pre-chamber Spark-ignition Engines- A Perspective Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0722/v1","date":1720508426000,"content":"The recent demand for reducing pollutant and CO2 emissions from internal combustion engines has created an urgent need for the development of ultra-lean burn engines that ensure combus-tion stability and reducing knocking tendency. One of the most promising methods is the Pre-chamber Spark Ignition (PCSI) system, where a jet of high-energy reactive gases, produced by pilot combustion in a pre-chamber, ignites the main combustion event in the cylinder. Given the intricate phenomena inherent to PCSI systems, conducting 3D CFD studies is imperative for a comprehensive analysis and optimal design. Furthermore, the detailed CFD model, combined with the calibrated 0-D/1-D model, is anticipated to yield a significant amount of new data that would be difficult to obtain through experimental approaches, making it essential for advancing our understanding and optimization of these systems. However, recently published papers re-port that some state-of-the-art models developed for conventional SI operation may not be pre-dictive under the challenging conditions of TJI systems, particularly under lean conditions. This review elucidates the reasons behind the widespread adoption of CFD in the optimal design of PCSI engines. It presents significant examples and delves into the potential and challenges of employing CFD not just as a predictive tool but also as a design instrument for enhancing PCSI engine performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"630cd418f1ef1849b2c83a6cdf544ca146e9c88a07172143025831d48ab4d357","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
