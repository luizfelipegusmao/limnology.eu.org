{"title":"Design and Modelling of MEMS Vibrating Internal Ring Gyroscopes for Harsh Environments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0768/v1","date":1720598034000,"content":"This paper presents the design, modelling, and comparative analysis of two internal MEMS vibrating ring gyroscopes for harsh environmental conditions. The proposed designs investigate the symmetric structure of the vibrating ring gyroscopes that operate at the identical shape of wine glass mode resonance frequencies for both driving and sensing purposes. This approach improves the gyroscope’s sensitivity and precision in rotational motion. The analysis starts with the investigation of the dynamic behaviour of the vibrating ring gyroscope with the detailed derivation of motion equations. A comprehensive evaluation of the design geometry, meshing technology, and simulation results presented on two internal vibrating ring gyroscopes. The two designs are distinguished by their support spring configurations and internal ring structures. Design I comprises eight semicircular support springs and Design II comprises with sixteen semicircular support springs. These designs were modelled and analyzed using finite element analysis (FEA) in Ansys software. The paper further evaluates static and dynamic performance, emphasizing mode matching and temperature stability. The results reveal that Design II, with additional support springs, offers better mode matching, higher resonance frequencies, and better thermal stability compared to Design I. Additionally, electrostatic, modal, and harmonic analyses highlight the gyroscope's behaviour under varying DC voltages and environmental conditions. Furthermore, the study investigates the impact of temperature fluctuations on performance, demonstrating the robustness of the designs within a temperature range of -100°C to 100°C. These research findings suggest that the internal vibrating ring gyroscopes are highly suitable for harsh conditions such as high-temperature applications and space applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f5dadc229cc004a7044e5e530117efad2fba9a7500f824e8834b7f673ce5b6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
