{"title":"A Novel Design of Oral Appliance for Monitoring the EMG of the Genioglossus Muscle in Wakefulness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0370/v1","date":1720077534000,"content":"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent source of sleep-disordered breathing, generally caused by common factors in modern life. OSA is most commonly associated with dysfunctions in the genioglossus (GG) muscles. In this study, we present the first version of a medical device that measures the electromyogram (EMG) of the GG. The prototype is composed of a (custom-made) 3D-printed mouthpiece. Impressions were taken for the lower arch and scanned with a lab scanner to be converted into digital impressions. ExoCad software was used to design the appliance. Fusion 360 software was then used to modify the design and create tubes to house the electrodes in a bilateral configuration to secure excellent and continuous contact with the GG muscle. Silver-silver chloride electrodes were incorporated within the appliance through the created tubes to record the muscle EMG. In this preliminary prototype, the EMG amplifier was placed outside the mouth, and isolated electric wires were connected to the amplifier input. Simple tests that included a group of OSA patients and a control group were done during wakefulness to check the comfort and stability of the device, understand the nature of GG EMG, and study which OSA might affect the daytime performance of the GG. The GG EMG was acquired from the participants for 60 seconds at Rest state when the participant rested his tongue without doing any activity. Then, the subject pushes his tongue against the fontal teeth with steady force while keeping the mouth closed (Active state). Several features were extracted from the acquired EMG: The results showed that mean power and standard deviation were higher in the control group than in the OSA group (p &lt; 0.01). Regarding the wavelength during active state, the control group had a significantly longer wavelength than the OSA group (p &lt; 0.01). Meanwhile, the mean frequency was higher in the OSA group (p &lt; 0.01) at rest. Future research should focus on developing the device to be more user-friendly and easily used at home during wakefulness and sleep.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"485cbdd1a0510635d8ae4645206a0634d04e0ee659e4223a2b5b80351f4b105f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
