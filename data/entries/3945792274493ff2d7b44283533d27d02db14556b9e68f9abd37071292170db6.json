{"title":"Study of the Nature of Destruction of Coatings Based on the ZrN System Deposited on a Titanium Alloy Substrate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1880/v1","date":1721904916000,"content":"The fracture strength was compared in a scratch test of coatings based on the ZrN system with the introduction of Ti, Nb and Hf, which were deposited on a titanium alloy substrate. The coatings were deposited using Controlled Accelerated Arc (CAA-PVD) technology. The comparison was carried out according to two parameters: adhesion strength to the substrate and overall coating strength. The (Zr,Hf)N coating showed better resistance to destruction, but had worse adhesion to the substrate. As a result, although the coating is retained directly in the scribing groove, a large area of delamination and destruction is formed around the groove. The (Ti,Zr,Nb)N coating, with its somewhat lower strength, has high adhesion to the substrate; no noticeable delamination is observed along the groove boundary.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3945792274493ff2d7b44283533d27d02db14556b9e68f9abd37071292170db6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
