{"title":"The Origin of the Accelerated Expansion of the Universe from a Gravitational Collapse in Higher Dimensions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1720/v1","date":1729592946000,"content":"In this work, we propose an alternative theoretical model to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, based on the gravitational collapse of a black hole in a higher-dimensional space. We suggest that this collapse causes a rupture in the fabric of spacetime, generating a new universe whose accelerated expansion is a direct consequence of this process. Through detailed calculations, we demonstrate that the current acceleration of the universe is consistent with observational data, such as those from type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background. Additionally, we address the problem of the universe's low initial entropy, proposing that this model provides a natural explanation for the order observed in its early stages. The results suggest that this alternative approach offers a viable explanation for cosmic expansion and raises new questions about the role of gravitational phenomena and the evolution of the universe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6170ae4778ad56d27dc95983884721d4985a77b719b7591748729ea9a7fd4bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
