{"title":"The Impact of Home Medication Management Practices on Medication Adherence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0165/v1","date":1722588667000,"content":"Medication adherence is a vexing challenge with nonadherence at 50% or greater among US adults. With most medications self-administered by patients in the home, home medication management practices, especially where patients store medication in the home and receptivity to guidance from healthcare providers, need to be better understood to improve adherence. We designed and deployed a survey to investigate home medication management. The 1,673 survey respondents reported that the most common home storage locations for medications were nightstand drawers (28%) and atop nightstands (27%). Kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities were significantly associated with increased odds of having ever forgotten to take a medication. Desks, dining room tables, and nightstand drawers were associated with the greatest statistically significant decrease in odds of having ever forgotten to take a medication. Almost all (96%) respondents were receptive to guidance on medication storage from a healthcare provider. Patients are largely on their own to devise home medication management practices, yet some home storage locations are significantly associated with decreased odds of having forgotten to take a medication. Knowing which practices are associated with adherence may lead to better guidance for patients from healthcare providers and to innovation in the design of medication adherence interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b24ed066c27745002a9fa33cba8c761d1be7a5fbfe4552b4d13c0d31bc705c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
