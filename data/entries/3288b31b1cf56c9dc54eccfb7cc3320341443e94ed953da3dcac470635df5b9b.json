There are plenty of combustion anomalies like preignition, backfire, knock and lube oil ignition that come along with the technology, hence not yet controllable. To gain more knowledge about their origin, optical engines and CFD simulations are well established methods to investigate and develop knew combustion processes. Hydrogenâ€™s wide flammability range and its short quenching distance bring new challenges. However, optical engines give the best insight into the real combustion behavior. Therefore, their understanding and proper modeling in the simulation is of great importance to calibrate the simulation models accurately. For optical engines there are diverging opinions on how to deal with their blow-by losses. Due to their lack of oil different sealing mechanisms exist and those seem to be crucial for the question on how or wether the blow-by has to be modelled. proposed a numerical multi-zone blow-by model whereas the opinion at is to neglect those losses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3288b31b1cf56c9dc54eccfb7cc3320341443e94ed953da3dcac470635df5b9b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
