With an extensive range of instrumentation and analytical techniques, unique and complementary information can be obtained across multiple length scales. One case that required this multi-modality, multi-scale characterization approach came from a user working on cyclic polyacetylene conductive polymer films. During a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) session, it was observed that some (not all) of the film samples exhibited unexpected micron-scale crystals. Determining whether the crystals were remnants from the catalyst or due to the formation of an additional phase during polymer synthesis was crucial to the user and refinement of polymer processing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b8c4b7f6dd00bbd1697aacf0a83a322ebe72c2e06bc068eb19dcf231afa26eec","category":"Environment"}
