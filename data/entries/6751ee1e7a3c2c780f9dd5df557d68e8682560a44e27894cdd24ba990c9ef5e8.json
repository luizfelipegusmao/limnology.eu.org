{"title":"Investigation on Hydrodynamic Performance and Wall Temperature of Water-cooled Wall in a 1000 MW Boiler under Low-load Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1783/v1","date":1727170412000,"content":"To enhance the peak-shaving capability of the boiler, a mathematical model of hydrodynamic and wall temperature characteristics for the water-cooled wall of a 1000 MW boiler was established. The attributes pertaining to the mass flow distribution, the temperature of the effluent working fluid, pressure drop, and the thermal distribution across the wall surfaces at 30% of the boiler's maximum continuous rating (BMCR) were meticulously computed and subjected to a thorough analytical review. The findings suggest that, under the operation at 30% BMCR load, there is a substantial equilibrium in the flow distribution across the quartet of walls that constitute the water-cooled wall assembly. The maximum mass flow rate deviations in the helical and vertical sections are 1.95% and 3.47%, respectively, showing small flow deviations and reasonable distribution. The temperature deviation in the helical section is 0.3 °C, reflecting the characteristic low thermal deviation in helical tubes. While the temperature deviation at the outlet of the vertical section is higher, it remains within safe limits. The pressure loss across the water-cooled wall system amounts to 0.4 MPa. The peak wall temperature reaches 337.5°C, remaining within the material's permissible safety limits. In-depth performance analysis ensures the safe operating conditions of the water-cooled wall during low load conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6751ee1e7a3c2c780f9dd5df557d68e8682560a44e27894cdd24ba990c9ef5e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
