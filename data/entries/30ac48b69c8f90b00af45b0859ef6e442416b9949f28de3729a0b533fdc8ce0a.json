The aim of the study is to obtain polymer-based composites with modified diatomite (water-dispersion paint on acrylic binder) with improved performance properties. Methods: determination of porosity, adhesion, elasticity, hiding power of the control composition; determination of porosity, adhesion, elasticity, hiding power of the obtained composites with the use of modified filler; investigation of the influence of radiation in the infrared radiation (IR) region of the spectrum of the paint coating surface using FLIRB620 thermal imager. As a result of work it is noticed that modification of water dispersions by silica activated diatomite promotes elimination of the main disadvantages of materials and coatings on the basis of acrylate binder - low water resistance and low physical and mechanical characteristics, introduction of modified diatomite into water emulsion paint on acrylate basis does not lead to deterioration of the main operational characteristics of paint and varnish coatings - porosity, adhesion, elasticity and covering. When analyzing the effect of emissivity in the IR region of the spectrum of the paint coating surface, a significant effect of the quantitative content of modified diatomite on the reduction of emissivity of paint coatings in the IR region of the spectrum was established and it was shown that a significant effect of the reduction of emissivity of paint coatings in the IR region of the spectrum is provided by the introduction of modified diatomite in the amount of 40 wt.h. into the mixture. The influence of the time of full-scale tests in the investigated small range regardless of the quantitative composition of modified diatomite on the performance characteristics of the paintwork was established.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30ac48b69c8f90b00af45b0859ef6e442416b9949f28de3729a0b533fdc8ce0a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
