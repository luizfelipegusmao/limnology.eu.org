For low-Z elements, which have characteristic X-ray lines only in the sub-1 keV range, the effects of absorption can dominate the analysis. At 20.0 keV, it is easy to overlook the O K signal from SiO<sub>2</sub> because the X-ray is so strongly absorbed. However, by lowering the beam energy to 5 keV, the beam no longer penetrates so far into the sample and absorption is greatly reduced. The O lines now are easily distinguished over the continuum. Figure 1 shows φ(ρz) curves which demonstrate the difference in relative absorption between SiO<sub>2</sub> at 5 keV and 20 keV. The red curve represents the generated signal as a function of mass-depth. The blue curve represents the emitted signal. At 20 keV, the emitted signal is substantially below the generated signal particularly at larger depths while, at 5 keV, the difference is less significant.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"92f515d0f8ff74135084515cfeeb4dfef385a1bf0d5b81a4c54a6b10f213faea","category":"Environment"}
