{"title":"From ultrasound to microscopy: Actualities in thyroid investigation in cattle","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302997","date":1714658400000,"content":"<p>by Justine Eppe, Elise Raguet, Patrick Petrossians, Sébastien Czaplicki, Calixte Bayrou, Frédéric Rollin, Vinciane Toppets, Hugues Guyot</p>\r\n\r\nThyroid ultrasonography examination is widely used in human and small animal medicine. However, it has rarely been applied in cattle. The aim of this study was to determine whether the measurements of the thyroid gland by ultrasound examination correlate to those taken during <i>post-mortem</i> examination. A sample of 22 cows and 23 calves was selected for thyroid gland evaluation. An ultrasound scan was performed <i>ante-mortem</i>, followed by euthanasia (for medical reasons) or slaughtered in the food chain and the dissection of the thyroid gland was therefore performed. <i>Post-mortem</i>, the gland was weighed and its dimensions and volume measured. The volume and weight measurements were compared with the predicted ones on US using the formulas available in the literature. Finally, histological examination was performed on thyroid glands. The dimensions of the thyroid gland measured by ultrasonography were significantly different (p&lt;0.05) from those observed <i>post-mortem</i>, except for lobe lengths in calves (p&gt;0.1). However, in calves, there was no systematic bias between the ultrasound and <i>post-mortem</i> examination of the thyroid gland, which were concordant (with an average error of 18%). Cystic lesions were observed on ultrasound in 9/22 cows and could be found on histological examination in 7 of these. Other lesions, such as follicular hypoplasia and hyperplasia, were seen on histological examination but not on ultrasound. Although the ultrasound measurements did not significantly correlate with those taken <i>post-mortem</i>, this examination may allow to differentiate non-standard thyroids in the case of hyperplastic goiter, as demonstrated in other species. This study also describes and illustrates interesting lesions of the thyroid gland in cattle. These findings are innovative in the description of the use of thyroid ultrasound in cattle, although further studies are needed to allow deeper conclusions.","author":"Justine Eppe","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bc1df8c944da3eab1aa12eafb5523b7e2f69af31e3507eb7ca437c616513fe00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
