{"title":"Can Plants Perceive Human Gestures? Using AI to Track Eurythmic Human-Plant Interaction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0466/v1","date":1712549530000,"content":"This paper explores if plants are capable of responding to human movement by changes in their electrical signals. Towards that goal we conducted a series of experiments, where humans over a period of 6 months were performing different types of eurythmic gestures in proximity of garden plants, namely salad, basil, and tomatoes. To measure plant perception, we used the plant spikerbox, a device that measures changes in voltage differentials of plants between roots and leaves. Using machine learning, we find that the voltage differentials over time of the plant predict if (a) eurythmy has been performed, and (b) which kind of eurythmy gestures has been performed. We also find that the signals are different based on the species of the plant. In other words, the perception of a salad, tomato, or basil might differ just as perception of different species of animals differ. This opens new ways of studying plant ecosystems, while also paving the way to use plants as biosensors for analyzing human movement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2adb290ad0a623b77f4767aa3ed13602a326d55da4846d5bcceff9443e121376","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
