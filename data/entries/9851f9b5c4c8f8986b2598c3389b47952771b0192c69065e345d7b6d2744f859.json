{"title":"The burden and care cascade in young and middle-aged patients with diabetes hypertension comorbidity with abdominal obesity in India: A nationally representative cross-sectional survey","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003413","date":1721224800000,"content":"<p>by Saurav Basu, Vansh Maheshwari, Mansi Malik, Kara Barzangi, Refaat Hassan</p>\r\n\r\nWe ascertained the burden, determinants, and care cascade in the young and middle-aged patients having co-existing hypertension (HTN), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and abdominal obesity in India from a secondary data analysis of nationally representative data. The study examined cross-sectional data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) conducted in India from 2019 to 2021 in 788974 individuals aged 15â€“49 years including 695707 women and 93267 men. The weighted prevalence of DM-HTN comorbidity with high waist circumference in the sample was 0.75% (95% CI: 0.71 to 0.79) including 46.33% (95% CI: 44.06 to 48.62) newly diagnosed cases detected for HTN and high blood sugars. The weighted prevalence of Metabolic syndrome as per NCEP ATPIII criteria was found to be 1.13% (95% CI: 1.08 to 1.17). Only 46.16% existing cases were treated with both anti-diabetes and antihypertensive medication (full treatment), while 34.71% cases were untreated. On adjusted analysis, increasing age, females, higher wealth index, high fat diet, obesity and comorbidities were significantly associated with having DM-HTN comorbidity along with high-waist circumference. More than half of young and middle aged-population in India with DM-HTN-abdominal obesity triad are not initiated on treatment for DM and HTN comorbidities, while a majority of the previously diagnosed cases have uncontrolled blood pressure and poor glycemic control. The poor cascade of care for DM and HTN in these high-risk group of patients may substantially increase their risk for early progression and severity of microvascular and macrovascular complications especially cardiovascular disease.","author":"Saurav Basu","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"9851f9b5c4c8f8986b2598c3389b47952771b0192c69065e345d7b6d2744f859","category":"Environment"}
