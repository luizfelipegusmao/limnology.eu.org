However, public health strategies to mitigate enteric infections among children largely aim to reduce exposure to human feces, overlooking transmission pathways related to animal feces. In this study we examine if and how children are exposed to enteric pathogens in animal feces in northwestern coastal Ecuador. We conducted qualitative interviews with mothers of children aged 10–18 months that owned (<i>n</i> = 32) and did not own (<i>n</i> = 26) animals in urban and rural communities. Using thematic analysis, we identified community, household, and child behavioral factors that influence exposure. We also compared child exposure by household animal ownership. Our findings revealed myriad opportunities for young children to be exposed to enteric pathogens in many locations and from multiple animal sources, regardless of household animal ownership. Animal feces management practices (AFM) used by mothers, such as rinsing feces into ditches and throwing feces into surrounding areas, may increase environmental contamination outside their homes and in their communities. Unsafe AFM practices were similar to unsafe child feces management practices reported in other studies, including practices related to defecation location, feces removal and disposal, environmental contamination cleaning, and handwashing. Findings suggest that animal feces may contaminate the environment along similar pathways as human feces. Identification and incorporation of safe AFM practices, similar to those developed for child feces management, would 1) mitigate child exposure to enteric pathogens by reducing animal feces contamination in domestic and public spaces; and 2) enable an integrated approach to address enteric pathogen exposure pathways related to animal and child feces.","author":"April M.
