{"title":"The Effect of Lifestyle Coaching Approach on Patient Engagement and Weight Loss in a Semaglutide-Supported Digital Obesity Program in the UK: A Comparative Retrospective Cohort Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1674/v1","date":1729584949000,"content":"Digital weight-loss services (DWLSs) that supplement continuous lifestyle coaching with Semaglutide therapy have shown promise in delivering continuous and effective obesity care. However, the extent to which lifestyle coaching approach and Semaglutide brand influences patient engagement and program effectiveness is unknown. This study retrospectively analyzed several engagement markers and weight loss percentage over 16 weeks in a large Semaglutide-supported DWLS in the UK. The comparative analysis found that patients who received lifestyle coaching that was proactive and personalized sent a statistically higher number of messages to their health coach (M=19.37 vs M=8.55) and opened the program app more frequently (M = 49.31 days vs M = 40.06 days) than patients whose coaching was reactive and standardized. Mean 16-week weight-loss was 10.1% in the proactive group compared to 8.9% in the reactive group, but the difference was not statistically significant. A two-sample t-test found that female patients (M = 9.76) tended to lose more weight than male patients (M = 6.88), (t(152) = 1.89 , p = 0.04). The findings add vital layers of nuance to the emerging literature on Semaglutide-supported DWLSs, indicating that a proactive, personalized coaching approach leads to better patient engagement with DWLS health coaches and that Wegovy has a comparable effect to Ozempic as a supplement to DWLS coaching. Future research should seek to conduct comparable investigations of other obesity services and over a longer period.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f07c1e6518e0a6163607967e586087bc99db467d7c4b8df03577d151bebfeb2d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
