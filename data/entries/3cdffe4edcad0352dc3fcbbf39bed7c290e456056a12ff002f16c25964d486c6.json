{"title":"Biomarkers of &lsquo;Late Onset Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease &lsquo;, Diagnosis and Role of &rsquo;Deep Learning&rsquo;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0154/v1","date":1725352543000,"content":"Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is a dementia category disease that starts after the age of 65. Progressive problems in thinking, behaviour, learning etc. are its characteristics. Due to its progressive nature, early diagnosis is crucial. A complex pathway mechanism with different risk factors is involved in LOAD progression. A comprehensive study is done on factors causing LOAD, biomarkers used for diagnosis in clinical and preclinical stage of the disease, ML (Machine Learning) techniques to identify disease stage. We reviewed research papers on clinical and preclinical diagnosis of LOAD using ML techniques from biomarker data: MRI, PET image, MMSE, Genome / Gene expression, DNA / RNA binding sites with protein, Epigenetic expression /DNA, methylation, Speech and text. We have listed improvement scope after finding the gaps and scope of using Generative AI and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for data augmentation. At the end, we have elaborated current use of DL (Deep Learning) and CNN (‘Convolution Neural Network’) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3cdffe4edcad0352dc3fcbbf39bed7c290e456056a12ff002f16c25964d486c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
