{"title":"Novel pH‐sensitive gellan gum–ε‐polylysine hydrogel microspheres for sulforaphene delivery","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13765?af=R","date":1721812821000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>This study aimed to improve the stability and utilization of sulforaphene (SFE) and to enhance the intestinal stability and pH-sensitive release of SFE in the gastrointestinal tract. To achieve this objective, calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) was used as a crosslinking agent to fabricate novel SFE-loaded gellan gum (GG)-ε-polylysine (ε-PL) pH-sensitive hydrogel microspheres by using the ionic crosslinking technique.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The molecular docking results of GG, ε-PL, and SFE were good and occurred in the natural state. The loading efficiency (LE) of all samples was above 70%. According to the structural characterization results, GG and ε-PL successfully embedded SFE in a three-dimensional network structure through electrostatic interaction. The swelling characteristics and <i>in vitro</i> release results revealed that the microspheres were pH-sensitive, and SFE was mainly retained inside the hydrogel microsphere in the stomach, and subsequently released in the intestine. The result of cytotoxicity assay showed that the hydrogel microspheres were non-toxic and had an inhibitory effect on human colon cancer Caco-2 cells.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Thus, the hydrogel microspheres could improve SFE stability and utilization and achieve the intestinal targeted delivery of SFE. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yang Qu, \nXiuxia Li, \nXiaoqiao Chen, \nJianrong Li, \nZhangfu Yu, \nRonghu Shen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"3d2a94851c1ccbadd404981c7fce3d515835592f8529e3f318e50dd9fedb8e06","category":"Environment"}
