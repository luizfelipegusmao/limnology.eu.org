{"title":"A New Paradigm in Cancer Treatment: Identifying and Targeting Clonal Mutations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202308.1536/v8","date":1719818849000,"content":"Recently concluded, large-scale cancer genomics studies involving multiregion sequencing of primary tumors and paired metastases appear to indicate that many or most cancer patients have one or more “clonal\" mutations in their tumors. Clonal mutations are those that are present in all of a patient’s cancer cells. Achilles Therapeutics is currently the only company specifically targeting clonal mutations. However, they are doing so with tumor-derived T cells. To address the potential limitations of immunotherapy, I have devised another approach for exploiting clonal mutations, which I call “Oncolytic Vector Efficient Replication Contingent on Omnipresent Mutation Engagement” (OVERCOME). The ideal version of OVERCOME would likely employ a bioengineered facultative intracellular bacterium. The bacterium would initially be attenuated, but (transiently) reverse its attenuation upon clonal mutation detection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e95c03225d80d8fc693b7bed0e471e65c579a061c4906a15abac4c7d6c9c8f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
