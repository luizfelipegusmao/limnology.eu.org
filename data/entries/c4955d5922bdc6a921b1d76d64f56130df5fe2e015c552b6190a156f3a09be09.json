Specifically, within the vast variety of viruses that can infect nearly all known forms of life, bacteriophages are the most prolific. Most of these belong to the class Caudoviricetes, which comprises double-stranded DNA-tailed bacteriophages. Tailed bacteriophages fall into three major morphological types: myoviruses (having a long, contractile tail), podoviruses (with very short, non-contractile tails), and siphoviruses (which possess a long, non-contractile tail).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c4955d5922bdc6a921b1d76d64f56130df5fe2e015c552b6190a156f3a09be09","category":"Environment"}
