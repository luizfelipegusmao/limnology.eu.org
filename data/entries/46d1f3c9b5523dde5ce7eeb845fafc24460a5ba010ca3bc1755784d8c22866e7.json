{"title":"Comparing the Cardiovascular Risk-Reducing Effects of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Fish Oil and Krill Oil: A Network Meta-Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0128/v1","date":1714637035000,"content":"The study aimed to compare the cardiovascular benefits of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids from fish oil versus krill oil in different forms and dosages. Following PRISMA 2015, data analysis with R software, and databases were searched from 1993 to 2023, (ID PROSPERO: CRD42024502338). Sixty high-quality studies were analyzed, covering various forms of fish oil and krill oil at different dosages (fish oil (ethyl ester-EE, triglyceride-TG, re-esterified triglycerides-rTG, capsules, emulsion-EM); krill oil (phospholipid/free fatty acid-PL/FFA, high concentration phospholipid-HPL, low concentration phospholipid-LPL)). Meta-analysis revealed that krill oil with phospholipid/free fatty acid at doses 2000-2900 mg effectively lowered triglycerides, while fish oil in ethyl ester form at doses above 3000 mg significantly reduced total cholesterol. Fish oil in triglyceride form at doses 2000-2900 mg and other variations positively impacted HDL-C levels. Fish oil in EE form above 3000 mg and triglyceride form below 2000 mg notably reduced LDL-C. However, there was limited effectiveness observed for other interventions. Analysis for LDL-C exhibited publication bias, while other parameters demonstrated reliability (Egger's test). In conclusion, krill oil - PL/FFA, Fish oil - EE above 3000 mg, Fish oil - TG 2000-3000 mg, and fish oil - rTAG 300-1900 mg effectively in reducing heart risk patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46d1f3c9b5523dde5ce7eeb845fafc24460a5ba010ca3bc1755784d8c22866e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
