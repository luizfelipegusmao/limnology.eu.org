{"title":"Mathematical Problems of Artificial Intelligence and Their Solution Through the Universality of the Zeta Function","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2164/v1","date":1727430388000,"content":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) faces several mathematical challenges, such as optimization, generalization, interpretability of models, and phase transitions. These problems significantly limit the application of AI in critical areas such as medicine, autonomous systems, and finance. This paper examines the main mathematical problems of AI and proposes solutions based on the use of the universality of the Riemann zeta function.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6dfe349800fc5ecb236d3308ee4c0e3921a5d68fde516b8f3aa54d486227dc1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
