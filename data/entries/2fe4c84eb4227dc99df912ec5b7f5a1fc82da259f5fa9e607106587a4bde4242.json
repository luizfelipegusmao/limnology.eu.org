{"title":"Enhancing Language Learning and Intergroup Empathy through Multi-user Interaction and Simulations in a Virtual World","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1274/v1","date":1718880879000,"content":"This study explores the impact of multi-user interaction, group work, and simulations within virtual worlds on language learning and the development of intergroup empathy. Two distinct research projects were conducted, involving a total of 241 participants aged 19-45. The language learning study engaged 116 participants in diverse interactive experiences, while the intercultural study had 125 participants collaborating in multicultural groups and participating in perspective-taking simulations. Both studies employed qualitative data collection methods, including surveys, interviews, and observations. The findings suggest that the combination of networking strategies, collaborative learning, and simulations within virtual worlds contributes to improvements in learners' language proficiency, confidence, and empathy towards diverse social groups. Participants reported increased motivation and engagement, attributed to the immersive and interactive nature of the virtual environments. The studies highlight the importance of collaboration and reflection in facilitating language acquisition and intercultural understanding. Technical challenges were identified as potential barriers to implementation. The results demonstrate the potential of virtual worlds to enhance language education and foster empathy in diverse societies, offering valuable insights for educators and researchers. However, the findings may be limited by the specific contexts and sample sizes of the studies, warranting further research to explore the generalizability and long-term impact of virtual world interventions. not exaggerate the main conclusions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2fe4c84eb4227dc99df912ec5b7f5a1fc82da259f5fa9e607106587a4bde4242","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
