{"title":"Bridge Deck Durability: Advanced Materials for Crack Mitigation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2390/v1","date":1722404681000,"content":"The durability of bridge decks is a critical factor in ensuring the safety and longevity of transportation infrastructure. This article explores advanced materials and innovative techniques designed to mitigate cracking in bridge decks, a common issue that can compromise structural integrity and increase maintenance costs. It provides a comprehensive review of cutting-edge solutions such as Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (FRP), High-Performance Concrete (HPC), Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC), and self-healing concrete technologies. Each material is analyzed for its ability to enhance strength, reduce permeability, and improve resistance to environmental stressors. Additionally, the article examines the role of surface treatments, sealants, and routine maintenance practices in prolonging the life of bridge decks. By synthesizing current research and practical applications, this article offers valuable insights and recommendations for engineers, contractors, and policymakers seeking to advance bridge deck durability through innovative materials and methodologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a52156159b6341030b120e0a98ef87b4e6003ec6ca6d0fdc80c90d89defc5610","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
