{"title":"Larval performance of two amphidromous atyid shrimp species in the genus Atyopsis under different temperatures and salinity conditions","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05438-6","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Amphidromous atyid shrimps in the genus <em>Atyopsis</em> consist of two species, namely, <em>A. moluccensis</em> and <em>A. spinipes</em>. The geographical distribution of <em>A. spinipes</em> extends to the Pacific islands and is wider than that of <em>A. moluccensis</em>. Amphidromous shrimp populations are linked through marine larval dispersal. Therefore, <em>A. spinipes</em> larvae may have an ability to survive in the open sea. We tested this expectation through larval culture experiments under different temperatures (20, 24, 28 and 32 °C) and salinity (8.5, 17, 25.5 and 34 ppt) conditions, which are crucial abiotic factors affecting the larval performance of decapod crustaceans. The larvae of <em>A. moluccensis</em> died soon after hatching at 34 ppt and survived to the juvenile stage under 24–32 °C and 17–25.5 ppt conditions. The larvae of <em>A. spinipes</em> survived to the juvenile stage under 24–32 °C and 17–34 ppt conditions, and their moulting incidence and survival time to death at 20 °C were higher and longer, respectively, compared with <em>A. moluccensis</em> larvae. The larvae of <em>A. spinipes</em> adapted to lower temperature and higher salinity conditions, allowing this species to expand their northward distribution through the open sea with high salinity conditions.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"e8c633252994509644695806e62c5743ed051e73a3f445f8c0816e4d6088893a","category":"Environment"}
