{"title":"Ethyl acetate in e-liquids: Implications for breath testing","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/6/413/7684353?rss=1","date":1716940800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Electronic cigarette liquids (e-liquids) can contain a variety of chemicals to impart flavors, smells and pharmacological effects. Surveillance studies have identified hundreds of chemicals used in e-liquids that have known health and safety implications. Ethyl acetate has been identified as a common constituent of e-liquids. Ethyl acetate is rapidly hydrolyzed to ethanol <span>in vivo</span>. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhaling &gt;2,000 mg/L ethyl acetate can lead to the accumulation of ethanol in the blood at concentrations &gt;1,000 mg/L, or 0.10%. A “Heisenberg” e-liquid was submitted to the Laboratory for Forensic Toxicology Research for analysis after a random workplace drug test resulted in a breath test result of 0.019% for a safety-sensitive position employee. Analysis of this sample resulted in the detection of 1,488 ± 6 mg/L ethyl acetate. The evaluation of purchased “Heisenberg” e-liquids determined that these products contain ethyl acetate. The identification of ethyl acetate in e-liquids demonstrates poor regulatory oversight and enforcement that potentially has consequences for breath ethanol testing and interpretations. The accumulation of ethanol in the breath from the ingestion/inhalation of ethyl acetate from an e-liquid used prior to a breath test may contribute to the detection of ethanol.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"ad18a31d22aa3846a59e86272250c083e8c5873114fb7181e7b66d0175125f7a","category":"Environment"}
