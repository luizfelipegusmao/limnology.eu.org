{"title":"Analysis of Tidal Current Energy Potential in the Major Channels of the Bohai Strait Based on Delft3D","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11802-024-5721-y","date":1722470400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The utilization and development of tidal current energy can help alleviate the current energy shortage, improve the global ecological environment, and maintain sustainable development. In this study, numerical simulation is carried out on a rectangular grid using Delft3D. The tidal current energy potential of the major channels in the Bohai Strait is further simulated and estimated by comparing the simulated and measured data. Results show that the flow module in Delft3D has good modeling ability for the assessment of tidal current energy potential. The average flow velocity, maximum flow velocity, and energy flow density are consistent. The Laotieshan Channel, located in the northern part of the Bohai Strait, shows a large tidal current energy potential. The maximum flow velocity of this channel can reach 2 m s<sup>−1</sup>, and the maximum energy flow density can exceed 500 W m<sup>−2</sup>. The tidal current energy in the Laotieshan Channel is more than 10 times that in other channels. Therefore, this study advocates for the continued exploration and exploitation of the tidal current energy resources in the Laotieshan Channel.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"a43f1cd73574f198cbd46952f5c1805e9869a60adf309012f6627ca1406db074","category":"Environment"}
