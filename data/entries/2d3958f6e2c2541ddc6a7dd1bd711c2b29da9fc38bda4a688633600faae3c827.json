{"title":"Perceived Inclusivity in Mobility Aids Use: A Qualitative Study in Iran","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1005/v1","date":1723616459000,"content":"Despite inclusive design focusing on improving environmental accessibility for mobility aid (MA) users, it often fails to ensure true inclusivity due to mismatches between interventions and user perceptions. Therefore, understanding mobility aids users' perceptions of inclusivity is essential for advancing disability studies and design, as it highlights key interventions for more effective practices. This study aims to explore perceived inclusivity in MAs usage and identifies gaps in users' needs, classifying their needs and offering recommendations to meet them. First, the DARE-Inclusive Design Framework was used to develop interview guidelines and interpret results. Next, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 experienced physiotherapists in Iran, and finally, an inductive thematic analysis was used to identify and present themes. Four themes were identified: 1. Perceived Financial Value: Assessing Worth, 2. Objective Enhancements: Optimizing Environments and MAs, 3. Subjective Enhancements: Trustworthiness, Support, and Hope, and 4. Contextual Factors: Interpretations and Representations. The four interconnected themes provide guidelines for inclusivity-oriented interventions, emphasizing financial assessment, high-tech integration, and aesthetic and symbolic considerations in mobility aid design. Physiotherapists can also mediate emotional responses and enhance inclusion during rehabilitation. Additionally, social context and disability etiology impact users' acceptance and use of MAs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d3958f6e2c2541ddc6a7dd1bd711c2b29da9fc38bda4a688633600faae3c827","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
