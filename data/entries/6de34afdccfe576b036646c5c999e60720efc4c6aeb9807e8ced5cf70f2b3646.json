{"title":"RNA N6-adenine methylation dynamics impact Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis resistance in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/745/7712420?rss=1","date":1720656000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In plants, epitranscriptomic mark N6-adenine methylation (m6A) is dynamically regulated in response to environmental cues. However, little is known about m6A dynamics under biotic stresses and their role in environmental adaptation. Additionally, current methodologies limit the investigation of m6A dynamics at single-nucleotide resolution on specific RNA molecules. Using Oxford Nanopore Technology direct RNA sequencing and a neural network model, we show transcript-specific dynamics of m6A modification at single-nucleotide resolution during <span>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</span> (<span>Hpa</span>) infection in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). In wild-type seedlings, pathogen infection causes a significant reduction in global m6A ratios, which corresponds with the activation of m6A-modified transcripts. Defect of m6A deposition in the m6A mutant <span>hakai-1</span> mimics m6A reduction from <span>Hpa</span> infection at âˆ¼70% of sites, resulting in constitutive overexpression of basal defense genes and enhanced resistance against the pathogen. Our results demonstrate that m6A dynamics impact defense response against <span>Hpa</span>, providing a promising target for future crop improvement strategies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"6de34afdccfe576b036646c5c999e60720efc4c6aeb9807e8ced5cf70f2b3646","category":"Environment"}
