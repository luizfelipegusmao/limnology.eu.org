{"title":"A Comprehensive Exploration of the Multifaceted Neuroprotective Role of Cannabinoids in Alzheimer&#039;s Disease Across a Decade of Research","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1367/v1","date":1716278528000,"content":"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, manifests through dysregulation of brain function and subsequent loss of bodily control, attributed to β-amyloid plaque deposition and TAU protein hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, leading to neuronal death. Concurrently, similar cannabinoids to the ones derived from Cannabis sativa are present in the endocannabinoid system, acting through receptors CB1R and CB2R and other related receptors such as Trpv-1 and GPR-55, and are being extensively investigated for AD therapy. Given the limited efficacy and adverse effects of current available treatments, alternative approaches are crucial. Therefore, this review aims to identify effective natural and synthetic cannabinoids and elucidate their beneficial actions for AD treatment. PubMed and Scopus databases were queried (2014–2024) using keywords such as \"Alzheimer's disease\" and \"cannabinoids\". The majority of natural (THC, CBD, AEA, etc.) and synthetic (JWH-133, WIN55,212-2, CP55-940, etc.) cannabinoids included, showed promise in improving memory, cognition, and behavioral symptoms, potentially via pathways involving antioxidant effects of selective CB1R agonists (such as the BDNF/TrkB/Akt pathway) and immunomodulatory effects of selective CB2R agonists (TLR4/NF-κB p65 pathway). Combining anticholinesterase properties with cannabinoid moiety may enhance therapeutic responses, addressing cholinergic deficits of AD brains. Thus, the positive outcomes of the majority of studies discussed supports further advancing cannabinoids in clinical trials for AD treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c71e308a775bcb525d2ddf4b6bdcaf39622b1c4b38966ab09f150948fc6a194","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
