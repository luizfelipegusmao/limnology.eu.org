{"title":"Implementing Replica Set: Strategy to Improve the Performance of NoSQL Database Cluster in MongoDB","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0449/v1","date":1720131021000,"content":"This study investigates the implementation and performance benefits of using a MongoDB replica set compared to a single node setup. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficiency and reliability improvements provided by replication in a NoSQL database cluster. The research involved configuring a single node and a three-node replica set, followed by conducting performance tests using CRUD operations on both setups. The results indicated that while the single node exhibited faster write operations, the replica set significantly improved read performance and provided high availability and fault tolerance. The findings highlight the advantages of using a replica set for applications requiring robust data access and consistent performance under varying workloads.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"41ea57fd1a69aa7da9a2f3c6ccaa0928598fe3c1f3ca53560500348d5a0609b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
