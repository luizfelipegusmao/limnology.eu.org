{"title":"Interactions Between Machiavellianism and Verbal Reasoning in &ldquo;Bullshit&rdquo; Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202308.2050/v2","date":1710409819000,"content":"Persons high in the manipulative, misanthropic trait Machiavellianism make use of various forms of deception to attain their goals. A recent study demonstrated that different facets of Machiavellianism account for different kinds of deception (Blötner &amp; Bergold, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12559). Intelligence could be another predictor of deception production. This research examined the interactions between different facets of Machiavellianism and verbal reasoning to predict the production of empty, vague pseudo-information that is supposed to help achieve desired states or prevent undesired ones (co-called “bullshit”). In a sample of 525 participants, and consistent with the hypotheses, individuals with high scores in the goal-oriented facet of Machiavellianism produced “bullshit” more frequently to achieve certain goals if they also scored high in verbal reasoning. Thus, and opposing common assumptions, Machiavellianism is not sufficient to explain engagement in deceptive behavior as it only reflects the motivation to do so. Especially in the case of verbally expressed deception, verbal skills are also required to be successful.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"faecc25d7f6acd3d7ce51e4c4d6f6ef4eb84b7efee2642ecdc28262aa2d6d011","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
