Races are often close, with elbow-to-elbow action right until the line, and the best cross-country mountain bikes combine everything we love about mountain biking – riding fast, uphill and downhill.</p>\n<p>Cross-country mountain bike technology has advanced quickly in the last few years. Cross-country bikes are now lighter, faster and more capable than ever, while many cross-country race tracks have become more demanding at the same time.</p>\n<p>If you’re thinking about buying a cross-country bike, then read on for our pick of the best bikes reviewed by our expert testers.</p>\n<p>We’ve also put together a buyer’s guide so you can learn everything you need to know about cross-country bikes <a href=\"#buyersguide\">at the end of this article</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re tempted to start riding competitively, we’ve got a separate <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cross-country-racing-guide/\">beginner’s guide to cross-country racing</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Best cross-country mountain bikes 2023, as rated by our expert testers</h2>\n<h3>Lapierre Prorace CF 9.9</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lapierre Prorace CF 9.9 hardtail mountain bike\" title=\"Lapierre Prorace CF 9.9 - pack shot\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Prorace is a race-ready rig.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Fast, fun, comfortable and good value</li>\n<li><span>Frame compliance adds speed </span></li>\n<li><span>£5,999/€6,799 as tested</span></li>\n</ul><p>The Prorace is Lapierre’s top-end carbon race hardtail and uses its 3D Tubular concept that the brand has employed on its road bikes since 2015 to boost compliance. This is effectively a triple-triangle design, which sees the seatstays separated from the seat tube.</p>\n<p>We found this really helped when climbing because the frame reduces the amount the bike skips and slips around and it smoothes out the trail when descending, too. That said, don’t expect it to tame the trails to the extent of a full-suspension bike.</p>\n<p>The Prorace handles well and the geometry gives it a fun and engaging ride, even if it’s not the most progressive.</p>\n<p>This SRAM-heavy build features a RockShox SID SL Ultimate fork up front, a wireless AXS drivetrain and a set of Level TLM brakes.</p>\n<p>We really rate the Maxxis Rekon Race tyres, their low-profile, densely packed tread rolling fast on smooth surfaces, balanced with their suppleness.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/lapierre-prorace-cf-9-9-review/\">Read our full Lapierre Prorace CF 9.9 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Specialized Epic Pro</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Specialized Epic Pro full-suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Buyer’s guide to cross-country bikes | How to buy the best XC bike for you\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Epic Pro is built from FACT 11M carbon, as used on the previous-generation S-Works Epic.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>A race bike with razor-sharp handling and technical ability</li>\n<li><span>Contemporary geometry for a race bike</span></li>\n<li><span>£8,250/$8,000/€9,299/AU$13,000 as tested</span></li>\n</ul><p>This Specialized Epic is one of the best cross-country bikes on the market, with its geometry proving both contemporary and more trail-oriented than XC.</p>\n<p>The bike uses Specialized’s proprietary Brain technology to control the suspension system, using weighted inertia valves to open the fork and shock when a bump is detected.</p>\n<p>We found the bike to ride calmly in the rough without feeling sluggish.

It needs to be equally capable of climbing and descending, while also being efficient when pedalling on flatter terrain, or picking a line through tight, twisting singletrack.</p>\n<p>Cross-country bikes are usually the lightest type of mountain bike you can buy for a given price and are often made from carbon fibre, although more affordable aluminium options are also widely available.</p>\n<p>XC bikes have less suspension travel than trail bikes and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">enduro bikes</a>, so won’t be as adept on very steep, rough and technical trails. That being said, in the right hands – for example, a professional rider – a cross-country bike is surprisingly capable.</p>\n<p>While cross-country bikes are designed mainly for racing, they’re equally at home on mellower trails, or a big day out in the hills when you’ll value the all-round capability of an XC bike on varied terrain.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h3>What about downcountry?</h3>\n<p>Before we go any further, we need to quickly mention downcountry bikes. </p>\n<p>Downcountry is a fairly new term within mountain biking. In essence, it refers to bikes that blur the line between dedicated cross-country race bikes and more forgiving trail bikes. </p>\n<p>A downcountry bike will have a little more suspension travel than a cross-country race bike; normally in the region of 120 to 130mm at the front and 110 to 115mm at the rear.</p>\n<p>It will also have geometry that leans more towards descending performance than pedalling efficiency. For example, a slacker head angle, longer reach and longer wheelbase. </p>\n<p>Finally, the componentry will be chosen with descending in mind, with more powerful brakes, larger/grippier tyres and a dropper post. </p>\n<p>For riders who want a fast, versatile bike for a variety of terrain, downcountry bikes fill that gap.

So if you live somewhere hilly, or just prioritise climbing performance above all else, then a hardtail could be a good option.</p>\n<p>With suspension only at the front of the bike, a hardtail is simpler in its design, making it easier and cheaper to maintain than a full-suspension bike.</p>\n<p>Finally, for the same cost, a hardtail can often come with a better spec than a full-suspension bike, so may require less, if any, upgrading in the future.</p>\n<h3>Full-suspension bike for XC riding</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Orbea Oiz\" title=\"Orbea Oiz\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Orbea’s 2021 Oiz OMX LTD uses a special carbon fibre to save 250g in the frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While a hardtail will typically be lighter, more affordable and simpler to maintain than a full-suspension bike, when it comes to descending performance, a full-susser will win every time.</p>\n<p>They’re also more comfortable than a hardtail, which is especially important for longer rides or races.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mathieu van der Poel going over a jump at the UCI cross-country world championships in May 2021\" title=\"Mercedes-Benz UCI Mountain Bike World Cup - Women Elite\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> On today’s rougher XC courses, a full-suspension bike can make a big difference.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Svoboda Jaroslav/BSR Agency/Getty Image</i></span></div>\n<p>On rough, flat terrain, full-suspension bikes will often enable you to pedal more efficiently because the rear suspension soaks up any bumps in the ground.</p>\n<p>As we’ve already mentioned, they will usually be heavier. However, this gap has narrowed over recent years, and at the top end, they may only weigh a kilo or two more than a hardtail.</p>\n<p>For many riders, the relatively small weight penalty of a full-suspension bike is worth the benefits of better descending, more comfort and increased pedalling efficiency on rough terrain.</p>\n<h2>What to look for when buying a cross-country bike</h2>\n<p>Now you’ve decided between a hardtail and full-suspension bike, here’s what else you need to look out for when buying a cross-country bike.</p>\n<h3>Geometry</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The BMC Twostroke\" title=\"BMC Twostroke\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The BMC Twostroke has a slack 67-degree head angle and steep 75-degree seat angle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jérémie Reuiller / BMC</i></span></div>\n<p>Cross-country bikes have traditionally had ‘steeper’ <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-bike-geometry-and-handling/\">geometry</a> figures than trail or enduro bikes. The logic was that the ‘quicker’ handling made cross-country bikes better in tight singletrack and elbow-to-elbow racing.</p>\n<p>However, modern cross-country racing now takes place on much tougher courses, which are equal parts tricky descents and lung-searing climbs, so geometry has had to keep up with this trend.</p>\n<p>Head angles as slack as 67 degrees and reach figures once only seen on trail bikes are not uncommon on modern cross-country bikes.</p>\n<p>They will also have steeper seat angles of around 74 to 75 degrees, which puts a rider’s hips in a better position over the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket</a> for pedalling efficiency.</p>\n<p>Prime examples of modern cross-country geometry are the Specialized Epic and the BMC Twostroke.</p>\n<h3>Frame material</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Orbea Alma pack shot\" title=\"Orbea Alma pack shot\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cross-country bikes such as the Orbea Alma come in carbon and aluminium alloy versions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<p>There are two main <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-frame-materials/\">frame materials</a> to choose from: carbon fibre and aluminium.</p>\n<p>When it comes to professional racing, every rider will use carbon fibre; it’s lighter than aluminium and can be designed to be stiffer, so makes perfect sense if all you’re worried about is going as fast as possible, with little concern for budget.</p>\n<p>The downside of carbon is it’s more expensive than aluminium, and in certain situations, more susceptible to crash damage.</p>\n<p>Aluminium is more affordable and better at resisting damage from certain impacts. This makes it ideal if you’re looking to save money or want your bike to be as durable as possible. The latest aluminium frames can be impressively light, too.</p>\n<p>Titanium and steel cross-country bikes do exist, but these are in the minority.</p>\n<h3>How much does a cross-country mountain bike weigh?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Evie Richards riding the women's elite XCO cross-country race at the 2020 UCI Mountain Bike World Championships\" title=\"Evie Richards riding the women's elite XCO cross-country race at the 2020 UCI Mountain Bike World Championships\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> XC racing is defined by savagely steep climbs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Whitehead / SWPix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/power-to-weight-ratio/\">power-to-weight ratio</a> is important for success in cross-country, so naturally riders want the lightest equipment possible, while still being able to withstand the demands of hard riding or racing.</p>\n<p>You might find a top-spec hardtail weighing in at under 8kg, which is incredibly impressive considering what these bikes are capable of. More affordable models typically weigh anywhere from 9 to 11kg.</p>\n<p>When it comes to full-suspension bikes, a top-spec model could come in just under 10kg, with more affordable bikes weighing anywhere from 12 to 14kg.</p>\n<p>While overall bike weight is a factor, especially if you’re an elite racer, there are much better and cheaper ways to get faster when you’re starting out – such as training.</p>\n<p>So, try not to get too hung up with weight early on. There’ll be plenty of time to start counting those grams and emptying your wallet as you progress gradually through the ranks.</p>\n<h3>Wheel size</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"29in, 27.5in and 26in mountain bike wheel sizes\" title=\"29in, 27.5in and 26in mountain bike wheel sizes\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 29in wheels are now the de facto standard on XC bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>On modern cross-country bikes, nearly every model will feature 29in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-wheels/\">mountain bike wheels</a>.</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29ers</a> took a while to truly catch on, they’re now considered a smart option for many riders, thanks to their ability to roll over obstacles more easily, and arguably provide better pedalling speed.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances, such as for particularly short riders, it may be best to go for smaller 27.5in wheels, but for most people, 29ers are the way to go for XC bikes.</p>\n<p>If you want more information, we’ve got a guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/mountain-bike-wheel-sizes-26in-650b-and-29in-explained/\">mountain bike wheel sizes</a>, covering the pros and cons of 26in, 27.5in and 29in wheels.</p>\n<h3>Tyres</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cannondale Scalpel SE rear tyre\" title=\"cannondale scalpel SE rear tyre\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Seemingly treadless tyres can still offer a lot of grip and control.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Tyre choice comes down to a balancing act between rolling resistance/speed and grip, so the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/six-of-the-best-fast-rolling-mtb-tyres/\">best cross-country tyres</a> will usually have smaller tread blocks than trail or enduro tyres.</p>\n<p>XC tyres may also have thinner sidewalls to save weight, and in some cases be made out of a slightly harder compound, which can roll faster.</p>\n<p>However, remember a harder compound will, in theory, provide less grip, and thinner sidewalls offer less puncture protection. As we said, there’s always a compromise to be made somewhere.</p>\n<p>Cross-country tyres were traditionally much narrower than <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">trail or enduro tyres</a> – but, as the sport has changed, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-tyre-sizes/\">tyre sizes</a> have increased, so you’ll now find cross-country tyres in the 2.2in to 2.4in range.</p>\n<h3>How much travel do you need?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2022 Scott Spark RC Team Issue AXS cross-country mountain bike\" title=\"2022 Scott Spark RC Team Issue AXS cross-country mountain bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Scott Spark has 120mm on the front and 120mm at the back.

As we said, XC race bikes are changing.</p>\n<p>Scott knows a thing or two about making great cross-country bikes – the outgoing Spark was hugely popular on the XC scene – so it’ll be interesting to see if longer travel on dedicated race bikes will start to catch on.</p>\n<h3>Gearing</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"sram axs eagle mech\" title=\"sram axs eagle mech\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cross-country bikes almost exclusively have 1x gearing with 32- or 34-tooth front chainrings and cassettes with a 51-tooth sprocket for climbing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Harookz</i></span></div>\n<p>Just like the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">best trail mountain bikes</a>, cross-country bikes have almost exclusively moved to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrains</a>, with Shimano and SRAM <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">mountain bike groupsets</a> dominating the market.</p>\n<p>1x drivetrains have one chainring at the front (removing the need for a front derailleur), with a wide-ranging 11- or 12-speed cassette at the back to still provide a big spread of gears.</p>\n<p>Stronger professional riders have been known to run up to a 38-tooth chainring at the front. However, at the amateur level most riders will normally go for a 32- or 34-tooth chainring instead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/bike-cassettes/\">Cassette</a> sizes usually range from a 10- or 11-tooth sprocket for the hardest gear to a 51- or 52-tooth sprocket for the easiest climbing gear.</p>\n<p>This is a pretty big spread and should keep those legs turning up the steepest of climbs.</p>\n<h3>Brakes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hope XCR caliper and rotor\" title=\"Hope XCR caliper and rotor\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cross-country bikes usually use 160 or, less commonly, 180mm rotors.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Cross-country bikes will commonly be fitted with lightweight disc brakes. These will have smaller rotors, with most riders opting for 160mm front and rear.</p>\n<p>Some particularly powerful riders may pop a 180mm rotor on the front, and the lightest riders may go for a 140mm on the rear, but in general, 160mm is what’s seen most commonly.</p>\n<p>XC disc brakes won’t be quite as powerful as the brakes you’ll find on an enduro bike, but they’re more than capable for the job at hand.</p>\n<p>On the most affordable bikes, these may be cable-actuated disc brakes, but from the mid-range and up, you’ll find hydraulic <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-disc-brakes/\">mountain bike disc brakes</a> on all cross-country bikes.</p>\n<h3>Dropper posts</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Orbea Oiz fox dropper post.\" title=\"Orbea Oiz fox dropper post\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Dropper posts are the new normal on XC bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">best dropper posts</a> enable you to lower your saddle height at the touch of a button or lever mounted on your handlebar. This helps with descending because you’re able to move the bike and your weight around more easily.</p>\n<p>Droppers were once unheard of in cross-country racing because most riders thought they were too heavy and unreliable. But as the sport and dropper technology has progressed, they’ve become more popular, with many pro riders making the switch.</p>\n<p>Dropper posts aren’t necessarily cheap, but if you can afford one, or your bike already comes with one, they can be a great addition for a relatively small weight penalty (around 400 to 500g).</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Anna Terpstra racing at the UCI women's cross-country world championships in May 2021\" title=\"Mercedes-Benz UCI Mountain Bike World Cup - Women Elite\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tough, technical courses define modern cross-country racing, making dropper posts a good choice.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Svoboda Jaroslav/BSR Agency/Getty Image</i></span></div>\n<p>For many riders, adding a dropper post can really increase the descending capability of a bike, which is why it’s one of the smartest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-best-upgrades-for-your-mountain-bike/\">mountain bike upgrades</a> you can make.</p>\n<h2>How much should you spend on a cross-country bike?</h2>\n<p>You can spend anywhere from £500 all the way up to £10,000 on a cross-country bike. While elite riders may want the best money can buy, most keen amateur racers will usually spend between £2,000 and £5,000 on their XC bike.</p>\n<p>That said, more affordable bikes in the £750 to £2,000 range are still excellent options for beginners or riders looking to save money.</p>\n<p>As ever, it’s a case of weighing up your priorities when it comes to price, component choice, weight and so on, before taking the plunge.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bikes-under-3000/\">Best mountain bikes under £3,000</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-2000/\">Best mountain bikes under £2,000</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bikes-under-1000-2/\">Best mountain bikes under £1,000</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-750/\">Best mountain bikes under £750</a></li>\n</ul>","author":"Joe Norledge","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"7f6e424880a5944548f7baea2d2a7632f0d8535691c7889289484adb64844105","category":"Cycling"}
