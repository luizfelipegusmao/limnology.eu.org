{"title":"An ANFIS-Based Strategy for Autonomous Robot Collision-Free Navigation in Dynamic Environments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0439/v1","date":1720083348000,"content":"Autonomous navigation in dynamic environments poses a significant challenge in the field of ro-botics with the primary goals of ensuring both smooth and safe movement. This study introduces control strategy based on an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to enhance au-tonomous robot navigation in dynamic environments, emphasizing on collision-free path plan-ning. This strategy employs, a path planning technique to develop a trajectory that allows the ro-bot to navigate smoothly while avoiding collisions with both static and dynamic obstacles. The developed control system incorporates four ANFIS controllers: two are tasked with guiding the robot toward its end point, and the other two are activated for obstacle avoidance. The experi-mental setup conducted in CoppeliaSim involves a mobile robot equipped with ultrasonic sensors navigating in an environment with static and dynamic obstacles. Simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the model's capability in ensuring collision-free navigation, employing a path planning algorithm to ascertain the shortest route to the target destination. The simulation results highlight the superiority of the ANFIS-based approach over conventional methods, partic-ularly in terms of computational efficiency and navigational smoothness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec30fca463a642f9ac3e6c4b8e72ea200a0b1c0db6b4855185f4ed1460e3736a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
