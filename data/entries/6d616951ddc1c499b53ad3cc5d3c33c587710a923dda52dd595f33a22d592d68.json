However, obtaining a bed in a homeless shelter for patients can be complex. To better understand the challenges of finding a safe discharge plan for homeless patients in the emergency department, our team conducted interviews with emergency department social workers and homeless shelter case managers in the Boston area. We identified and mapped the stages in the processes performed by both parties, identifying challenges with successful placement into a shelter. Furthermore, we assembled a data dictionary of key factors considered when assessing a patientâ€™s fit for a homeless shelter. By identifying bottlenecks and areas of opportunity, this study serves as a first step in enabling homeless individuals to receive the post-discharge assistance they require.","author":"Elle R.
