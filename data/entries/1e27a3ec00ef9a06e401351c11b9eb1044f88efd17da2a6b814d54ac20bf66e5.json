{"title":"Optimization of Functionally Graded Cylindrical Shells for Maximal Eigen-Frequencies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1741/v1","date":1721662358000,"content":"Mechanical response of composite structures concerning also natural frequencies is a function of material and geometrical describing plates and shells. In the present paper the optimization of those parameters is demonstrated. It is based on the formulation that uses the key-points (spline functions) and evolutionary algorithms. The numerical solutions dealing with the optimal design of axisymmetric cylindrical shells having variable radius are presented and discussed in details.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e27a3ec00ef9a06e401351c11b9eb1044f88efd17da2a6b814d54ac20bf66e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
