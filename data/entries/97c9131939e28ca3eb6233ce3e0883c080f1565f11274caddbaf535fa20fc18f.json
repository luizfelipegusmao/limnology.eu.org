{"title":"Broadband backscattering by Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus L.) differs when measured from a research vessel vs. a silent uncrewed surface vehicle","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/7/1362/7660037?rss=1","date":1714435200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Broadband frequency-modulated signals are believed to improve acoustic spectral-based target classification. Efficient use of uncrewed surface vehicles (USV) for fisheries science applications, with no possibility for biological sampling, is believed to be facilitated by use of broadband signals with methods for target classification. If the broadband frequency response used to train automated target classifiers are obtained from conventional research vessels (RVs), due to potential vessel avoidance, the swimming angle distribution may be different than for USVs. This may have consequences for target classification if the model is trained with RV data. The aim of this study was to assess whether the frequency response differs between platforms due to avoidance. Broadband acoustic data were collected with a conventional RV and a small USV. The broadband frequency response of Norwegian spring spawning herring obtained with the USV and RV was found to be significantly different for shallow herring layers in the 200Â kHz band. This indicates that broadband frequency response has potential as a tool for real-time monitoring of behaviour reactions to vessels and to provide insight into fish behaviour in general. When using broadband frequency response for target classification, the potential platform-dependent broadband frequency response should be considered.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"97c9131939e28ca3eb6233ce3e0883c080f1565f11274caddbaf535fa20fc18f","category":"Environment"}
