{"title":"Group VII ethylene response factors forming distinct regulatory loops mediate submergence responses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1745/7317528?rss=1","date":1697241600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Group VII ethylene response factors (ERFVIIs), whose stability is oxygen concentration-dependent, play key roles in regulating hypoxia response genes in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) and rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) during submergence. To understand the evolution of flooding tolerance in cereal crops, we evaluated whether <span>Brachypodium distachyon</span> ERFVII genes (<span>BdERFVII</span>s) are related to submergence tolerance. We found that three <span>BdERFVII</span>s, <span>BdERF108</span>, <span>BdERF018</span>, and <span>BdERF961</span>, form a feedback regulatory loop to mediate downstream responses. BdERF108 and BdERF018 activated the expression of <span>BdERF961</span> and <span>PHYTOGLOBIN 1</span> (<span>PGB1</span>), which promoted nitric oxide turnover and preserved ERFVII protein stability. The activation of <span>PGB1</span> was subsequently counteracted by increased BdERF961 accumulation through negative feedback regulation. Interestingly, we found that OsERF67, the orthologue of BdERF961 in rice, activated <span>PHYTOGLOBIN</span> (<span>OsHB2</span>) expression and formed distinct regulatory loops during submergence. Overall, the divergent regulatory mechanisms exhibited by orthologs collectively offer perspectives for the development of submergence-tolerant crops.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"51f6b20214cfd614c017b6d49c6f3c9d9fb8c7c051688bfd63b176505d74696f","category":"Environment"}
