{"title":"Comparative digestive biology between the ponyfishes from the Pranburi River estuary, Thailand","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15653?af=R","date":1705484960000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>We investigated the digestive biology of two prevalent leiognathid species in Pranburi River estuary, Thailand: the decorated ponyfish (<i>Nuchequula gerreoides</i>) and the splendid polyfish (<i>Eubleekeria splendens</i>). A total of 632 samples collected from February to April and September to November 2017 were analysed using morphological and histological approaches. The overall structures were similar between the species: a short mucous-cell-rich oesophagus region, a well-developed gastric gland uniformly present across the stomach's mucosal layer, and three finger-like pyloric caeca between the stomach and intestine. However, there were marked differences in the mouth, gill raker, and intestinal coefficient (IC). <i>N. gerreoides</i> had a relatively longer mouth, smoother gill rakers, and an IC of 1.08 ± 0.01, similar to those of other carnivorous fish. In contrast, the gill raker of <i>E. splendens</i> had more villiform teeth that can filter-feed better, and their IC was 2.16 ± 0.02 (i.e., longer intestine). Although digestive structures were generally similar between the ponyfishes, these differences suggest that <i>N. gerreoides</i> is relatively carnivorous with stronger suction, whereas <i>E. splendens</i> may be an omnivorous or herbivorous filter-feeder.</p>","author":"Tassaporn Kanjanarakha, \nSinlapachai Senarat, \nKitipong Angsujinda, \nGen Kaneko, \nAtsuo lida, \nPahol Kosiyachinda, \nWitchaya Tongtako, \nSupapong Imsonpang, \nJes Kettratad","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"140a6ee64a43c4df7c32302cae278615efc142450c7cfc563ec0349fa9ccf678","category":"Environment"}
