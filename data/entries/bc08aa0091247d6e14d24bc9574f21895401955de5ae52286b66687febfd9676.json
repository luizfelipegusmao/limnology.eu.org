{"title":"Assessment of Hydrometeorological Impacts of Climate Change on Water Bodies in Northern Kazakhstan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1417/v1","date":1718882373000,"content":"This article examines the impact of climate change on the hydrometeorological state of some lakes and reservoirs in the Akmola and North Kazakhstan regions. Time series with values of various climate parameters for the period 1986-2023 are used for the climate analysis; the reliability of the results was assessed using the Fisher criteria. Hydrometric indicators were studied using the ArcGIG program. Using GIS to spatially analyze water climate data, 8-channel satellite images from 1995 to 2023 were used. During the study, it was found that the area of the main lakes has undergone changes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc08aa0091247d6e14d24bc9574f21895401955de5ae52286b66687febfd9676","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
