{"title":"Exploring Machine Learning Models for Lung Cancer Level Classification: A comparative ML Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1407/v1","date":1716295377000,"content":"Abstract\nThis study delved into the application of various machine learning (ML) models for the classification of lung cancer levels. Through meticulous monitoring of parameters such as minimum child weight and learning rate, efforts were made to mitigate overfitting while optimizing model performance. The Deep Neural Network (DNN) emerged as a standout performer, showcasing robust performance across training, validation, and testing stages. Ensemble methods like voting and bagging also demonstrated promising results. However, Support Vector Machine (SVM) models with the Sigmoid kernel faced challenges in achieving satisfactory performance. Overall, the investigation sheds light on the efficacy of different ML models in lung cancer level classification and underscores the importance of parameter tuning to address overfitting concerns.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db38355bb1ff7c050600375ff0e53e4fec1b7ef558f44bff2e6be27deb5b3db0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
