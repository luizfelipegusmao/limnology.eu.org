{"title":"Effective Living Donor Evaluation in a Western Liver Transplantation Program","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1440/v1","date":1718882624000,"content":"BackgroundLiving donor liver transplantation offers comparable long-term results to cadaveric donor transplantation. This study analyzes the selection process of living liver donors at a Western transplant center that utilizes both donation forms. MethodsThis retrospective analysis examined potential living donors, collecting medical data and reasons for refusal, and divided patients by indication and urgency for transplantation. ResultsFrom January 2013 to December 2023, 594 potential living donors were assessed at Jena University Hospital. Of these, 124 living donor transplants were performed. During outpatient evaluation, 357 potential donors were excluded. Subsequently, 238 individuals underwent inpatient assessment, with 100 more being excluded. Main reasons for donor refusal included medical or psychological issues (n=160), disease progression in recipients (n=90), and recipient refusal or donor withdrawal (n=54). The evaluation process showed a trend towards considering more distant relatives and acquaintances as donor candidates with increasing severity of the recipient's disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c41a18ec949b2cfa584f61c5b4102d014a8ab94e8f0101d8f1e23a64deb01e20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
