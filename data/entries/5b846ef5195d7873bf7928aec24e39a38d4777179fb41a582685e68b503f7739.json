{"title":"A Comparative Analysis of Retrofitting Techniques for Seismically Vulnerable Historical Building","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1772/v1","date":1716841401000,"content":"This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of retrofitting techniques aimed at enhancing the seismic resilience of seismically vulnerable historical buildings. Recognizing the dual objectives of structural safety and architectural preservation, this research evaluates and compares several advanced retrofitting methods, including base isolation, strengthening of masonry, steel bracing systems, Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) wrapping, and damping devices. Each technique is critically assessed based on its effectiveness in mitigating seismic risks, its compatibility with historical architectural features, and its applicability to various building types. Base isolation is highlighted for its ability to decouple buildings from ground motion, thereby significantly reducing seismic forces and protecting architectural integrity. Strengthening of masonry through the use of fiber-reinforced polymers and steel elements enhances the ductility and strength of masonry walls, making them more resilient to seismic forces. Steel bracing systems are shown to provide essential lateral support, particularly in timber-framed structures, improving overall stability and reducing deformation during earthquakes. FRP wrapping is identified as a versatile technique that strengthens structural elements without compromising aesthetic value, making it suitable for reinforcing concrete and masonry components. Damping devices, including viscous dampers and tuned mass dampers, are discussed for their ability to dissipate seismic energy and control structural vibrations, offering a minimally invasive solution that preserves historical aesthetics. The study also addresses several challenges and research gaps associated with these retrofitting techniques, such as ensuring architectural compatibility, assessing long-term material performance, optimizing cost-effectiveness, and navigating complex regulatory frameworks. By advancing knowledge in these areas, the research aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in the development of retrofitting solutions. Ultimately, this study contributes to the ongoing efforts to safeguard historical buildings against seismic hazards. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and best practices in structural engineering and architectural conservation, stakeholders can develop sustainable, cost-effective, and culturally sensitive retrofitting strategies that protect valuable cultural heritage for future generations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b846ef5195d7873bf7928aec24e39a38d4777179fb41a582685e68b503f7739","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
