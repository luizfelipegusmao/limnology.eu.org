{"title":"Functional Foods in Preventing Human Blood Platelet Hyperactivity – Mediated Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0294/v1","date":1728022474000,"content":"Abnormal platelet functions are associated with human morbidity and mortality. Maintaining physiological platelet function is critical to hemostasis and preventing platelet-associated diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer metastasis, immune disorders, hypertension, diabetes, sickle cell disease, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, myeloproliferative disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. Platelets become hyperactive in obesity, diabetes, a sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, pollution, and smokers. Platelets, upon activation, can trawl leukocytes and progenitor cells to the vascular injury sites. Platelets also release various pro-inflammatory, anti‐inflammatory, and angiogenic factors and shed microparticles in the circulation. The challenge for therapeutic intervention in these diseases will be identifying factors that preferentially block specific targets involved in platelets' complex contribution to inflammation or tumor progression while leaving their hemostatic function at least partially intact.  Since antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin are not recommended as primary preventives, it is essential to use alternative safe platelet inhibitors. Potent natural antiplatelet factors were investigated, including n-3 fats, polyphenols, and other bioactive compounds. This review describes the anti-platelet bioactive compounds in food that can prevent platelet hyperactivity and thus may prevent several platelet-mediated diseases, including cardiovascular disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd03f1174a6e606ae9ac8a501f34ae82e03ca2ebc13e755287174d44de5bcaa9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
