The current study primarily focuses on the key volatile metabolites in JMD black and oolong teas, and investigates the impact of processing technologies on the aroma quality of JMD tea. However, few studies have explored the suitability of JMD for producing a certain type of tea or the characteristic quality differences among various JMD teas using multivariate statistical analysis methods.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The principal volatile metabolites contributing to the floral quality of JMD tea are linalool, geraniol, indole and phenethyl alcohol. In JMD black tea (BT), the key volatile metabolites include methyl salicylate, geraniol, (<i>E</i>)-β-ocimene and phenethyl alcohol. In JMD oolong tea (OT), the key volatile metabolites include indole, linalyl valerate and phenethyl alcohol. In JMD yellow tea (YT), the key volatile metabolites include methyl salicylate, geraniol and terpinolene. In JMD white tea (WT), the key volatile metabolites include methyl salicylate, geraniol and terpinolene. In JMD green tea (GT), the key volatile metabolites include (<i>E</i>)-β-ocimene, indole and geraniol. Comparative analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that flavonoid biosynthesis is the primary metabolic pathway responsible for the taste differences among various tea types. GT exhibited higher levels of phloretin, dihydromyricetin and galangin. The contents of vitexin, tricetin in YT were relatively higher. The contents of aromadendrin and naringenin in BT were higher, while OT contained higher levels of kaempferol. Additionally, WT showed higher contents of 3-<i>O</i>-acetylpinobanksin and 3,5,7-pinobanksin.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study explained the reasons for the quality differences of different JMD tea and provided a reliable theoretical basis for the adaptability of JMD tea. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Mengting Tang, \nXiansheng Liao, \nMengting Xu, \nJianming Zhang, \nXianshou Wu, \nMingxiu Wei, \nShan Jin, \nYucheng Zheng, \nNaixing Ye","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"578f2f66d1234a346b6579e1ea9a2f795963d195605ba246ed6d523b59eb43ce","category":"Environment"}
