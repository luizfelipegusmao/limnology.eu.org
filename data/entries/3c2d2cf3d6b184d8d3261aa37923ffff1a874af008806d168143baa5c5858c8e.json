{"title":"Effect of Protein (BSA) Content on the Frictional Behaviour of Soft Contact Lenses Using a Dynamic Oscillating Tribometer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0836/v1","date":1712892704000,"content":"Proteins have the ability to adsorb on the surface of materials, such as soft contact lenses (SCLs), and can affect the hydrophobicity, roughness and surface properties of the contact lenses (CLs), which, in turn, can influence the friction between the lenses and the ocular surface. Excessive friction between contact lenses and the ocular surface can lead to discomfort for the wearer and may cause irritation or inflammation of the cornea, better known as corneal ulcers (keratitis). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is often used as a standard protein in biocompatibility testing of materials, including contact lenses. One standard commercial contact lenses was tested under lubricated conditions to access the coefficient of friction (CoF), being the contact lubricated with a tear like fluid (TLF) solution containing six different concentrations of BSA. In all cases, a good linearity of the results of the friction force was verified, so the first friction law can be applied to determine the value of the coefficient of friction. It was found that friction increases with increasing protein concentration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c2d2cf3d6b184d8d3261aa37923ffff1a874af008806d168143baa5c5858c8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
