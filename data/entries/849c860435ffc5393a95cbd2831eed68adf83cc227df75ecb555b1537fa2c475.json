{"title":"From Arctic ponds to the “Northern Great Lakes”: Algae as first responders of climate‐driven regime shifts","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13494?af=R","date":1729597128000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Arctic freshwater ecosystems are on the “frontline” of climate change, but due to a lack of direct long-term monitoring data, indirect approaches, such as algal-based paleolimnology, must be used to reconstruct past limnological conditions. Our understanding of the responses of small- to mid-sized Arctic lakes to climate warming has increased over the last ~30 years. However, until recently, little was known about even the basic limnological conditions of Canada's “Northern Great Lakes,” such as Lake Hazen, Great Bear Lake, and Great Slave Lake. In this summary, we show that a continuum of algal changes, observable in the sedimentary archives of shallow ponds to very large Arctic lakes, signals the crossing of key aquatic thresholds linked to changing ice covers and thermal regimes, declining wind speeds, and other climate-related variables. With recent accelerated warming, even the largest and most resilient Arctic waterbodies are now fundamentally different than they were just a few decades ago. These changes will undoubtedly cascade throughout the food web leading to important changes for local Indigenous populations as well as the global community.</p>","author":"John P.
