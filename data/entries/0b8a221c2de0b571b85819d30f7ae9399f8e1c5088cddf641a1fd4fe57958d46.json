{"title":"Impact of Nanoparticles on Plant Growth, Development and Physiological Processes: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0780/v1","date":1728546757000,"content":"Nanotechnology is being used in agriculture to improve plant nutrition while maintaining soil texture and safeguarding it against microbial illnesses. Examples of such applications include the utilization of nano-fertilizers, nano-pesticides, and nano-herbicides. Nanotechnology plays a crucial role in maintaining soil health, hence promoting the overall well-being of plants. Nanoparticles have been shown to enhance agricultural productivity and output, mitigate the opposing effects of chemical runoff and nutrient loss. Several factors, including concentrations, physiochemical properties, and plant species, influence the impact of nanoparticles on plants. Several nanoparticles have been shown to impact plant physiology, leading to enhanced biomass output and germination rate. Nanoparticles have the ability to alter molecular pathways in plants via their impact on gene expression. The presence of quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, ZnO, Ag, Fe2O3, Se, Au, TiO2, Al2O3, SiO2, and non-metal oxides of nanoparticles is of significant importance in the promotion of plant development and growth. Extensive research has been conducted on the role of NPs in the reduction of growth, inhibition of chlorophyll, and enhancement of photosynthetic efficiency. The main purpose of this study was to offer a comprehensive overview of studies that have examined the impacts, translocation, and interactions of nanoparticles with plants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b8a221c2de0b571b85819d30f7ae9399f8e1c5088cddf641a1fd4fe57958d46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
