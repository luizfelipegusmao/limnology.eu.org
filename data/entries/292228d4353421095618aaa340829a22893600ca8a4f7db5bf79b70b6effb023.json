{"title":"Surface Characteristics of Ti6Al7Nb Alloy after Sandblasting and Anodic Oxidation Process for Biomedical Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1364/v1","date":1713773805000,"content":"Titanium alloys belong to the metal biomaterials that are one of the most widely used in medicine. In recent years, in order to reduce the use of vanadium, Ti6Al4V alloy is increasingly replaced by Ti6Al7Nb alloy. In addition, to ensure the best possible biocompatibility, its surface is subjected to appropriate modifications, for example, anodic oxidation. Despite the extensive use of anodic oxidation of titanium implants in orthopedics, there are few works focused on a detailed analysis of the chemical composition of the surface layers. In addition, the effect of treatments before anodic oxidation on the properties of the produced layer has not been analyzed. Thus, the purpose of this study was to analyze in detail the chemical composition of the passive layer of Ti6Al7Nb alloy obtained by anodic oxidation preceded by sandblasting. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of the analyzed surface affecting biocompatibility were determined. For this purpose, surface observation, wettability and roughness tests, microhardness tests, electrochemical tests and phase composition analysis were carried out. In addition, the preclinical suitability, of the surface modified in this way, was evaluated by cytotoxicity tests.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"292228d4353421095618aaa340829a22893600ca8a4f7db5bf79b70b6effb023","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
