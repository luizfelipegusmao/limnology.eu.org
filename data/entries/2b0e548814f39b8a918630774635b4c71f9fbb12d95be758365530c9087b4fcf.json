{"title":"The Precision Medicine: Advancement and Transformation in Cancer Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2018/v1","date":1719629619000,"content":"In recent years, bioengineered and biotechnological products have gained tremendous attention to identify unique biologic features associated with oncology. To overwhelm the complexity of tumor personalized medicines (PM) or vaccines could be a promising way-out to be considered. Cancer is a heterogeneous disease. This characteristic variability of cancer provides itself to the emergent era of PM i.e., precision oncology. The prime objective of PM is merely to deliver the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. For instance, imatinib was effectively targeted chronic myeloid leukemia. To date, attainment in using PM approaches to cancer treatment have been mixed. The next-generation sequencing (NGS), and the use of several biomarkers (e.g., HER2, BRAF, ALK, etc.), to drive precise cancer treatment through a timely and cost-effective manner. In current review, author summarizes the advancement in the field of PM such as CRISPR-Cas9, NGS, pharmacogenomics, and the benefits of machine learning techniques. The precise communication between healthcare professionals, regulatory bodies, and patients is essential to translate advances in PM into immense benefits for patients with cancer globally.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b0e548814f39b8a918630774635b4c71f9fbb12d95be758365530c9087b4fcf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
