Fish were fed diets containing 0, 1.0, and 3.0 mL kg<sup>−1</sup> cumin for 60 days. At the end of the experiment, the use of cumin oil did not affect growth performances and survival rate after challenge with <i>A. hydrophila</i> (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). However, villi length and goblet cells increased in carp fed with cumin diets. In addition, no pathological findings were observed in the hepatopancreas, gonad, and intestine tissues of carp fed with cumin. Total protein; albumin; aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels; superoxide dismutase; and catalase activity were similar in cumin oil supplemented groups compared with the control. Both male and female fecundity increased with the addition of 1.0 mL kg<sup>−1</sup> cumin, whereas the addition of 3.0 mL kg<sup>−1</sup> cumin caused a slight decrease in fertility. As a result, the use of cumin essential oil at 1 mL kg<sup>−1</sup> concentration can be recommended to improve fish health and increase fertility in carp culture.</p>","author":"Nalan Ozgur Yigit, \nSecil Metin, \nHakan Didinen, \nBerrin Cetinkaya, \nOzlem Ozmen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"ca13502da0dce4be95d31a0e9a34458e1eb31d9e0c04d32de411a8b2e72e398d","category":"Environment"}
