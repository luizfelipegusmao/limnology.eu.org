{"title":"Scale-dependent effects of urbanization on avian diversity in a Neotropical region","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11252-024-01624-z","date":1738368000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Urbanization is a major driver of natural habitat reduction and fragmentation. Yet, reported urban-related impacts on species richness are highly variable among studies, possibly because of differences in spatial grain. To better understand the scale-dependent impacts of urbanization on species richness, we focused here on birds in a tropical region and used a stratified sampling design with multiple spatial grains. We applied an approach that allows dissecting the three underlying components of diversity, as follows: species abundance distribution (SAD - which refers to the distribution of abundances among all species within a sample or ecological community), total abundance (N), and intraspecific aggregation. We observed a contrasting pattern of decreasing species richness and increasing total N with urbanization intensity. This clearly rejects the “more individuals hypothesis” as an underlying driver of bird richness along the urbanization gradient studied. By contrast, changes in SAD were the main underlying component of bird richness decrease with increasing urbanization intensity. Specifically, the dominance of synanthropic species in more urbanized forest patches resulted in reduced richness in those systems, despite higher total N. The effect of SAD on richness along the urbanization gradient was scale-dependent, significantly increasing with sampling effort. Local and regional variables, including tree height and vegetation cover in 1000-meter buffers, were important determinants of bird diversity patterns. Our study presents a case in which small habitat patches of tropical forests within cities present high bird abundance and high bird dominance but reduced species richness. Our results indicate that maintaining parks in a 1000-meter buffer of native vegetation is crucial to safeguarding urban bird diversity and ecosystem functions in tropical cities.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"65234f71c9c64b4c7f4f11002029b3705cef70e1afbeebd6db92c41b573a2b81","category":"Environment"}
