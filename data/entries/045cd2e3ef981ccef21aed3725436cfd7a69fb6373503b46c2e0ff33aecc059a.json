{"title":"Influencing factors of stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305954","date":1719237600000,"content":"<p>by Mengjiao Zhao, Yongze Dong, Luchen Chen, Huajuan Shen</p>\r\nBackground <p>Stroke stands as a significant macrovascular complication among individuals with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), often resulting in the primary cause of mortality and disability within this patient demographic. Presently, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the underlying causes of stroke in individuals with T2DM, yet the findings exhibit inconsistencies.</p> Objective <p>This paper aims to consolidate and summarize the available evidence concerning the influential factors contributing to stroke among patients diagnosed with T2DM.</p> Methods <p>We conducted a comprehensive search across multiple databases, including Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web Of Science, Embase, China Biology Medicine (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang and Weipu up to August 2023. Google Scholar was also searched to retrieve gray literature. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Stata software.</p> Results <p>Our analysis encompassed 43 observational studies, exploring factors across sociodemographic, biochemical, complications, and hypoglycemic agent categories. The findings identified several risk factors for stroke in patients with T2DM: age, gender, T2DM duration, hypertension, body-mass index (BMI), smoking, Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), albuminuria, Triglycerides (TG), Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), Coronary heart disease (CHD), Atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetic retinopathy (DR), Peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and carotid plaque. Conversely, exercise, High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), metformin (MET), pioglitazone, and metformin combination therapy emerged as protective factors.</p> Conclusion <p>This study underscores the multitude of influencing factors contributing to stroke in people with T2DM patients, among which the microvascular complications of T2DM play an most important role. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of screening for microvascular complications in patients with T2DM. However, due to limitations arising from the number of articles reviewed, there remain areas where clarity is lacking. Further research efforts are warranted to expand upon and reinforce our current findings.</p>","author":"Mengjiao Zhao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"045cd2e3ef981ccef21aed3725436cfd7a69fb6373503b46c2e0ff33aecc059a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
