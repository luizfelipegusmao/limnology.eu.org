{"title":"Microbiological Aspects and Enzymatic Characterization of Curvularia kusanoi L7: Ascomycete with Great Biomass Degradation Potentialities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2396/v1","date":1727685813000,"content":"The complex structure of the plant cell wall makes it difficult to use the biomass produced by biosynthesis. For this reason, the search for new strains of microorganisms capable of efficiently degrading fiber is a topic of interest. For these reasons, the present study aimed to evaluate both the microbiological and enzymatic characteristics of the fungus Curvularia kusanoi L7strain. For this, its growth in different culture media was evaluated. Wheat straw mineralization was evaluated by gas chromatography assisted by infrared spectroscopy. The production of endo- and exoglucanase, laccase and peroxidase enzymes in submerged solid fermentation of wheat and sugarcane bagasse were characterized. The strain efficiently mineralized raw wheat straw, showing a significant decrease in signals associated with cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in the infrared spectra. High enzyme productions were achieved in submerged solid fermentation of both substrates, highlighting the high production of endoglucanases in sugarcane bagasse (2.87 IU/mL) and laccases in wheat (1.64 IU/mL). It is concluded that C. kusanoi L7 is an ascomycete with a versatile enzyme production that allows it to exhaustively degrade complex fibers such as raw wheat straw and sugar cane bagasse, making it a microorganism with great potential in the bioconversion of plant biomass.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a144cd0655d6f4fa9f9011c27529d7cde37d98ad21213474615728cd08974478","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
