{"title":"Network Security Challenges and Countermeasures for Software-Defined Smart Grids: A Survey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1701/v1","date":1711628315000,"content":"Grid modernization has been ushered in by rising electricity consumption, deteriorating infrastructure, and increasing reliability concerns for electric utilities. New advances, collectively referred to as the smart grid, include modern electronics, technology, telecommunications, and computing capabilities. Smart grid telecommunication frameworks provide two-way communication to support grid operations. Software-defined networking (SDN) has been proposed as a method of monitoring and controlling telecommunication networks, enabling increased smart grid visibility, control, and security. However, being connected to telecommunications infrastructure means that smart grid networks are exposed to cyber-attacks. Attackers may use unauthorized access to intercept messages, inject false data into system measurements, flood communication channels with false data packets, or target centralized controllers to cripple network control. Defense and security techniques against these threats are constantly evolving, necessitating an up-to-date, comprehensive study analyzing cyber attacks and defense methods for smart grid networks. Previous smart grid security surveys do not contain recent techniques and to our knowledge most, if not all, address only one type of attack type and/or one type of defense. This survey considers the latest security techniques, simultaneous multi-pronged cyber attacks and defensutilityes to meet the challenges of the next-generation SDN smart grid research with the goal of identifying future research needs, describing the open security challenges, and exposing both emerging threats and their potential impact on SD-SG deployment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25554524d13c1736057e517b7e2448452dc8e302b9edb0c2d34a0612ecc3c1eb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
