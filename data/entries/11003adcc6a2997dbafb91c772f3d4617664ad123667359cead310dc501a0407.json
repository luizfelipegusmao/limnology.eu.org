Here, we show that a pathogenic <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>S</i>Tm) exploits host polyamines for the functional expression of virulence factors. An <i>S</i>Tm mutant strain lacking principal genes required for polyamine synthesis and transport exhibited impaired infectivity in mice. A polyamine uptake-impaired strain of <i>S</i>Tm was unable to inject effectors of the type 3 secretion system into host cells due to a failure of needle assembly. <i>S</i>Tm infection stimulated host polyamine production by increasing arginase expression. The decline in polyamine levels caused by difluoromethylornithine, which inhibits host polyamine production, attenuated <i>S</i>Tm colonization, whereas polyamine supplementation augmented <i>S</i>Tm pathogenesis. Our work reveals that host polyamines are a key factor promoting <i>S</i>Tm infection, and therefore a promising therapeutic target for bacterial infection.","author":"Tsuyoshi Miki","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"11003adcc6a2997dbafb91c772f3d4617664ad123667359cead310dc501a0407","category":"Environment"}
