{"title":"Farmers&rsquo; Perceptions on Crop Diversification to Enhance the Adaptive Capacity under Climate Change: The Case of Pistachio in French Mediterranean Region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1528/v1","date":1721305904000,"content":"Climate change is an important threat to orchard production at Mediterranean basin. Diversification seems to be implemented at a farm level as an important strategy to face these challenges. This paper aims to analyse farmer’s perceptions on crop diversification as a way to enhance farm’s adaptive capacity in a context of current and future climate changes impacts. Our case study is focused in orchards growers from French department of Vaucluse recently diversifying their activities through pistachio (Pistacia vera L.). We did in-depth semi-structured farmers’ interviews in 2021. The results show that diversification is supposed to enhance 3 main components of farms adaptative capacity: (1) strengthening robustness through improvement of buffering capacities to climate impacts (trough robust and adapted plants), economic uncertainties (by exploring local/niche markets) and labour scarcity (by lowering workforce requirements and mechanization); (2) Learning by experimenting, monitoring and exchanging with pairs and advisors (3) Cope with change related with societal demands and helps to increase personal satisfaction. Finally, promote farm’s diversification can contribute to enhance farm’s adaptive capacity under climate change impacts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"586d9aa518581cf3b4d5760de7ef0148093e9dd7b948ab30992237307d9169cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
