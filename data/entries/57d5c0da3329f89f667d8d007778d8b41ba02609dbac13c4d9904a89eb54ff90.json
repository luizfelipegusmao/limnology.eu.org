{"title":"Limitations and drawbacks of DQE estimation methods applied to electron detectors","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/73/5/405/7631224?rss=1","date":1710720000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The detective quantum efficiency (DQE) is generally accepted as the main figure of merit for the comparison between electron detectors, and most of the time given as a unique number at the Nyquist frequency while it is known to vary with electron dose. It is usually estimated, thanks to a method improved by McMullan in 2009. The purpose of this work is to analyze and to criticize this DQE extraction method on the basis of measurement and model results, and to give recommendations for fair comparison between detectors, wondering if the DQE is the right figure of merit for electron detectors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"57d5c0da3329f89f667d8d007778d8b41ba02609dbac13c4d9904a89eb54ff90","category":"Environment"}
