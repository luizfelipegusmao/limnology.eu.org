{"title":"Judging Rainfall Intensity From Inter-tip Times: Comparing &lsquo;Straight-Through&rsquo; and Syphon-Equipped Tipping-Bucket Rain Gauge Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0697/v1","date":1710392189000,"content":"The inter-tip times (ITTs) of tipping-bucket rain gauges potentially provide the highest-resolution intensity data that can be acquired from this type of gauge. At an intensity of 100 mm h-1, a typical gauge with a sensitivity of 0.2 mm of rainfall would be expected to tip every 7.2 seconds. However, TBRGs are often equipped with syphons, to reduce the dynamic calibration error that results from continued (and unmeasured) inflow to a bucket as it tips. This increases the accuracy of rainfall depth recording, but the time to fill and empty the syphon can reduce the ability of a TBRG to respond to (and for the ITTs to reflect) short-term intensity fluctuations. This ability is already limited by the discretisation arising from the filling and emptying of the buckets themselves. Laboratory tests with controlled water inflow rates were performed using two high-quality TBRGs, one a 'straight-through' design and the other syphon-equipped. These confirmed that at all intensities at which the syphon operates, a regular sequence of fixed-duration ITTs (such as the 7.2 s mentioned above) does not occur. Rather, the ITTs are perturbed by the syphon cycling. The gauges were also co-located in the field, and linked to carefully synchronised event data loggers. Data collected during several rainfall events revealed differences in the ITTs, and again confirm that the ITT sequence of a syphon-equipped TBRG exhibits artefacts related to syphon operation, that are not present in the 'straight-through' data. These artefacts can result in ITT differences of many minutes, depending on the rainfall intensity, and are problematic for the use of ITTs to estimate intensity. Peaks and troughs in the intensity profile also differed between the two gauges. It is recommended that in the application of TBRGs for studies where short-term intensity data are required, 'straight-through' gauges should be used, and syphon-equipped gauges avoided.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f8914b60680a50e262fae833946fc19afff9d6026e74f07aacbd298fe79afc8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
