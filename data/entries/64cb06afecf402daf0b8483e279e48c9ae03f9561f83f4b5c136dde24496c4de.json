{"title":"Current Role of PET CT in Staging and Management of Penile Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0356/v1","date":1720010739000,"content":"Penile cancer (PeCa) is a rare urological malignancy characterized by significant geographic variations in both incidence and mortality rates. Due to its rarity and the consequent lack of randomized trials, current management is based on retrospective studies and small prospective trials. In addition, the diagnostic pathways and treatment strategies exhibit substantial heterogeneity, differing significantly between less developed and well-developed countries. The prognosis of PeCa is determined by the presence and extent of regional lymph node (LN) involvement. Therefore, early detection and treatment of LN metastasis is paramount to ensure better outcomes. In recent decades, the overall survival for PeCa has increased, mainly due to advancements in imaging techniques and risk stratification. We aim to provide an overview of the current role of PET CT imaging in the management of patients with PeCa.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64cb06afecf402daf0b8483e279e48c9ae03f9561f83f4b5c136dde24496c4de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
