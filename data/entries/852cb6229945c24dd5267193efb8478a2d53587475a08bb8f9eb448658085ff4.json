Therefore, it is crucial to realize rapid and accurate <i>B. xylophilus</i> detection. In this work, an accelerated strand exchange amplification method (ASEA) was established to detect <i>B. xylophilus</i> for the first time. By integrating with fast nucleic acid extraction, the whole detection procedure could be finished within 30 min, dramatically shortened the detection time. The ASEA method exhibited high specificity towards <i>B. xylophilus</i> and the detection limit for <i>B. xylophilus</i> plasmid DNA was as low as 1.0 × 10<sup>0</sup> copies/μL. Furthermore, the ASEA approach also exhibited accurate detection for <i>B. xylophilus</i> when applied to actual pinewood samples, meeting the demand of <i>B. xylophilus</i> detection in realistic scenario. We believe the ASEA method has significant potential for <i>B. xylophilus</i> detection, and it will be helpful for controlling forest pest and quarantine regulations.</p>","author":"Xiujuan Wang, \nJiao Chen, \nJinxiu Zhang, \nYake Duan, \nXin Zhang, \nChao Shi, \nYong Li, \nCuiping Ma","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of Applied Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a403b38a3432c20b8a9e38602184acbfc416cca77ff6bdf54b49e3b6eafe9c39","entryHash":"852cb6229945c24dd5267193efb8478a2d53587475a08bb8f9eb448658085ff4","category":"Environment"}
