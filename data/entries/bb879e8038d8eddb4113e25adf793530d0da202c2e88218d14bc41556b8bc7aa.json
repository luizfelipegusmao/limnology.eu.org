{"title":"Container Based Electronic Control Unit Virtualisation: A Paradigm Shift Towards a Centralised Automotive E/E Architecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1515/v1","date":1724217596000,"content":"The past 40 years have seen automotive Electronic Control Units (ECUs) move from being purely mechanical controlled to being primarily digital controlled. While there has been significant improvements in terms of passenger safety and vehicle efficiency including optimised fuel consumption, rising ECU numbers have resulted in increased vehicle weight, greater demands placed on power,more complex hardware and software, ad-hoc methods for updating software, and subsequent rise in costs for both vehicle manufacturer and consumer. To address these issues, the research presented in this paper proposes virtualisation technologies to be applied within automotive Electrical/Electronic (E/E) architecture. To proposed approach is evaluated through a comprehensive study of the CPU and memory resource requirement in order to support container-based ECU automotive functions. This comprehensive performance evaluation reveals that lightweight container virtualisation has the potential to welcome a paradigm shift in the E/E architecture, promoting consolidation and enhancing the architecture through power, weight and cost savings. Container based virtualisation will also enable a robust mechanism to facilitate online dynamic software updates throughout the lifetime of a vehicle.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb879e8038d8eddb4113e25adf793530d0da202c2e88218d14bc41556b8bc7aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
