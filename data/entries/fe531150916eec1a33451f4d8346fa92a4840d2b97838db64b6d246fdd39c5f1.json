{"title":"Polarimeter for Detection of Anisotropy from Reflectance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1816/v1","date":1714275260000,"content":"Polarimetry is used to determine the Stokes parameters of a laser beam. Once all four S0,1,2,3 parameters are determined, the state of polarisation is established. Upon reflection of a laser beam with the defined S polarisation state, the directly measured S parameters can be used to determine the optical properties of the surface, which modified the S-state upon reflection. Here, we demonstrate polarimetry for the determination of surface anisotropies related to birefringence and dichroism from different materials, which have a common feature of linear patterns of different alignments and scales. It is shown that polarimetry in the back-reflected light is complementary to ellipsometry and four-polarisation camera imaging.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe531150916eec1a33451f4d8346fa92a4840d2b97838db64b6d246fdd39c5f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
