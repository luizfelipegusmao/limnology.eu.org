{"title":"Empowering New-Quality Productivity Development through Artificial Intelligence: Impact Mechanisms and Spatial Spillover","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1099/v1","date":1715853775000,"content":"Constructing an innovation system centered on new-quality productivity is key to achieving China's technological independence and high-quality development, especially against the backdrop of rapid advancements in artificial intelligence. This article utilizes provincial panel data from China spanning 2010 to 2022 and applies kernel density estimation and the Moran's I index to study the spatiotemporal evolution of artificial intelligence and new-quality productivity. The findings indicate a clustering trend in the development of both factors across regions. Causal empirical analysis using a two-way fixed-effects model reveals that artificial intelligence positively influences new-quality productivity, with conclusions validated by robustness and endogeneity tests.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1ba2ded16f6c2821080844411bec8ee2cf0ed8c9c1983228f9d10964c6961ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
