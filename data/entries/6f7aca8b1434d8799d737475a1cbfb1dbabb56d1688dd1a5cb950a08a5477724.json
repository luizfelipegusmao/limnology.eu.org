Epitaxially grown thin-film ferroelectrics have modified electronic properties due to interplay of spin, lattice, orbital and charge degrees of freedom. The structural and functional properties of thin-film ferroelectrics such as strain and polarization have been well understood via atomic scale structural characterization techniques such as High Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF)-Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and four-dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D-STEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.771-B1\">1</a>]. However, the phonons, which are the fundamental driving force behind thermal transport, and heat transfer have not been understood in detail yet. The established methods to investigate vibrational modes such as Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, neutron scattering can provide near 1 meV energy resolution, but they fail at providing atomic scale spatial resolution, which can be obtained by using vibrational Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (vib-EELS) technique in STEM, while maintaining energy resolution &lt;10 meV.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6f7aca8b1434d8799d737475a1cbfb1dbabb56d1688dd1a5cb950a08a5477724","category":"Environment"}
