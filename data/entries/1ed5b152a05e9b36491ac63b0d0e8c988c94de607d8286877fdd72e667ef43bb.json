{"title":"Evaluating the Educational Effectiveness of Radar Systems Laboratory Sessions in the Undergraduate Curriculum","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0454/v1","date":1725532919000,"content":"Introductory courses regarding radar technologies are very popular in undergraduate curriculum of many electrical and electronics engineering departments. Hands-on experience is an essential part for understanding the theoretical concepts given in lectures. In most cases, it is not affordable for universities to acquire experimental radar systems, especially those in developing countries. This paper presents a detailed description of a cost-effective easy-to-deploy radar system laboratory sessions and measures the educational effectiveness of the proposed material. The provided radar models can be used in teaching undergraduate students the working principles of frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar systems, as well as assisting graduate students in their research activities. The effectiveness of the laboratory sessions is measured thoroughly via qualitative and quantitative methods based on the proposed learning process and studentsâ€™ success. The results show that the lab sessions have increased the students' understanding of the topics covered within the course, and the students' general perception is positive.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ed5b152a05e9b36491ac63b0d0e8c988c94de607d8286877fdd72e667ef43bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
