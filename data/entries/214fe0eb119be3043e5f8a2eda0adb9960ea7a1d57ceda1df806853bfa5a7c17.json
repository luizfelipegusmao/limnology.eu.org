{"title":"Pioneering Insights: The Intersection of Pesticide Exposure, Genetic Variations, and Health Risks in Southeastern Brazilian Farmers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2592/v1","date":1722431827000,"content":": Brazil is the world leader in pesticide consumption, and its indiscriminate use puts farmers’ health at risk. The CYP2C9 gene stands out for encoding the CYP2C9 enzyme, which metabolizes several endogenous substrates and specific xenobiotics, especially pesticides. Our goal is to study the risk of pesticide use, espe-cially the herbicide glyphosate, in the development of diseases and the association with two CYP2C9 poly-morphisms, in farmers living in the southern region of Espírito Santo state, Brazil. The allelic frequency of CYP2C9*1, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 was determined in blood samples from individuals exposed or not to pesticides using real-time PCR. 304 blood samples were analyzed, dividing CYP2C9 genotypes into three metabolization classes: normal, intermediate, and slow. Our results show that normal metabolizers are more vulnerable to diseases such as blood pressure changes and cardiovascular and kidney problems, while in-termediate metabolizers show an association with attention deficit disorder and miscarriages, suggesting that farmers in the studied region developed symptoms correlated to the CYP2C9 genotype they have. This work is pioneering in associating specific genetic variations and health risks with pesticide exposure, em-phasizing the importance of personalized medicine and stricter regulation of pesticide use for public health and occupational safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"214fe0eb119be3043e5f8a2eda0adb9960ea7a1d57ceda1df806853bfa5a7c17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
