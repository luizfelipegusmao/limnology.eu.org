{"title":"Health-related quality of life among inpatients suffering from Traumatic brain injury in an urban setting in Vietnam","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308372","date":1722952800000,"content":"<p>by Hai Minh Vu, Nam Nhu Duong, Cuong Duy Nguyen, Linh Gia Vu, Hien Thu Nguyen, Tung Hoang Tran</p>\r\nBackground <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally. This study aimed to measure the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of TBI patients in Vietnam and evaluate the associated factors.</p> Methods <p>A longitudinal study was conducted in Thai Binh, Vietnam, from February to September 2020. The EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) and EQ-Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) were used to measure HRQOL. Socio-demographic characteristics, including age, gender, education level, employment status, marital status, and income, as well as clinical characteristics such as injury severity, cause of injury, comorbidities, and functional status, were collected through patient interviews and medical records. Multivariate Tobit regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with HRQOL.</p> Results <p>The study included 212 TBI patients. The mean scores of the VAS and EQ-5D-5L scales were 82.4/100 (SD = 14.49) and 0.9/1.0 (SD = 0.2), respectively, indicating a relatively high HRQOL. However, certain factors significantly impacted HRQOL. Unemployed patients and those with depression or higher injury severity, as measured by the Injury Severity Score (ISS), had notably lower HRQOL scores. Poor sleep quality and severe functional impairments also adversely affected HRQOL, whereas patients discharged for a longer period had slightly better HRQOL scores.</p> Conclusion <p>This study highlights that while HRQOL is relatively high among TBI patients, mental health disorders, injury severity, and functional impairments are key factors negatively impacting their quality of life. High HRQOL was defined by mean scores on the VAS and EQ-5D-5L scales, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. Home-based interventions addressing these issues could improve HRQOL for TBI patients.</p>","author":"Hai Minh Vu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"aa761d97e456315860902dce41dc6f4e07545d1a85022fda8366f23774dfa015","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
