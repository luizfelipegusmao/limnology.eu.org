{"title":"In Vitro Resensitization of Fluoroquinolones and Carbapenems Against Biofilm-Forming and Multidrug-Resistant Salmonella and Shigella spp. Using Riboflavin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0934/v1","date":1710511345000,"content":"Shigella and Salmonella have been implicated in neonatal sepsis, food poisoning, and bacteremia. Their increasing resistance to antibiotics has undermined treatment options, constituting a public health crisis. Also, the scarcity of new antibiotics in the development pipeline compounds multidrug-resistance (MDR). Hence, there is a need to potentiate antibiotics to mitigate resistance. This study leveraged riboflavin to re-sensitize fluoroquinolones and carbapenems against MDR Shigella and Salmonella spp. Disk diffusion, microbroth-dilution, chequerboard, and time-kill assays were used to determine resistance profiles and riboflavin-antibiotic activity. Biofilm-formation and bacterial viability (after riboflavin-antibiotic challenge) was determined with crystal-violet and Macrophage infection assays, respectively. Strains exhibited &amp;gt;80% resistance to fluoroquinolones and carbapenems, with 160–320 µg MIC ranges and 0.5–2 FIC, indicating no synergy. At 40–80 µg riboflavin, there was two-fold reduction in bacterial survival, with meropenem-riboflavin exhibiting significant reduction and FIC of 0.075 indicating high synergistic activity. Biofilm-formation was altered (from strong to weak phenotype) with 40 µg riboflavin-antibiotic treatment. There was a 40–70% reduction in bacterial survival in THP-1 cells treated with meropenem-riboflavin after 3 hours, and complete clearance between 24-48 hpi. Riboflavin potentiated fluoroquinolones and meropenem, leading to modulation of the host immune response for the clearance of the strains.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"86b5266336ebddc9b0e36d02fe798690266191cc1d31b89e586d8d66189c92ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
