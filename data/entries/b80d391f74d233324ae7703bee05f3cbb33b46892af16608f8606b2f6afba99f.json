{"title":"Outcomes of NSTEMI Admissions and Significance of TIMI Score: A Nationwide Analysis Using the National In-Patient Sample","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2132/v1","date":1717145327000,"content":"Background and objectives: Main aim of the study is to analyze the outcomes of NSTEMI admissions and testing the relevance of TIMI as a risk score in a real-world setting. Also looking at any potential social or health care disparities involved with outcomes of NSTEMI admissions. The study also investigates factors associated with mortality in NSTEMI admissions and correlation between in-hospital mortality and heart catheterization. . Materials and Methods: NSTEMI admissions were analyzed using the National Inpatient Sample. TIMI scores were calculated in the admissions and association between all-cause mortality and calculated TIMI score &gt;=2 was analyzed. Difference in outcomes based on heart catheterization was studied in the subgroup with TIMI score &gt;=2. Correlation between time to heart catheterization and all-cause mortality in NSTEMI admissions were analyzed. Results: No significant social or healthcare disparities were noted amongst outcomes for NSTEMI admissions. NSTEMI admissions with a calculated TIMI score &gt;=2 had a statistically significant association with all-cause mortality during the admission. Prevalence of mortality among NSTEMI admissions with calculated TIMI score &gt;2, who did not undergo heart catheterization was higher with statistical significance when compared to admissions that underwent heart catheterization. NSTEMI admissions with a calculated TIMI score &gt;2 who underwent catheterization on or beyond the 4th day of hospitalization had statistically significant association with all-cause mortality during the admission. Age at admission, presence of CKD and CHF were associated with mortality in NSTEMI admissions, with statistical significance.
