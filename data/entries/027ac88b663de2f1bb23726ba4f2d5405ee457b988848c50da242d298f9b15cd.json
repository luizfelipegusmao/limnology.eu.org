However, this efficacy has not been replicated in the context of glioblastoma (GBM). In this study, a PD1CD28 chimeric molecule was introduced into EGFRvⅢ-directed CAR-T cells, generating EGFRvⅢ-P2A-PD1CD28 CAR-T cells. Notably, this modification significantly increased IL-2 secretion and enhanced antigen-dependent activation of CAR-T cells, especially when programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was present <i>in vitro</i>. In addition, the <i>in vivo</i> xenograft experiments revealed that the PD1CD28 chimeric molecule played a pivotal role in reducing recurrence rates, effectively controlling recurrent tumor volume, and ultimately prolonging the survival of mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that EGFRvⅢ-directed CAR-T cells co-expressing the PD1CD28 chimeric molecule have the potential to significantly enhance the treatment efficacy against GBM.","author":"Wanqiong Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"027ac88b663de2f1bb23726ba4f2d5405ee457b988848c50da242d298f9b15cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
