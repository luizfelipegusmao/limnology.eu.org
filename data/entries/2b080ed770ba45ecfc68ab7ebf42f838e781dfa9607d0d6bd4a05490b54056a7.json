However, its respiratory safety profile is not well understood. We compared the continuous infusion of remimazolam with commonly used sedatives, propofol and dexmedetomidine, after regional anesthesia. In this retrospective study, the incidence of apnea (&gt;10 seconds) was assessed in patients who underwent orthopedic surgery under regional anesthesia and received moderate to deep sedation using continuous infusion of remimazolam (group R: 0.1 mg/kg in 2 minutes followed by 0.5 mg/kg/hr). The incidence was compared with that of propofol (group P: 2–3 μg/mL target-controlled infusion) and dexmedetomidine (group D: 1 μg/kg in 10 minutes followed by 0.4–1 μg/kg/hr). Propensity score weighted multivariable logistic regression model was utilized to determine the effects of the sedative agents on the incidence of apnea. A total of 634 (191, 278, and 165 in group R, P, and D) cases were included in the final analysis. The incidence of apnea was 63.9%, 67.3%, and 48.5% in group R, P, and D, respectively. The adjusted odds ratios for apnea were 2.33 (95% CI, 1.50 to 3.61) and 2.50 (95% CI, 1.63 to 3.85) in group R and P, compared to group D. The incidence of apnea in patients receiving moderate to deep sedation using continuous infusion of remimazolam with dosage suggested in the current study was over 60%. Therefore, careful titration and respiratory monitoring is warranted.","author":"Chahyun Oh","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2b080ed770ba45ecfc68ab7ebf42f838e781dfa9607d0d6bd4a05490b54056a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
