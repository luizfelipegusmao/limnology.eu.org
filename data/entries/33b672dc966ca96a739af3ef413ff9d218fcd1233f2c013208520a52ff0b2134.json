{"title":"The Big Bang Was Not the Beginning, but a Repeating Pattern of Expansion and Contraction of Spacetime","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202207.0121/v9","date":1727863099000,"content":"In this paper, I present a possible explanation for accelerated expansion of the universe, and introduce the cosmic scale, size of the universe and cosmic time, age of the universe. The observed expansion of the universe, which relates the stretching of Shrunk space to the new theory, is derived. This model is based on the two principal long-range forces: the gravitational force and the repulsive force generated by shrunk space. They are the two most basic fundamental quantities in the universe that govern cosmic evolution. They may provide the clockwork mechanism that operates our eternal cyclic universe. This model of Space-time and its unique properties of shrinking and stretching enables us to describe a sequence of events from the Big Bang to the Big Crunch.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33b672dc966ca96a739af3ef413ff9d218fcd1233f2c013208520a52ff0b2134","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
