{"title":"Investigating Thresholds for Drought Resistance in Floodplain Forest Tree Species","link":"https://academic.oup.com/forestscience/article/70/4/294/7720251?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Anthropogenic and climatic variables combine to alter river flow regimes worldwide, which can influence shifts in species composition. Exacerbation of drought events in southeastern United States floodplains may have varying impacts on survival and regeneration of high bottomland, low bottomland, and swamp forest species, causing distribution shifts between these forest types. We tested 7-month-old seedlings of the swamp species water tupelo (<span>Nyssa aquatica</span>), Ogeechee tupelo (<span>Nyssa ogeche</span>), and pop ash (<span>Fraxinus caroliniana</span>), and the low bottomland species overcup oak (<span>Quercus lyrata</span>) and water hickory (<span>Carya aquatica</span>) in a controlled experiment with increasing drought treatment. We compared timing to 95% mortality and determined lethal soil moisture thresholds for species. Swamp species were no more vulnerable to mortality under increasing drought than low bottomland hardwood species found in neighboring wet floodplain habitats, suggesting that duration of drought may not be a main driver of compositional shifts between these forests.<strong>Study Implications</strong>: Natural flows of river systems around the world have been altered by humans and a changing climate. Increased intensity of drought events can affect tree species growing adjacent to rivers and influence their ability to reproduce, thus changing the composition of floodplain forests. We tested the drought tolerance of three swamp species accustomed to frequent flooding and two low bottomland hardwood species accustomed to less frequent flooding to see which species might be more affected by drought. We observed no differences between these two groups, suggesting that greater flood tolerance may not imply greater drought intolerance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Forest Science Current Issue","siteHash":"05e2fee9ae6a27cd288c89ae75adf607539d339849a171c4fab1eaa2f11b4162","entryHash":"54a7bcb996b23df53bd604f2c55b81533de50554da318771504f2046f6a25a75","category":"Environment"}
