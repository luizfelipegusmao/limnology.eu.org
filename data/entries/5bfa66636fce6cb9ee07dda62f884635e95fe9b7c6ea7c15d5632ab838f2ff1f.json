{"title":"Optimization of Production Parameters for Impact Strength of 3D-Printed Carbon/Glass Fiber Reinforced Nylon Composite in Critical ZX Printing Orientation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2382/v1","date":1727674763000,"content":"Additive Manufacturing (AM) methods are increasingly beign abopted in the industry as an alternative for mass production. In particular, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology is leading the way in this field. However, the adhesion of layers in products produced using FDM technology is an important issue. These products are particularly vulnerable to forces acting parallel to the layers and specially to impact strength. This study aims to optimize the impact strength against loads acting parallel to the layers (ZX orientation) of PA6, one of the most widely used materials in the industry. This orientation is critical in term of mechanical properties, and the mechanical characteristics are significantly lower compared to other orientation. In this study, filaments containing pure PA6 with 15% short carbon fiber and 30% glass fiber were utilized. Additionally, printing temperature, layer thickness and heat treatment duration were used as independent variables. An L9 orthogonal array was employed in this study, and each experiment was repeated three times to conduct impact strength tests. Characterization, Taguchi optimization, a factor analyses were performed, followed by fracture surface characterization by SEM. As a result, the highest impact strength was achieved with pure PA6 at 8.9 kJ/m2, followed by PA6 GF30 at 8.1 kJ/m2 and the lowest impact strength was obtained with PA6 CF15 at 6.258 kJ/m2. When compared to the literature and manufacturer datasheets, it was concluded that the impact strength values have significantly increased, and the chosen experimental factors and their levels, particularly nozzle temperature, were effective.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5bfa66636fce6cb9ee07dda62f884635e95fe9b7c6ea7c15d5632ab838f2ff1f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
