{"title":"Complex drivers of geomorphic response and habitat formation revealed in multiyear monitoring of Cosumnes River experimental floodplain reconnection","link":"https://journals.plos.org/water/article?id=10.1371/journal.pwat.0000132","date":1713362400000,"content":"<p>by Britne Clifton, Joshua H. Viers</p>\r\n\r\nIn this study, we examine a novel levee breach experiment that reconnected a floodplain along the Cosumnes River, California to determine the decadal impact of removing 250 meters of levee and assess the recruitment of large wood. This is the latest study in an ongoing series of investigations 40 years in the making along the largest river on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada without a major dam. We present the findings of this multi-modal investigation here by first measuring the geomorphic alteration of the floodplain surface to quantify the depletion and accretion of sediment across the excavated site. We then identify and quantify the deposition of large wood. Results indicate initiation of anastomosing channel formation and distinct areas of large wood recruitment supporting a naturally evolving lateral levee. Accretion resulted in more than 25,000 m<sup>3</sup> of sediment deposition within the original excavation site, the development of multiple sand splays, and natural recruitment of native riparian tree species. We conclude by discussing implications following other approaches to floodplain restoration as a Nature-based Solution. In episodic flow regimes, like in Californiaâ€™s Mediterranean-montane hydroclimatic regime, restoring lateral hydrologic connectivity facilitates ecosystem function. Large flood pulse events drive sediment dynamics and geomorphic heterogeneity while enriching biodiversity through biogeochemical fluxes and habitat creation on reconnected floodplains that store floodwaters and reduce peak discharge. These findings support the importance of long-term monitoring efforts of floodplain restoration.","author":"Britne Clifton","siteTitle":"PLOS Water","siteHash":"76ba47a8597c89f4cf217272433133ba8aa6d0dba9c907d21e63f90c34e21e00","entryHash":"c3c71ed1c9a4b472c4e3d70c6aaacc14475aa5e3474a93cdaa0171ca2b71faaf","category":"Environment"}
