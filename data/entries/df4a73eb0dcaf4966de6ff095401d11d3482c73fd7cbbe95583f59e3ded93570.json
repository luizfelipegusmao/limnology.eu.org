{"title":"Evaluation of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Complex Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1345/v1","date":1713533122000,"content":"Complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia (CAH) carries a high probability of cancer. Intraoperative evaluation of endometrial cancer in cases of CAH has not been reliable. The safety and sensitivity of sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling has been validated. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SLN sampling in CAH managed by the da Vinci robotic platform. A total of 113 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of CAH were included in this retrospective cohort study. All underwent a robot assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with 69 patients undergoing SLN sampling. Statistical analysis calculated the probability of cancer, SLN map rate, and surgical complications. Predictors of cancer were evaluated. Forty-seven percent of the entire cohort were diagnosed with endometrial cancer. Median age was 63 years in the SLN cohort (N = 69) and 61 in the No SLN cohort (N = 44) (p= 0.363).Â  Median BMI was 34 Kg/m2 in the SLN cohort and 40 in the No SLN cohort (p= 0.004). Bilateral SLN map was 92.8% and unilateral SLN map rate was 7.2%. There were no grade 3-4 complications in the SLN cohort, and 4 grade 3-4 complications in the No SLN group (p=0.021). A preoperative diagnosis of CAH bordering on or cannot rule out cancer was the only predictor of cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df4a73eb0dcaf4966de6ff095401d11d3482c73fd7cbbe95583f59e3ded93570","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
