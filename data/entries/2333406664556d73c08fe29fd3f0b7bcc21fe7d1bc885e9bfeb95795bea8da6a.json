{"title":"HIV stigma and other barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Georgian people living with HIV/AIDS: A mixed-methods study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003069","date":1711634400000,"content":"<p>by Tamar Zurashvili, Tsira Chakhaia, Elizabeth J. King, Jack DeHovitz, Mamuka Djibuti</p>\r\n\r\nWe conducted a study in Georgia to examine behavioral insights and barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake among people living with HIV (PLWH). Between December 2021-July 2022, we collected quantitative data to evaluate participants’ demographics, COVID-19 knowledge, attitude, perception, and HIV stigma as potential covariates for being vaccinated against COVID-19. We conducted a multivariate analysis to define the factors independently associated with COVID-19 vaccination among PLWH. We collected qualitative data to explore individual experiences of their positive or negative choices, main barriers, HIV stigma, and preferences for receiving vaccination. Of the total 85 participants of the study, 52.9% were vaccinated; 61.2% had concerns with the disclosure of HIV status at the vaccination site. Those who believed they would have a severe form of COVID-19 were more likely to be vaccinated (OR = 23.8; 95% CI: 5.1–111.7). The association stayed significant after adjusting for sex, age, education level, living area, health care providers’ unfriendly attitudes, and their fear of disclosing HIV status at vaccination places. Based on the qualitative study, status disclosure was a significant barrier to receiving care; therefore, PLWH prefer to receive COVID-19 vaccination integrated in HIV services. Conclusions: In this study, around half of the participants were not vaccinated against COVID-19. The main reasons for not being vaccinated included stigma, misleading health beliefs, and low awareness about COVID-19. An integrated service delivery model may improve vaccination uptake among PLWH in Georgia.","author":"Tamar Zurashvili","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"2333406664556d73c08fe29fd3f0b7bcc21fe7d1bc885e9bfeb95795bea8da6a","category":"Environment"}
