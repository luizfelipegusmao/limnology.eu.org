{"title":"Designing Coopetition Networks for SMEs: A Service-Dominant Logic Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2118/v1","date":1724923596000,"content":"Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in the European economy, representing the vast majority of businesses and a significant portion of employment. As the global business environment increasingly embraces digital supply chains, coopetition—collaborative competition—has emerged as a vital strategy for sustaining business growth and competitiveness. Despite its recognized importance, the potential of coopetition to enhance firm performance, particularly within SMEs, remains underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by developing and validating a reference model for coopetition networks specifically tailored for SMEs, utilizing the Service-Dominant framework. The research introduces a comprehensive model that guides the formation, management, and dissolution of coopetition networks throughout their lifecycle. The model is empirically validated within the Portuguese ornamental stone sector, providing insights into its practical applicability. Key findings demonstrate that the implementation of coopetition networks can significantly enhance production efficiency and operational effectiveness within SMEs. The study also highlights the critical role of technology as an enabler of service exchange and institutionalization within coopetition networks, facilitating collaborative interactions and value co-creation. While the study makes substantial contributions to the literature, it also identifies areas for further research, including the exploration of human dynamics within coopetition networks and the long-term sustainability of such networks. The findings offer valuable guidance for SMEs seeking to enhance their competitiveness and operational efficiency in an increasingly digital and interconnected business landscape.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64307b9136dc7dfa572ce354d53647f39a1890d1e32bbfc3929d292c09cabf0a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
