{"title":"Urban Air Pollution and Plant Tolerance: Omics Responses to Ozone, Nitrogen Oxides, and Particulate Matter","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0079/v1","date":1719838973000,"content":"Recent omics technologies have revolutionized the study of molecular plant responses to air pollution, overcoming previous limitations. This review synthesizes the latest advancements in molecular plant responses to major air pollutants, emphasizing ozone (O3), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and particulate matter (PM) research. These pollutants induce stress responses common to other abiotic and biotic stresses, including the activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzymes and hormone signaling pathways. New evidence showed the central role of antioxidant phenolic compound biosynthesis via phenylpropanoids pathway in air pollution stress responses. Transcription factors like WRKY, AP2/ERF, and MYB, which connect hormones signaling to antioxidant biosynthesis, were also affected. To date, research has predominantly focused on laboratory studies analyzing individual pollutants. This review highlights the need for comprehensive field studies and the identification of molecular tolerance traits, which are crucial for the identification of tolerant plant species aimed to the development of sustainable Nature Based Solutions (NBS) to mitigate urban air pollution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7fb1935077ac235384bf41922883ea0717bc2b75ea1802cd39359213f37dd212","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
