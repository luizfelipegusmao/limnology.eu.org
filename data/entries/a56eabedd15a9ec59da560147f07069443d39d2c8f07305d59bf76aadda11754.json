The <span>Liolaemus</span> lizard genus displays impressive species richness with around 290 species widely distributed across southern South America. SÃ¡nchez et al. conducted a comprehensive study on the 5-million-year-old <span>Liolaemus kingii</span> group, which includes 14 species. The research provides new key insights to enhance our understanding of this rapid radiation, including its diversification in space and time and the consequences of hybridization in its morphological evolution and taxonomy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"a56eabedd15a9ec59da560147f07069443d39d2c8f07305d59bf76aadda11754","category":"Environment"}
