{"title":"Global Trends in Disease Burden, Morbidity, and Mortality: Implications of Emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) Technologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1130/v1","date":1726378367000,"content":"The global landscape of health and disease has undergone significant transformations over the past several decades. While infectious diseases once dominated the morbidity and mortality statistics, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have emerged as the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. This shift has profound implications for public health systems, healthcare delivery, and global health policies. This introduction aims to explore the main tendencies of disease burden, morbidity, and mortality in the world, with a special emphasis on NCDs and the Implications of Emerging AI Technologies. By examining the current trends and underlying factors, we can better understand the challenges and opportunities for improving global health outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc24c2783ab91ffceeb4994b8d53bb653fd9dbd7f3825d8489d0ad87e2cbf7a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
