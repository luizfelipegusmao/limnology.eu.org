The objective of this study was to compare hydraulic and gas-exchange traits between these two closely related <span>Salix</span> species with contrasting natural habitats. <span>S. matsudana</span> had lower photosynthesis (<span>A</span><sub>max</sub>), lower stomatal conductance (<span>g</span><sub>s</sub>) and lower stem and leaf hydraulic conductance, but it exhibited higher water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub>), higher hydraulic safety and wider leaf-to-stem vulnerability segmentation as well as narrower, shorter and denser conduits and a lower ratio of leaf area to sapwood area than <span>S. babylonica</span>. These findings suggest that variations in hydraulic vulnerability and gas-exchange traits enable closely related <span>Salix</span> species to adapt to different habitats.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plant Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"532f26bf1ba0f166bd6491390ce5cd237faca477af455cac49d2509f7b38d556","entryHash":"070904c64277604f1d8086f5bedc98fb78cf08ec3e3760a7b644acd808c84a5a","category":"Environment"}
