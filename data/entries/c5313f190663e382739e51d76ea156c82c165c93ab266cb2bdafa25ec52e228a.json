However, its prevalence in Sri Lanka is unknown. Our objective was to study the island-wide prevalence of GERD symptoms in Sri Lanka and its associated factors. A total of 1200 individuals aged 18â€“70 years (male: female 1: 1.16, mean age 42.7 years [SD 14.4 years]). were recruited from all 25 districts of the country, using stratified random sampling. An interviewer-administered, country-validated questionnaire was used to assess the GERD symptom prevalence and associated factors. Weight, height, waist, and hip circumference were measured. Heartburn and/or regurgitation at least once a week, an internationally used criterion for probable GERD was used to diagnose GERD. In this study, GERD symptom prevalence was 25.3% (male 42.1% and female 57.9%). Factors independently associated with GERD were inadequate sleep, snacking at midnight, sleeping within two hours of consuming a meal, skipping breakfast, increased mental stress, and certain medications used such as statins, and antihypertensive medications (p&lt;0.001, univariate and logistic regression analysis). 38.4% of the study population have been using medication for heartburn and regurgitation in the past 3 months and 19.8% were on proton pump inhibitors. To conclude, the prevalence of GERD symptoms in Sri Lanka (25.3%) is higher than its estimated global prevalence of 13.8%. Several meal-related lifestyle habits, mental stress, and the use of some medications are significantly associated with GERD, indicating the importance of lifestyle modification and stress reduction in its management.","author":"Nilanka Wickramasinghe","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"c5313f190663e382739e51d76ea156c82c165c93ab266cb2bdafa25ec52e228a","category":"Environment"}
