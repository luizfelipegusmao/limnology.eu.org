{"title":"Developing a Secure Service Ecosystem to Implement the Intelligent Edge Environment for Smart Cities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1821/v1","date":1721797596000,"content":"In the future, smart cities will provide key services including seamless communication, \nintelligent transport systems, advanced healthcare platforms, urban and infrastructure management, \nand digital services for local and regional government. Therefore, a new service and networking \nparadigm, called the Intelligent Edge Environment, has been specified. and is known as the Intelligent \nEdge Environment. As a key part of this system, a new secure service ecosystem must be developed \nto provide the secure realtime movement of services on different High-Performance Edge Cloud \nSystems. This paper explores these issues by introducing the following mechanisms: the Resource \nAllocation Algorithm, the Resource Allocation Secure Protocol and finally the Secure Service Protocols. \nThese systems were integrated into the Basic Capabilities System Library and a multithreaded FUSE \nclient connected to the Service Management Framework. Docker was used as a migration mechanism. \nA prototype was developed and implemented using a FUSE-Network Memory System in which the \nNetwork Memory Server was migrated as users move around. The result shows that this approach \nwas safe and could be used to develop new applications and services for smart cities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b7a49ee636bfe67c60772fb58b867ee1bf8199e33064330ba2a51f063d84a7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
