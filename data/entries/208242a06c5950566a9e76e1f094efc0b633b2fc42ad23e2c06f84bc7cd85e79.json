{"title":"Analysis of Environmental Projects Financed by Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) in Spain During the Period of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12748?af=R","date":1728545620000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Hundreds of Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) have emerged along the European Union coast trying to dynamize fisheries-dependent areas through an approach based on <i>community-led local development</i> (CLLD) <i>strategies</i>. In this research, we characterized and analyzed environmental projects funded by the FLAGs through the <i>European Maritime and Fisheries Fund</i> in Spain from 2014 to 2020. The <i>Spanish Network of Fisheries Groups</i> database allowed us to locate projects defined as environmental, which were then classified into six areas and different project typologies. Most projects were categorized by FLAGs as environmental but were really linked to tourism development. Moreover, true environmental projects were substantially lower in total cost than statistics showed. These conclusions should lead to a reflection on the role that FLAGs and European fisheries funds should play in environmental care of European coasts.</p>","author":"Lluís Miret‐Pastor, \nPaloma Herrera‐Racionero, \nMiriam Ortuño, \nAgustín Molina‐García","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"208242a06c5950566a9e76e1f094efc0b633b2fc42ad23e2c06f84bc7cd85e79","category":"Environment"}
