{"title":"Quantum Fluid Operation: A Universal Chemical Engineering Building Block, Retiring the Continuous, Stirred Tank Reactor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0266/v1","date":1722912713000,"content":"The familiar stirred tank reactor poses an inherent challenge of variability. Some inflowing chemicals spend too little time in the reactor, and others stay too long, harming the uniformity of the end product. This issue can be addressed by replacing the continuous operation with a flow of individually treated fluid quanta. Ideally one would devise a universal fluid handling apparatus that can be adjusted to take care of all the needed chemical engineering unit operations. Proposing a cylinder shape capsule containing a rotating piston that moves back and forth between the edges of the capsule. The piston is cut through with certain fluid pass ways (holes) which may be shifting between being open, being closed, and anything in between. The combined movement of holes-drilled rotating piston will allow this universal unit to adjust for pumping, mixing and reacting fluid, and fluid components. By lining up the inner sides of the piston holes with fluid impact materials (FIM) the same generic unit can be used for catalytic reactions and for separation challenges. These generic units are linked \"Lego like\" to form a compound process, replacing the familiar continuous operation. The multi-mode piston (MMP) unit is completely specified by a digital representation of the shift position , the rotational position and the open/closed positions of the fluid pass ways. This allows for an efficient imposition of control strategy and for optimized manufacturing.   The resultant digital representation renders the control strategy to become AI friendly, consistent with supervised learning tools for improving  the efficiency of many chemical processes that transform from continuous mode to quantum fluid mode. While appearing promising, the concept is in its preliminary stages and its prospective impact is not yet well determined","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e75480f87f6e16ad12344b4d5736fa552cf40d0a7d6420be7922dd0930198670","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
