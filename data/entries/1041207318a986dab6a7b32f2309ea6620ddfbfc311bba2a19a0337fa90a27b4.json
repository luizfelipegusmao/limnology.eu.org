Data were collected through cross-sectional convenience sampling via a self-administered survey questionnaire from 431 clinical outpatients who revisit the same hospital of metropolitan areas of Punjab, Pakistan. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was carried out for path analysis through AMOS (24.0 V), while statistical measures were analyzed using SPSS (25.0 V). The present study results revealed that patients’ intention optimistically triggered through partial mediation and affirm the direct and indirect association with servicescape. It also revealed that patient-recommended and re-patronage intentions to visit the clinic were statistically substantial and positively influenced by intervening constructs of pleasure feeling and satisfaction. Additionally, it is found that servicescape and pleasure feeling contributed to 30% change in satisfaction. Moreover, pleasure feeling, and satisfaction contributed to 50% change in re-patronage and 31% change in recommendation intention of the patients. The current study findings contribute significantly to servicescape literature from a theatrical perspective and reevaluate the patterns and operations in healthcare. It also helps managers and administrators of private hospitals to make strategies to increase patient satisfaction.","author":"Abdul Rauf","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1041207318a986dab6a7b32f2309ea6620ddfbfc311bba2a19a0337fa90a27b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
