Widely accepted electric double-layer models describe the distribution of ionic species near the interface, but our perception of this has been limited to computational modelling [<a href=\"#ozae044.044-B1\">1</a>] and spectro-electrochemical techniques [<a href=\"#ozae044.044-B2\">2</a>], which can only provide indirect measurements of interfacial atoms and ions. Challenges facing direct analysis and imaging of electrochemical interfaces using microscopy techniques include the need for atomic scale resolving power, chemical detection sensitivity and the difficulties associated with imaging liquids at high vacuum conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"180e8c117028385644328b567ee7606733bc7c0e28b6028bbd37e975456c5140","category":"Environment"}
