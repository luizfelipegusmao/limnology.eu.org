{"title":"MRI texture analysis Machine Learning models to assess graft interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy in patients with transplanted kidneys","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0113/v1","date":1722582468000,"content":"Objective: Interstitial fibrosis / tubular atrophy (IFTA) is a common, irreversible, and progressive form of chronic kidney allograft injury, and it is considered a critical predictor of kidney allograft outcomes. The extent of IFTA is estimated through a graft biopsy, while a non-invasive test is lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of an MRI radiomic-based machine learning (ML) algorithm in estimating the degree of IFTA in a cohort of transplanted patients. Approach: Patients who underwent MRI and renal biopsy within a 6-month interval from 1/1/2012 to 1/3/2021 were included. Stable MRI sequences were selected, and renal parenchyma, renal cortex and medulla were segmented. After image filtering and pre-processing, we computed radiomic features which were subsequently selected through a LASSO algorithm for their highest correlation with the outcome and lowest intercorrelation. Selected features and relevant patients’ clinical data were used to produce ML-algorithms using 70% of the study cases for feature selection, model training and validation with a 10-fold cross-validation, and 30% for model testing. Performances were evaluated using AUC with 95% confidence interval. Main results: 70 coupled tests (63 patients, 35.4% females, mean age 52.2 years) have been included and subdivided into a wider cohort of 50 for training and a smaller cohort of 20 for testing. For IFTA ≥ 25%, AUCs in test cohort were 0.60, 0.59, and 0.54 for radiomic features only, clinical variables only, and combined radiomic-clinical model, respectively. For IFTA ≥ 50%, AUCs in training cohort were 0.89, 0.84, 0.96, and in test cohort were 0.82, 0.83, and 0.86, for radiomic features only, clinical variables only, and combined radiomic-clinical model, respectively. Significance: An ML-based MRI radiomic algorithm showed promising discrimination capacity for IFTA&gt;50%, especially when combined with clinical variables. These results need to be confirmed in larger cohorts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2a134c65a744469a71ea6ef9672bee8d50edd67b3cf5eaac099274d3b8f2216","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
