{"title":"Entropy Analysis of FPGA Interconnect and Switch Matrices for Physical Unclonable Functions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1719/v1","date":1716807753000,"content":"Random variations in microelectronic circuit structures represent the source of entropy for physical unclonable functions (PUFs). In this paper, we investigate delay variations that occur through the routing network and switch matrices of a field programmable gate array (FPGA). The delay variations are isolated from other components of the programmable logic, e.g., Look-up tables (LUTs), flip-flops (FFs), etc. using a feature of Xilinx FPGAs called dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR). A set of partial designs are created that fix the placement of a time-to-digital converter (TDC) and supporting infrastructure to enable the path delays through the target interconnect and switch matrices to be extracted by subtracting out common-mode delay components. Delay variations are analyzed in the different levels of routing resources available within FPGAs, i.e., local routing and across chip routing. Data is collected from a set of Xilinx Zynq 7010 devices, and a statistical analysis of within-die variations in delay through a set of the randomly-generated and hand-crafted interconnects is presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d98db161249b83bee748d9da3a6101b6327139000461158669eea311c4f30b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
