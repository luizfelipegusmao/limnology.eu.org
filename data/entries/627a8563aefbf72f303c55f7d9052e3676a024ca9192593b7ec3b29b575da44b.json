Existing information on those for greater weever inhabiting the eastern North Sea is based on the analysis of whole otoliths. Here, we present a reanalysis using sectioned otoliths. The results reveal a different growth pattern and a higher maximum age than that previously reported. The higher maximum age makes greater weever populations more vulnerable to exploitation. Such information can serve as a basis for the estimation of the growth curve that can be used for future assessment of the species.</p>","author":"Monica Mion, \nAlessandro Orio, \nJohan LÃ¶vgren, \nFrancesca Vitale, \nMassimiliano Cardinale","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"627a8563aefbf72f303c55f7d9052e3676a024ca9192593b7ec3b29b575da44b","category":"Environment"}
