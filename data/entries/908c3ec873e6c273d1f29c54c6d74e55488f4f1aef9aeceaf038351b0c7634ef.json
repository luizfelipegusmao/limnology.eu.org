{"title":"Approaching the Conformal Limit of Quark Matter with Different Chemical Potentials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0177/v1","date":1714721517000,"content":"We study in detail the influence of different chemical potentials (baryon, charged, strange, and neutrino) on how and how fast a free gas of quarks in the zero-temperature limit reaches the conformal limit. We discuss the influence of non-zero masses, the inclusion of leptons, and different constraints, such as charge neutrality, zero-net strangeness, and fixed lepton fraction. We also investigate for the first time how the symmetry energy of the system under some of these conditions approaches the conformal limit. Finally, we briefly discuss what kind of corrections are expected from perturbative QCD as one goes away from the conformal limit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"908c3ec873e6c273d1f29c54c6d74e55488f4f1aef9aeceaf038351b0c7634ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
