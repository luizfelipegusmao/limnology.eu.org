{"title":"Cumulative and Yield-Scaled Greenhouse Gas Emissions Under Different Organic and Inorganic Soil Fertilization in Central Kenya","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0079/v1","date":1727790064000,"content":"Demand for livestock products in East Africa is anticipated to triple by 2050. Therefore, sustainable intensification of livestock production systems for increased productivity is necessary in line with minimal negative environmental consequences. An agronomic field experiment was set up at the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya, and the effects of organic and inorganic soil amendments on greenhouse gas emissions (particularly N2O) from a Humic Nitisol planted with Brachiaria brizantha cv. xaraes were evaluated between October 2018 and August 2019. The treatments comprised mineral NPK fertilizer, Lablab intercrop, FYM, FYM-BC, Bioslurry, and control. Fertilizer treatments were applied at a rate of 45 kg N ha-1 following each harvest. GHG emissions were measured using the static vented chamber technique. Treatment and season significantly influenced daily N2O emissions. The lowest (4.51±3.30 µg N m-2 h-1) and highest (27.16±3.61 µg N m-2 h-1) mean N2O emissions were recorded under NPK and Control treatments during the short rains and dry seasons, respectively. Cumulative N2O emissions and the corresponding yield-scaled emissions were similar across all the treatments but varied significantly (p &lt; 0.001) between the wet and dry seasons. Cumulative N2O emissions were 0.31±1.49, 0.33±1.47, 0.33±1.74, and 0.37±1.74, 0.38±2.3 and 0.42±1.81 Kg N ha-1 under FYM-BC, Lablab, NPK fertilizer, and FYM, Bioslurry and control treatments respectively. The corresponding yield-scaled emissions were also higher during the wet (0.23±1.16 g N kg-1 DM) than in the dry seasons (0.16±0.50 g N kg-1 DM). Higher (-21.86±4.47 mg CH4-Ch-1) CH4 uptake was recorded under the control treatment whereas the lowest (-2.69±17.97 mg CH4-Ch-1) uptake was recorded under Bioslurry (P &lt; 0.01). Treatment and season exhibited individual effects on daily CO2 emissions (P &lt; 0.001), with a significant interaction effect (P &lt; 0.001). The highest (157.5±28.76 mg CO2-C m-2h-1) and lowest (44.33±8.37 mg CO2-C m-2h-1) CO2 emissions were recorded under Control and FYM treatments during the October 2018-January 2019 and January-March 2019 HD. Since the experiment was newly established via ploughing a field which had been used as a permanent pasture during previous years, did not expect considerable yield differences between treatments. Yet, it is interesting to see first effects of fertilizer amendments, pointing to their potential as climate-smart forage intensification strategies. The study established that Manure + biochar is a better strategy for forage soil amendments in mitigating soil N2O emissions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4024989bde1cd362f1e4430a748d2bd54c4b3ab630631b0b4292ffabb9ad2ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
