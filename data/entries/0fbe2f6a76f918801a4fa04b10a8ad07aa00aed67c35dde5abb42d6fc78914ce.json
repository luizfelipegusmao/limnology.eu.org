{"title":"IntAct: A nondisruptive internal tagging strategy to study the organization and function of actin isoforms","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002551","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by Maxime C. van Zwam, Anubhav Dhar, Willem Bosman, Wendy van Straaten, Suzanne Weijers, Emiel Seta, Ben Joosten, Jeffrey van Haren, Saravanan Palani, Koen van den Dries</p>\r\n\r\nMammals have 6 highly conserved actin isoforms with nonredundant biological functions. The molecular basis of isoform specificity, however, remains elusive due to a lack of tools. Here, we describe the development of IntAct, an internal tagging strategy to study actin isoforms in fixed and living cells. We identified a residue pair in β-actin that permits tag integration and used knock-in cell lines to demonstrate that IntAct β-actin expression and filament incorporation is indistinguishable from wild type. Furthermore, IntAct β-actin remains associated with common actin-binding proteins (ABPs) and can be targeted in living cells. We demonstrate the usability of IntAct for actin isoform investigations by showing that actin isoform-specific distribution is maintained in human cells. Lastly, we observed a variant-dependent incorporation of tagged actin variants into yeast actin patches, cables, and cytokinetic rings demonstrating cross species applicability. Together, our data indicate that IntAct is a versatile tool to study actin isoform localization, dynamics, and molecular interactions.","author":"Maxime C. van Zwam","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"0fbe2f6a76f918801a4fa04b10a8ad07aa00aed67c35dde5abb42d6fc78914ce","category":"Environment"}
