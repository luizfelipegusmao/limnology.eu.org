However, the comprehensive impacts of MNPs on soil health have not yet been explored. We conducted a hierarchical meta-analysis of over 5000 observations from 228 articles to assess the broad impacts of MNPs on soil health parameters (represented by 20 indicators relevant to crop growth, animal health, greenhouse gas emissions, microbial diversity, and pollutant transfer) and whether the impacts depended on MNP properties. We found that MNP exposure significantly inhibited crop biomass and germination, and reduced earthworm growth and survival rate. Under MNP exposure, the emissions of soil greenhouse gases (CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and CH<sub>4</sub>) were significantly increased. MNP exposure caused a decrease in soil bacteria diversity. Importantly, the magnitude of impact of the soil-based parameters was dependent on MNP dose and size; however, there is no significant difference in MNP type (biodegradable and conventional MNPs). Moreover, MNPs significantly reduced As uptake by plants, but promoted plant Cd accumulation. Using an analytical hierarchy process, we quantified the negative impacts of MNP exposure on soil health as a mean value of −10.2% (−17.5% to −2.57%). Overall, this analysis provides new insights for assessing potential risks of MNP pollution to soil ecosystem functions.</p>","author":"Li Chen, \nTianyi Qiu, \nFengyu Huang, \nYi Zeng, \nYongxing Cui, \nJing Chen, \nJason C.
