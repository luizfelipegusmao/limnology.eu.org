{"title":"Elevated hydrostatic pressure disturbs expression of growth factors in human renal epithelial cells","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310001","date":1725631200000,"content":"<p>by Chen Yan, Jie Xiao, Yong-Hua Peng, Tao-Sheng Li</p>\r\n\r\nObstructive uropathy is a common kidney disease caused by elevated hydrostatic pressure (HP), but relevant molecular and cellular mechanisms have not yet been well understood. In this study, we <i>ex vivo</i> investigated the effects of elevated HP on human renal epithelial cells (HREpCs). Primary HREpCs were subjected to 100 cmH<sub>2</sub>O HP for 8 or 48 h. Then, the cells were cultured without HP stimulation for another 24 h or 72 h. Cell morphology showed almost no change after 8h HP treatment, but exhibited reversible elongation after 48h HP treatment. HP treatment for 8 h increased the expression of <i>TGFB1</i> and <i>VEGFA</i> but decreased the expression of <i>CSF2</i> and <i>TGFB2</i>. On the other hand, HP treatment for 48 h downregulated the expression of <i>CSF2</i>, <i>TGFB2</i>, <i>PDGFB</i>, <i>VEGFA</i>, and <i>VEGFB</i>, while upregulated the expression of <i>TGFB3</i>. Interestingly, all changes induced by 48 h HP treatment were detected more severe compared to 8 h HP treatment. In conclusion, elongated <i>ex vivo</i> HP loading to renal epithelial cells induces reversible changes on cell morphology and disturbs the expression of several growth factors, which provides novel mechanistic insight on elevated HP-caused kidney injury such as obstructive uropathy.","author":"Chen Yan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4b1051a5de691e597ff02ad1a5e32f4005ae84dcc174da0eb1341c47838ff25f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
