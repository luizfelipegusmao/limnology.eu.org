{"title":"The Role of the Manganese Content on the Properties of Mn3O4 and Reduced Graphene Oxide Nanocomposites for Supercapacitor Electrodes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1586/v1","date":1721377223000,"content":"Increasing the energy density and power of supercapacitors through hybrids of carbonaceous materials and metal oxides continues to be the subject of numerous research works. The correlation between specific capacitance and the properties of materials used as electrodes attracts great interest. In the present study, we have investigated composites (GO/Mn3O4) prepared by hydrothermal method with variable ratio GO/Mn3O4 and tested as supercapacitor electrode materials in three and two-electrode cells. The chemical characterization carried out by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and the adsorption techniques used have allowed the determination of the surface carbon and oxygen content, as well as its textural properties. In this work we have analyzed the contribution of the double layer and of the Faradaic reactions to the value of the final supercapacitance of the synthesized materials. Beyond empirically obtaining the electrochemical properties, these have been related to the physicochemical characteristics of the hybrids, to help design materials with the best performances for supercapacitor electrodes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3043f41a9e147475be1badc3d262cf1f622ef866324de6784edf3646e2bcfb32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
