These challenges are acute in watersheds like the Citarum River in West Java, Indonesia, which suffers from severe pollution due to inadequate waste management infrastructure, and is worsened by rapid urbanisation and a changing climate, which further degrades the river ecosystem and threatens lives and livelihoods. Developing a unified approach to addressing these complex problems, and responding to real world social, governance, and biophysical conditions through integrated water management, is difficult to achieve in practice. Responding to this challenge, living labs have emerged as a mode of transdisciplinary research and implementation that incorporates the expertise of diverse stakeholders in real-world settings to learn and develop solutions to complex challenges, like those faced in the Citarum River. While living lab approaches have been used widely in Western cities, there is little research that investigates its usefulness in informal peri-urban settlements. This paper presents a case study of the Citarum Living Lab, a live action research program that aims to co-develop, test, and learn from socio-technical experiments in real-world settings in collaboration with an interdisciplinary international research consortium, government, NGOs, businesses, community leaders, and residents. With the ultimate aim of revitalising the Citarum river and its surrounding environments and communities, the program engages with community experiences, existing institutional frameworks, and changing environmental conditions. This paper identifies the conditions and factors that enable and constrain a living lab approach in a vulnerable peri-urban watershed from the perspective of the research team by employing a reflexive participatory action research methodology. Place-based, transdisciplinary responses to planetary health imperatives in this context require navigation of complex, multi-level governance contexts and novel resourcing models to support applied research, implementation, and learning.","author":"Paris Hadfield","siteTitle":"PLOS Water","siteHash":"76ba47a8597c89f4cf217272433133ba8aa6d0dba9c907d21e63f90c34e21e00","entryHash":"97115080c76b2d08d03647e4d728a5b03d27ecb96668bb9dde8ad01fd1008d03","category":"Environment"}
