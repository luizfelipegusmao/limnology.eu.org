Over the past few decades, significant advancements have been made in understanding many features of bud dormancy, particularly in model species, where certain molecular mechanisms underlying this process have been elucidated. We provide an overview of recent molecular progress in understanding bud dormancy in trees, with a specific emphasis on the integration of common signaling and molecular mechanisms identified across different tree species. Additionally, we address some challenges that have emerged from our current understanding of bud dormancy and offer insights for future studies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"bbda7591480ee56e88f1226f801bbbb448eb0d4c241d50a7040a5961ec6c48c3","category":"Environment"}
