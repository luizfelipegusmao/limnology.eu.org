Advances in nanoscale imaging have shed light on chromatinâ€™s organization into packing domains (PD) with radii ranging from about 50nm to 200nm [<a href=\"#ozae044.361-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.361-B4\">4</a>], providing crucial insights into the 3D architecture of chromatin. Among various imaging techniques, electron tomography stands out for its unrivaled resolution in 3D [<a href=\"#ozae044.361-B5\">5</a>]. Combined with ChromEM staining [<a href=\"#ozae044.361-B6\">6</a>], a technique that applies Click-EM labeling with the photo-activation of DNA intercalating dye DRAQ5 to double-stranded DNA, electron tomography allowed an unprecedented visualization of chromatin structure. However, the method remained low throughput and is not suitable for multiple cell studies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"73fd5eee169a7fdf3873ab8cb8ca9890f53b1495d5a0bbffc37a4b3e0386efe6","category":"Environment"}
