{"title":"Effects of High-Speed vs. Low-Speed Resistance Training on Neuromuscular and Functional Capacities in Institutionalized Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0762/v1","date":1720524764000,"content":"Objectives: To compare the effects of high-velocity resistance training to slow-velocity re-sistance training on neuromuscular and functional parameters and to analyze the relationship between changes in walking speed and improvements in neuromuscular parameters following intervetions. Methods: 40 participants were randomly assigned to either a high-speed resistance training group (GHS, n = 18; age = 80.41 ± 10.12 years; BMI = 23.81 ± 3.45 kg/m²) or a low-speed resistance training group (GLS, n = 22; age = 82.89 ± 5.32 years; BMI = 23.81 ± 3.45 kg/m²). Before and after the interventions, gait speed (m/s) was assessed using a 10-minute walking test, and relative maximal force (Relative F max, N/kg) was evaluated during maximal voluntary isometric con-traction of the plantar flexors. From the force-time curve, early (0 – 50 ms) and late (100 – 200 ms) rates of force development (RFD) were extracted from the linear slopes (Δ force / Δ time). Results: Gait speed significantly improved in both groups (p &lt; 0.05). However, the improvement was more pronounced in the GHS compared to the GLS (p &lt; 0.05). Relative Fmax showed a more significant increase in the GLS than in the GHS (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, a significant 10% increase in early RFD in the GLS and a 20.1% increase in the GHS were observed (p &lt; 0.05). The improvement in early RFD was greater in the GHS (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, late RFD improved significantly only in the GHS (+20.4%, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: High-velocity resistance training appears particularly effective in improving the ability to rapidly generate force, which is essential for many daily activities re-quiring explosive movements and quick responses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37334caa062767ba03bc6c74bcc787f364ee033fe378e954a15a6781c20b793f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
