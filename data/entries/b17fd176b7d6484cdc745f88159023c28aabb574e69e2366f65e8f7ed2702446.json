{"title":"Effect of Micro-cracks on Chloride Ion Diffusion in Concrete Based on Stochastic Aggregate Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0775/v1","date":1712824960000,"content":"For concrete structures exposed to offshore areas, chloride ion erosion is one of the main factors affecting the durability. It is crucial to evaluate chloride ion permeability resistance of concrete structures. In this article, a finite element simulation of the chloride ion diffusion process in concrete is conducted. A mass diffusion finite element model based on random aggregate approach is established to investigate the influence of aggregate, interface transition zone, and micro-cracks on chloride ion diffusion coefficients in concrete. The results show that the mass diffusion finite element analysis based on the exponential function model and power function model can effectively simulate the chloride ion diffusion process in concrete. In addition, the data reveal that coarse aggregate is the most important factor affecting chloride ion diffusivity in concrete. However, the interface transition zone significantly accelerates chloride ion diffusion in concrete. Moreover, this acceleration effect exceeds the barrier effect of aggregate.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b17fd176b7d6484cdc745f88159023c28aabb574e69e2366f65e8f7ed2702446","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
