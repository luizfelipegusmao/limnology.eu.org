{"title":"Yellow leaf green tea modulates the AMPK/ACC/SREBP1c signaling pathway and gut microbiota in high‐fat diet‐induced mice to alleviate obesity","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13413?af=R","date":1709813520000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Yellow leaf green tea (YLGT) is a new variety of <i>Camellia sinensis</i> (L.) O. Ktze, which has yellow leaves and the unique qualities of ‘three green through three yellow’. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-obesity effect of YLGT in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and to explore the potential mechanisms by regulating the AMPK/ACC/SREBP1c signaling pathways and gut microbiota.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that YLGT aqueous extract reduced body weight, hepatic inflammation, fat accumulation and hyperlipidemia in HFD-induced C57BL/6J mice, and also accelerated energy metabolism, reduced fat synthesis and suppressed obesity by activating the AMPK/CPT-1α signaling pathway and inhibiting the FAS/ACC/SREBP-1c signaling pathway. Fecal microbiota transplantation experiment further confirmed that the alteration of gut microbiota (e.g. increasing <i>unclassified_Muribaculaceae</i> and decreasing <i>Colidextribacter</i>) might be an important cause of YLGT water extract inhibiting obesity.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, YLGT has a broad application prospect in the treatment of obesity and the development of anti-obesity function beverages. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Baoming Tian, \nYizhu Pan, \nXue Zhou, \nYuezhi Jiang, \nXiangchun Zhang, \nXudong Luo, \nKai Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"c881a94fe0280d9702d2f162c515c6b120c8d0835a773877cf81c28e61afaf31","category":"Environment"}
