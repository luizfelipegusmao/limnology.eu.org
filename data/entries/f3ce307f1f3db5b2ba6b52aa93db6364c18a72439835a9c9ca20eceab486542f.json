{"title":"Evaluation of maize varieties via multivariate analysis: Roles of ionome, antioxidants, and autophagy in salt tolerance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/195/7691843?rss=1","date":1718150400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Salt stress presents a major obstacle to maize (<span>Zea mays</span> L.) production globally, impeding its growth and development. In this study, we aimed to identify salt-tolerant maize varieties through evaluation using multivariate analysis and shed light on the role of ionome, antioxidant capacity, and autophagy in salt tolerance. We investigated multiple growth indices, including shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, plant height, chlorophyll content, electrolyte leakage, potassium and sodium contents, and potassium-to-sodium ratio, in 20 maize varieties at the V3 stage under salt stress (200 m<span>m</span> NaCl). The results showed significant differences in the growth indices, accompanied by a wide range in their coefficient of variation, suggesting their suitability for screening salt tolerance. Based on <span>D</span> values, clustering analysis categorized the 20 varieties into 4 distinct groups. TG88, KN20, and LR888 (group I) emerged as the most salt-tolerant varieties, while YD9, XD903, and LH151 (group IV) were identified as the most sensitive. TG88 showcased nutrient preservation and redistribution under salt stress, surpassing YD9. It maintained nitrogen and iron levels in roots, while YD9 experienced decreases. TG88 redistributed more nitrogen, zinc, and potassium to its leaves, outperforming YD9. TG88 preserved sulfur levels in both roots and leaves, unlike YD9. Additionally, TG88 demonstrated higher enzymatic antioxidant capacity (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) at both the enzyme and gene expression levels, upregulation of autophagy-related (<span>ATG</span>) genes (<span>ZmATG6</span>, <span>ZmATG8a</span>, and <span>ZmATG10</span>), and increased autophagic activity. Overall, this study offers insights into accurate maize varieties evaluation methods and the physiological mechanisms underlying salt tolerance and identifies promising materials for further research.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"f3ce307f1f3db5b2ba6b52aa93db6364c18a72439835a9c9ca20eceab486542f","category":"Environment"}
