{"title":"PSVIII-9 Effects of growth implants and timing of vaccination on calf immunity and growth performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/584/7757813?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study assessed calf growth performance and blood parameters of beef calves under different growth implants and timing of vaccination protocols. Crossbreed beef calves (n = 59) were stratified by birth body weight (BW) and age (41 ± 5.2 kg of BW and 70 ± 8 d of age) and randomly assigned in a split-plot design with implant strategy as the main plot and timing of vaccination as the subplot. The main plot (treatment) consisted of 3 implant strategies: 1) Synovex C (SC; n = 20; 100 mg progesterone/10 mg estradiol benzoate, or 2) Synovex One Grower (SG; n = 19; 150 mg trenbolone acetate and 21 mg estradiol benzoate; or 3) no implant (CON; n = 20). Subplot treatments were the timing of vaccination booster against bovine respiratory disease pathogens on 1) weaning (WV; n = 29) or 2) 7-d post-weaning (PWV; n = 30). Cow-calf pairs were treated alike in a single pasture during the pre-weaning phase, receiving the same vaccine (Bovi-Shield Gold One Shot and Ultrabac 7) on d 0 (implantation day) and booster time (WV or PWV). After weaning (approximately 187 d of age), calves were allocated in a single pen receiving ad libitum hay until d 60 post-weaning. Body weight and blood were collected on d 0, weaning, d 0 and 28 relative to vaccination booster, and d 60 post-weaning. Blood was collected to determine insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), cortisol, and leptin concentrations and to perform a complete blood cell count. WV calves had decreased cortisol concentrations on booster day and 28 d post-vaccine (<span>P</span> = 0.01). Regardless of implant treatment, calves tended to have decreased IGF-1 concentrations 28-d post-vaccine booster (<span>P</span> = 0.09). An effect of treatment (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) was detected for lymphocyte counts, with CON having greater concentrations vs. SG and SC calves. A treatment × timing of vaccination (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) interaction was detected for monocyte counts, where SG-PWV calves had the greatest concentrations. A treatment effect (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.02) was observed for eosinophil percentage, where SG had reduced percentages than CON, while SC was intermediate. An effect of treatment was detected for leptin (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), with SG calves having the least, CON being intermediate, and SC the greatest concentrations. From d 0 to 60 d post-weaning, SG tended to have greater ADG (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.07) compared with CON, while SC was intermediate. On d 28 and d 35 post-weaning, calves implanted with SG were heavier (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.04) than the CON but not than SC. In summary, this study demonstrates that growth implants and timing of vaccination significantly affect both physiological parameters and growth performance in beef calves. Implanting calves with Synovex One Grower resulted in improved growth performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"8fd89f288d604bfccffc24c08dc93eab34670a8cb2e770720ac0356a7c8b9f04","category":"Environment"}
