{"title":"Environmental Sustainability in Zambia: Where Are We?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2422/v1","date":1722327553000,"content":"Global environmental sustainability is a crucial issue, and Zambia, like many other countries, has particular potential and challenges in this regard. Environmental sustainability has been and is today a priority on the global development agenda due to serious issues emerging from extensive interference with human-related activities. Maintaining environmental sustainability is essential for preserving the nation's natural resources, fostering economic growth, and guaranteeing the welfare of its citizens. Even if there are many significant challenges, coordinated initiatives incorporating international cooperation, sustainable practices, and community engagement can open the door to a more sustainable future. While the ongoing discussion about environmental sustainability takes very diverse forms and concentrate on various aspects of the problem, this paper aims to discuss climate change, habitat and biodiversity, land degradation and agricultural constraints in the Zambian context. Using desktop approach, the paper will utilize reports, academic journals and policy documents in an attempt to define a common starting point from which to gain an understanding of the magnitude of the issue.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"edd44d116779bd7584349ad7f9f97a068e01564e0d9989f16dbfacb4cc7f7873","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
