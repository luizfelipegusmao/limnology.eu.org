{"title":"Variation in leaf dark respiration among C3 and C4 grasses is associated with use of different substrates","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1475/7603018?rss=1","date":1707264000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Measurements of respiratory properties have often been made at a single time point either during daytime using dark-adapted leaves or during nighttime. The influence of the day–night cycle on respiratory metabolism has received less attention but is crucial to understand photosynthesis and photorespiration. Here, we examined how CO<sub>2</sub>- and O<sub>2</sub>-based rates of leaf dark respiration (<span>R</span><sub>dark</sub>) differed between midday (after 30-min dark adaptation) and midnight in 8 C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> grasses. We used these data to calculate the respiratory quotient (RQ; ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> release to O<sub>2</sub> uptake), and assessed relationships between <span>R</span><sub>dark</sub> and leaf metabolome. <span>R</span><sub>dark</sub> was higher at midday than midnight, especially in C<sub>4</sub> species. The day–night difference in <span>R</span><sub>dark</sub> was more evident when expressed on a CO<sub>2</sub> than O<sub>2</sub> basis, with the RQ being higher at midday than midnight in all species, except in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>). Metabolomic analyses showed little correlation of <span>R</span><sub>dark</sub> or RQ with leaf carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose, fructose, or starch) but strong multivariate relationships with other metabolites. The results suggest that rates of <span>R</span><sub>dark</sub> and differences in RQ were determined by several concurrent CO<sub>2</sub>-producing and O<sub>2</sub>-consuming metabolic pathways, not only the tricarboxylic acid cycle (organic acids utilization) but also the pentose phosphate pathway, galactose metabolism, and secondary metabolism. As such, <span>R</span><sub>dark</sub> was time-, type- (C<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>4</sub>) and species-dependent, due to the use of different substrates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"ab2a4d43182f78e1e9e29e63f5aa3c589d522eb356de556fb8f6f781a00ba09c","category":"Environment"}
