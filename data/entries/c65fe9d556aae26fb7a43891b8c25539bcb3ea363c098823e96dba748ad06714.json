{"title":"Investigating the Impact of Diet, Supplementation, Microbiota, Gut-Brain Axis in Schizophrenia: A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1720/v1","date":1719292443000,"content":"Schizophrenia is a disease with a complex etiology that significantly impairs the functioning of patients. In recent years, there has been increasing focus on the importance of the gut microbiota in the context of the gut-brain axis. In our study, we analyzed data on the gut-brain axis in schizophrenia, as well as the impact of eating habits, the use of various supplements, and diets on schizophrenia. Additionally, the study investigated the impact of antipsychotics on the development of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity. There may be significant clinical benefits to be gained from therapies supported by supplements such as omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, and probiotics. The results suggest the need for a holistic approach to the treatment of schizophrenia, incorporating both drug therapy and dietary interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c65fe9d556aae26fb7a43891b8c25539bcb3ea363c098823e96dba748ad06714","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
