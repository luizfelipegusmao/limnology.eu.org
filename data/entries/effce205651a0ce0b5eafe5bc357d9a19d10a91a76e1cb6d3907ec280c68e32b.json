{"title":"Knowing your limits: Patterns and drivers of nutrient limitation and nutrient–chlorophyll relationships in US lakes","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10420?af=R","date":1719835230000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Although understanding nutrient limitation of primary productivity in lakes is among the oldest research priorities in limnology, there have been few broad-scale studies of the characteristics of phosphorus (P)-, nitrogen (N)-, and co-limited lakes and their environmental context. By analyzing 3342 US lakes with concurrent P, N, and chlorophyll <i>a</i> (Chl <i>a</i>) samples, we showed that US lakes are predominantly co-limited (43%) or P-limited (41%). Majorities of lakes were P-limited in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, and Southeast, and co-limitation was most prevalent in the interior and western United States. N-limitation (16%) was more prevalent than P-limitation in the Great Basin and Central Plains. Nutrient limitation was related to lake, watershed, and regional variables, including Chl <i>a</i> concentration, watershed soil, and wet nitrate deposition. N and P concentrations interactively affected nutrient–chlorophyll relationships, which differed by nutrient limitation. Our study demonstrates the value of considering P, N, and environmental context in nutrient limitation and nutrient–chlorophyll relationships.</p>","author":"Ian M.
