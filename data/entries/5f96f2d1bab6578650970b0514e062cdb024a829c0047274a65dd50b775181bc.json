{"title":"COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH VARIATION OF CONCRETE WITH COCONUT SHELL &amp; BAMBOO STRIPS.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1942/v1","date":1727254705000,"content":"This study investigates the compressive strength and workability of concrete incorporating coconut shells and bamboo strips as alternative aggregates. The research compares traditional concrete to concrete mixtures with varying percentages of coconut shells and bamboo strips. Specifically, the study examines the effects of adding 10% coconut shell, 10% bamboo strip, and a combination of 5% coconut shell and 5% bamboo strip by volume to the concrete mix, tested in both C20 and C30 grades.\nTo prepare the materials, coconut shells and bamboo strips were first crushed and then sieved. The sieving process retained particles that passed through a 10mm sieve but were retained on a 4.7mm sieve. The primary focus of the experimental tests was on measuring the compressive strength of the resulting concrete mixtures.\nThe findings indicate that concrete incorporating coconut shells showed moderate workability. In contrast, concrete with bamboo strips exhibited lower workability. Regarding compressive strength, the concrete mix containing a combination of 5% coconut shell and 5% bamboo strips demonstrated a reduction in strength compared to the control group of normal concrete.\nThis research highlights the potential of using coconut shells and bamboo strips as sustainable alternatives in concrete construction. While the workability varies between the different materials, the results provide valuable insights into their suitability for specific applications. This encourages further exploration of eco-conscious building practices and the development of sustainable construction materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f96f2d1bab6578650970b0514e062cdb024a829c0047274a65dd50b775181bc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
