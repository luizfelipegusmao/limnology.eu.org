{"title":"Translation and psychometric evaluation of the Greek version of the Attitudes Toward Transgendered Individuals Scale","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2101/v1","date":1717138486000,"content":"Numerous investigations have consistently underscored the impact of societal stigma on the well-being of transgender individuals, encompassing both those experiencing gender dysphoria (transgender) and those who have undergone gender-affirming interventions (transsexual). The primary objective of the current research is to translate and adapt the Attitudes Toward Transgendered Individuals Scale into the Greek language. This scale specifically assesses stigma, excluding components such as discreteness and violence, and is tailored to evaluate individuals within the general populace. Employing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and assessing gender metric equivalence, the analyses yielded highly favourable outcomes, demonstrating excellent scale fit, reliability, and content validity, reflecting the robustness of the adapted tool for the Greek population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f289ea964fc612221860b227eea01a9d40a9bbc064dcf792dc0121d1c20a79df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
