{"title":"Performance Evaluation of Biowashing Pilot Reactor for Remediation of Crude Oil-contaminated Soil of Kuwait","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1529/v1","date":1724232783000,"content":"Bioremediation of crude oil-contaminated soil in Kuwait was evaluated using the biowashing pilot reactor system, whose components included 3 biowashing reactors; an oil separator, a hydrocyclone, and a dissolved air flotation. The biowashing pilot reactor system was fed with hemoglobin, a cheap and rich nutrient source containing carbon and nitrogen for bacterial growth. The initial total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) concentration was about 84,000 mg/kg soil. The initial TPH concentration decreased to 38,000 mg/kg soil on day 1. The degradation extents of TPH were 55%, 91%, and 96% on days 1, 3, and 5. The first-order rate constant for TPH degradation rate was 0.682ï‚±0.0004/day. The initial unresolved complex mixture (UCM) concentration was 78,000 mg/kg soil. The degradation extents of UCM were 53%, 91%, and 98% on days 1, 3, and 5. Then, the degradation extents of individual components of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), alkylated PAH, and n-alkanes were measured for 5 days. 16S rRNA gene copy number was measured during 5 days for bacterial population estimation. Although there was a day delay in the accretion of the number of copies, the number increased from day 2 to day 5. The present study suggests that the biowashing pilot reactor system with a capacity of 200 L is efficient for TPH degradation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d896855c5379d77feca384f718d9c997003b056039f001ea50fe6f1408fa3fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
