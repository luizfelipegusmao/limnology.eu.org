{"title":"Sedentary Life Is an Invisible Trap: Molecular, Cellular, and Systemic Reasons to Leave It Behind","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1277/v1","date":1724123532000,"content":"As the global population ages, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has become a major public health concern. The adoption of a less sedentary lifestyle has been shown to have a beneficial effect on cognitive decline, but the molecular mechanisms responsible are less clear. Here we provide a detailed analysis of the complex molecular, cellular, and systemic mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline and how lifestyle choices influence these processes. A review of the evidence from animal models, human studies, and postmortem analyses emphasizes the importance of integrating physical exercise with cognitive, multisensory, and motor stimulation as part of a multifaceted approach to mitigating cognitive decline. We highlight the potential of these non-pharmacological interventions to address key aging hallmarks—such as genomic instability, telomere attrition, and neuroinflammation—and underscore the need for comprehensive and personalized strategies to promote cognitive resilience and healthy aging.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd72f184e81576d3f7ad04864b902dd0db5c51f135fc691b57a69471dac8ef41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
