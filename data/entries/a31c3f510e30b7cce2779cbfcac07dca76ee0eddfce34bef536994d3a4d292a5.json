{"title":"Bone Fracture Detection from X-ray Images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1320/v1","date":1729101311000,"content":"Bone fractures are common injuries that require quick and accurate diagnosis to provide the right medical care. The “convolutional neural network” technique relies mostly on manual inspection, by radiologists and can be laborious and prone to error. The objective of this work was to increase the efficiency and accuracy of fracture identification by automating the examination of X-ray images using convolutional neural networks. A “convolutional neural network” model created to detect bone fractures in X-ray images was used in the present study. The model was trained and validated using an extensive dataset of X-ray images, which included both fractured and nonfractured bones. Multiple convolutional layers were used in the “convolutional neural network” architecture for feature extraction, and pooling and fully connected layers were added for classification. The main measures used to assess the model's performance were sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. In regard to identifying bone fractures, the “convolutional neural network”-based model outperformed the conventional technique. With significant gains in sensitivity and specificity, this approach achieved a high accuracy rate and decreased the frequency of false positives and false negatives. We used “convolutional neural network” tool in PyTorch for bone fracture detection and we outlined the important considerations that must be considered when attempting to achieve this goal Additionally, we contrasted every study with our baseline. Here our maximum accuracies were 99.05%, 98.60%, 99.45% and 99.74% for epochs 8, 9, 10 and 11, respectively. These findings highlight the model's ability to improve the diagnostic efficiency and accuracy in clinical settings. Using “convolutional neural network” to identify bone fractures from X-ray images is a promising development in medical imaging. In the end, our method improves patient outcomes by ensuring faster and more reliable fracture diagnosis while also lessening the diagnostic burden on radiologists. Subsequent investigations will focus on incorporating this system into clinical procedures and investigating its utilization in real-time emergency situations. Since there was no medical intervention on human subjects in this investigation, trial registration regulations were not applied.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a31c3f510e30b7cce2779cbfcac07dca76ee0eddfce34bef536994d3a4d292a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
