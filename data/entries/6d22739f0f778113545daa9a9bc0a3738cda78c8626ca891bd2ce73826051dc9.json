{"title":"The Correlation Between Central Corneal Thickness and Intraocular Pressure Among Syrians: A Cross Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1731/v1","date":1714282966000,"content":"Introduction: intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement is an essential part glaucoma’s diagnosis and follow-up. Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) is the gold standard for IOP measurement but it’s affected by many factors like central corneal thickness (CCT). Racial differences in CCT are reported but the Syrian population was never studied.Research design and methods: 57 subjects with 114 eyes visiting Damascus hospital were examined and 100 eyes were included. IOP was measured using GAT and CCT was measured using OCULUS Pentacam AXL Corneal Topography, demographic data and history of ocular surgery, systemic co-morbidities and history of medications were collected. IOP values were corrected for CCT.Results: 56% were males, the mean age was 48.1. 24% of subjects had hypertension. Males had higher CCT with 557.23± 25.33 compared with 531.34 ± 41.88 for females. There was a moderately positive correlation between CCT and IOP (r=0.232, p-0.02), CCT and IOP values were linearly correlated (ANOVA, p=0.02).Conclusions: This study showed that the correlation between CCT and IOP is present in the Syrian population. Males had a slightly thicker corneas than females and CCT didn’t significantly change with age.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d22739f0f778113545daa9a9bc0a3738cda78c8626ca891bd2ce73826051dc9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
