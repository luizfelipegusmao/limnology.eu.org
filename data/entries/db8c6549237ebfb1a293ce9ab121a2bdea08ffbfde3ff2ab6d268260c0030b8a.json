{"title":"Do sympatric catfish radiations in Lake Tanganyika show eco-morphological diversification?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/evolinnean/kzae015/7739518?rss=1","date":1724371200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Adaptive radiation is characterized by eco-morphological differentiation, in which niche partitioning has been shown to be a central response to natural selection during the diversification of animal clades. This process is suggested to have generated the exceptional biodiversity in the East African rift lakes; however, aside from the cichlid fishes, the nature of the divergence, over time, or among species is less clear in the other radiations. To address this, we focus on two distantly related sympatric Lake Tanganyika catfish clades, the genus <span>Synodontis</span>, considered to be MÃ¼llerian mimics, and the subfamily Claroteinae. We investigate to what extent, if any, these radiations have undergone eco-morphological diversification. We place these radiations in a common phylogenetic context, and test for morphological divergence and trophic niche partitioning using novel trait data and stable isotope signatures. Diversification of both catfish clades was recent, with the <span>Synodontis</span> radiation synchronized in time with individual genera within the claroteine radiation, suggesting initial diversification was facilitated by lake basin dynamics and/or lake level fluctuations. There is evidence for eco-morphological diversification within the claroteine radiation, as inferred from observed morphological disparity and divergence in diet both between and within genera; however, several species show significant overlap in dietary isotopic signatures. In contrast, the <span>Synodontis</span> radiation has greater overlap between taxa both in morphology and in isotopic signatures potentially indicating niche conservatism, suggesting different selective forces may be driving these radiations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolutionary Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"3a6bf3189332aa8d860b0369d5aa2ac065f7385b7c3f4543469ad2a55950d26a","entryHash":"db8c6549237ebfb1a293ce9ab121a2bdea08ffbfde3ff2ab6d268260c0030b8a","category":"Environment"}
