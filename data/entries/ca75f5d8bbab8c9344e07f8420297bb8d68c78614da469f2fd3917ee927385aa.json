{"title":"The Temporality of Rewards: Analysis of the Impacts of Positive and Negative Habits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0885/v1","date":1723531516000,"content":"This study explores the relationship between positive and negative habits and their rewards over time. Using a bibliographic and documentary approach, we analyze how the temporality of rewards influences the formation and maintenance of habits. We developed the \"habit chart\", which shows that positive habits, such as reading, healthy eating, physical exercise, meditation and personal relationships, offer incremental and lasting rewards. In contrast, negative habits such as sugar consumption, excessive use of social media and a sedentary lifestyle provide immediate gratification followed by a sharp decline. The analysis was based on studies such as those by Warburton et al. (2006), Lally et al. (2010), and Hu (2003) for positive habits, and Malik et al. (2010) and Kross et al. (2013) for negative habits. We conclude that practical strategies, such as financial incentives and creating enabling environments, can make long-term rewards more tangible, promoting the adoption of healthy behaviors. This study reinforces the importance of the temporality of rewards in habit formation and suggests evidence-based interventions to improve quality of life and general well-being.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca75f5d8bbab8c9344e07f8420297bb8d68c78614da469f2fd3917ee927385aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
