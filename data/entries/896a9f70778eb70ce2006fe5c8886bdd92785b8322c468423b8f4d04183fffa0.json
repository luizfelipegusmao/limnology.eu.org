{"title":"Hydrocarbons Are the Backbone of Sustainable Civilization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0780/v1","date":1710339104000,"content":"This article illustrates a comprehensive exploration of the multifaceted role of hydrocarbons in the field of material science, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical applications, also providing acumens into future perceptions. Hydrocarbons, which consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms, play a critical role in numerous sectors due to their extensive presence in both natural and synthetic environments. The study categorizes hydrocarbons into diverse categories such as alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons, each owning unique features that influence their physical properties and applications. This inclusive review comprehends the fundamental aspects of hydrocarbons, their indispensable compounds and elements, and their substantial contributions to material science, including their utilization in coatings, composites, and polymers. Besides, the article investigates into case studies that demonstrate the theoretical advancements and practical applications of hydrocarbons, as well as their latent in addressing future energy and environmental encounters. By investigative the role of hydrocarbons in the expansion of innovative materials and their implications for sustainability and technological progress, the article accentuates the significance of hydrocarbons in evolving the field of material science and technology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"896a9f70778eb70ce2006fe5c8886bdd92785b8322c468423b8f4d04183fffa0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
