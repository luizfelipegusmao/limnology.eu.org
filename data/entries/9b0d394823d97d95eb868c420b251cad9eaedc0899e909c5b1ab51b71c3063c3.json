{"title":"Cellular and Molecular Biology of Mitochondria in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0048/v1","date":1719814827000,"content":"Abstract:\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a continually advancing respiratory disorder, characterized by enduring airflow limitation along with long-lasting inflammation in the airways. An expanding pool of evidence is emphasizing how mitochondrial dysfunction directly impacts the development and progression of COPD. This comprehensive review delves deeper into the intricate cellular and molecular biology of mitochondria within the framework of COPD, spotlighting significant alterations in structure and function that accompany mitochondrial dysfunction.\nIn this narrative, we delve into the observed changes in mitochondrial shape, behavior, and respiratory chain complex alterations seen in individuals afflicted with COPD. The discussion includes implications on cellular signaling pathways and how this affects the natural process of programmed cellular death (apoptosis) and cellular aging, particularly in reference to COPD. Additionally, we consolidate ongoing therapeutic strategies, honing in on the management of COPD through a focus on mitochondrial dysfunction. Prominent among these strategies is the potential role of antioxidants and mitochondrial biogenesis inducers, which are emerging as promising fields of intervention.\nFurthermore, we embark on an overview of the possible use of mitochondrial biomarkers as innovative tools in diagnosing COPD, evaluating disease progression, and monitoring the efficacy of COPD treatments. As we unravel the rather complex interplay between mitochondrial biology and COPD, this review highlights the critical importance of formulating treatments that target mitochondrial dysfunction. The ultimate goal of these strategic interventions is to slow down the rate of COPD progression and significantly improve patient outcomes.\nLastly, though our understanding of the nexus between COPD and mitochondrial dysfunction has significantly enhanced, ample scope remains for further investigation. Improved insights into the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction, discovered biomarkers, and targeted therapies could encompass a revolutionary step towards comprehensive disease management. The future of COPD treatment seems to lean towards a combination of strategies, prioritizing not only the management of symptoms but also focused on preserving and restoring lung function, improving physical capacity, and enhancing quality of life for COPD patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b0d394823d97d95eb868c420b251cad9eaedc0899e909c5b1ab51b71c3063c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
