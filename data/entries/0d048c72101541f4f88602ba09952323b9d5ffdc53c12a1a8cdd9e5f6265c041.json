{"title":"Selection drives divergence of eye morphology in sympatric Heliconius butterflies","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/7/1338/7670775?rss=1","date":1715558400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>When populations experience different sensory conditions, natural selection may favor sensory system divergence, affecting peripheral structures and/or downstream neural pathways. We characterized the outer eye morphology of sympatric <span>Heliconius</span> butterflies from different forest types and their first-generation reciprocal hybrids to test for adaptive visual system divergence and hybrid disruption. In Panama, <span>Heliconius cydno</span> occurs in closed forests, whereas <span>Heliconius melpomene</span> resides at the forest edge. Among wild individuals, <span>H. cydno</span> has larger eyes than <span>H. melpomene</span>, and there are heritable, habitat-associated differences in the visual brain structures that exceed neutral divergence expectations. Notably, hybrids have intermediate neural phenotypes, suggesting disruption. To test for similar effects in the visual periphery, we reared both species and their hybrids in common garden conditions. We confirm that <span>H. cydno</span> has larger eyes and provide new evidence that this is driven by selection. Hybrid eye morphology is more <span>H. melpomene</span>-like despite body size being intermediate, contrasting with neural trait intermediacy. Overall, our results suggest that eye morphology differences between <span>H. cydno</span> and <span>H. melpomene</span> are adaptive and that hybrids may suffer fitness costs due to a mismatch between the peripheral visual structures and previously described neural traits that could affect visual performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"0d048c72101541f4f88602ba09952323b9d5ffdc53c12a1a8cdd9e5f6265c041","category":"Environment"}
