{"title":"Prognostic impact of the distance from the anterior surface to tumor cells in pancreatoduodenectomy with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307876","date":1722002400000,"content":"<p>by Miki Usui, Katsunori Uchida, Aoi Hayasaki, Masashi Kishiwada, Shugo Mizuno, Masatoshi Watanabe</p>\r\nPurpose <p>Several reports have shown the importance of margins in pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) specimens; however, whether anterior surfaces are included as margins varies among reports. In this study, we aimed to examine the impact of the anterior surface on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).</p> Method <p>In total, 98 patients who underwent PD after chemoradiotherapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at Mie University Hospital between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2019, were included. We investigated the prognostic impact of the distance from the anterior surface to tumor cells on DFS and OS using a log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards analysis.</p> Results <p>A significant difference in DFS and OS was observed up to a distance of 5 mm from the anterior surface of tumor cells. The multivariate analysis revealed that the distance from the anterior surface to tumor cells (â‰¤5 mm) was an independent poor prognostic factor for DFS and OS.</p> Conclusion <p>In patients with PD treated with neoadjuvant therapy, the distance from the anterior surface to tumor cells is an important assessment and should be included in the pathology report.</p>","author":"Miki Usui","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4455de3c3566116b056825d2194ebffc2644d73a4ec59a64acd740917596fa5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
