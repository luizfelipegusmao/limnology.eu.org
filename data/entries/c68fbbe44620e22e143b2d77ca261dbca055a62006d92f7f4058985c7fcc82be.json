{"title":"Asiatic acid inhibits osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion via the AKT/Sp1/MMP1 axis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24246?af=R","date":1718077862000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor affecting adolescents and children. No effective treatment is currently available. Asiatic acid (AA), a triterpenoid compound found in <i>Centella asiatica</i>, possesses anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties in various types of tumor cells. This study aims to determine whether AA exerts antitumor effects in human osteosarcoma cells. Our results indicate that AA does not influence the viability, proliferative rate, or cell cycle phase of human osteosarcoma cells under non-toxic conditions. AA suppressed osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion by down-regulating matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) expression. Data in the TNMplot database suggested MMP1 expression was higher in osteosarcoma than in normal tissues, with associated clinical significance observed in osteosarcoma patients. Overexpression of MMP1 in osteosarcoma cells reversed the AA-induced suppression of cell migration and invasion. AA treatment decreased the expression of specificity protein 1 (Sp1), while Sp1 overexpression abolished the effect of AA on MMP1 expression and cell migration and invasion. AA inhibited AKT phosphorylation, and treatment with a PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin) increased the anti-invasive effect of AA on osteosarcoma cells via the p-AKT/Sp1/MMP1 axis. Thus, AA exhibits the potential for use as an anticancer drug against human osteosarcoma.</p>","author":"Yat‐Yin Law, \nHsiang‐Lin Lee, \nChu‐Liang Lin, \nPei‐Ni Chen, \nPei‐Han Wang, \nYi‐Hsien Hsieh, \nChien‐Min Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"c68fbbe44620e22e143b2d77ca261dbca055a62006d92f7f4058985c7fcc82be","category":"Environment"}
