{"title":"A Unified Force Theory Based on Quantum Aether Dynamics: Predictions and Experimental Support","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0007/v1","date":1725259489000,"content":"This paper presents the Aether Physics Model (APM), a novel theoretical framework that offers a unified description of the fundamental forces and weak interaction. The APM proposes a quantum Aether composed of discrete units, recognizes two distinct charge manifestations, and treats all charges as distributed. Using dimensional analysis and simple equations, the APM derives force equations that unify gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong forces and the weak interaction. The model makes specific predictions about force strengths, maximum mass density, and fine structure constants for protons and neutrons. These predictions align with existing observations and offer new avenues for experimental testing. The APM addresses the limitations of the Standard Model while providing a more intuitive explanation for phenomena like the quantum Hall effect and Casimir effect. If validated, the APM could revolutionize our understanding of space, matter, and fundamental forces.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44dd54d6be48ca2242c866d3fc45e84bdc734c6df66eb42b1b78c16cad2a066d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
