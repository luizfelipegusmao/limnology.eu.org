{"title":"One-shot technology for three-dimensional imaging of large animals: perspectives for ruminant management","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae018/7604297?rss=1","date":1707436800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In numerous systems of animal production, there is increasing interest in the use of three-dimensional (3D)-imaging technology on farms for its ability to easily and safely measure traits of interest in living animals. With this information, it is possible to evaluate multiple morphological indicators of interest, either directly or indirectly, and follow them through time. Several tools for this purpose were developed, but one of their main weaknesses was their sensitivity to light and animal movement, which limited their potential for large-scale application on farms. To address this, a new device, called Deffilait3D and based on depth camera technology, was developed. In tests on 31 Holstein dairy cows and 13 Holstein heifers, the values generated for most measured indicators were highly repeatable and reproducible, with coefficients of variation lower than 4%. A comparison of measurements obtained from both Deffilait3D and the previous validated system, called Morpho3D, revealed a high degree of similarity for most selected traits, e.g., less than 0.2% variation for animal volume and 1.2% for chest depth, with the highest degree of difference (8%) noted for animal surface area. Previously published equations used to estimate body weight with the Morpho3D device were equally valid using Deffilait3D. This new device was able to record 3D images regardless of the movement of animals and it is affected only by direct daylight. The ongoing step is now to develop methods for automated analysis and extraction from images, which should enable the rapid development of new tools and potentially lead to the large-scale adoption of this type of device on commercial farms.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"29766689876f5c7c7a437a24272a7708153467ec009423b5e531060ed3f552f8","category":"Environment"}
