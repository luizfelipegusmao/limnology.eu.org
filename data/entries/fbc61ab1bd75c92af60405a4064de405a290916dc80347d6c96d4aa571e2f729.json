{"title":"High-Temperature Stone Behavior: Insights from a Global Heritage Stone Resources","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0149/v1","date":1727866932000,"content":"Throughout history, natural stone has been a crucial building material due to its strength, durability, and aesthetic qualities. Today, it continues to be a valuable resource, representing both a cultural heritage asset and a significant economic material. However, the increasing frequency of heat waves and fires driven by climate change poses a growing threat to stone building materials. This paper presents a literature review aimed at assessing the effects of high temperatures on Global Heritage Stone Resources (GHSR). GHSR is an international classification designed to enhance the recognition and status of building stones. The study identifies a critical need for research to better understand how those stone materials behave when exposed to high temperatures in order to predict and mitigate the effects of external threats such as fires.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fbc61ab1bd75c92af60405a4064de405a290916dc80347d6c96d4aa571e2f729","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
