{"title":"52 Alleviating antinutritional effects of high soybean meal diets for nursery pigs through multienzyme and acidifier supplementation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/89/7664702?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study evaluated the effect of multienzyme and acidifier supplementation in high soybean meal (SBM) diets on performance and allergenic response in nursery pigs. A total of 240 weaned pigs, 5.9 ± 0.8 kg body weight (BW), were allotted to 5 dietary treatments with 8 replicates in a randomized complete block design. Dietary treatments were low SBM diet (17% in phase 1 and 20% in phase 2), standard SBM diet (22% in phase 1 and 25% in phase 2), high SBM diet (30% in phase 1 and 35% in phase 2), high SBM diet with multienzyme supplementation (100 ppm of phytase, 500 ppm of carbohydrase, 250 ppm of protease, and 25 ppm of keratinase), and high SBM diet with multienzyme and acidifier (0.5%) supplementation. The enzyme combination was selected based on an in-vitro digestion experiment evaluating the degradation rate for antinutritional factors present in SBM. Diets were provided in a 3-phase feeding program: phase 1 (wk 1), phase 2 (wk 2 and 3), and phase 3 (wk 4 to 6); common corn-SBM based diet. Growth performance was measured at the end of each phase along with blood collection for serum IGF-1, IgA, and IgE analyses. One pig per pen was euthanized to collect intestinal tissue for histomorphology and ileal digesta for sIgA analysis. Data were analyzed using MIXED procedure of SAS and fecal score data was analyzed using FREQ procedure of SAS. Pigs fed high SBM diets with multienzyme or with multienzyme and acidifier tended to have a greater (<span>P</span> = 0.08) average daily gain compared with pigs fed High-SBM diet during phase 2 by 12.5%. Pigs fed high SBM diets with multienzyme and acidifier supplementation had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) average daily feed intake compared with pigs fed high SBM diet in phase 2. During phase 1 and 2, pigs fed high SBM diets supplemented with multienzyme or multienzyme plus acidifier had less incidence of soft and watery feces (χ<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.05) than those fed high SBM diet. Dietary treatment did not affect serum concentrations of T4, IGF-1, IgA, and IgE. Pigs fed high SBM diet with multienzyme and acidifier supplementation had less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) concentration of sIgA in the ileal digesta on d 14 compared with high SBM diet (24.2 vs 33.8 mg/mL) but similar to low SBM diet (22.7 mg/mL). Pigs fed high SBM diet with multienzyme and acidifier supplementation had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) jejunal villus height to crypt depth ratio on d 7 compared with low SBM by 12%. In conclusion, supplementation with multienzyme or multienzyme and acidifier in high SBM diets could reduce the negative impact of high SBM inclusion in nursery pig diets by improving growth performance, promoting intestinal health, and reducing allergenic response in nursery pigs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"e666f8e37e2c516642a6943ee6936e1450d9da3f591798fc1b6774139e22affc","category":"Environment"}
