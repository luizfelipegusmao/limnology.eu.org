{"title":"Proposal of a Sensorization Methodology to Obtain a Digital Model: The Case of the Dome of the Pious School of Valencia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0234/v1","date":1717590302000,"content":"The Church of the Pious Schools of Valencia (18th century) has the largest Valencian dome constructed, with its 24.5 meter span, and it is included among the prestigious great European domes, inspired by the Pantheon and belonging to Neoclassicism. Currently, it is undergoing a thorough study and restoration process to improve the management of the monument, especially to halt its deterioration due to moisture and cracks. An initial study included in the Master Plan (1995) determined that the cracks were caused by thermal effects, but recently other studies have addressed that the failure originated from the walls. Additionally, environmental impact and thermal behavior are among the causes, as excessive humidity due to high interior occupancy can cause damage to the dome, which has historic coatings. As a result of the study process, it is proposed to sensorize the dome of the church to have comprehensive control of temperature, humidity, and CO2, as well as accelerometers to monitor the movements of the structure. With this, after the restoration of the dome, the potential effects of temperature, humidity, and CO2 on the dome's surfaces will be controlled, in addition to verifying if there is any correlation between the cracks and the temperature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"98476d49067b00fce2431f2d28b6dc97ca0d04abf672356d86a132f9793daca4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
