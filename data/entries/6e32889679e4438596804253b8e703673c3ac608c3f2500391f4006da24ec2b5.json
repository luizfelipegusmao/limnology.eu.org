{"title":"Optimization Analysis of Company Financial Statements Using Weighted Goal Programming with Analytical Hierarchy Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0659/v1","date":1718087526000,"content":"Financial statements depict the condition of a company and need to be analyzed and evaluated to assess its performance. This research aims to analyze financial statements to describe the financial condition, measure business development over time, and evaluate the achievement of the com-pany's objectives. An optimization analysis of financial ratios is performed using the Weighted Goal Programming (WGP) model, which addresses multiple objectives by applying weights based on their priorities. The Analytical Hierarchy Process was used to determine the priority weights of deviation variables from each financial ratio target. Financial ratios were selected based on their impact on profit using factor analysis. The constructed WGP model aims to minimize deviations in Return on Assets, Operating Ratios, Operating Income Ratio, Total Assets Turnover, and Current Ratio. Computational calculations to solve the WGP model are per-formed using Python, with pseudocode provided. A case study on a company in the garment and textile sector was conducted and found that the Operating Ratio, Return on Assets, Operating Income Ratio, and Current Ratio still need improvement by developing strategies to achieve the targets. Sensitivity analysis was also employed to assess the resilience of the model in response to alterations in data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e32889679e4438596804253b8e703673c3ac608c3f2500391f4006da24ec2b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
