{"title":"The Role of Data Governance in Ensuring System Success and Long-Term IT Performance: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1841/v1","date":1729686650000,"content":"Data governance has emerged as a critical factor in determining the effectiveness and long-term stability of IT systems in todayâ€™s data-driven environment. It encompasses frameworks that guide organizations in managing data collection, storage, processing, usage, and sharing, while ensuring alignment with business objectives, compliance with regulations, and adherence to ethical standards. However, the complexities associated with data governance, particularly in the context of new technological models, pose significant challenges. This systematic review aims to explore the role of data governance in enhancing data quality, system stability, and regulatory compliance. It seeks to identify common issues, effective practices, and strategic implications for implementing data governance frameworks across diverse industries, focusing particularly on small and medium enterprises (SMEs). We conducted a systematic review of 68 eligible studies published between 2014 and 2024, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. The included studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. The review covered a range of study types, including qualitative (60%), quantitative (19%), and mixed-methods (21%) research, to provide a comprehensive understanding of data governance's impact on IT performance. The findings highlight that data governance significantly influences system success by improving data quality, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance. Although qualitative studies predominantly emphasized in-depth analysis, a moderate representation of empirical validation through quantitative studies was observed. Common challenges identified include data migration issues, resistance to change, and budget constraints, particularly during system upgrades. Effective practices involve aligning data governance with business strategies, employing hybrid models, and regularly updating governance policies to adapt to technological advancements such as AI and big data. This review provides practical recommendations for IT managers and policymakers to enhance data governance frameworks. These include phased implementation approaches, the establishment of data governance committees, and the use of performance metrics to monitor data quality and system resilience. While significant progress has been made, further research is needed to address gaps related to emerging technologies and the unique challenges faced by SMEs in developing regions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"27088fabc89824f82974f1445b4e3ffab4e501c8e49754cee49e9f4d77abee64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
