{"title":"Exploring Theoretical Modifications in Fabric of Spacetime","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202207.0121/v7","date":1718088698000,"content":"In this paper, I present a possible explanation for the expansion of the universe, by introduced a unique nature of Space-time, this particular and marvelous nature of space shows us that space can shrink, expand, and stretch. This property of space is caused the size of the universe changing over time: growing or shrinking. The observed expansion of the universe, which relates the stretching of Shrunk space for the new theory, is derived. This model is based on the two principal long-range forces are the gravitational force and the repulsive force generated by shrunk space. They are the two most fundamental quantities in the universe that govern cosmic evolution. They may provide the clockwork mechanism that operates our eternal cyclic universe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ecabd834f34f4ee945ca08cfd7e5ddfd4c2959c43146024fa4eed42f6ee609da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
