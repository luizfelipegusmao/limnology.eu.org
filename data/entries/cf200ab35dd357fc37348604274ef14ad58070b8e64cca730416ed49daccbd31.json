{"title":"Interplay Between Oxidative Stress, Autophagy and the Endocannabinoid System in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Role of the Nrf2- p62/SQSTM1 Pathway and Nutraceutical Activation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0298/v1","date":1717671583000,"content":"The onset of neurodegenerative diseases involves a complex interplay of pathological mecha-nisms, including protein aggregation, oxidative stress, impaired autophagy. This review focuses on the intricate connection between oxidative stress and autophagy in neurodegenerative disor-ders, highlighting autophagy as pivotal in disease pathogenesis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play dual roles in cellular homeostasis and autophagy regulation, with disruptions of redox sig-naling contributing to neurodegeneration. The activation of the Nrf2 pathway represents a criti-cal antioxidant mechanism, while autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis by degrading al-tered cell components. The interaction between p62/SQSTM1, Nrf2 and Keap1 forms a regulatory pathway essential for cellular stress response, whose dysregulation leads to impaired autophagy and aggregate accumulation. Targeting the Nrf2-p62/SQSTM1 pathway holds promise for thera-peutic intervention, mitigating oxidative stress and preserving cellular functions. Additionally, the review explores the potential synergy between the endocannabinoid system and Nrf2 signal-ing for neuroprotection. Further research is needed to elucidate the involved molecular mecha-nisms and develop effective therapeutic strategies against neurodegeneration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf200ab35dd357fc37348604274ef14ad58070b8e64cca730416ed49daccbd31","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
