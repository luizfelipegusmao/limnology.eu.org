{"title":"“You know that we travel a lot”: Mobility narratives among female sex workers living with HIV in Tanzania and the Dominican Republic","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003355","date":1720188000000,"content":"<p>by Zoé M.

Kerrigan</p>\r\n\r\nFemale sex workers (FSW) are highly mobile, which may result in reduced access to and use of health services and increased risk for poor health outcomes, particularly for those living with HIV. Mobility includes spatial, temporal, and social elements that are not fully captured by quantitative measures. We conducted two rounds of in-depth interviews with FSW living with HIV in Iringa, Tanzania (n = 20), and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (n = 20), to describe mobility experiences and compare mobility narratives across settings. We integrated a thematic analysis of all interviews with a narrative analysis of a subset of 10 information-rich interviews (five in each country) with women who had recently traveled, for sex work or another reason, outside of their hometown. Across narratives, FSW living with HIV traveled locally or to seasonal destinations, for short and long periods. Social factors influencing mobility included economic drivers; risk of arrest, harassment, or violence; anonymity and/or familiarity; social relationships; and clients’ mobility. Spatial, temporal, and social factors intersected in unique ways in FSW’s mobility experiences, yet distinct mobility typologies were evident across settings and destinations. Together, mobility narratives of FSW living with HIV can inform quantitative research on mobility typologies in Tanzania, the Dominican Republic, and elsewhere. With the potential for economic circumstances, climate change, and other emergencies to increase people’s mobility around the world, researchers and practitioners can learn from the lived experiences of FSW to inform whether and how to tailor and improve the accessibility of HIV care and treatment interventions based on spatial, temporal, and social characteristics of mobility.","author":"Zoé M.
