{"title":"System Acquisition and Development of the Journal House Information System Using Bespoke and Prototype for Improve Connectivity on Integrity Services","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1723/v1","date":1721711880000,"content":"The UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Journal House Information System encounters significant usability challenges stemming from inadequate UI/UX design and sub-optimal integration across its components, resulting in diminished user efficiency and adoption rates. To tackle these issues effectively, a bespoke acquisition approach coupled with prototype development was implemented. This method facilitated a structured software development life cycle emphasizing iterative feedback loops and active stakeholder participation. By iteratively refining requirements and ensuring continuous alignment with user expectations, the prototype development process aimed to deliver a final system that not only meets but exceeds user needs. Rigorous testing, ongoing support, and a commitment to continuous improvement were pivotal in transforming the initial prototype into a robust and user-friendly system. This approach not only promises to enhance overall system effectiveness but also ensures sustained value delivery to stakeholders over the system's lifecycle.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24022495764a741477a94ed87f0021abf493c5f079d8386b97e3a0fb1f9cbbc5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
