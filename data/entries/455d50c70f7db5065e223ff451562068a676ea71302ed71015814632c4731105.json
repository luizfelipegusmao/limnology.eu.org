{"title":"Mini-Review on Recent Developments and Improvements in CO2 Catalytic Conversion to Methanol: Prospects for the Cement Plant Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0961/v1","date":1726121840000,"content":"The cement industry has significant environmental impacts, stemming from natural resources extraction and fossil fuels combustion. Notably, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are a major concern associated with cement production. The cement industry emits 0.6 tons of CO2 per ton of cement production, which is around 8 % of the total CO2 emissions in the world. Meeting the 13th United Nations Sustainable Goals, cement plants aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, resulting from reduction in CO2 emissions (change in the composition of cementitious materials) and the adoption of carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technologies. A promising approach involves converting COâ‚‚ into valuable chemicals and fuels, such as methanol (MeOH) through the power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies. In this process, CO2 captured from cement industry flue gas with hydrogen generated from renewable sources through electrolysis of water, catalytically transformed into renewable methanol (e-MeOH), offering a sustainable solution. To achieve this, it is crucial to advance the development of novel, highly efficient catalysts specifically designed for direct CO2 hydrogenation. In this sense, this review discusses recent developments and improvements in CO2 catalytic conversion, emphasizing catalyst performance, selectivity, and stability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"455d50c70f7db5065e223ff451562068a676ea71302ed71015814632c4731105","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
