{"title":"Beneficial Effects of Geological Materials: With Africa Case Descriptions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0660/v1","date":1710177108000,"content":"Studies on Medical Geology have up till recently tended to emphasise the harmful effects of geological material and processes. This is perhaps justifiable, given the realisation that many environmental diseases could have causal links with some geo-environmental variables as co-factors, making such studies extremely valuable in the improvement of diagnoses and therapy. However, this review aims to show that in addition to the high value of such research, studies conducted on the beneficial properties of Earth materials also have considerable merit, given their enormous potential for assuaging a wide range of environmental health disorders. For instance, certain geological materials including clay minerals contain active substances that show considerable promise in various applications such as pharmaceutical formulations, aesthetic medicine, and indigenous medicine. This review synthesises current knowledge of how certain geological materials can be exploited in formulating remedies for some human health problems. Reports of the therapeutic uses of clay minerals, zinc oxide (zincite), zeolite, and kaolin are appraised. The review shows that ancient and contemporary use of geological materials such as clay minerals have played crucial roles in the treatment of several human diseases, with recent and ongoing research revealing further development in these applications. Well strategised clinical trials using available resources could give impetus to further research in elucidating the potential of various geomaterials as innovative clinical remedies for some human diseases and infections as well as aid the proper scientific documentation of their natural uses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c193b2d07aebf7d37436c6320f3230f11fbbc2b6ada551fbde274dd6f9b0c2d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
