{"title":"Mrj is a chaperone of the Hsp40 family that regulates Orb2 oligomerization and long-term memory in <i>Drosophila</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002585","date":1713794400000,"content":"<p>by Meghal Desai, Hemant, Ankita Deo, Jagyanseni Naik, Prathamesh Dhamale, Avinash Kshirsagar, Tania Bose, Amitabha Majumdar</p>\r\n\r\nOrb2 the <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) protein forms prion-like oligomers. These oligomers consist of Orb2A and Orb2B isoforms and their formation is dependent on the oligomerization of the Orb2A isoform. <i>Drosophila</i> with a mutation diminishing Orb2Aâ€™s prion-like oligomerization forms long-term memory but fails to maintain it over time. Since this prion-like oligomerization of Orb2A plays a crucial role in the maintenance of memory, here, we aim to find what regulates this oligomerization. In an immunoprecipitation-based screen, we identify interactors of Orb2A in the Hsp40 and Hsp70 families of proteins. Among these, we find an Hsp40 family protein Mrj as a regulator of the conversion of Orb2A to its prion-like form. Mrj interacts with Hsp70 proteins and acts as a chaperone by interfering with the aggregation of pathogenic Huntingtin. Unlike its mammalian homolog, we find <i>Drosophila</i> Mrj is neither an essential gene nor causes any gross neurodevelopmental defect. We observe a loss of Mrj results in a reduction in Orb2 oligomers. Further, Mrj knockout exhibits a deficit in long-term memory and our observations suggest Mrj is needed in mushroom body neurons for the regulation of long-term memory. Our work implicates a chaperone Mrj in mechanisms of memory regulation through controlling the oligomerization of Orb2A and its association with the translating ribosomes.","author":"Meghal Desai","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"ec3cf3c4f2a98df05d35467598895a927a357b76e73394a256f632f9031c69a8","category":"Environment"}
