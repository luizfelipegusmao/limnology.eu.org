{"title":"Social norms that sustain transactional sex and associations with sexual health outcomes: A mixed-methods study in the Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé, a rural-Indigenous region of Panama","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304805","date":1717164000000,"content":"<p>by Amanda Gabster, Philippe Mayaud, Mónica Jhangimal, Juan Miguel Pascale, Suzanna C. Francis, Ben Cislaghi</p>\r\n\r\nThe Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé (CNB), home to &gt;200,000 Indigenous people, is one of the poorest regions in Panama. We describe transactional sex (TS) behaviours, normative beliefs and factors associated with TS among Indigenous adolescents(14-19years) in the CNB. We conducted a mixed-methods study in the CNB between January and November 2018, which included a qualitative study with participant observation and semi-structured interviews that focused on descriptive norms related to TS; and a cross-sectional study among public-school-going adolescents using self-administered questionnaire to report sexual behaviour and injunctive norms related to TS. Participants in the epidemiological study were also asked to submit samples for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea testing. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to organise and analyse field notes and semi-structured interviews. Quantitative analysis included four models: TS experience and acceptance of a TS offer and the associations of these outcome variables with demographic and behavioural variables and HIV/STI infections. In the qualitative study among 20 adolescents, we found that people offering TS were reported to be from within and outside of the community, and included older men and women, and disturbingly, teachers. Participants reported feeling individual and collective agency in the decision to engage in TS and described little social sanctions for participation. In the quantitative study among 700 adolescents(309 girls[45.1%],379 boys[54.9%]), we found that girls(18.8%;58/309) and boys(15.5%;58/379) reported similar levels of having been offered TS, and of acceptance among those offered(girls 81.4% [35/43]; boys 77.8% [35/45]). TS was found to be associated with the reported forced sex and HIV/syphilis seropositivity. Due to widespread acceptance and feelings of agency, interventions would not be effective if they focused on eliminating the transactional component of sexual encounters. Instead, interventions should focus on individual and household economic stability, increasing violence reporting, bringing perpetrators to justice, and adopting condom use during all sexual encounters.","author":"Amanda Gabster","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ac0583f384945e573829065d731876cc2514f2d9f93444cfc16f6e84f0e3afea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
