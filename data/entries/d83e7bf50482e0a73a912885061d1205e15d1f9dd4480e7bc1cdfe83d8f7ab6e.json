{"title":"An Annotated Checklist of Invasive Species of the Phylum Arthropods and Chordates in Panama","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2047/v1","date":1719584053000,"content":"Invasive species are one of the five main causes of biodiversity loss, along with habitat destruction, overexploitation, pollution, and climate change. Represent one of the first barriers to overcome in ecological conservation programs, since are difficult to control and eradicate. Due to the lack of records of invasive exotic species in Panama, this research is necessary to identify and register the documented groups of invasive species of the Chordates and Arthropod groups in Panama. This exhaustive search of invasive species was carried out in different bibliographic databases, electronic portals and scientific journals which addressed the topic at a global level. The results indicate that approximately 133 invasive exotic species of the Arthropoda and Chordata Phylum have been reported in Panama. Of the 133 species, 49 species belong to the Arthropoda Phylum and 84 species belong to the Chordate Phylum. The Panamanian economic activity could promote the introduction of alien species in this country. The study provides the first list of invasive exotic chordate and arthropod species reported for the Republic of Panama.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d83e7bf50482e0a73a912885061d1205e15d1f9dd4480e7bc1cdfe83d8f7ab6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
