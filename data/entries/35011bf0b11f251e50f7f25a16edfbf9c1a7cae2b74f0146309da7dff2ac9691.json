{"title":"The Effect of CKD-495, Eupacidin, and Their Marker Com-pounds on Altered Permeability in the Postoperative Ileus Animal Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0145/v1","date":1722694137000,"content":"Postoperative ileus (POI) is a delay in gastrointestinal transit following surgery that leads to various complications. There is limited understanding of its effective treatment options. CKD-495 and eupacidin are natural products licensed for treating mucosal lesions in acute and chronic gastritis; however, little is known about their effects on intestinal permeability. This study evaluated the effects of CKD-495, eupacidin, and its components (eupatilin and cinnamic acid) on intestinal per-meability in an animal model of POI. Guinea pigs underwent surgical procedures and were ran-domly assigned to different treatment groups. Drugs were administered orally prior to surgery. Intestinal permeability, leukocyte count, and the expression of calprotectin and tight junction proteins were measured in the harvested ileum tissue. The intestinal permeability and leukocyte count were higher in the POI group than in the control group. Pre-administration of CKD-495, cinnamic acid, eupacidin, and eupatilin effectively prevented these changes in the POI model. No significant differences were observed in the expression of tight junction proteins. CKD-495, cinnamic acid, eupacidin, and eupatilin exerted protective effects against increased intestinal permeability and inflammation in an animal model of POI. These natural products have potential as therapeutic options for the treatment of POI.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"35011bf0b11f251e50f7f25a16edfbf9c1a7cae2b74f0146309da7dff2ac9691","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
