{"title":"The Application and the Validity of a New Composite Radiographic Index in Patients with Osteonecrosis of the Jaws","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0439/v1","date":1715174861000,"content":"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to apply the Composite Radiographic Index modified (CRIm) in CBCT scans of patients with Medication related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) in order to detect its validity, and corelate the radiologic findings with the clinical staging of the disease.\n\nMethods: This study included 43 patients with MRONJ diagnosis and CBCT scans performed in the School of Dentistry and approved by the Research Ethics Committee.\nClinical staging for every patient (0-3) was provided according to AAOMS 2022 guidelines. In cases of patients with both jaws affected, each jaw was evaluated independently resulting to 52 CBCT scans. The 52 CBCT scans were assessed under standardized viewing conditions by 2 observers who evaluated independently the following 8 radiologic features: lytic changes, sclerosis, periosteal reaction, sequestration, non-healing extraction sockets and other findings (sinus implication, inferior alveolar canal involvement, jaw fracture). The CRIm index was constructed to assess the extent of osseous changes. The radiologic features were scored as absent (0), localized/single (1), extensive/multiple (2), yielding a theoretical range of 0–12. For statistical analysis Fisher’s exact test and Spearman’s correlation coefficient were performed.\n\nResults: A statistically significant association of clinical stage with lytic changes, sequestration and inferior alveolar canal involvement was found. Also, a statistically significant correlation of clinical stage with CRIm index classification was obtained.\n\nConclusions: The CRIm index tends to increase as the clinical stages of MRONJ advance, suggesting a correlation between the clinical stage of MRONJ and the CRIm index.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02910b707c10b11dd1ff44d5efa9a8e1706570dd00ec515127abd1233e47a3f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
