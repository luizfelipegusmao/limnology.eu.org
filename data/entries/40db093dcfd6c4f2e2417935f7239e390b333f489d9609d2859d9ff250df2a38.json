{"title":"Models and Practices of Assessment in Primary Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1965/v1","date":1716975995000,"content":"The objective of this study is to analyze the assessment practices in primary education and how they relate to the valuation of the learning process. It seeks to understand the perceptions of teachers and students regarding assessment and to observe classroom activities, as well as to analyze the assessment instruments used. The method used is a mixed approach that combines qualitative interpretations of the participantsâ€™ realities with a phenomenological analysis to reflect on the evaluative practices. The results indicate a contradiction between what is said and what is done in terms of evaluation, with a tendency to use written tests and traditional exams instead of a combination of techniques that allow for a significant evaluation of student learning. In addition, significant differences are observed among teachers regarding the importance they give to evaluation within their practices and evaluative models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40db093dcfd6c4f2e2417935f7239e390b333f489d9609d2859d9ff250df2a38","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
