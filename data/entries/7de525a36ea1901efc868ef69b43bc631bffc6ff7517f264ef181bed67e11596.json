{"title":"Evaluation of An Erbium-Doped Fiber Ring Laser, as An Edge Filtering Device for FBG Sensor Interrogation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0491/v1","date":1712556352000,"content":"An easy to implement and cost-effective Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor interrogation technique based on a ring Erbium-Doped Fiber Laser (EDFL) topology is proposed and experimentally assessed. The FBG sensor is part of the EDFL cavity and must have a central wavelength located within the linear region of the EDFâ€™s amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) spectrum which occurs between 1530 and 1540nm. In this manner, the wavelength-encoded response of the FBG under strain is converted to a linear variation of the laser output power, removing the need for spectrum analysis as well as any limitations from the use of external edge-filtering components. In addition, the laser linewidth is significantly reduced with respect to the FBG bandwidth thus improving the resolution of the system, whereas its sensitivity can be controlled through the pumping power. The performance of the system has been characterized by modeling and experiments for EDF's with different lengths, doping concentrations and pumping power levels. The influence of mode-hopping in the laser cavity on the resolution and accuracy of the system has also been investigated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7de525a36ea1901efc868ef69b43bc631bffc6ff7517f264ef181bed67e11596","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
