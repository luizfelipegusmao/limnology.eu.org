{"title":"Optimization of Energy Efficiency, Operation Costs and Carbon Footprint Using Pareto Analysis with New Generation Ro Membranes for Sea Water Desalination Plants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0964/v1","date":1718326064000,"content":"This study explores the potential of piloting desalination plants in a systematic way to evaluate energy improvements in water desalination processes. Pilot tests with the latest generation of reverse osmosis membranes in large desalination plants are becoming increasingly common, as small-scale experiments are carried out on the operation of new generation membranes with better salt rejection and lower energy consumption. This approach aims to achieve optimal water quality standard at the lowest possible cost. In this way, pilot tests are being carried out before the decision is made whether to change the reverse osmosis membranes, as this represents a significant investment. By carrying out these tests, we hope to minimize the risk of making a mistake to ensure the best results in terms of energy consumption, operating costs and reducing the environmental impact while complying with the required water quality. In this case, the Pareto analysis is used to identify the two or three most significant causes whose treatment affects more than 80% of the possible energy improvement to be implemented. This article introduces a novel approach to studying a total of 180 desalination plants at the territorial level in the Canary Islands. The global scarcity of freshwater resources has greatly contributed to the development of desalination technologies, in which reverse osmosis is one of the most widely used and highly regarded methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f564ca2ec84b12706b4e1a1f46d567c5527aa414fc9cee9b0327ea4e177d7b90","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
