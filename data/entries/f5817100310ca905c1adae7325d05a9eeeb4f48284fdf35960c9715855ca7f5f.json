{"title":"The potential of oviduct tags and fine‐scale acoustic telemetry to reveal the timing and location of spawning in Arctic salmonids (Salvelinus spp.)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15951?af=R","date":1728305439000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Identifying and characterizing spawning locations are paramount for the protection of critical fish habitats but can be challenging, particularly in remote locations. Using the underexplored oviduct-tagging technique, we aimed to identify the timing and location of spawning for wild Arctic char (<i>Salvelinus alpinus</i>) and lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>) in two high-Arctic lakes in Nunavut. Specifically, Innovasea V7 acoustic telemetry transmitters were inserted into the oviducts of 13 Arctic char and 4 lake trout, and the timing and location of tag expulsion were determined using a fine-scale positioning system. Twenty Arctic char and 20 lake trout were also tagged with abdominal V16 transmitters, and 10 of them were paired with the oviduct tags, to further study the behavior of individual fish during the spawning season. Oviduct tags from four Arctic char and one lake trout could be used to assess the timing and location of spawning. Spawning anadromous Arctic char drastically reduced their activity and remained proximate to their presumed spawning location immediately before and for months after spawning. In contrast, a non-anadromous (i.e., freshwater resident) Arctic char and a lake trout showed little to no reduction in activity around presumed spawning events. Because of the highlighted sedentary behavior of inferred spawning anadromous Arctic char implanted with both abdominal and oviduct tags, we could also infer potential spawning based on the behavior of individuals equipped only with abdominal tags. Spawning areas identified via telemetry also aligned well with Inuit knowledge of those lakes. This is the first field study to use acoustic oviduct and abdominal tags coupled with a fine-scale positioning system. Despite a limited success rate of ejection, the study reveals the strong potential of the method to study spawning habitat and timing, particularly in remote areas.</p>","author":"Véronique Dubos, \nLes N.
