It can increase the risk of adverse outcomes for both the woman and the infant more than each infection alone does. However, the magnitude of these co-infections remains insufficiently documented. Hence, this study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of HIV, HBV, and syphilis co-infections and associated risk factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care in Amhara region referral hospitals in northern Ethiopia.</p> Methods <p>A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Amhara regional state referral hospitals from January 1 to February 30, 2024, among 606 pregnant women. Pregnant women were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. An interviewer-administered questionnaire and chart review were used to collect data. Data were analyzed in SPSSV26.0. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the magnitude of co-infections, and binary logistic regression was used to determine associated factors. Variables with a P-value &lt; 0.05 were used to declare statistical significance.</p> Result <p>Overall, 4.1% (95% CI: 2.7, 6.1) of pregnant women were co-infected. The prevalence of specific co-infections was 2% (95% CI: 1, 3.5) for HIV/HBV, 1.3% (95% CI: 0.6, 2.6) for HIV/syphilis, and 0.8% (95% CI: 0.3, 1.9) for HBV/syphilis. No cases of triple co-infection were observed. Women with a history of unsafe sex (AOR = 8.2, 95% CI: 1.5, 16.7) and incarceration (AOR = 9.3, 95% CI: 1.6, 20.8) were associated with HIV/syphilis co-infection. For HIV/HBV co-infection, contact with jaundice patients (AOR = 5.5, 95% CI: 1.3, 22.5) and women with a history of STIs (AOR = 4.6, 95% CI: 1.4, 14.9) was significantly associated. Women with STI history (AOR = 6.3, 95% CI: 1.2, 15.9) were also significantly associated with HBV/syphilis co-infection.</p> Conclusion <p>Despite the governmentâ€™s elimination efforts, a relatively high prevalence of coinfections with the infections studied was found among pregnant women. Therefore, HIV, HBV, and syphilis testing and treatment packages should be strengthened by targeting pregnant women with a history of STIs, contact with patients with jaundice, a history of incarceration, and unsafe sex.</p>","author":"Degsew Ewunetie Anteneh","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3ecbcee208b5f01e731ee6a7a2bbded6b0394e9566ea08f0cdc94bdf2d9e9df0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
