{"title":"Heritable changes of epialleles near genes in maize can be triggered in the absence of CHH methylation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2511/7477629?rss=1","date":1702857600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Trans</span>-chromosomal interactions resulting in changes in DNA methylation during hybridization have been observed in several plant species. However, little is known about the causes or consequences of these interactions. Here, we compared DNA methylomes of F1 hybrids that are mutant for a small RNA biogenesis gene, <span>Mop1</span> (<span>Mediator of paramutation1</span>), with that of their parents, wild-type siblings, and backcrossed progeny in maize (<span>Zea mays</span>). Our data show that hybridization triggers global changes in both <span>trans</span>-chromosomal methylation (TCM) and <span>trans</span>-chromosomal demethylation (TCdM), most of which involved changes in CHH methylation. In more than 60% of these TCM differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in which small RNAs are available, no significant changes in the quantity of small RNAs were observed. Methylation at the CHH TCM DMRs was largely lost in the <span>mop1</span> mutant, although the effects of this mutant varied depending on the location of these DMRs. Interestingly, an increase in CHH at TCM DMRs was associated with enhanced expression of a subset of highly expressed genes and suppressed expression of a small number of lowly expressed genes. Examination of the methylation levels in backcrossed plants demonstrates that both TCM and TCdM can be maintained in the subsequent generation, but that TCdM is more stable than TCM. Surprisingly, although increased CHH methylation in most TCM DMRs in F1 plants required <span>Mop1</span>, initiation of a new epigenetic state of these DMRs did not require a functional copy of this gene, suggesting that initiation of these changes is independent of RNA-directed DNA methylation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"2beecb799a8ee14ee8d0f667ef491abb902acbb2626a9d8dcb8416ec0cc46e56","category":"Environment"}
