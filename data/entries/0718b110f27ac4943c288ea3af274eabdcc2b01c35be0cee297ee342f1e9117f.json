{"title":"Germplasm Rescue of Postmortem Critically Endangered Yangtze Sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus) by Cell Preservation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/2472375?af=R","date":1676707200000,"content":"<p>With the growing sophistication of cloning technology, rescuing cell resources is of great significance for the protection of endangered animals. The Yangtze sturgeon (<i>Acipenser dabryanus</i>), one of the three Acipenseriformes species in the Yangtze River, is critically endangered. Natural reproduction of the Yangtze sturgeon has not been detected since 2000. Less than 20 wild individuals are kept in husbandry, and all are too old to breed. Therefore, it is urgent to rescue the genetic resources of every wild Yangtze sturgeon. Here, we isolated and preserved viable cells from critically endangered postmortem Yangtze sturgeon for the first time. Attempts to rescue and preserve cell resources were carried out from 8 tissues, brain, kidney, gonad, fin, liver, skin, spleen, and muscle of an over 35-year-old female wild Yangtze sturgeon between 11 and 14 hours after death at 19.8°C in an outdoor concrete pond, and only muscle tissue cells could be successfully subcultured and preserved. Furthermore, the cultured cells showed high post-thaw cell viability and normal growth with a population doubling time of 52.98 h. Moreover, they were fibronectin- and desmin-positive, characterizing them as fibroblastic confirmed muscle cells with fibroblastic properties and myogenic origin. Tests for microbial contamination of the cell lines were negative. Chromosome analysis demonstrated that muscle cells possess a modal polyploid chromosome number of 264. The mitochondrial sequence data of COI genes and 12S rRNA confirmed that the developed cell line originated from <i>A. dabryanus</i>. Furthermore, transfection results indicate that muscle cells could be used for gene manipulation and functional studies. These results suggest that viable muscle cells could also be successfully isolated and cryopreserved from the wild Yangtze sturgeon in a short time after death. This report is not only of great significance for the germplasm rescue of critically endangered Yangtze sturgeon but also provides some scientific reference for the germplasm preservation of other endangered fish.</p>","author":"Juanjuan Liu, \nBinzhong Wang, \nYacheng Hu, \nHongtao Huang, \nXun Zhao, \nHejun Du, \nZhitao Qi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"0718b110f27ac4943c288ea3af274eabdcc2b01c35be0cee297ee342f1e9117f","category":"Environment"}
