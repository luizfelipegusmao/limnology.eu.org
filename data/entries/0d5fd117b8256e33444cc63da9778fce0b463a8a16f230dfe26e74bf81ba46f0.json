{"title":"Demographic Characteristics and Survival in Young Onset Colorectal Neuroendocrine Neoplasms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0261/v1","date":1725509053000,"content":"Recent epidemiologic studies have revealed an upward trend in young-onset colorectal cancer (YOCRC) overall, whereas specific data on young-onset colorectal neuroendocrine neoplasms (YONEN) remain limited. This study investigates demographic characteristics and survival trends in YONEN and compares these with those of young-onset colorectal adenocarcinoma (YOADC), the most common histologic subtype of YOCRC. A retrospective analysis was conducted from 2000 to 2019 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Survival outcomes were assessed using univariate and multivariable Cox proportional models, with demographic differences evaluated via Wilcoxon Rank Sum and Chi-square tests. Out of 61,705 patients aged 20-49 with colorectal cancer, 8% had NEN, and 92% had adenocarcinoma. The YONEN cohort had a higher proportion of Black patients and a lower proportion of White patients than the YOADC cohort (21% vs. 13% and 44% vs. 57%, respectively). NEN was more commonly found in the rectum (79%), and adenocarcinoma was mostly colonic (57%) in origin. YONEN patients had better survival than YOADC patients. Multivariate analysis in YONEN patients revealed that Hispanic patients had better overall survival compared to White patients (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.95, p=0.024). Racial disparities should be investigated further to aid in policymaking and targeted interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d5fd117b8256e33444cc63da9778fce0b463a8a16f230dfe26e74bf81ba46f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
