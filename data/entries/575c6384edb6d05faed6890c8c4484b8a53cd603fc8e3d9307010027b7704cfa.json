{"title":"Analysis of $d$-Wave Topologies with $k$-Hop-Based Graph Metrics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1116/v1","date":1728985388000,"content":"In this paper, we focus on graph-based analysis of the topology of $D$-Wave quantum computers. The Pegasus, Chimera, and Zephyr topologies generated with different parameters are examined using $k$-hop-based graph metrics. In addition to the well-known classical graph metrics, we briefly describe the density and redundancy-based metrics interpreted in the $k$-hop environment. These topologies consist of different subgraphs depending on the implementation in which the qubits are connected in a specific pattern. Our main goal is to use metrics to highlight the main features and limitations of these topologies. The secondary goal is that the results contribute to the further development of more efficient quantum processors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"575c6384edb6d05faed6890c8c4484b8a53cd603fc8e3d9307010027b7704cfa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
