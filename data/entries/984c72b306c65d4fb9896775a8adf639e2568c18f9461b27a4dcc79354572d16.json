{"title":"Toxicity of Formaldehyde, and the Harmful and Aroma Compounds Derived from It","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0566/v1","date":1728372974000,"content":"Formaldehyde is generated via the biochemical and chemical pathways, and it widely exists in foods. Its chronic exposure causes carcinogenic, neurotoxic, reproductive, allergic, immunological, genetic and respiratory toxicities. However, food-sourced formaldehyde is usually neglected due to its rapid metabolism after intake. Compared with its residual level in processed foods, a large proportion of formaldehyde disappears because of its high reactivity. Nevertheless, its elimination reaction mechanism and the potential consequences remain unclear. In this review, the disappearing pathway of formaldehyde from two aspects, the formation of formaldehyde-derived toxins and aromas, was reviewed. This review article may help food scientists take appropriate strategies to use the beneficial reactions of formaldehyde or divert its harmful effects to beneficial ones.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"984c72b306c65d4fb9896775a8adf639e2568c18f9461b27a4dcc79354572d16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
