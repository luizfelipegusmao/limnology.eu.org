{"title":"Physical, Chemical and Antibacterial Characterization of Hand Sanitizer Lotion Made on Brown Seaweed (Scytosiphon lomentaria)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1860/v1","date":1719405825000,"content":"Although a lot of research has been carried out on hand sanitizer as an effort to prevent Covid-19, there is still limited research on non-alcoholic hand sanitizer lotion from the brown algae Scytosiphon lomentaria (S. lomentaria) as a raw material that provides antibacterial effects and maintains healthy skin. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze microbial inhibitory ability, physical and chemical characteristics of hand sanitizer lotion made from S. lomentaria algae. S. lomentaria powder was tested for phytochemicals, total phenolic content, free radical scavenging activity (IC50), and antibacterial tests. S. lomentaria slurry was prepared by adding distilled water (1:1) for lotion preparations in four treatment groups, such as normal control (lotion base without adding algae), lotion with the addition of algae 20%, 30%, and 40%. The lotion preparations for each treatment group were tested for antibacterial activity of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, phytochemicals, pH, adhesion, spreadability, homogeneity, emulsion type, and hedonic. S. lomentaria powder contains bioactive polyphenolic compounds with a total phenolic content of 117.70±1.40 mg GAE/g dry weight and an IC50 value of 455±3.4 ppm, while lotion with the addition of S. lomentaria contains polyphenols and saponins The best treatment was shown by 40% S. lomentaria hand sanitizer lotion with inhibition of 6.30 ± 0.64 mm E. coli, 6.85 ± 1.12 mm S. aureus, hedonic test for color, texture and absorption with likes to likes very much level, neutral pH, greenish-white color, O/W emulsion type, high adhesion, homogeneous, and easily absorbed by the skin. This research can be an alternative reference in making non-alcoholic hand sanitizer lotion that is safe for the skin.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"11b91e6e8ca1b6db9c5070f15702b34e69d7929b7809f0b11a60adffad74bdb6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
