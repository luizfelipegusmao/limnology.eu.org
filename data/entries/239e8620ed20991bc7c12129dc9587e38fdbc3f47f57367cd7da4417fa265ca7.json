A 42-d study investigated the effects of using advanced chelate technology-based TM (ACTM) or adding varying amounts of ACTM to broiler diets during HS conditions. The study involved 672 male broiler chickens in 7 treatment groups, including a thermoneutral control (TNC) group and six HS treatments. There were 8 replicate pens per treatment and 12 birds per replicate. The six HS treatments included birds exposed to a cyclic HS environment (34°C) for 8 h and were as follows: HSC, which consisted of the same basal diet with the recommended ITM levels; ACTM50 and ACTM100, which replaced the basal diet with 50% and 100% ACTM instead of ITM; ITM+ACTM12.5 and ITM+ACTM25, which involved adding extra ACTM to the ITM basal diet at 12.5% and 25%, respectively; and ITM125, which used 125% of the recommended levels of ITM in the basal diet. Compared with the HSC treatment, the TNC, ACTM100, and ITM+ACTM25 treatments resulted in increased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) body weight; tibia weight; tibia ash, phosphorus, iron, and manganese contents; secondary antibody titers; and serum TAC and SOD values but decreased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) serum MDA concentrations and the expression levels of the hepatic genes IL-1β, IL-6, and INF-γ. The TNC and ACTM100 groups also showed greater (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) feed efficiency, tibia length, tibia zinc content, and hepatic SOD1 expression but exhibited reduced (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) hepatic NF-kB expression. Significant increases (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) in primary anti-NDV titers, serum GPx1 activity, and Nrf2 and GPx1 gene expression levels were also detected in the ACTM100, ITM+ACTM12.5, and ITM+ACTM25 groups. In conclusion, the findings suggest that replacing ITM with ACTM or adding ACTM to ITM diets, especially at a 25% higher dose, can effectively protect broilers from heat stress by promoting growth, reducing inflammation, and increasing the expression of antioxidant proteins.","author":"Taher Mohammadizad","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"239e8620ed20991bc7c12129dc9587e38fdbc3f47f57367cd7da4417fa265ca7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
