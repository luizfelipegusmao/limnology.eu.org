{"title":"Stability of Saltwater‐Freshwater Mixing Zones in Beach Aquifers With Geologic Heterogeneity","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036056?af=R","date":1722427200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Saltwater-freshwater mixing zones in beach aquifers support biogeochemical reactions that moderate chemical loads in fresh groundwater discharging to marine ecosystems. Existing laboratory and numerical modeling studies have demonstrated that fluid density gradients in the mixing zone can lead to free convection and the formation of density instabilities, or salt fingers, under a range of hydrologic, morphologic, and hydrogeologic conditions. However, salt fingers have rarely been observed in real-world beach aquifers despite a growing body of field studies investigating intertidal mixing zones. In this study, we used geostatistical methods to generate randomly distributed assemblages of fine and medium sand and incorporated those geologic realizations into variable-density variably-saturated flow and salt transport simulations to explore the influence of geologic structure on mixing zone stability in tidally-influenced beaches. Ensemble-averaged model results show that geologic heterogeneity inhibits salt finger formation and promotes a stable intertidal mixing zone due to enhanced dispersion. This effect is highest for high degrees of heterogeneity and for more laterally connected geologic architecture. Compared to hydraulically equivalent homogeneous models, sediments with moderate to high heterogeneity produce mixing zones that are on average 19%–29% smaller and 3–10 times more stable due to the absence of the downward convection and seaward movement of salt fingers. The models indicate that geologic heterogeneity may explain the lack of field observations of salt fingers in real-world intertidal mixing zones. The findings have implications for predicting the onset of free convection in beaches and for understanding intertidal pore water biogeochemistry and chemical fluxes to the ocean.</p>","author":"Olasunkanmi Olorunsaye, \nJames W.
