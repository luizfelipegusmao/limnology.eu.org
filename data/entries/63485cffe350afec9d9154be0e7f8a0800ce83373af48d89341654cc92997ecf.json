{"title":"Interactions Between Folic Acid Supplementation and Vitamin B12 Deficiency in Pregnant Women with Celiac Disease and Associated Maternal/Fetal Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2021/v1","date":1724833665000,"content":"Celiac disease is a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten, affecting approximately 1% of the global population and two million Americans. An increasing number of studies have identified a link between celiac disease and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes during pregnancy and after birth. Additionally, both celiac disease and pregnancy are associated with an increased risk for nutrient deficiencies, specifically vitamin B12 and folate. Deficiencies in these key nutrients are linked with several negative maternal and fetal health outcomes including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, spontaneous abortion/miscarriage, preterm birth, NTDs, Intrauterine Growth Restriction, and low gestational age and birthweight. This review examines the current literature related to the folate trap and vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with celiac disease and pregnant women independently, and to provide rationale for future research to explore the correlation between the folate to B12 ratio in pregnant woman with celiac disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63485cffe350afec9d9154be0e7f8a0800ce83373af48d89341654cc92997ecf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
