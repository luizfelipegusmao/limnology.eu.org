This was an exploratory qualitative study using data collected from implementing actors of mass distribution campaigns in the Boké health district. \nResults showed four main facilitators of mass distribution campaigns rollout in Boké health district: i) support to the district teams in the organization of the campaigns; ii) involvement of community-based associations in social mobilization; iii) strong adherence of the communities to the different mass distribution campaigns, facilitated through the involvement of community relays, who are members of these communities, in the distribution of drugs; and iv) transparency in the allocation of incentives to drug dispensers and supervisors. \nHowever, the frequent shortages of medicines, the difficulties of access to rural areas and the lack of logistical means for the su-pervision of activities were the main obstacles to the success of the various mass distribution campaigns in Boké. \nThe provision of buffer stocks for special areas such as Boké by national program actors and partners, joint planning of campaign activities with local managers of health systems and services, and improvement of existing mechanisms for motivating health workers, including community health workers, during future campaigns should help to achieve national objectives in the fight against NTDs in Guinea.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0603b1cb988743592f5f535ba606e0acc438eea8607882481ab38b0f5213a600","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
