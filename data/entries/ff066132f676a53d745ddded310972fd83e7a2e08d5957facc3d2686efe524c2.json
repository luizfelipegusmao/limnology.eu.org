{"title":"Smelling of the mothers’ diet in amniotic fluid by adult noses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjae003/7595408?rss=1","date":1706659200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In this study, the transfer of odorants, namely vanilla, and garlic, into the amniotic fluid (AF) during the second trimester was investigated by examination of collected AF samples through healthy adults. Eleven AF samples were collected from pregnant women (aged 32.9 ± 4.9 yr, 16–25 wk of gestation) undergoing diagnostic amniocentesis after eating garlic oil or vanilla powder in high-fat yogurt. The control group did not receive food before amniocentesis. Two vanilla, 3 garlic, and 6 control samples were collected through amniocentesis 60–120 min after ingestion. Samples were collected at −80 °C and carefully defrosted over 12 h at the same time point. Sixteen healthy volunteers (8 males, aged 26.5 ± 5.0 yr) were asked to judge AF samples with potential garlic or vanilla odors from controls in a 2-alternative forced choice (2AFC) paradigm. Judges were able to identify vanilla in the AF samples with an estimated probability of 50%, resulting in a significant <span>P</span>-value of &lt; 0.001. In contrast, the identification of garlic was unsuccessful with a <span>P</span>-value of 0.86, and only 2 judges were able to identify both vanilla and garlic. According to the results of this study, the vanilla odor probably passes into the amniotic fluid.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"ff066132f676a53d745ddded310972fd83e7a2e08d5957facc3d2686efe524c2","category":"Environment"}
