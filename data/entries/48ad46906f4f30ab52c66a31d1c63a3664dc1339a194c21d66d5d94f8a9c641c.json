{"title":"157 Microbial inoculant effects on limpograss silage","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/389/7757354?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Warm-season perennial grasses are the main forage sources preserved as silage or haylage by livestock producers in subtropical and tropical regions; however, the nutritive value and silage fermentation parameters are often less than desirable. Microbial inoculants have been used to improve grass silage nutritive value and fermentation characteristics with inconsistent results. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of a microbial inoculant on nutritive value and fermentation parameters of ‘Gibtuck’ limpograss (<span>Hemarthria altissima</span>) silage. Treatments were silage treated with SiloSolve FC (68.1 billion CFU/g, <span>Lactobacillus lactis</span> and <span>Lactobacillus buchneri</span>) or control (no microbial inoculant) distributed in a complete randomized design with 10 replicates. The inoculant level used was 0.5 g/Mg of forage. The experiment was conducted in Ona, FL in May 2023. Twenty 4 × 4 m plots of established limpograss were harvested at 15-cm stubble height with 58-d regrowth interval. The forage was chopped to a particle size ranging from 10 to 18 mm, placed into mini-silos (PVC pipes with rubber), and sealed immediately. The inoculant was applied with a hand sprayer before ensiling. The silos were opened after 60 d for analysis. There was no difference (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) between the inoculant and control treatments on DM concentration (25%), DM recovery (96%), NDF (67%), and NFC concentrations (14%); however, silage treated with inoculant had greater CP (8.5 vs. 8.0%; <span>P</span> = 0.03), IVTD (56 vs. 54%; <span>P</span> = 0.01), and NDFD (53 vs. 51%, <span>P</span> = 0.02) and lesser ADF concentrations (38 vs. 40%; <span>P</span> = 0.02) than control. The inoculant did not affect (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) silage pH (4.2) and lactic acid concentrations (1.5%) but resulted in greater acetic acid (2.5 vs. 2.0%; <span>P</span> = 0.01), propionic acid (1.6 vs. 1.0%, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), and total acid concentrations (5.6 vs. 5.0%; <span>P</span> = 0.04), and decreased butyric acid (0 vs. 0.2%; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), isobutyric acid (0.1 vs. 0.4%; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), and NH<sub>3</sub>-N concentrations (4.4 vs. 5.3% N; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Aerobic stability (140 h), mold (1.1 log cfu/g) and yeast (2.2 log cfu/g) count were not affected (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) by the inoculant treatment. At the genus level, there was no difference (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) in relative abundance of <span>Lactobacillus</span> (85%), <span>Enterobacter</span> (4.0%), <span>Enterococcus</span> (1.8%), and <span>Weissella</span> (0.2%) between inoculant and control, but silage treated with inoculant had less <span>Clostridium</span> (1.0 vs. 2.3%, <span>P</span> = 0.04), <span>Pediococcus</span> (0.2 vs. 0.3%, <span>P</span> = 0.03) and greater relative abundance of <span>Lactococcus</span> (2.8 vs. 0.5%, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) and <span>Bacillus</span> (0.2 vs. 0.1%, <span>P</span> = 0.01). At the species level, the inoculant was effective to increase the relative abundance of <span>Lactococcus lactis</span> (from 0.02 to 0.48, <span>P</span> = 0.002) and <span>Lactobacillus buchneri</span> (from 1.4 to 1.9, <span>P</span> = 0.03). SiloSolve FC is a promising microbial inoculant to be used in warm-season grass silage in subtropical and tropical regions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"48ad46906f4f30ab52c66a31d1c63a3664dc1339a194c21d66d5d94f8a9c641c","category":"Environment"}
