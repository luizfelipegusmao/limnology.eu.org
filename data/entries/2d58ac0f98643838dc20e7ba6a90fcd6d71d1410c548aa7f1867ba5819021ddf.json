{"title":"A Simulated Annealing Approach to the Scheduling of Battery-Electric Bus Charging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1863/v1","date":1716891460000,"content":"With an increasing adoption of Battery Electric Bus (BEB) fleets, developing a reliable charging schedule is vital to a successful migration from their fossil fuel counterparts. In this paper, a Simulated Annealing (SA) implementation is developed for a charge scheduling framework for a fixed-schedule fleet of BEBs that utilizes a proportional battery dynamics model, accounts for multiple charger types, allows partial charging, and further considers the total energy consumed by the schedule as well as peak power use. Two generation mechanisms are implemented for the SA algorithm denoted as the \"quick\" and \"heuristic\" implementations, respectively. The model validity is demonstrated by utilizing a set of routes sampled from the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) and comparing the results against two other models: the BPAP and the Qin-Modified. The results presented show that both SA techniques offer a means of generating operationally feasible schedules quickly while minimizing the cost of operation and considering battery health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d58ac0f98643838dc20e7ba6a90fcd6d71d1410c548aa7f1867ba5819021ddf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
