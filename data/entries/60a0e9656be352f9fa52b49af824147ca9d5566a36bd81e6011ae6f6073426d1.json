{"title":"The Relationship between Perceptions of High-Performance Work Systems and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) considering the Moderating Effect of a Positive Diversity Climate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0694/v1","date":1712745250000,"content":"The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between high-performance work systems and a company’s social performance, taking into account the organizational climate as a situational variable. Specifically, this study aimed to analyze the impact of perceptions of a high-performance work system on the perception of a company’s social responsibility (CSR) among employees of Jordanian companies with an organizational size of 300 or more. This study used 175 valid questionnaires, and SPSS and AMOS 24 were used to test the hypotheses. The results showed that there was a positive relationship between the perception of a high-performance work system and the perception of a company’s CSR. Furthermore, this study found that a positive diversity climate could enhance the positive relationship between the two. These findings suggest that high-performance work systems can contribute to the development of sustainable human resource management systems and that a positive diversity climate is essential in shaping these systems. Based on these results, it is recommended that companies implement HPWSs and encourage workforce diversity to maximize the value of CSR activities and ensure their sustainability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60a0e9656be352f9fa52b49af824147ca9d5566a36bd81e6011ae6f6073426d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
