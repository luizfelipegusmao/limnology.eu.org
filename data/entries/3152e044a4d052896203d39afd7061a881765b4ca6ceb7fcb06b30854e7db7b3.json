{"title":"Sustainability evaluation of sports tourism using a linguistic neutrosophic multi-criteria decision-making method","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300341","date":1710770400000,"content":"<p>by Zhenyin Chen, Suizhi Luo, Feng Zheng</p>\r\n\r\nSports tourism represents a novel industrial manifestation of the profound integration between the tourism and sports sectors. The objective of this research is to examine an innovative multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method for the sustainability evaluation of sports tourism. The largest innovations are the expression and treatment of ambiguous data and interdependent evaluation criteria in the sports tourism sustainability evaluation process. On the one hand, intricate assessment data is represented using linguistic neutrosophic numbers (LNNs), which employ three linguistic variables to convey uncertainty and imprecision. On the other hand, to effectively capture the interrelationships among inputs, two novel aggregation operators are proposed. They are devised based on the Einstein operations and Heronian mean operators of LNNs. Subsequently, a linguistic neutrosophic evaluation method utilizing the aforementioned operators is presented. Comparative and sensitivity analyses conclude that great interdependence exists among five different dimensions of sustainability evaluation in sports tourism, and the proposed method can reflect the interrelations among inputs without redundant calculations.","author":"Zhenyin Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3152e044a4d052896203d39afd7061a881765b4ca6ceb7fcb06b30854e7db7b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
