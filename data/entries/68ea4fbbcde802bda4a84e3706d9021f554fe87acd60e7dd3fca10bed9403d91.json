However, the utility of character variation in separate body regions has yet to be tested. The taxonomy of the Gerreidae family is controversial due to character overlapping among its fish species. This work aims to analyze and compare the body shape variation in three regions, cephalic, trunk, and caudal peduncle, using landmark data and geometric morphometric methods in 17 species and five genera of the family Gerreidae. The pattern of shape variation for the cephalic region consisted of well-defined character states exclusive of each species analyzed. Shape variation in the trunk and caudal peduncle regions does not distinguish all species in this study. This study showed that the dorsal cephalic profile is highly variable among the species, therefore, shape variation in this region is useful for distinguishing Gerreidae species. In contrast, some species within the same genus share similar shape states in the trunk and caudal peduncle regions, with the most shape variation in the dorsal profile and anal fin for the trunk and in the middle of the caudal peduncle.</p>","author":"Jorge Guillermo Chollet‐Villalpando, \nFrancisco Javier García‐Rodríguez, \nJosé De La Cruz‐Agüero","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"68ea4fbbcde802bda4a84e3706d9021f554fe87acd60e7dd3fca10bed9403d91","category":"Environment"}
