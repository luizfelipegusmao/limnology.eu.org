{"title":"Dual effects of drying and urban pollution on leaf litter decomposition and shredder consumption in permanent and intermittent streams","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05524-3","date":1725148800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>In the present study we investigated the combined effect of flow intermittence and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent on leaf litter decomposition in two Mediterranean streams with permanent and intermittent flow regimes. The litter decomposition experiment was performed using black poplar litter bags where we measured litter mass loss, fungal biomass, aquatic hyphomycete sporulation and species richness and C:N ratio. Afterwards, the remaining litter material from the different treatments was offered to the shredder <em>Potamophylax latipennis</em> in a microcosm laboratory experiment, and its growth and consumption rates were studied. We hypothesised that drying would decrease leaf litter decomposition in the permanent stream more than in the intermittent stream and that WWTP effluent would compensate for drying effects when both stressors interacted. The results indicated that drying has the greatest impact on the permanent stream, decreasing decomposition, aquatic hyphomycete species richness, and leaf litter quality. In the intermittent stream, WWTP effluent decreases aquatic hyphomycete species richness, but drying increases it, showing an opposing effect and a synergistic interaction. In the permanent stream drying provoked an increase in the shredder consumption rate. Thus, the expected more frequent intermittence in rivers under climate change may threaten the processing of organic matter.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"6c9511532b9f73e3e2ae7a20753c9d6538072c67d2e56bae4421a9cb11fd5a5b","category":"Environment"}
