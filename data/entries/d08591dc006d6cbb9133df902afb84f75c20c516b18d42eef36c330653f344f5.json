{"title":"Kelps may compensate for low nitrate availability by using regenerated forms of nitrogen, including urea and ammonium","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13459?af=R","date":1718080861000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Nitrate, the form of nitrogen often associated with kelp growth, is typically low in summer during periods of high macroalgal growth. More ephemeral, regenerated forms of nitrogen, such as ammonium and urea, are much less studied as sources of nitrogen for kelps, despite the relatively high concentrations of regenerated nitrogen found in the Southern California Bight, where kelps are common. To assess how nitrogen uptake by kelps varies by species and nitrogen form in southern California, USA, we measured uptake rates of nitrate, ammonium, and urea by <i>Macrocystis pyrifera</i> and <i>Eisenia arborea</i> individuals from four regions characterized by differences in nitrogen availability—Orange County, San Pedro, eastern Santa Catalina Island, and western Santa Catalina Island—during the summers of 2021 and 2022. Seawater samples collected at each location showed that overall nitrogen availability was low, but ammonium and urea were often more abundant than nitrate. We also quantified the internal %nitrogen of each kelp blade collected, which was positively associated with ambient environmental nitrogen concentrations at the time of collection. We observed that both kelp species readily took up nitrate, ammonium, and urea, with <i>M. pyrifera</i> taking up nitrate and ammonium more efficiently than <i>E. arborea</i>. Urea uptake efficiency for both species increased as internal percent nitrogen decreased. Our results indicate that lesser-studied, more ephemeral forms of nitrogen can readily be taken up by these kelps, with possible upregulation of urea uptake as nitrogen availability declines.</p>","author":"Lauren E.
