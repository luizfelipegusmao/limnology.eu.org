{"title":"Dietary Lipids and Their Metabolism in the Midgut","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1758/v1","date":1719352473000,"content":"Animals use dietary lipids to sustain their growth and survival. Insects can synthesize fatty acids (FAs) and are autotroph for a number of lipids, but auxotroph for specific lipids classes (e.g. sterols, polyunsaturated FAs). Once ingested, lipids are hydrolyzed in the intestinal lumen and taken up into intestinal cells within specific regions of the insect digestive tract. These lipids can be either stored in the intestinal cells or exported through the haemolymph circulation to specific organs. In this chapter, we describe the various lipids provided by insect diets, their extracellular hydrolysis in the gut lumen and their intake and metabolic fate in the intestinal cells. This review emphasizes the critical role of the digestive tract and its regionalization in processing dietary lipids prior to their transfer to the requiring tissues.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e635572e7d9ee49c1f539cf4c9daab4cb5a49bd61ae94e7776e5860b71a5ed0a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
