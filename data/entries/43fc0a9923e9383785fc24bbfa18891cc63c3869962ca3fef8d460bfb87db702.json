{"title":"Interaction Effects of Macroprudential and Monetary Policies in China: An Empirical Analysis Based on a DSGE Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2162/v1","date":1717157671000,"content":"[Introduction]: In the contemporary international financial environment, marked by intricate complexities and increasing uncertainties, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on national economies has become increasingly significant. In this context, this study uses the Chinese economy as a case study to delve deeply into the interaction effects between macroprudential and monetary policies, analyzing how these policies jointly address economic instability. The aim is to offer new perspectives and strategies for stabilizing the global economic and financial landscape. [Methods]: This paper constructs an open-economy Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model specifically tailored for China, incorporating Bayesian estimation and numerical simulation techniques. The study meticulously examines how macroprudential and monetary policies can be coordinated to achieve economic stability in response to exchange rate shocks. [Results]: The research finds that (1) targeted coordination of macroprudential and monetary policies towards asset prices and price levels can maintain stability under exchange rate shocks; (2) the effective implementation of such coordinated policies not only mitigates the fluctuations in asset prices due to exchange rate shocks but also enhances the level of societal welfare; (3) in terms of choosing an exchange rate regime, a managed floating rate system can prevent policy overlaps and conflicts that might occur in a floating rate system during the coordination of macroprudential and monetary policies, thus offering comparative advantages. [Discussion]: The findings underscore the importance of policy integration in a dynamic and complex global economic environment. They provide policy recommendations for China and other emerging market countries on how to effectively maintain economic stability through the synergistic interplay of macroprudential and monetary policies amid fluctuations in exchange rates and asset prices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43fc0a9923e9383785fc24bbfa18891cc63c3869962ca3fef8d460bfb87db702","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
