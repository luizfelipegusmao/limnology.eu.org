{"title":"Prevalence and risk factors of hearing loss in the Chinese population aged 45 years and older: Findings from the CHARLS baseline survey","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310953","date":1727100000000,"content":"<p>by Xiaoli Xu, Gang Sun, Deping Sun</p>\r\nObjective <p>This study aimed to determine the prevalence of hearing loss and identify associated risk factors in a Chinese population aged 45 years and older.</p> Study design <p>This study employed a cross-sectional research design. Data from the 4th wave survey of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) conducted in 2018 were utilized. Participants were assessed using self-reported questionnaires, and various demographic and comorbidity factors were analyzed to elucidate the risk factors associated with hearing loss.</p> Methods <p>A total of 17,695 individuals from 10,257 households in 450 villages and urban settlements were included in the study. Hearing loss was assessed through self-reported questionnaires. Risk factors, including demographic characteristics and comorbidities, were analyzed to identify associations with hearing loss.</p> Results <p>The study population had a hearing loss prevalence rate of 17.9% (n = 3,179). Regional variations were observed, with highest rates in Chongqing (28.67%), Yunnan (25.12%), and Qinghai (24.36%), and lowest rates in Zhejiang (17.71%), Tianjin (10.56%), and Shanghai (9.26%). Age â‰¥70 was associated with higher risk (OR = 3, p&lt;0.05), while being female was associated with reduced risk (OR = 0.81, p&lt;0.05). Higher education level showed lower risk (OR&lt;1, p&lt;0.05). Non-agricultural workers had lower risk (OR = 0.67, p&lt;0.05). Fewer social activities were correlated with decreased risk (OR = 0.89, p = 0.024). Ethnic minorities had slightly higher risk (OR = 1.23, p&lt;0.05).</p> Conclusion <p>This study provides valuable insights into the prevalence and risk factors associated with hearing loss in the Chinese population aged 45 years and older. The findings emphasize the importance of early detection and intervention, particularly among older individuals and those residing in specific regions, for effective hearing loss management.</p>","author":"Xiaoli Xu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bac16f45c18e5a162148db1e57b6088c1b080b1a84a3618e59ef0e0b9a8c646d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
