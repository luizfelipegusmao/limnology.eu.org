{"title":"Regulation of H9C2 cell hypertrophy by 14-3-3η via inhibiting glycolysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307696","date":1721656800000,"content":"<p>by Sha Wan, Songhao Wang, Xianfei Yang, Yalan Cui, Heng Guan, Wenping Xiao, Fang Liu</p>\r\n\r\nIt has been reported that Ywhah (14-3-3η) reduces glycolysis. However, it remains unclear about the downstream mechanism by which glycolysis is regulated by 14-3-3η in cardiac hypertrophy. As an important regulator, Yes-associated protein (YAP) interacts with 14-3-3η to participate in the initiation and progression of various diseases in vivo. In this study, the model of H9C2 cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was established by triiodothyronine (T3) or rotenone stimulation to probe into the action mechanism of 14-3-3η. Interestingly, the overexpression of 14-3-3η attenuated T3 or rotenone induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and decreased glycolysis in H9C2 cardiomyocytes, whereas the knockdown of 14-3-3η had an opposite effect. Mechanistically, 14-3-3η can reduce the expression level of YAP and bind to it to reduce its nuclear translocation. In addition, changing YAP may affect the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), a glycolysis-related protein. Meanwhile, LDHA is also a possible target for 14-3-3η to mediate glycolysis based on changes in pyruvate, a substrate of LDHA. Collectively, 14-3-3η can suppress cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via decreasing the nucleus translocation of YAP and glycolysis, which indicates that 14-3-3η could be a promising target for inhibiting cardiac hypertrophy.","author":"Sha Wan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c9437bf478d29419fb8d76db819d176f51efd228cbadd51e5830ecf6959ceb25","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
