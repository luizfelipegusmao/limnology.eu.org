{"title":"Next-Generation Block Modeling for Complex Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0352/v1","date":1722939823000,"content":"Research in complex network analysis, including tasks such as information dissemination and link prediction, has traditionally advanced by examining groups of nodes with similar characteristics. In multilayer complex networks, these analyses are performed layer-wise, with each layer representing a distinct feature. However, this approach often neglects interlayer interactions, leading to limited predictive power, underestimation of network resilience, and incomplete identification of influential nodes. This article introduces a novel block modeling technique that integrates dominant features from multiple layers, addressing these shortcomings. Our approach introduces a new centrality metric that combines layer weight and PageRank centrality to identify influential nodes within multilayer networks. Nodes are aggregated into blocks centered around these influencers, accounting for both intra- and interlayer connections. Empirical evaluation of various datasets demonstrates that our method effectively identifies influential nodes, thereby enhancing information dissemination and link prediction across diverse multilayer network structures. This technique offers significant potential for improving decision-making processes in various fields, including social network analysis, transportation systems, and biological networks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0477ce4642c7c45b01d0b87dcd417fdb4c254ad2fbec4118492c1143c198eae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
