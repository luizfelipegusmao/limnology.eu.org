{"title":"Development of Ballistic Protection Soft Panels According to Regulatory Documents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1604/v1","date":1719211434000,"content":"The development of ballistic protection vests (BPVs) has become increasingly significant, particularly in the design of soft panels, which are critical to the overall size and configuration of these vests. Despite their importance, a standardized design process for soft panels is lacking in the literature. This research addresses this gap by creating soft panels tailored to the body types of regional soldiers while adhering to relevant standards. We propose a comprehensive design algorithm and evaluate the applicability of the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) standard 0101.06 test templates for configuring these panels. This study aims to design soft ballistic panels for BPVs that cater to the body type requirements of regional soldiers and comply with NIJ 0101.06 standards. We have developed an algorithm for designing soft panels and analyzed the feasibility of using NIJ test templates for their configuration. The research encompasses a detailed literature review, analysis of existing BPV soft panels, and comparison with NIJ test templates. The panels were designed and scaled using computer-aided design (CAD) systems and evaluated through by physical fitting on mannequins and virtual fitting using the Clo3D program. Our findings indicate that the NIJ standard test templates are only partially applicable to the design of soft panels. The developed methodology includes an algorithm and size specifications tailored to regional covers. A coefficient (K) was identified to calculate the soft panel surface area prior to design, thereby saving time and resources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b82f1c6c6ab9fa1ee4400b458cc1b741f04d34461c54c1cf97ca3a377b8a48a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
