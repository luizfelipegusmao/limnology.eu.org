{"title":"Association between nocturia and serum albumin in the U.S. adults from NHANES 2005–2012","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308980","date":1723730400000,"content":"<p>by Yangtao Jia, Fangzheng Yang, Xinke Dong, Libin Zhou, Huimin Long</p>\r\nBackground <p>Nocturia, a prevalent chronic condition, impacts individuals’ quality of life but remains underexplored. This study aimed to assess the association between serum albumin levels and nocturia.</p> Methods <p>Based on the analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database (2005–2012), our study included a total of 6345 adults (≥20 years old). Nocturia was defined as ≥2 nocturnal voiding episodes. Logistic regression and smooth curve fitting analyzed the linear and nonlinear correlations between serum albumin and nocturia, with subgroup analysis.</p> Results <p>Among 6345 participants, 1821 (28.7%) experienced nocturia. Logistic regression analysis revealed a linear negative correlation between serum albumin and nocturia risk (OR = 0.9549, 95% CI = 0.9280 ~ 0.9827, P = 0.002). Even after quartile division of serum albumin concentration, this correlation persisted within each group, and a smooth curve fitting validated the nonlinear negative correlation between the two. Subgroup analysis further demonstrated significant impacts of body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, and age on this association.</p> Conclusion <p>This cross-sectional study indicated that higher serum albumin levels were associated with a reduced risk of nocturia in U.S. adults aged 20 and older, highlighting the importance of serum albumin in the prevention and treatment of nocturia and providing clinical guidance.</p>","author":"Yangtao Jia","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"30c0f35a14d357ffc3e8ff4f4c4933e71856717b6ab18135f1daffb5584d53e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
