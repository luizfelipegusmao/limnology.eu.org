{"title":"Expanded roles of community health workers beyond malaria in the Asia-Pacific: A systematic review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003113","date":1729087200000,"content":"<p>by Monnaphat Jongdeepaisal, Panarasri Khonputsa, Massaya Sirimatayanant, Worarat Khuenpetch, Elinor Harriss, Richard J. Maude</p>\r\n\r\nIn the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), community health workers (CHWs) are a key component of malaria elimination strategies. As malaria declines, support for, and uptake of, malaria services may also subsequently decrease. Expanding their roles beyond malaria has been proposed to sustain the services. A systematic review was conducted to identify and characterize programmes with CHWs providing services in addition to those for malaria in the Asia Pacific. This review describes the expanded roles, identifies evidence of impact or success of the programmes, and explores strategies to ensure sustainability and factors for effective implementation to inform the design of malaria CHW programmes. Searches were conducted in 6 databases, for grey literature, and in bibliographies of retrieved articles. Data were extracted from 38 published articles, 12 programme reports, and 4 programme briefs and analysed using thematic coding and descriptive analysis. Twenty-nine programmes were identified with CHWs performing both malaria and non-malaria roles in the Asia Pacific. There was evidence of impact on malaria incidence in 4 of these, none on malaria mortality, and 4 on other diseases. Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, multi-sectoral stakeholder collaborations, and adequate training and consistent supervision of CHWs were key to effective programme implementation. Integration of programmes into broader health services, ongoing political and funding support, and engagement with local communities were found to contribute to sustaining provision of health services by CHWs. Expanding CHW roles depends on programme management and strengthening linkages with local health systems. To sustain malaria CHW services, countries need adequate policies and financing, and sufficiently strong health systems to deliver basic health services that are adapted to the health needs of the community which means transitioning away from vertical disease programs. Further research should explore programmes that have not been captured in this review and address gaps in measuring malaria outcomes.","author":"Monnaphat Jongdeepaisal","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"f1bcd5f792b78545b6afe6204a37f9217b685f882c427cf1d869079bb5b23f5d","category":"Environment"}
