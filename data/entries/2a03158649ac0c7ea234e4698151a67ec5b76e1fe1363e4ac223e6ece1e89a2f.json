{"title":"Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) as an Adverse Event to the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Vaccine and its Relationship to Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1712/v1","date":1711614619000,"content":"Gardasil 4, a human papilloma virus vaccine, has been shown to protect against various cancers, including cervical cancer. Common side effects include injection site pain, fever, headaches, and muscle aches. In some individuals, the severe side effect of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) has been reported. POTS is characterized by the abnormal response of lightheadedness, blurry vision, and dizziness while transitioning to an upright posture. POTS predominately affects women, with more than eighty-five (85) percent of POTS patients being female. POTS on average, takes five years and eleven months to receive the diagnosis. Additionally, ​A strong association between POTS and Ehlers Danlos Syndrome Type III (EDS) exists. Eighty (80) percent of patients with EDS have POTS. This severe side effect dictates that providers need to be aware of this strong association of HPV vaccinations and POTS. ​In this report we will present a case of a young women with a past medical history significant for EDS type III who was diagnosed with POTS after receiving Gardasil 4 vaccination. This case demonstrates the need for physicians to be aware of the association of POTS with EDS type III and HPV vaccination. Physician awareness of the associations, signs and symptoms of POTS and earlier testing at the first presentation of signs and symptoms will limit the negative impact on patient’s quality of life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a03158649ac0c7ea234e4698151a67ec5b76e1fe1363e4ac223e6ece1e89a2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
