{"title":"Molecular responses of seaweeds to biotic interactions: A systematic review","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13504?af=R","date":1726766000000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Seaweed farming is the single largest aquaculture commodity with &gt;30 million tonnes produced each year. Furthermore, the restoration of lost seaweed forests is gaining significant momentum, particularly for kelps in warming temperate areas. Whether in aquaculture settings, following restoration practices, or in the wild, all seaweeds undergo biotic interactions with a diverse range of co-occurring or cocultured organisms. To date, most research assessing such biotic interactions has focused on the response of the organism interacting with seaweeds, rather than on the seaweeds themselves. However, understanding how seaweeds respond to other organisms, particularly on a molecular scale, is crucial for optimizing outcomes of seaweed farming or restoration efforts and, potentially, also for the conservation of natural populations. In this systematic review, we assessed the molecular processes that seaweeds undergo during biotic interactions and propose priority areas for future research. Despite some insights into the response of seaweeds to biotic interactions, this review specifically highlights a lack of characterization of biomolecules involved in the response to chemical cues derived from interacting organisms (four studies in the last 20 years) and a predominant use of laboratory-based experiments conducted under controlled conditions. Additionally, this review reveals that studies targeting metabolites (70%) are more common than those examining the role of genes (22%) and proteins (8%). To effectively inform seaweed aquaculture efforts, it will be crucial to conduct larger scale experiments simulating natural environments. Also, employing a holistic approach targeting genes and proteins would be beneficial to complement the relatively well-established role of metabolites.</p>","author":"Tomas Lang, \nScott F.
