{"title":"The Perception Gap Between Special Education School Teachers and Vocational Rehabilitation Practitioners in Teaching Vocational Readiness to Students with Intellectual Disabilities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0974/v1","date":1718369831000,"content":"This study aimed to elucidate the perception gap regarding instructional matters between special education teachers and vocational rehabilitation practitioners involved in transition support in Japan. To this end, 126 vocational support providers affiliated with the Employment and Life Support Centers for persons with disabilities, which are vocational rehabilitation institutions in Japan, and 129 special education teachers from schools for students with intellectual disabilities in Prefecture X, Japan, were surveyed. They were asked to respond on the importance of teaching skills that constitute vocational readiness by means of a questionnaire comprising 25 items across five layers: vocational aptitude, basic work habits, interpersonal skills, daily living management, and health management, both during school and after graduation. The results revealed a perception gap in each of the first layer, vocational aptitude, and second layer, work habits. Additionally, only in the second layer, work habits, did special education teachers recognize the importance of instruction more during the school period than after graduation. Moving forward, it is necessary for both institutions involved in transition support to collaborate, focusing on students with disabilities based on the identified gap.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b8fb93f1278d8e4db3f3bc454369e2a1eaae0d95f1bb26583d7fe2d243f1c528","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
