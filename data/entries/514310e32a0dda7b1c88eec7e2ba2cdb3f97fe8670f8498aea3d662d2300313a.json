{"title":"Effects of Gestational Intermittent Hypoxia on the Respiratory System: A Tale of the Placenta, Fetus and Developing Offspring","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0083/v2","date":1722330202000,"content":"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that is associated with a wide variety of health conditions, including cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, metabolic, neoplastic, and neurocognitive manifestations. OSA as a chronic condition is mainly characterized by repeated upper airway obstructions during sleep that cause episodes of intermittent hypoxia (IH), resulting in tissue hypoxia-reoxygenation cycles. Decreased arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) and hemoglobin saturation (SatO2) stimulate reflex responses to overcome the obstruction. The prevalence of OSA is significant worldwide, and an underrated problem when focusing on women during pregnancy. The physiological changes associated with pregnancy, especially during its latest stages, are related with a higher prevalence of OSA events in pregnant mothers, and associated with an increased risk of hypertension, pre-eclampsia and diabetes, among other deleterious consequences. Furthermore, OSA during pregnancy can interfere with normal fetal development and is associated with growth retardation, preterm birth, or low term weight. Carotid body overstimulation and hypoxia-reoxygenation episodes contribute to cardiovascular disease and oxidative stress, which can harm both mother and fetus and have long-lasting effects that can reach into adulthood. Because IH is the hallmark of OSA, this review examines the literature available about the impact of gestational intermittent hypoxia (GIH) on the respiratory system at maternal, fetal, and offspring levels. Offering the latest scientific data about OSA during pregnancy, we may help to tackle this condition with lifestyle changes and therapeutic approaches, that could influence the mothers, but also impact adult health problems, mostly unknown, inherited from these hypoxic episodes in the uterus.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"514310e32a0dda7b1c88eec7e2ba2cdb3f97fe8670f8498aea3d662d2300313a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
