{"title":"Non-Isocyanate-Polyhydroxyurethanes (NIPHUs) of Epoxidized Soybean Oil for Wound Dressings Applications: Physico-Chemical and Mechanical Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1024/v1","date":1715763890000,"content":"Within the polyurethanes market, only 0.1% are from renewable sources. With the continuing concern about climate change and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the substitution of monomers and processes derived from petrochemical sources is crucial for the development of biomaterials. Therefore, polyhydroxyurethanes have propose due to their synthesis route with the incorporation of monomers from renewable sources such as vegetable oils and the substitution of isocyanates known for their high toxicity, carcinogenicity and petrochemical origin, and the use of carbon dioxide. There are few reports on the use of soybean oil and the possible application of these materials in wound healing applications. Based on this, polyhydroxyurethanes were obtained from carbonated soybean oil and two diamines, one aliphatic: 1,4-butadiamine (putrescine), and one cycloaliphatic: 1,3-cyclohexanobis(methylamine), and they were physiochemically, mechanically, and thermally characterized. Four polyhydroxyurethanes were obtained, with stability to hydrolytic and oxidative media, thermal stability above 200 Â°C, tensile strength between 0.9-1.1 MPa, elongation at break between 81 and 222%. And water absorption up 102% and contact angle between 63,70 and 101,39. Achieving new formulations of biobased NIPHUs that represent a more sustainable process which allow to achieve the physicochemical, mechanical, and thermal properties required for the preparation of wound dressings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7d11ce19da1902e3be0e1ba3559fe40b97587df4ebf4618e0dc91ccd585b683","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
