This review examines the evi-dence behind the GAQ and relevance to our tropical environment. \nMethods: Searches were done via Pubmed, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Resources referenced by the CSEP were hand-searched. The CSEP was also contacted for further information. Evidence behind each GAQ question was compared to inter-national literature and guidelines, where applicable. \nResults: Out of 273 studies, 49 were suitable for analysis. Two GAQ studies commissioned by the CSEP showed a high negative predictive value but high false negative rate.  Of the nine GAQ questions, those on dizziness, joint pains and chronic diseases appear justified. Those on heart disease/stroke, hypertension, breathlessness and concussion require modification. That on syncope can be amalgamated into the dizziness question. The remaining question may be deleted.  No long-term studies were available to validate use of the GAQ. Heat disorders were not considered in the GAQ. \nConclusions: Modification of the GAQ, including inclusion of environmental factors, may make it more suitable for the general population and should be considered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22512ce35432464ee67ab1f5eab020ad5c718944c59b4c518ba93e358c7dfb62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
