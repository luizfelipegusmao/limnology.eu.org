{"title":"How the ecological structure affects the aesthetic atmosphere of the landscape: Evaluation of the landscape Beauty of Xingqing Palace Park in Xi’an","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302855","date":1715781600000,"content":"<p>by Weiwei Jin, Wenyu Miao</p>\r\n\r\nIn landscape appreciation, what tourists directly perceive is the atmosphere of the landscape. This paper introduces the concept of “Ecological Structure” from Gernot Böhme’s theory of atmospheric aesthetics into the assessment of landscapes, utilizing atmosphere as a bridge between horticultural ecology, aesthetics, and culture. It examines the relationship between the objective environment and subjective perception. This study conducted a field survey of Xingqing Palace Park and selected the waterside plant landscape that directly reflects the atmosphere of the royal garden as the research object. In the first stage of this study, Scenic Beauty Estimation was used to evaluate the overall beauty of 32 landscape units; in the second stage, the Delphi method and Analytic Hierarchy Process were used to evaluate the ecological structures that affect the garden landscape atmosphere; in the third stage, the two evaluation results of the Kendall’s W concord coefficient test Analytic Hierarchy Process and Scenic Beauty Estimation have high consistency, which shows that the atmosphere is great value to the beauty of the landscape. This study provides designers with a means to create a garden atmosphere using ecological structures and provides new ideas for landscape design.","author":"Weiwei Jin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1584543a9a9529e81c1cf18eeb354ff95e91bad15232e137418dedad8bba7218","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
