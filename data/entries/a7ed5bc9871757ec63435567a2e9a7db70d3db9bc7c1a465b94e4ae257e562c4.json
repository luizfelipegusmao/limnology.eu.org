In the present study, comparative proteome analysis was performed on serum samples from <i>Vibrio</i>-resistant and <i>Vibrio</i>-susceptible grouper. Samples were analysed using high-throughput LC-MS/MS and identified 2770 unique peptides that corresponded to 344 proteins. Subsequent analysis identified 21 proteins that were significantly up-regulated in the resistant group compared to the control and the susceptible groups. Those proteins are associated with immunostimulatory effects, signalling and binding cascade, metabolism, and maintaining tissue integrity and physiological condition. Besides, potential protein biomarkers related to the immune system were identified, which could be associated with the disease-resistant phenotype. These data provide insights into the underlying immune mechanism of hybrid groupers upon <i>Vibrio</i> sp. infection.</p>","author":"Nurhikmah Abu Aziz, \nAnnie Christianus, \nWan Mohd Syazwan Wan Solahudin, \nIntan Safinar Ismail, \nChen‐Fei Low","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"a7ed5bc9871757ec63435567a2e9a7db70d3db9bc7c1a465b94e4ae257e562c4","category":"Environment"}
