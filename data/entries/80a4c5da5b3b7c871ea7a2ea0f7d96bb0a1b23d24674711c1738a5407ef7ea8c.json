We selected 12 sika deer including six adults and six sub-adults. Key considerations in the design of the natural training were to divide the training spatial ground into two parts (30 × 30 m small areas for isolation of new individuals and large areas measuring 200 × 600 m for free walking), and the importance of gradually reducing concentrated feed quantity while maintaining the same feed ration.\n</p><br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Prey populations significantly influence the distribution of top predators. The sika deer (<i>Cervus nippon</i>), a key prey species for the Amur tiger in Northeast China, plays a critical role in the recovery and dispersal of Amur tiger populations. Reintroduction is a pivotal strategy for restoring prey populations, but it presents challenges, especially in terms of adaptation to the natural environment during the natural training process before animals are released. In this study, we sampled six adult and six sub-adult sika deer and employed high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene to investigate changes in gut microbial diversity, composition, and function during natural training. The results showed that adult sika deer had higher gut microbiota diversity compared to sub-adults. However, as natural training progressed, the gut microbial diversity in sub-adults approached that of adults. Additionally, beneficial, fiber-digesting bacteria associated with adaptation to the natural environment tended to increase during nature training in both adult and sub-adult sika deer, while pathogenic bacteria tended to decrease. We also compared the metabolic function of the gut microbiota in adult and sub-adult sika deer, which showed that the carbohydrate metabolic function of both adults and sub-adults decreased significantly with natural training, declining more rapidly in sub-adults. Conversely, the lipid metabolic function in sub-adults increased significantly with natural training. Overall, a period of nature training is necessary before reintroducing animals to their natural habitats, and sub-adult sika deer, in particular, exhibit greater adaptability to environmental changes as reflected by their gut microbiota dynamics. These findings offer valuable insights for the reintroduction of sika deer and other ungulates. We recommend incorporating natural training in reintroduction programs and prioritizing sub-adult animals for reintroduction.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>猎物种群丰度是影响顶级捕食者分布的最重要因素。梅花鹿作为东北虎的主要猎物之一，对东北虎种群的恢复和扩散起着至关重要的作用。重引入是恢复猎物种群的一种有效方式，但也面临着许多问题，尤其是在自然训练过程中对自然环境的适应问题。在这项工作中，采集了6只成年梅花鹿和6只亚成年梅花鹿的样本，使用16S核糖体RNA (rRNA) 基因的高通量测序来确定成年和亚成年梅花鹿在自然训练过程中肠道微生物多样性、组成和功能的变化过程和差异。结果表明，成年梅花鹿肠道微生物的多样性高于亚成年，但随着训练的进行，亚成年梅花鹿的微生物多样性接近成年的多样性水平。此外，在成年和亚成年梅花鹿的训练过程中，与适应自然环境有关的有益纤维消化菌呈上升趋势，而致病菌呈下降趋势。通过比较成年和亚成年梅花鹿肠道微生物的代谢功能，发现成年和亚成年梅花鹿的碳水化合物代谢功能随着训练的进行而显著下降，亚成年的下降速度更快，而亚成年的脂质代谢功能随着自然训练的进行显著增加。总之，在将动物重引入到自然环境之前，进行一段时间的自然训练是很有必要的，这对亚成年梅花鹿更有积极意义，因为它们的肠道微生物能够更好地应对强烈的环境变化。这些结果为重引入梅花鹿或其他有蹄类动物提供了重要的理论依据。本研究建议，在以后的重引入工作中应增加这种自然训练过程，考虑选择亚成年个体。 【翻译：张文韬】</p>","author":"Wentao Zhang, \nFeifei Yang, \nHeng Bao, \nJiale Sun, \nWannian Cheng, \nShiyu Chen, \nNathan J.
