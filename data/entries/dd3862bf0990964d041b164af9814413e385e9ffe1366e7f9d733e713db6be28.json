Tea and its consumption extract are associated with a lower risk of several types of cancer and have anti-inflammatory and antioxidative biological effects. However, the anti-EMT and anti-cancer stemness effect of black tea ethanol extracts (BTEE) in human melanoma remain poorly understood. In this study, the effects of BTEE-reduced invasiveness, EMT, and cancer stemness were evaluated in human A 375 and A2058 melanoma cells. BTEE inhibited the activity of u-PA, migration, and invasiveness by repressing p-FAK signaling pathway. BTEE affected the EMT by downregulating the expression of <i>β</i>-catenin, <i>N</i>-cadherin, fibronectin, vimentin, and Twist-1. BTEE also reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced invasiveness and cancer stemness characteristics in vitro. The growth of melanoma in nude mice xenograft model showed that BTEE suppressed A 375 tumor growth in vivo.</p>","author":"Chin‐Yin Lin, \nShu‐Chen Chu, \nYih‐Shou Hsieh, \nWen‐Yi Tsai, \nPei‐Ni Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"dd3862bf0990964d041b164af9814413e385e9ffe1366e7f9d733e713db6be28","category":"Environment"}
