{"title":"Adherence to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Therapy (CPAP) in Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): A Prospective Single-Centre Study Assessing Impact on Quality of Life and the Cues to CPAP Use","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1419/v1","date":1721207913000,"content":"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) often goes unrecognized despite common symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and impaired quality of life (QoL). CPAP is the gold standard treatment for OSA, but optimal daily usage and time needed for observable effects remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the short-term effects of CPAP on daytime sleepiness and QoL in patients with severe OSA. Medical records were collected from 87 patients with severe OSA who initiated CPAP therapy. Also, validated questionnaires were used before and after one month of CPAP to analyze QoL - the Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI), the Cues to CPAP Use Questionnaire (CCUQ), and daytime sleepiness - the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of CPAP usage. Of the total participants aged 55.6±12.5, 77% were males, and 62% were CPAP adherent. Reductions in daytime sleepiness (ESS) were noted, as well as improvements in both overall QoL (SAQLI) and specifically in the domains of daily functioning, social interactions, emotional well-being, and symptom perception. Important cues for CPAP usage recognized by patients were physicians’ instructions and physicians’ worry regarding patients' condition. Furthermore, multiple regression revealed higher SAQLI scores and lower ESS scores as positive predictors of CPAP usage, along with lower AHI after one month of CPAP being associated with sufficient adherence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ece51ec9320a7652b6a8aa47aedc9211ef89e4f22f6cfb1c487708b9fdefc0a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
