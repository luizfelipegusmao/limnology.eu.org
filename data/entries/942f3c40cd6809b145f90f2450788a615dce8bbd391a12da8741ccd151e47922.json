{"title":"A Buffered Local Anesthetic Without Epinephrine: Development, Characterization, and In Vivo Efficacy and Toxicity Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1859/v1","date":1721797039000,"content":"Lidocaine hydrochloride (HCl) 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine (LW/E) is widely used to prevent pain during dental procedures and has been associated with injection sting, jittering effects, slow onset, and a bitter aftertaste. Since LW/E's introduction in 1948, no significant modifications have been proposed. This study aims to design and characterize an improved dental lidocaine HCl injectable formulation without epinephrine (LW/O/E) via buffers, sweeteners, and amino acids. LW/O/E injections were prepared with pH and osmolality values of 6.5 â€“ 7.0 and 590-610 mOsm/kg. Using the electronic tongue (ETongue), the LW/O/E injectable formulations were characterized for viscosity, injectability, and taste analysis. The results were compared with the LW/E control. In vivo efficacy and anesthetic duration of the samples were measured through radiant heat tail-flick latency (RHTFL) and hot plate (HP) tests and local toxicity was assessed after a single intra-oral injection in Sprague Dawley rats (SDR). The viscosity and injectability values of the LW/O/E samples were found to be comparable to the LW/E injection. ETongue taste analysis showed an improvement in bitterness reduction of the LW/O/E samples compared to the LW/E formulation. Toxicity studies of samples in SDR showed minor and transient signs of erythema/eschar and edema. Anesthetic duration via RHTFL and HP paw withdrawal latency time in SDR were found to be comparable for the LW/O/E Sample 3A and the LW/E injection (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"942f3c40cd6809b145f90f2450788a615dce8bbd391a12da8741ccd151e47922","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
