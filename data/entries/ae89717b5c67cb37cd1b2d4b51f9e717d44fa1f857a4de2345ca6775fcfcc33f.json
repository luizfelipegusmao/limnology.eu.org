{"title":"Mapping Balsam Fir (Abies balsamea) Christmas Tree Nutrition Requirements Using Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles and Multispectral Sensing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1296/v1","date":1711014723000,"content":"Balsam fir trees are a specialty agricultural species that are largely used as Christmas trees. Soil or tissue sampling is seldom performed to assess balsam fir nutrition needs, which can contribute to over or under fertilization and subsequent environmental challenges. Remote sensing to determine the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has had strong relationships with nutrition in other plants. This research aimed to determine whether there is a relationship between NDVI and nutrition in balsam fir. A random sample of 45 trees was selected in autumn of 2021 and then another 70 trees selected in spring of 2022. Soil and needle tissue samples were analyzed for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Zn, Mn, B, and Cu. An uncrewed aerial vehicle equipped with a multispectral camera was flown over the orchard to determine the NDVI for each tree. Nutrition and NDVI were analyzed for correlations through all sampled trees. Separate correlation analyses were repeated for mature trees (greater than 5 years old) and young trees (less than 5 years old). Soil nutrients N, P, K had a significant relationship with NDVI in autumn sampling. Only N was correlated consistently in both autumn and spring, with R2 of 37% and 33% respectively. Relationships were much stronger when only mature trees were considered, increasing to 60% and 51% respectively. NDVI was found to offer predictive power for tissue N that can be useful to producers to help optimize fertilizer input. However, further work is needed to refine these relationships.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ae89717b5c67cb37cd1b2d4b51f9e717d44fa1f857a4de2345ca6775fcfcc33f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
