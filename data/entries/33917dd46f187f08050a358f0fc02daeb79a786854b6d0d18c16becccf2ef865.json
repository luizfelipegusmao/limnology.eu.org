The dinoflagellate <i>Amyloodinium ocellatum</i> is responsible for amyloodiniosis, a parasitological disease with a strong economic impact in temperate and warm water aquaculture, mainly in earthen pond semi-intensive systems. Amyloodiniosis represents one of the most important bottlenecks for aquaculture and, with the predictable expansion of the area of influence of this parasite to higher latitudes due to global warming it might also be a threat to other aquaculture species that are not yet parasitized by <i>A. ocellatum</i>. This review made a compilation of the existing knowledge about this parasite and the disease associated with it. It was noticed that, except from the life cycle characterisation, detection methods, histopathological analysis, and treatments, there are still a lot of areas that need a further investment in research. Areas like parasite–host interactions, epidemiological models, taxonomy, host physiological responses to parasitism, and genome sequencing, amongst others, can contribute to a better understanding of this disease. These proposed approaches and routes of investigation will enhance and contribute to a more standardised knowledge, creating the opportunity for a better understanding of amyloodiniosis impacts on fish and contributing for the development of new tools against <i>A. ocellatum</i>, that may reduce fish mortality in aquaculture production due to amyloodiniosis outbreaks.</p>","author":"Márcio Moreira, \nBenjamín Costas, \nPedro M.
