{"title":"The wall-associated receptor-like kinase CsWAKL01, positively regulated by the transcription factor CsWRKY53, confers resistance to citrus bacterial canker via regulation of phytohormone signaling","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/18/5805/7686091?rss=1","date":1717113600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Citrus bacterial canker (CBC) is a disease that poses a major threat to global citrus production and is caused by infection with <span>Xanthomonas citri</span> subsp. <span>citri</span> (<span>Xcc</span>). Wall-associated receptor-like kinase (WAKL) proteins play an important role in shaping plant resistance to various bacterial and fungal pathogens. In a previous report, CsWAKL01 was identified as a candidate <span>Xcc</span>-inducible gene found to be up-regulated in CBC-resistant citrus plants. However, the functional role of CsWAKL01 and the mechanisms whereby it may influence resistance to CBC have yet to be clarified. Here, CsWAKL01 was found to localize to the plasma membrane, and the overexpression of the corresponding gene in transgenic sweet oranges resulted in pronounced enhancement of CBC resistance, whereas its knockdown had the opposite effect. Mechanistically, the effect of CsWAKL01 was linked to its ability to reprogram jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and abscisic acid signaling activity. CsWRKY53 was further identified as a transcription factor capable of directly binding to the <span>CsWAKL01</span> promoter and inducing its transcriptional up-regulation. <span>CsWRKY53</span> silencing conferred greater CBC susceptibility to infected plants. Overall, these data support a model wherein CsWRKY53 functions as a positive regulator of CsWAKL01 to enhance resistance to CBC via the reprogramming of phytohormone signaling. Together these results offer new insights into the mechanisms whereby WAKLs shape phytopathogen resistance while underscoring the potential value of targeting the CsWRKY53â€“CsWAKL01 axis when seeking to breed CBC-resistant citrus plant varieties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"07ff64d9635e84e643a7f6846e57868e6fdec3b6e60b49fb5179567d64c67ae5","category":"Environment"}
