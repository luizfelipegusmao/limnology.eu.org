{"title":"Global Patent Analysis of Battery Recycling Technologies: A Comparative Study of Korea, China, and the United States","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1249/v1","date":1716214330000,"content":"This study provides a comprehensive analysis of global patent trends in battery recycling, focusing on secondary batteries and related technologies across Korea, China, and the United States. The data, collected from various patent databases, was quantitatively analyzed to identify technology trends and direct future development. The analysis reveals distinct emphases on technologies such as lithium-ion and waste battery recycling, highlighting notable differences in patent activities among key companies and countries. China's large number of patents in battery manufacturing processes contrasts with the USA's focus on electrochemical cell construction and storage systems, while Korea shows significant activity in waste battery technology. The study underscores the competitive landscape and innovation efforts in the battery recycling sector, providing insights into the technological focuses and priorities of each country. It also identifies key challenges, such as the need for consistent innovation and broader geographic coverage in Korea, enhancing patent influence and international presence in China, and ensuring high patent quality and fostering innovation in lagging sectors in the United States. Addressing these challenges through enhanced collaboration, increased R&amp;D investments, and supportive policies is crucial for strengthening the global position and driving further innovation in the battery recycling sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4ba41e05f2bfefc12716b45ea3aef70d21b79eb67346fb93c98c8585dadcc83","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
