Their consequences for health range from skin reactions to major psychological distress. However, epidemiological data is still lacking. This study estimated the incidence of general practice consultations related to bed bugs in France and evaluated factors associated with repercussions on everyday life. We conducted a prospective observational study from March 2019 to April 2020 among 217 GPs in France. Annual and monthly GP consultations related to bed bugs were estimated from the reported cases. Descriptive analyses were performed, and factors associated with repercussions on everyday life were assessed using a logistic regression model. The annual incidence rate of GP consultations related to bed bugs was estimated at 109 per 100,000 inhabitants [95%CI: 92–126]. Bed bug-related consultations occurred in all regions, peaking in the summer. Moderate-to-severe repercussions on everyday life were reported by 39% of the patients. The associated factors with this level of repercussions were: having seen bed bugs (OR = 4.02 [95%CI: 1.6–10.73]), having lesions from scratching (OR = 5.25 [1.65–19.92]), having lesions on the head and the neck (OR = 3.97 [1.52–10.95]) and reporting psychological distress (OR = 6.79 [2.47–20.42]). This study provides new knowledge on GP consultations related to bed bugs in France. These data will help tailor public health programs to the population’s needs, including information and training for primary healthcare professionals.","author":"Bérenger Thomas","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f7019936afa28664c96e9693643641af273c1e99afbdaef9c6d18d34a0a97983","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
