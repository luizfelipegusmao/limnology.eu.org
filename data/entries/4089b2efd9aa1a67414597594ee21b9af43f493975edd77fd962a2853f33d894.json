{"title":"Intersectional Development: How Seaweed Farming in Kwale County, Kenya Can Foster Inclusive and Transformational Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1261/v1","date":1711008330000,"content":"Seaweed farming has been growing in prominence in the coastal region of Kwale County, Kenya, as a livelihood led by women since the turn of the century, however the sector remains far below its full productive capacity. As such, this study explores the factors that influence women’s ability to access seaweed farming through engagements with the theories of intersectionality. The Blue Empowerment Project is seeking to upscale seaweed farming in this region to promote women’s empowerment and this study questions the extent to which men should be included in such an endeavour. It finds that several factors may intersect with gender to create varying levels of (dis)advantage amongst women in this region, and that we may need to reframe the conceptualisation of women’s empowerment to be inclusive of men. This study therefore makes a range of recommendations for the BEP, development practitioners in general, and researchers to inform them of how women’s empowerment initiatives may be made more inclusive and transformational.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4089b2efd9aa1a67414597594ee21b9af43f493975edd77fd962a2853f33d894","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
