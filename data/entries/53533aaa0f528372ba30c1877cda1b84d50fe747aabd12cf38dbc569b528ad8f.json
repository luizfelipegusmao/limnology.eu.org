{"title":"Finding a Direct method for a Dynamic process: the DD (Direct and Dynamic) Cell-Tox method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1328/v1","date":1713767776000,"content":"The main focus of the in vitro toxicity assessment methods is on the viability of the cells, which is usually based on metabolism changes. Yet, when exposed to toxic substances, the cell triggers multiple signals in response. With this in mind, we have developed a promising cell-based toxicity method that observes various cell responses when exposed to toxic substances (either death, division or remaining viable). Based on the collective cell response, we observed and predicted the dynamics of the cell population to determine the toxicity of the toxicant. The method was tested with two different conformations: In the first conformation, we exposed a monoculture model of blood macrophages to UV light, hydrogen peroxide, nutrient deprivation, tetrabromobisphenol A, fatty acids and 5-fluorouracil. In the second, we exposed a coculture liver model consisting of hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells to rifampicin, ibuprofen and 5-fluorouracil. The method showed good accuracy compared to established toxicity assessment methods. In addition, this approach provided more representative information on the toxic effects of the compounds as it considers the different cellular responses induced by toxic agents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53533aaa0f528372ba30c1877cda1b84d50fe747aabd12cf38dbc569b528ad8f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
