Yttrium Orthoferrite, a ferrimagnetic material known for its potential applications in spintronics and photonics, was deposited on single-crystal substrates under controlled conditions to analyze its optical characteristics. The influence of deposition time, on the film quality and optical properties was examined.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cccc6819b199e126d1857a3ae96303813239cb1a38fe54321c2698541c8cb562","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
