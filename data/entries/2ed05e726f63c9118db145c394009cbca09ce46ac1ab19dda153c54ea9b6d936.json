{"title":"A Comparison for Infantile Mortality of Crucial Congenital Heart Defects in Korea over a Five-year Period","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1661/v1","date":1729582249000,"content":"Background: Nearly half of congenital heart defects (CHDs) related mortality occur during infancy although advancement in treatments have increased the survival rates. This study comprehensively examines overall and surgical mortality of CHD infants with the highest mortality in an effort to improve our understanding of CHD epidemiology.\nMethods: Participants were drawn from a dataset of 1,964,691 infants born between 2014 and 2018 in Korea. Target patients defined as those with crucial CHDs including classical critical CHDs and diverse categorical defects but excluding simple shunt defects. Overall mortality (procedural and natural mortality) and procedural mortality (interventional and surgical mortality) for infants were analyzed. \nResults: Performance rate of multiple procedures in infants with crucial CHDs was 16%. Overall and surgical mortalities of crucial CHDs were 8% and 7%. Mortalities of palliative procedures were relatively high. Procedural mortalities for infants were significantly decreased in tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), atrioventricular septal defects, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) compared with overall mortalities for infants. Surgical mortalities for infants involving TOF and TAPVR were significantly lower, but those for infants involving hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) was higher than the those for all ages.  \nConclusions: Palliative procedural technique in infants must be improved to obtain better outcome particularly in palliative surgery of HLHS. The infantile procedural outcomes for TOF and TAPVR are excellent and important to overcome disastrous circumstances during infancy. This comprehensive study of overall and procedural mortalities of CHDs may lay a cornerstone for CHD epidemiology in Korean infants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ed05e726f63c9118db145c394009cbca09ce46ac1ab19dda153c54ea9b6d936","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
