Universal Control, for example, lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> devices, and it's now possible to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> directly to a Mac from an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, ‌iPad‌, or even another Mac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSafari has an updated tab bar and support for Tab Groups to keep tons of tabs organized, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> now features support for spatial audio, Portrait Mode (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Macs only) and Voice Isolation for cutting out background noise. A SharePlay ‌FaceTime‌ feature lets <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> users watch TV, listen to music, and share their screens with one another.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nShared With You, another new feature, keeps track of the music, links, podcasts, news, and photos that people are sent in Messages, highlighting it in the relevant apps. Notes has a new Quick Note feature for jotting down thoughts, and the Shortcuts app is now available on the Mac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA dedicated Focus mode helps people stay on task by cutting out background distractions based on what's going on, and there's an updated Maps app with a whole slew of new features. With Live Text, Macs can now detect text in photos or provide details on animals, art, landmarks, plants, and more in images.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMail Privacy Protection hides IP and prevents tracking through invisible pixels, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Private Relay keeps Safari browsing protected.
