However, the high electron sensitivity inherent in biological samples leads to a low signal-to-noise ratio and low contrast in EM images. While cryo-EM single particle analysis usually records microscopic movies with high defocus to improve contrast, high-defocus condition attenuates low-frequency information and rapidly reverses high-frequency information in the phase contrast transfer function (PCTF) [<a href=\"#ozae044.949-B2\">2</a>], which causes difficulties in accurate identification, classification and alignment of particles to a common reference.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"57efef45537d5086e29d2b79b832edaafb5d7064908354a7b08981cec9ccb213","category":"Environment"}
