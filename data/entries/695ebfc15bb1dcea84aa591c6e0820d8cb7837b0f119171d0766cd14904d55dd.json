The challenge is even greater when it comes to isolating genomic DNA from mammalian spermatozoa, as DNA is tightly packed into a cell with a robust membrane rich in disulfide bonds. Here we describe a method for isolating high molecular weight DNA from Bovine commercial semen straws. This protocol includes a cleaning step to remove diluents and preservatives used for the long-term storage of the semen, which may affect long read sequencing. It is based on a simple salting-out method and avoid the use of spin columns, strong mixing or intensive centrifugation, in order to limit DNA fragmentation. However, we have adapted this protocol to facilitate the disruption of cell membranes and disulfide bonds with strong chaotropic and reducing agents. The average size of the fragments produced was approximately 49 kb, ranging from 25 to 85 kb, according to the femto pulse profiles.This method was used to isolate DNA from semen straws, more than 80 of them were successfully sequenced using the Continuous Long-Read (CLR) sequencing mode on the PacBio SequelII platform to study genome diversity and notably to detect large structural variations within genomes.","author":"Erwan Denis","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"695ebfc15bb1dcea84aa591c6e0820d8cb7837b0f119171d0766cd14904d55dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
