{"title":"Machine Learning Discoveries of ABC Transporter-X Synergy in ETC-1922159 Treated Colorectal Cancer Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0908/v1","date":1726067358000,"content":"Often, in biology, we are faced with the problem of exploring relevant unknown biological hypotheses in the form of myriads of combinations of factors/genes/proteins that might be affecting the pathway under certain conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells treated with ETC-1922159, many genes were found up and down regu- lated, individually. A recently developed search engine ranked combinations of ATP- binding cassette (ABC) transporters-X (X, a particular gene/protein) at 2nd order level after drug administration. These rankings reveal which ABC-X combinations might be working synergistically in CRC. If found true, oncologists can further test the com- bination of interest in wet lab and determine the mechanism of functioning between the ABC and X. In this research work, we cover combinations of ABC with ubiquitin- conjugating enzymes (UBE2), Interleukin (IL), BCL and Caspase (CASP).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e43a73220b612081930bc237f8973d0a39625c38ea8dc5d289a4db0c4808fd6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
