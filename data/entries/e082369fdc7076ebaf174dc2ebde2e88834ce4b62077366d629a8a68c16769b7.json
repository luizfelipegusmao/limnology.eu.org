{"title":"Supply Chain Management for the Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) Model: A Review and Bibliometric Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1693/v1","date":1729585752000,"content":"China's \"Going Out\" strategy and the \"Belt and Road\" initiative have significantly propelled the expansion of overseas contractual engagements, with a pronounced impact in the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) sector. EPC contracting is increasingly recognized for its superior resource allocation and integration efficiency. Within the EPC framework, procurement is pivotal, exerting a direct influence on project cost, schedule, and quality parameters. This paper argues that the incorporation of supply chain management into the procurement processes of international EPC projects can optimize efficiency and mitigate costs. Through forging collaborative partnerships with suppliers and stakeholders, EPC contractors may realize enhanced project outcomes. While the integration of supply chains has been efficaciously realized in the manufacturing domain, its transposition to the construction industry is nascent and predominantly resides within the ambit of scholarly inquiry. The present discourse endeavors to elucidate the imperatives and methodologies for supply chain integration within the procurement management of international EPC ventures, thereby furnishing both theoretical and pragmatic guidance for principal contractors. An extensive literature review and bibliometric analysis conducted herein delineate extant research lacunae and articulate prospective trajectories for scholarly exploration in the procurement management sphere of international EPC projects. The advocated integrative modality seeks to deliver a systemic and holistic solution framework conducive to the triumphant execution of EPC projects, engendering viable avenues and opportunities for the advancement and symbiosis within the pertinent industrial sectors. The integration of supply chain management in EPC projects is a burgeoning field that holds significant potential for advancing sustainability in construction. As the industry moves toward greener practices, the role of EPC contractors in driving sustainable procurement and project management becomes increasingly vital.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e082369fdc7076ebaf174dc2ebde2e88834ce4b62077366d629a8a68c16769b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
