{"title":"Antimicrobial Resistance Elements in Coastal Water Identified from Llanquihue Lake, Chile","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0310/v1","date":1717589590000,"content":"Antimicrobial resistance has been stated to be a global health problem. In Chile, the use of antibiotics should be declared by medical prescription, however, it is unknown what happens to the drugs once the treatment ends. One possibility is that these end up being disposed of in the trash or down the drain. In both scenarios, antibiotics could accumulate in the environment, stimulating the emergence of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and their transfer between microorganisms. Unfortunately, sometimes wastewater ends up in bodies of water, due to the dragging of elements by rain, or by the presence of illegal water discharges. In this work, we use shotgun metagenomics to elucidate the functional and microbial composition of biohazard elements in the bay of Puerto Varas City, Chile. As expected, we found a high diversity in microbial communities, with bacterial elements described as human or animal pathogens. Also, we detect a diverse repertory of virulence and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs), related with macrolides, beta-lactams, and tetracyclines resistance, which are consistent with the families of antibiotics most used in Chile. Similar ARGs were identified in DNA mobile elements. In addition, we tested the AMR ability in 20 bacterial strains recovered from the Llanquihue lake. This is the first report of the presence of genomic elements that could constitute a health problem for the people who live around the Llanquihue Lake of Chile, considering the importance of the interconnection between environmental, animal, and human health, a concept known as One Health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8258d2bc02d728d2b80faf124c709b890240f1e32c5f1ce06281a5e5bbe363ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
