The system uti- lizes the MediaPipe face mesh model for facial landmark detection and calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to determine the eye state. Results demonstrate high accuracy and responsiveness, indicating po- tential applications in driver drowsiness detection, human-computer interaction, and medical diagnostics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39a434379142b562200679e53840c17d7776744763e1ec8896e3efe2ceb06ae9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
