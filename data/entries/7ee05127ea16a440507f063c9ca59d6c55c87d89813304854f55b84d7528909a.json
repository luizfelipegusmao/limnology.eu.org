{"title":"Outcomes of Active Middle Ear Implants: Speech Perception and Quality of Life","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1717/v1","date":1721825202000,"content":"Abstract Objective: To evaluate audiological outcomes, quality of life, and complications in patients implanted with Active middle ear implants (AMEI). The secondary objective is to investigate the required duration after implantation to reach satisfactory outcomes. Methods: This retrospective study included 31 patients implanted with Active middle ear implants (AMEI) with different methods of floating mass transducer attachment. Patients with incomplete medical records and those who did not respond to postoperative follow-up were excluded. Patients were assessed preoperatively, and at one, three, and six months postoperatively. The assessment included Pure Tone Average (PTA4), Speech Reception Threshold (SRT) and Speech Discrimination Score (SDS). The Speech Spatial and Qualities of Hearing scale (SSQ12) was also used to evaluate levels of satisfaction. Result: There are no significant differences found in PTA and SRT between the 3-, 6-, and 12-month visits. The speech reception threshold (SRT) showed a statistically significant improvement at 3, 6, and 12 months post-operative measures compared to pre-operative. Additionally, the SDS exhibited a significant increase only after 12 months, compared to the 3-month time point. However, satisfaction levels did not significantly differ between the 6-month and 12-month measurements following surgery.  Conclusion: Vibrant Sound bridge improves subjective satisfaction scores and audiological test scores in patients with different types of hearing loss. AMEI has a low risk of medical or surgical complications, the ease of using a hearing implant, and the social benefits of good hearing and communication.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ee05127ea16a440507f063c9ca59d6c55c87d89813304854f55b84d7528909a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
