{"title":"Enhancing Medical Tourism In Bali: A Readiness Analysis of Siloam Hospital Through Actor-Network Theory (ANT)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0091/v1","date":1725327181000,"content":"This study evaluates the preparedness of Siloam Hospital Bali for medical tourism using Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to analyze human and non-human interactions within social networks. The objective is to identify factors influencing the hospital's readiness. Data was collected through interviews with hospital administration, specialized physicians, local officials, and tourism organization members, supplemented by document and archival research. Network visualization with GraphCommons.com revealed interaction patterns, key actors, and potential impediments. The results show that effective hospital administration, professional care by doctors, and cooperation with tourism groups and local authorities significantly impact the hospital's readiness. However, dependencies on core nodes, lack of redundancy, and underutilization of peripheral nodes are vulnerabilities. Recommendations include enhancing integration with peripheral nodes, establishing network redundancy, involving educational institutions, and aligning with international insurance and immigration policies. This study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of medical tourism dynamics and offers strategies to enhance Siloam Hospital's readiness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76a5694648bab3147c2b370b1506726e7bb4ba032a5b760b61e55f825a79134b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
