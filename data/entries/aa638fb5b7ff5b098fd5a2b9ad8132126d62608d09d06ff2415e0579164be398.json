{"title":"Pharmacological Dose of Vitamin C Promotes Apoptosis by Induces Caspases -3 to -9, Inhibits Matrix Metalloproteinases, Reduces Cell Cycle Proteins, and Enhances Tumor Suppressor Genes Expression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1201/v1","date":1729009235000,"content":"Breast cancer is currently the second leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 15% of all deaths (8.2 million deaths). Approximately 20% of breast cancer diagnoses are triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a type of cancer that lacks receptors for estrogen (ER negative), progesterone (PR negative), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu negative). Consequently, TNBC doesnâ€™t respond to hormonal or targeted therapies, making it challenging to treat due to its rapid growth, metastasis, and high recurrence rate within the first three years of therapy. Alternative chemotherapies are needed to address this problem. Pharmacological dose of vitamin C (high-dose VC) has been identified as a potential treatment for some cancer cells. The present study aimed to evaluate whether VC has a therapeutic effect on TNBC using MDA-MB-231 cells as the model. MTT assay, Hoechst 33342 staining, Nuclear ID Red/Green staining, Rhodamine 123 staining, and Western blot analysis were employed to test the hypothesis that pharmacological dose of VC can kill TNBC cells. Upregulation of Apaf-1, caspases -3, -6, -7, -8, and -9, inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), reduction in cell cycle protein expression, and enhancement of tumor suppressor proteins such as p53 and p21 indicated that pharmacological dose of VC has promising anti-cancer properties in the treatment of TNBC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa638fb5b7ff5b098fd5a2b9ad8132126d62608d09d06ff2415e0579164be398","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
