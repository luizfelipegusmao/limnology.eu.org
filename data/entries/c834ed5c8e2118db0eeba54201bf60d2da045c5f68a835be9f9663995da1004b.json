{"title":"69 The Holos model for estimating greenhouse gases and soil carbon: Characterizing regionalized beef farm model systems","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/307/7757458?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this work is to characterize regionally representative beef farm systems that represent dominant or typical surveyed management practices for 11 beef-producing regions across Canada. This work fulfills two further purposes 1) to improve and expand the Holos model interface; and 2) to facilitate the estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and soil carbon (C) changes on beef farms in different regions of Canada. Holos version 4 is the whole-farm model of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s to estimate GHG emissions and changes in soil C on Canadian farms in response to shifts in management practices. Holos can be implemented in all 10 Canadian provinces and accounts for GHG emissions from crop and livestock production [enteric and manure methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), manure and soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions], farm machines and infrastructure [on-farm energy carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions], as well as from the upstream production of some farm inputs (synthetic fertilizer and pesticides). The model is designed to utilize data readily available on the farm to answer, ‘What if?’ scenarios, whereby the user can test the effect of changing management practices on their whole-farm GHG budget. To reduce the data input burden on the user, Holos V4 has built-in model livestock systems for beef, dairy, swine and poultry production that characterize the dominant features of these operations in Canada at the national scale based on relevant literature/data and expert opinion. Regarding beef production, we have characterized regionally specific model beef farms for incorporation into Holos, one for each of 11 Canadian beef-producing regions. General characteristics and management practices for each farm were based on the 2011 Beef Farm Survey (Sheppard et al., 2015), which summarizes management information from 1,009 Canadian beef farms, combined with data from the Canadian Cow-Calf Cost of Production Network (Canfax 2023). Each regional farm includes cow-calf, backgrounding in confinement, backgrounding on pasture and finishing components, and considers all the specific feed (e.g., forage, grains, by-products) required for each stage of the beef cycle. These 11 model farms are simulated within the current Holos V4 model to explore the impacts of variation in beef management practices on farm GHG emissions across Canada and on soil C stocks on lands used to produce feed and graze cattle. An overview of the national-level dairy, swine and poultry components in Holos will be presented along with a more detailed perspective of whole-farm GHG budget and multi-decadal soil C dynamics in regionalized beef farms. The impact of management and environmental factors that lead to differences in GHG emissions and soil C stocks in beef farms will also be explored.
