{"title":"Does women’s decision-making autonomy matter in utilization of antenatal care services in India? An analysis from nationally representative survey","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308576","date":1724335200000,"content":"<p>by Koyel Majumder, Mithun Sarkar, Rahul Mallick, Sabbir Mondal, Pradip Chouhan</p>\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to examine the association between women’s decision-making autonomy and utilization of antenatal care services among ever-married women in India. The entire study has been accomplished with the help of secondary data composed from the latest round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) conducted during 2019–21. A total of 34,618 ever-married women aged 15–49 with at least one live birth preceding five years of the survey have been taken into consideration in this study. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted for proper illustration of the outcome. A sizable proportion of women did not fulfill the WHO-recommended criterion of obtaining ANC services. Utilization of full ANC services is found in some regions of southern, eastern, northern, and northeastern states, and in some districts of Gujarat. After adjusting the other explanatory variables, the result of multivariate analysis indicates that women’s autonomy is significantly and positively associated with the utilization of full antenatal care services. Women who participate actively in decision-making are more likely to use full ANC services (AOR: 1.316, 95% CI: 1.197–1.446, p&lt;0.05). Additionally, likelihood of utilization of full ANC services is high among women aged 25–34 years, are educated, have access to the media, come from richest wealth quintile, and are from southern, western, and eastern regions. Therefore, appropriate measures should be adopted to eliminate gender bias and promote women’s empowerment for the overall improvement of maternal health as well as societal health.","author":"Koyel Majumder","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0ab8eedd2ef72ed314af9ba1743fea544e7a1c14335a24a2f041cdea71f9c347","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
