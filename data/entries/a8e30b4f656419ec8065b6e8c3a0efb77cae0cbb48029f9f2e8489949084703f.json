{"title":"Anatomical and Surface Electron Microscopic Investigation of the Tongue and Laryngeal Prominence in the Red-Eyed Turtle Dove (Streptopelia semitorquata, Rüppel 1837)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/3/619/7697071?rss=1","date":1718928000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study investigated the morphology of tongue and laryngeal structures in red-eyed dove and related it to feeding habits. Samples were examined using gross anatomy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and histological techniques. The tongue conformed to the shape of the lower beak, and the apex with a pointed tip, body, and root were distinguished. A median grove was apparent, and a papillary crest with pointed triangular papillae separated the body from the root. The length of the tongue, its width (body), and the percentage of the length of the lower jaw occupied by the tongue were, on average, 12.5 mm, 2.3 mm, and 57.3%, respectively. SEM showed highly desquamated dorsal epithelium with pointed papillae-like projections. The papillary crest presented pointed papillae of about 20–22. Salivary openings were apparent in the root, surrounded by mucosal folds and blunt papillae. Laryngeal prominence was irregularly triangular shaped and elevated. The rim of the glottis showed glandular pinpointed marks. Typical cornified multilayered mucosal epithelium was present in the apex and decreased caudally. Hyaline entoglossal cartilage and adjoining connective tissue were present in the body and apex. Numerous tubuloalveolar glands were seen in the body and root. The rim of the glottis showed mucous intraepithelial glands. The rostral and caudal lingual glands indicated positive reaction to neutral and acidic mucins. This study demonstrated a morphofunctional relationship of the tongue of a red-eyed dove to its diet.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a8e30b4f656419ec8065b6e8c3a0efb77cae0cbb48029f9f2e8489949084703f","category":"Environment"}
