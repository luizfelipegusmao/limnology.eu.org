{"title":"Heavy Metals Contamination and Potential Health Risk Assessment of Ground Water: A Case Study of Open Dumpsites of KP, Pakistan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1217/v1","date":1721066061000,"content":"This study was conducted to investigate heavy metal contamination and potential health risk of ground water of selected municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal sites of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Pakistan. For this purpose a total of 30 composite samples of both surface and ground water were collected from dumpsites of Abbottabad, Bannu and Peshawar. The collected samples were analyzed for physico-chemical parameters and heavy metals by following standard methods. Results indicated that pH values were found within the acceptable limits specified by national environmental quality standards (NEQS) and world health organization (WHO). Mean concentrations of heavy metals were within NEQS and WHO limits, except for Ni which exceeded the NEQS and WHO limit of 0.02 mg/L in all samples, Similarly, Mn exceeded the limit set by NEQS and WHO (0.5 mg/L) in the ground water samples collected from Bannu dumpsite. The multivariate analysis indicated that the heavy metal contamination of the groundwater of the selected dumpsites was anthropogenic. The pollution index (PI) values (PI≥100) of Mn and Ni indicated very high pollution at individual levels while collectively based on heavy metals pollution index (HPI) values (HPI ≥ 200) the ground water of all the selected dumpsites were found highly polluted. Whereas, the hazard index (HI) values (HI ≥ 5) suggested adverse health effects. It was concluded that the ground water of all the dumpsites was highly polluted with heavy metals particularly Ni and Mn thus, posing a high health risk.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05ac323d0fcf7d7274779d058492a05f75e3a8ec1cf21243f069a1e9449aa9a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
