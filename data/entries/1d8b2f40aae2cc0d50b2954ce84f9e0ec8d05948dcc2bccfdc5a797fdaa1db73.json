{"title":"There is no &ldquo;love molecule&rdquo;. No evidence that phenylethylamine is directly involved in romantic love","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0336/v1","date":1720013567000,"content":"A surge of b-phenylethylamine (PEA), an endogenous monoamine found in traces in the human brain and naturally present in chocolate, has been commonly associated with romantic love earning it the nickname of “love molecule”. The origin of this association must be traced to a speculation dating back to the early eighties that has over time become something of a factoid, reaching a large diffusion through the sharing phenomenon of the Internet. What is disputed in this paper is the existence of any direct biochemical or physiological evidence of the role of PEA in any of the phases of romantic love in the human species. The actual and possible roles of PEA    in human physiology are reviewed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d8b2f40aae2cc0d50b2954ce84f9e0ec8d05948dcc2bccfdc5a797fdaa1db73","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
