{"title":"A Turing Test for Self-Awareness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0359/v2","date":1717145558000,"content":"I propose a test for machine self-awareness inspired by the Turing test. My test is simple, and it provides an objective, empirical metric to rectify the ungrounded speculation surging through industry, academia, and social media. Drawing from a breadth of philosophical literature, I argue the test captures the essence of self-awareness, rather than some postulated correlate or ancillary quality. To begin, the concept of self-awareness is clearly demarcated from related concepts like consciousness, agency, and free will. Next, I propose a model called the Nesting Doll of Self-Awareness and discuss its relevance for intelligent beings. Then, the test is presented in its full generality, applicable to any machine system. I show how to apply the test to Large Language Models and conduct experiments on popular open and closed source LLMs, obtaining reproducible results that suggest a lack of self-awareness. The implications of machine self-awareness are discussed in relation to questions about meaning and true understanding. Finally, some next steps are outlined for studying self-awareness in machines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a0ef695faaec94e6b93a47945a5d7ba311c64d37b4bd21a72612c52e5d396638","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
