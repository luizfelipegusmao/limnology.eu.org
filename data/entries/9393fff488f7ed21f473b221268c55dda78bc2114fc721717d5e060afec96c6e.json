However, the patterns and driving factors of N retention in different forest compartments remain elusive. In this study, we synthesized 408 observations from global forest <sup>15</sup>N tracer experiments to reveal the variation and underlying mechanisms of <sup>15</sup>N retention in plants and soils. The results showed that the average total ecosystem <sup>15</sup>N retention in global forests was 63.04 ± 1.23%, with the soil pool being the main N sink (45.76 ± 1.29%). Plants absorbed 17.28 ± 0.83% of <sup>15</sup>N, with more allocated to leaves (5.83 ± 0.63%) and roots (5.84 ± 0.44%). In subtropical and tropical forests, <sup>15</sup>N was mainly absorbed by plants and mineral soils, while the organic soil layer in temperate forests retained more <sup>15</sup>N. Additionally, forests retained more N15H4+$$ {}^{15}\\mathrm{N}{\\mathrm{H}}_4^{+} $$than N15O3−$$ {}^{15}\\mathrm{N}{\\mathrm{O}}_3^{-} $$, primarily due to the stronger capacity of the organic soil layer to retain N15H4+$$ {}^{15}\\mathrm{N}{\\mathrm{H}}_4^{+} $$. The mechanisms of <sup>15</sup>N retention varied among ecosystem compartments, with total ecosystem <sup>15</sup>N retention affected by N deposition. Plant <sup>15</sup>N retention was influenced by vegetative and microbial nutrient demands, while soil <sup>15</sup>N retention was regulated by climate factors and soil nutrient supply. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of climate and nutrient supply and demand in regulating forest N retention and provides data to further explore the impacts of N deposition on forest carbon sequestration.</p>","author":"Quanhong Lin, \nJianxing Zhu, \nQiufeng Wang, \nQiongyu Zhang, \nGuirui Yu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"9393fff488f7ed21f473b221268c55dda78bc2114fc721717d5e060afec96c6e","category":"Environment"}
