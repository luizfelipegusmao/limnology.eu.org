{"title":"HCI and Data: Interacting in a New Era of Virtualization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0508/v1","date":1715169688000,"content":"This article explores the intricate relationship between Human-Data Interaction (HDI) and Data Virtualization (DV), two integral fields that are redefining how we engage with and manage data in the digital age. Positioned at the intersection of technology and user-centric design, this study examines how DV can transcend traditional data management boundaries to significantly enhance data accessibility, legibility, and agency, thus fostering more ethical and meaningful interactions across various sectors. Opening with a detailed exposition on the evolving role of HDI, the paper contextualizes the importance of user-centric data practices within contemporary digital challenges. HDI’s principles are pivotal as they advocate for user empowerment in data interactions, ensuring that data processes are not only transparent but also negotiable and aligned with users’ needs and ethical standards. DV emerges as a transformative solution that inherently supports these principles by integrating diverse data sources into a cohesive and accessible format, thereby eliminating many of the inefficiencies found in conventional data management systems. Through a series of nuanced case studies, the paper provides empirical evidence of DV’s effectiveness across diverse domains. In healthcare, DV facilitates a holistic approach to patient care by providing seamless access to comprehensive medical records, thereby enabling faster, more accurate diagnostic and treatment processes. In the financial sector, DV proves instrumental in enhancing the detection and management of fraud, integrating transactional data across global platforms in real-time to allow for swift, proactive interventions. In education, DV supports personalized learning by synchronizing data from various educational tools, thus allowing for tailored educational experiences that respond dynamically to student performance and engagement metrics. Moreover, the paper critically addresses the ethical considerations and privacy concerns that arise with the integration of HDI and DV, particularly as data interactions become more pervasive and complex. By proposing forward-thinking research directions, it seeks to refine these technologies to better serve societal needs while addressing potential risks and governance issues. In conclusion, this study significantly contributes to the discourse on HDI by advocating for DV as an essential, innovative tool that enhances the clarity, fairness, and efficacy of data interactions. By demonstrating how DV can transform large-scale data sets into user-friendly formats that support decision-making and improve operational efficiencies, the paper underscores DV’s potential to advance a range of industries and enhance the daily lives of individuals interacting with digital systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d019bf7394787e05f6bf3eff36df32b46910f69abef2d8241778cfed4f33c6cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
