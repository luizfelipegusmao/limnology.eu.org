{"title":"Economic Efficiency versus Energy Efficiency of Selected Crops in EU Farms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1722/v1","date":1719302996000,"content":"The goal of farmers operating in a market economy is to maximise profit. In the face of the changing political situation, the main social interest, besides food security, should be energy security. This article aims to indicate the direction of agricultural policy development so that it guarantees both the economic security of producers—farmers—and Europe’s energy security. The work uses data obtained from the agri benchmark Cash Crop database. DEA method and stepwise multiple regression were used. The research showed that plants are already grown in Europe which will ensure high energy efficiency of production without compromising farm financial results (including oats, peas and winter rye) and that improving the involvement of certain inputs results in improved production efficiency (among others, by expenditure on agricultural advisory services). The significance of the presented research results from the fact that the recent COVID pandemic and escalation of the military conflict in Ukraine have led to a renewed interest in the concept of EU energy security, i.e. generation of generating the greatest possible amount of energy within the EU, to be used both for food and non-food purposes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7314a0b756b14da578f48278e4d586bccdba1fe2b64b43c4f409a9578eb5a831","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
