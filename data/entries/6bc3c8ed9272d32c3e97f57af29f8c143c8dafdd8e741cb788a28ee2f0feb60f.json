{"title":"Biomedical named entity recognition based on multi-cross attention feature fusion","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304329","date":1716904800000,"content":"<p>by Dequan Zheng, Rong Han, Feng Yu, Yannan Li</p>\r\n\r\nCurrently, in the field of biomedical named entity recognition, CharCNN (Character-level Convolutional Neural Networks) or CharRNN (Character-level Recurrent Neural Network) is typically used independently to extract character features. However, this approach does not consider the complementary capabilities between them and only concatenates word features, ignoring the feature information during the process of word integration. Based on this, this paper proposes a method of multi-cross attention feature fusion. First, DistilBioBERT and CharCNN and CharLSTM are used to perform cross-attention word-char (word features and character features) fusion separately. Then, the two feature vectors obtained from cross-attention fusion are fused again through cross-attention to obtain the final feature vector. Subsequently, a BiLSTM is introduced with a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to focus on key information features and further improve model performance. Finally, the output layer is used to output the final result. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves the best F1 values of 90.76%, 89.79%, 94.98%, 80.27% and 88.84% on NCBI-Disease, BC5CDR-Disease, BC5CDR-Chem, JNLPBA and BC2GM biomedical datasets respectively. This indicates that our model can capture richer semantic features and improve the ability to recognize entities.","author":"Dequan Zheng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6bc3c8ed9272d32c3e97f57af29f8c143c8dafdd8e741cb788a28ee2f0feb60f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
