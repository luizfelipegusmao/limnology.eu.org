{"title":"SAMD9L acts as an antiviral factor against HIV-1 and primate lentiviruses by restricting viral and cellular translation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002696","date":1720015200000,"content":"<p>by Alexandre Legrand, Clara Dahoui, Clément De La Myre Mory, Kodie Noy, Laura Guiguettaz, Margaux Versapuech, Clara Loyer, Margaux Pillon, Mégane Wcislo, Laurent Guéguen, Clarisse Berlioz-Torrent, Andrea Cimarelli, Mathieu Mateo, Francesca Fiorini, Emiliano P. Ricci, Lucie Etienne</p>\r\n\r\nSterile alpha motif domain-containing proteins 9 and 9-like (SAMD9/9L) are associated with life-threatening genetic diseases in humans and are restriction factors of poxviruses. Yet, their cellular function and the extent of their antiviral role are poorly known. Here, we found that interferon-stimulated human SAMD9L restricts HIV-1 in the late phases of replication, at the posttranscriptional and prematuration steps, impacting viral translation and, possibly, endosomal trafficking. Surprisingly, the paralog SAMD9 exerted an opposite effect, enhancing HIV-1. More broadly, we showed that SAMD9L restricts primate lentiviruses, but not a gammaretrovirus (MLV), nor 2 RNA viruses (arenavirus MOPV and rhabdovirus VSV). Using structural modeling and mutagenesis of SAMD9L, we identified a conserved Schlafen-like active site necessary for HIV-1 restriction by human and a rodent SAMD9L. By testing a gain-of-function constitutively active variant from patients with SAMD9L-associated autoinflammatory disease, we determined that SAMD9L pathogenic functions also depend on the Schlafen-like active site. Finally, we found that the constitutively active SAMD9L strongly inhibited HIV, MLV, and, to a lesser extent, MOPV. This suggests that the virus-specific effect of SAMD9L may involve its differential activation/sensing and the virus ability to evade from SAMD9L restriction. Overall, our study identifies SAMD9L as an HIV-1 antiviral factor from the cell autonomous immunity and deciphers host determinants underlying the translational repression. This provides novel links and therapeutic avenues against viral infections and genetic diseases.","author":"Alexandre Legrand","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"c47456f43e6ebd507153e755a311e79fc4523f05b5c1716f84fdd7e12a7a720f","category":"Environment"}
