{"title":"Optimizing Ammonia Concentration in Poultry Houses through Random Forest Prediction and LoRa-WAN Monitoring &amp; Controlling System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0042/v1","date":1725269877000,"content":"Balancing the levels of ammonia, in poultry facilities plays a role in enhancing the welfare and productivity of animals. Various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, ammonia concentrations, carbon dioxide concentration and exposure to light have an impact on the wellbeing and efficiency of poultry. It is essential to monitor these elements to achieve outcomes necessitating practical, reliable and cost-effective solutions. Leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) in conjunction with LoRa-WAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology presents an opportunity in the industry by enhancing connectivity among devices and facilitating real time data transmission. This research introduces a hardware and software setup for monitoring conditions at poultry farms through LoRa WAN and IoT technologies. More-over researchers employed Random Forest Machine Learning prediction models to tune the concentration of Ammonia (NH3) in poultry facilities across a wide area or multiple Poultry houses. Comparative assessments were conducted to evaluate the proposed system against devices revealing a correlation exceeding 0.9830 between the sensors and standard equipment while costing 28% less than traditional tools. The prototype displayed outcomes underscoring its potential, for managing poultry facilities across multiple farms with centralized oversight","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d161f8e5d77a93ce47f44363a904f98eb79f62585b9638fd7e29d259f8b51726","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
