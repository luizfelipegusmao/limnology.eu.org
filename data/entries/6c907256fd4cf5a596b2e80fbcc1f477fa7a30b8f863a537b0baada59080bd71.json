{"title":"Factors that Influence Resilience among Undergraduate First-Year Nursing Students: A Cross-Sectional Descriptive Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0452/v1","date":1712577422000,"content":"Transition from basic to higher education is regarded as a ‘juggle of many balls’ because students ought to balance between theoretical and clinical requirements, including social life. As a result, a significant number of undergraduate first-year nursing students succumb to these challenges due to lack of coping mechanisms emanating from poor resilience. As a result, the aim of this study was to determine the factors that influence resilience among undergraduate first-year nursing students at a South African university. A quantitative cross-sectional descriptive research design was followed. Data was collected using an adapted self-administered online questionnaire. Principal component analysis extraction method and Varimax rotation were used to analyse data. A total of 123 participants completed the questionnaire. The eigenvalues showed that the first factor explained 23.9% of the variance, the second factor 11.2%, a third factor 7.5% while the fourth factor explained 5.9% of the variance. The fifth until the eight factor had eigenvalues greater than 1 but less than 2. This study showed that resilience can be dependent on various factors such as lecture support, parental support, academic achievement, peer and mentor support, optimism about the future and being self-determined.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c907256fd4cf5a596b2e80fbcc1f477fa7a30b8f863a537b0baada59080bd71","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
