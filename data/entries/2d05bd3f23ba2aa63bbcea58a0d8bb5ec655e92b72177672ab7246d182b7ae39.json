{"title":"Origins and Unifying of Four Fundament Forces of Nature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1396/v1","date":1729162236000,"content":"Four fundamental forces of nature are too important to say because they dominate the formation and evolution of the universe. However, until now, their origins and physical essences have not been answered with wide acceptations. This paper gives new explanations for the origins and essences of these four forces based on different understandings, which can easily explain that all of the four fundamental forces of nature are originated from the electric force only and so can be unified to be one force. First of all, the gravitational force is a synthesized electric force produced by a huge amount of electric charges via particular movements and distributions. Depending on inference of nuclear structure, which has strong supports by observed phenomena, the strong and weak forces are deduced to be electric forces too. The introduced new understandings can explain observed confusing phenomena simply and effectively, such as “galaxy shape”, “dark matter”, “dark energy”, “gamma-ray bursts” in nuclear fission or fusion and from black holes, and so on. The author wrote this paper is for helping to find the natural truth earlier.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d05bd3f23ba2aa63bbcea58a0d8bb5ec655e92b72177672ab7246d182b7ae39","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
