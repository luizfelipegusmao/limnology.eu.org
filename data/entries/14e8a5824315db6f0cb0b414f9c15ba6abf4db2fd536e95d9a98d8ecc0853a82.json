{"title":"Identification of a Novel KPC Variant, KPC-204, Conferring Resistance to Both Carbapenems and Ceftazidime-Avibactam in an ST11 Klebsiella Pneumoniae Strain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1139/v1","date":1715938583000,"content":"This study describes KPC-204, a novel variant of Klebsiella Pneumoniae carbapenemase, characterized by a KDD amino acid insertion at Ambler position 269 deviates from KPC-2. This variant was identified in an ST11-type clinical isolate of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae from China. Notably, KPC-204 exhibits resistance to both ceftazidime-avibactam and carbapenems. Genetic analysis revealed that blaKPC-204 was located on a highly mobile IncFII/IncR plasmid within a complex genetic structure that facilitates its spread. Functional analysis, achieved through cloning into E. coli DH5Î±, validates KPC-204's contribution to increased resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam. The kinetic parameters showed that KPC-204 exhibited similar affinity to KPC-2 toward ceftazidime and reduced sensitivity to avibactam. Mating experiments demonstrated the resistance's transmissibility. This investigation underscores the evolving diversity of KPC variants affecting ceftazidime-avibactam resistance, highlighting the necessity for continuous monitoring.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"14e8a5824315db6f0cb0b414f9c15ba6abf4db2fd536e95d9a98d8ecc0853a82","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
