Nevertheless. since the introduction of TEM and cryoEM the sample carrier (grid) has remained largely unchanged. Meanwhile microfabrication has made leaps due to the semiconductor industry. In this abstract we present a silicon-based sample carrier made with microfabrication techniques.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"86d1c8a9831eeda4f39b00350ca596d01bc7cb49c3db58e209552f2c3e7e2666","category":"Environment"}
