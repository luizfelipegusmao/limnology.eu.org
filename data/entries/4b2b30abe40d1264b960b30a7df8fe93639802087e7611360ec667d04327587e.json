{"title":"Assessing the Polarizing Impacts of Low-Traffic Neighbourhoods: A Community Perspective from Birmingham, UK","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0799/v1","date":1728558985000,"content":"Globally, the transport sector is a major contributor to air pollution. Currently in the UK, vehicle emissions contribute significant amounts of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) pollution in urban areas. Low-emission zones policies have been used as an intervention to tackle air pollution, and in this context, the UK launched the Low- Traffic Neighbourhood scheme. This study investigates the impacts of the Low- Traffic Neighbourhood in Kings Heath, Birmingham, UK, to evaluate its impact in reducing air pollution and local community perspectives about the scheme and perceived impacts on health and well-being. The study employs a mixed-method ap-proach comprising air quality monitoring assessment and a survey questionnaire involving 210 residents. The findings reveal an increase in active travel and a reduction in air pollution levels in the years after the implementation of the scheme, although the area is still non-compliant with the 2021 WHO air quality guidelines. Nonetheless, the scheme has a polarizing effect and created a division within the local community about the overall scheme acceptance and spatial distribution of the schemeâ€™s benefits. The study underscores the importance of comprehensive baseline data, long-term community engagement, and integration with broader urban planning initiatives to enhance the success of future Low-Neighbourhood Traffic schemes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b2b30abe40d1264b960b30a7df8fe93639802087e7611360ec667d04327587e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
