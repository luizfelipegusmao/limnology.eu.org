{"title":"Bioremediation of Pb contaminated water using a novel <i>Bacillus</i> sp. strain MHSD_36 isolated from <i>Solanum nigrum</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302460","date":1714399200000,"content":"<p>by Pfariso Maumela, Sinomncedi Magida, Mahloro Hope Serepa-Dlamini</p>\r\n\r\nThe Pb bioremediation mechanism of a multi-metal resistant endophytic bacteria <i>Bacillus</i> sp. strain MHSD_36, isolated from <i>Solanum nigrum</i>, was characterised. The strain tested positive for the presence of plant growth promoters such as indoleacetic acid, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase, siderophores, and phosphate solubilization. The experimental data illustrated that exopolysaccharides and cell hydrophobicity played a role in Pb uptake. The data further showed that the cell wall biosorbed a significant amount (71%) of the total Pb (equivalent to 4 mg/L) removed from contaminated water, compared to the cell membrane (11%). As much as 11% of the Pb was recovered from the cytoplasmic fraction, demonstrating the ability of the strain to control the influx of toxic heavy metals into the cell and minimize their negative impacts. Pb biosorption was significantly influenced by the pH and the initial concentration of the toxic ions. Furthermore, the presence of siderophores and biosurfactants, when the strain was growing under Pb stress, was detected through liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The strain demonstrated a multi-component based Pb biosorption mechanism and thus, has a great potential for application in heavy metal bioremediation.","author":"Pfariso Maumela","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e1559a124574363b30d858eb7c81f728b8ba0523d3ed88d91d97e7ca544a539d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
