This computing model delivers IoT (Internet of Things) computations and processes the IoT requests from the Edge of the network. In a diverse and independent environment like Fog-Edge, resource management is a critical issue. Hence, scheduling is a vital process to enhance efficiency and allocation of resources properly to the tasks. The manuscript proposes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) inspired Antlion algorithm for task orchestration Edge environments. Its aim is to enhance resource utilization and reduce energy consumption. Comparative analysis with different algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm balances the load on the Edge layer, which results in lower load on the cloud, improves power consumption, CPU utilization, network utilization, and reduces average waiting time for requests. The proposed model is tested for healthcare application in Edge computing environment. The evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing fuzzy logic algorithms. The performance of the ANN inspired Antlion based orchestration approach is evaluated using performance metrics, power consumption, CPU utilization, network utilization, and average waiting time for requests respectively. It outperforms the existing fuzzy logic, round robin algorithm. The proposed technique achieves an average cloud energy consumption improvement of 95.94%, and average Edge energy consumption improvement of 16.79%, 19.85% in average CPU utilization in Edge computing environment, 10.64% in average CPU utilization in cloud environment, and 23.33% in average network utilization, and the average waiting time decreases by 96% compared to fuzzy logic and 1.4% compared to round-robin respectively.","author":"Madhusudhan H.
