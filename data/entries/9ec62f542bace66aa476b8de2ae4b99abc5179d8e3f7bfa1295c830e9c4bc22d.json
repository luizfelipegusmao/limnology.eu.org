{"title":"Viral Hijacking of Host RNA-Binding Proteins: Implications for Viral Replication and Pathogenesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0436/v1","date":1712636208000,"content":"In the intricate dance between viruses and host cells, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) serve as crucial orchestrators of gene expression and cellular processes. We will delve into the riveting realm of viral hijacking, where viruses deftly exploit host RBPs to manipulate cellular machinery for their replication and pathogenesis. Through a masterstroke of molecular subterfuge, viruses co-opt RBPs involved in various facets of RNA metabolism - from transcription to degradation - to promote viral gene expression and evade host immune defenses. This manipulation leads to global alterations in cellular RNA metabolism, impacting essential host genes vital for immune responses and homeostasis.Unveiling this clandestine alliance between viruses and RBPs is not just a scientific pursuit, but a critical imperative for devising innovative antiviral strategies to disrupt these interactions. By unraveling the intricate interplay between viral proteins and host RBPs throughout the viral life cycle - from entry to assembly - researchers aim to identify vulnerabilities that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Strategies such as disrupting viral protein-RBP interactions hold promise for inhibiting viral replication and curbing pathogenesis, offering a beacon of hope in the battle against viral infections.Our manuscript elucidates the indispensable roles played by RBPs in viral replication, translation, and pathogenesis, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms driving viral success. Delving deeper, it explores how viruses intricately entwine with host RBPs, manipulating cellular signaling pathways to create a hospitable environment for viral spread. By dissecting these manipulative tactics, researchers uncover new targets for antiviral therapy, envisioning a future where tailored interventions disrupt viral-host RBP interactions with precision and efficacy.As the narrative unfolds, the therapeutic implications of targeting RBPs or their interactions with viral proteins emerge as a promising frontier in the fight against viral infections. From small molecule inhibitors to RNA-based therapeutics, innovative approaches are on the horizon, offering new avenues for combatting viral diseases. We set the stage for future research, beckoning researchers to delve deeper into the molecular intricacies of viral hijacking of RBPs and charting a course towards novel therapeutic interventions that promise to reshape the landscape of antiviral therapy.\\Ultimately, it beckons the scientific community to embark on a voyage of discovery, unraveling the secrets of viral hijacking of RBPs and paving the way for transformative advances in antiviral therapeutics. The stage is set for a new chapter in the battle against viral infections, where knowledge becomes the sword and innovation the shield against the pernicious machinations of viral pathogens.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ec62f542bace66aa476b8de2ae4b99abc5179d8e3f7bfa1295c830e9c4bc22d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
