Many disease areas typically involve different kinds of sample specimens, sample qualities and quantities. The quality of the DNA can range from intact, high molecular weight molecules to degraded, damaged and very short molecules. The differences in quality and quantity pose challenges for downstream molecular analyses. To overcome the challenge with the need of different molecular methods for different types of samples, we have developed a joint procedure for preparing enriched DNA libraries from high molecular weight DNA and DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, fresh frozen tissue material, as well as cell-free DNA.","author":"Anna Lyander","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"40ad041fd9d098ea86a23360d718f99171ad96102ec90a4e9af96fe580955884","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
