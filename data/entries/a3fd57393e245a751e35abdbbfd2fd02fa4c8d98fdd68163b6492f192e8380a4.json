Mirza</p>\r\n\r\nWhile costs of norovirus acute gastroenteritis (AGE) to healthcare systems have been estimated, out-of-pocket and indirect costs incurred by households are not well documented in community settings, particularly in developing countries. We conducted active surveillance for AGE in two communities in Peru: Puerto Maldonado (October 2012–August 2015) and San Jeronimo (April 2015–April 2019). Norovirus AGE events with PCR-positive stool specimens were included. Data collected in follow-up interviews included event-related medical resource utilization, associated out-of-pocket costs, and indirect costs. There were 330 norovirus-associated AGE events among 3,438 participants from 685 households. Approximately 49% of norovirus events occurred among children &lt;5 years of age and total cost to the household per episode was highest in this age group. Norovirus events cost a median of US $2.95 (IQR $1.04–7.85) in out-of-pocket costs and $12.58 (IQR $6.39–25.16) in indirect costs. Medication expenses accounted for 53% of out-of-pocket costs, and productivity losses accounted for 59% of the total financial burden on households. The frequency and associated costs of norovirus events to households in Peruvian communities support the need for prevention strategies including vaccines. Norovirus interventions targeting children &lt;5 years of age and their households may have the greatest economic benefit.","author":"Joan Neyra","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"a3fd57393e245a751e35abdbbfd2fd02fa4c8d98fdd68163b6492f192e8380a4","category":"Environment"}
