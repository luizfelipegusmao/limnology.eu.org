{"title":"The Extremal Trees for Logarithmic VDB Topological Indices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1333/v1","date":1724116715000,"content":"Vertex-degree-based (VDB) topological indices have been applied in QSPR/QSAR. As an important category, the general logarithmic VDB topological index $T_{lnf}(G)$, is defined as the summation of $ln{f(d(u),d(v))}$, where the summation over all $uv\\in E(G)$.\n\nIn this paper, we give the sufficient conditions for that\n\n(1) the path $P_{n}$ is the only tree with the minimal $T_{lnf}$;\n\n(2) the star $S_n$ is the only tree with the maximal and the minimal $T_{lnf}$, respectively. As applications, the minimal and maximal trees of some logarithmic VDB indices are determined.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"18a9e2daca856a2f75f0a96843f63ef3728587b2cf7a6bccb334004dfc9d47ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
