{"title":"Stochastic Compartment Model With Mortality and Its Application to Epidemic Spreading in Complex Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1142/v1","date":1711088903000,"content":"We study epidemic spreading in complex networks by a multiple random walker approach. Each walker\nperforms an independent simple Markovian random walk on a complex undirected (ergodic) random\ngraph where we focus on Barabási-Albert (BA), Erdös-Rényi (ER) and Watts-Strogatz (WS) types. Both,\nwalkers and nodes can be either susceptible (S) or infected and infectious (I) representing their states of\nhealth. Susceptible nodes may be infected by visits of infected walkers, and susceptible walkers may be\ninfected by visiting infected nodes. No direct transmission of the disease among walkers (or among nodes)\nis possible. This model mimics a large class of diseases such as Dengue and Malaria with transmission\nof the disease via vectors (mosquitos). Infected walkers may die during the time span of their infection\nintroducing an additional compartment D of dead walkers. Infected nodes never die and always recover\nfrom their infection after a random finite time. This assumption is based on the observation that infectious\nvectors (mosquitos) are not ill and do not die from the infection. The infectious time spans of nodes and\nwalkers, and the survival times of infected walkers, are represented by independent random variables.\nWe derive stochastic evolution equations for the mean-field compartmental populations with mortality of\nwalkers and delayed transitions among the compartments. From linear stability analysis, we derive the\nbasic reproduction numbers R M , R 0 with and without mortality, respectively, and prove that R M &lt; R 0 .\nFor R M , R 0 &gt; 1 the healthy state is unstable whereas for zero mortality a stable endemic equilibrium\nexists (independent of the initial conditions) which we obtained explicitly. We observe that the solutions\nof the random walk simulations in the considered networks agree well with the mean-field solutions for\nstrongly connected graph topologies, whereas less well for weakly connected structures and for diseases\nwith high mortality. Our model has applications beyond epidemic dynamics, for instance in the kinetics of chemical reactions, the propagation of contaminants, wood fires, among many others.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cea9e7902421101010fda9d87fc74b9dda3b7e63eee0550a1a19a50d328878a3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
