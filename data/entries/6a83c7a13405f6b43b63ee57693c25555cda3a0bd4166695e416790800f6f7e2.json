{"title":"Deer oil improves ulcerative colitis induced by DSS in mice by regulating the intestinal microbiota and SCFAs metabolism and modulating NF‐κB and Nrf2 signaling pathways","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13837?af=R","date":1724755200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Deer oil (DO), a byproduct of deer meat processing, possesses high nutritional value. This study aims to evaluate the protective effects of DO on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice and to explore its potential mechanisms of action.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>DO was found to inhibit weight loss and colon shortening in colitis mice, significantly reduce disease activity index scores, and notably enhance the levels of tight junction proteins in colon tissues, thus improving intestinal barrier function. ELISA results indicated that DO markedly alleviated the mice's oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Western blot analysis further demonstrated that DO significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of NF-κB while up-regulating the expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 proteins. Additionally, DO increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as <i>Odoribacter</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, and <i>Muribaculum</i>, reduced the abundance of harmful bacteria such as <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Helicobacter</i>, and <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>, and promoted the production of short-chain fatty acids.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Our study provides the first evidence that DO can effectively improve DSS-induced UC in mice. The underlying mechanisms may involve maintaining intestinal barrier function, inhibiting inflammation, alleviating oxidative stress, and modulation of gut microbiota. These findings offer valuable insights for developing DO as an adjunct treatment for UC and as a functional food. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Hongyan Li, \nLu Han, \nYing Zong, \nRuyi Feng, \nWeijia Chen, \nJianan Geng, \nJianming Li, \nYan Zhao, \nYuqi Wang, \nZhongmei He, \nRui Du","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"6a83c7a13405f6b43b63ee57693c25555cda3a0bd4166695e416790800f6f7e2","category":"Environment"}
