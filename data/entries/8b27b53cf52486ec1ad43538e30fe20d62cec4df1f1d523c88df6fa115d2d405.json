{"title":"Safety and Efficacy in Mitral Regurgitation Management with the MitraClip&reg; G4 System: Insights from a Single-Center Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1101/v1","date":1726237076000,"content":"Background: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common valvular disorder linked to high morbidity and mortality. For patients unsuitable for surgery, transcatheter mitral edge-to-edge repair (TEER) with the MitraClip® G4 system offers an alternative. This study aims to evaluate procedural, echocardiographic, functional, and quality of life (QoL) outcomes in patients who underwent TEER with the MitraClip® G4 system, along with possible predictors of New York Heart Associa-tion (NYHA) class I at 30 days and 1 year. Methods: Patients with moderate-to-severe (3+) or se-vere (4+) degenerative MR (DMR) or functional MR (FMR), classified as NYHA class III or IV, who underwent TEER with the MitraClip® G4 system at our center between January 2021 and De-cember 2023 were included. Results: A total of 83 patients [71% FMR, 66% male, median (IQR) age 70 (11) years] underwent TEER, with 100% procedural success. MR ≤2+ was achieved in 100% and 98% of patients at 30 days and 1 year, respectively. NYHA class I or II was achieved in 100% and 96.8% of patients at 30 days and 1 year, respectively. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Ques-tionnaire (KCCQ) score improved from 51±20 at baseline to 69±15 at 30 days (p&lt; 0.001) and 70.5±15 at 1 year (p&lt; 0.001). Lower baseline N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) pre-dicted achieving NYHA class I at 30 days (HR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.41–0.95, p = 0.030), while lower Eu-ropean System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II) and NT-proBNP pre-dicted it at 1 year [(HR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28–0.89, p = 0.019), (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.44–0.99, p = 0.049), respectively]. Conclusions: The MitraClip® G4 system provides significant improvements in MR severity, functional class, and QoL. Lower NT-proBNP and EuroSCORE II were strong predictors of achieving optimal functional status (NYHA class I).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b27b53cf52486ec1ad43538e30fe20d62cec4df1f1d523c88df6fa115d2d405","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
