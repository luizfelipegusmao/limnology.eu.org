{"title":"Estimating Agglomerate Particle Degradation Rates in Treated Produced Water and Hydraulic fracturing fluid during Hydraulic Fracturing: Insights from the Bakken Formation Using d90 Metrics and Pump Speed.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1811/v1","date":1727102893000,"content":"This study examines the degradation of agglomerate particles in treated produced water used for hydraulic fracturing in the Bakken Formation. By analyzing d90 values and pump speeds from different manufacturers, the research quantifies particle size reduction rates, revealing how degradation contributes to pore throat blocking in tight formations. The study found that agglomerate particles in hydraulic fracturing fluids ranged from 9 to 85 microns in size, with degradation occurring most rapidly within the first five minutes of pump action. As time progresses, degradation slows, indicating that pore clogging is most likely at the beginning of the fracturing process. The research emphasizes that pump speed is a critical factor in determining the rate of particle degradation. To minimize formation damage, it is recommended to scale up particle size and use coarser particles in suspension. However, both large and small particles pose risks: larger particles can reduce porosity, while smaller particles may penetrate pore throats and form internal filter cakes. The study highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate pump speed and particle size distribution to optimize fracturing fluid design, maintain formation permeability, and reduce the risk of formation damage. Lower pump speeds and fewer coarse particles are advised to avoid pore clogging during the fracturing process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9aec8c42d01dd0db1ec9f249b1a6e1e8a2428d43b8e0cd194272fda4d7bc12e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
