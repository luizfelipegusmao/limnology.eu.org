{"title":"Different Levels of Therapeutic Strategies to Recover the Microbiome to Prevent/Delay Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or Arrest Its Progression in Children","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1126/v1","date":1710991501000,"content":"Alterations in the composition and diversity, metabolism, and products of the microbiome, and of the gut microbiome (GM), have been shown to be closely associated with the onset and progression of many human diseases, including cancer (i.e. hematological neoplasms). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common form of childhood malignancy. Affected cases present typical alterations of GM, followed by inflammation, which contribute to its progression, response to therapy, as well as possible relapses. Recent evidence also reports that GM influences the development and functions of the newborn's hematopoietic system through the process of developmental programming during fetal life, as well as its susceptibility to the onset of onco-hematological pathologies, namely ALL. Furthermore, in children with ALL, GM has been found to vary in composition, variety, and functions during the clinical stages of ALL, and such variation may influence and predict the complications and prognosis of ALL after chemotherapy treatment or stem cell hematopoietic transplant. Here, we suggest some therapeutic strategies, which can be applied at two levels of intervention to recover the microbiome, and consequently prevent/delay ALL or arrest its progression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38bd2dc5f57f846ed32c457b007111e613e0b3452b61c111eb2e8ffe8bba8fc4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
