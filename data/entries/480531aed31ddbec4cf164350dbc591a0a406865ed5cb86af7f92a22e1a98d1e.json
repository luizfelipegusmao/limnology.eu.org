Using longitudinal data, this study examined the association between changes in physical activity duration and depressive symptoms in 1225 adolescents without depressive symptoms at baseline (51.2% female) from a rural city in Japan. Adolescents in the group that changed from \"Active\" (physical activity duration ≥7 h /week) in the fifth-grade of elementary school (age 11 years) to \"Inactive\" in the second-grade of junior high school (age 14 years) had a higher odds ratio of being rated as having depressive tendencies at age 14 years than adolescents in the Active–Active group. Additionally, the results of the cross-lagged effects model analysis suggested that depressive symptoms may be a factor in the reduced physical activity duration.","author":"Toshinobu Kawai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"480531aed31ddbec4cf164350dbc591a0a406865ed5cb86af7f92a22e1a98d1e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
