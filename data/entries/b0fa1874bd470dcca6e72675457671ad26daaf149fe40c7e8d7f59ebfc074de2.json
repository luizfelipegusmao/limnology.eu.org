{"title":"The Association between Physical Fighting and Victimisation by Traditional Bullying and Cyberbullying among Adolescents in 27 European Countries: The Moderating Effects of Perceived Social Support and Public Education Spending","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1565/v1","date":1716536357000,"content":"Literature indicates scarcity of cross-national research on the association between physical fighting and bullying victimisation among adolescents, and the moderating role of perceived social support and education spending on this association. Using multilevel binary logistic regression, this study examined the association of physical fighting with traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimisation, with public education spending and perceived social support from families and teachers as moderators. Country-level data were combined with 2017/18 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey data from 162,792 adolescents (11-, 13- and 15-year-olds) in 27 European countries. Results showed that physical fighting was positively and significantly associated with cyberbullying and traditional bullying victimisation. These results signify that physical fighting is a robust predictor of bullying victimisation. The findings demonstrate that perceived social support and education spending buffered the association of physical fighting with traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimisation. The findings imply that social support not only prevents adolescents from engaging in physical fights, but also reduces the risk of bullying victimisation. Accordingly, to deter adolescents from engaging in physical violence and reduce the risk of bullying victimisation, there is need to fully comprehend the influence of physical fighting on bullying victimisation, and the moderating role of social support.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0fa1874bd470dcca6e72675457671ad26daaf149fe40c7e8d7f59ebfc074de2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
