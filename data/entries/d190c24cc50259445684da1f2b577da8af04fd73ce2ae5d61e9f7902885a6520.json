{"title":"Quantum Mechanics Characterization of Non-Covalent Interaction in Nucleotides Fragments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0349/v1","date":1717666272000,"content":"Accurate calculation of non-covalent interaction energies in nucleotides is crucial for understanding the driving forces governing nucleic acid structures and functions, as well as developing advanced molecular mechanics forcefields or machine learning potentials tailored to nucleic acids. Here, we dissect the nucleotidesâ€™ structure into three main constituents: nucleobases (A, G, C, T, and U), sugar moieties (ribose and deoxyribose), and phosphate group. The interactions among these fragments and between fragment and water were analyzed. Different quantum mechanical methods were compared for their accuracy in captuing the interaction energy. The non-covalent interaction energy was decomposed into electrostatics, exchange-repulsion, dispersion, and induction using two ab-initio methods: Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT) and Absolutely Localized Molecular Orbitals (ALMO). These caculations provide the benchmark for different QM methods while providing valuable understanding of the roles of various interamolecular forces in hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d190c24cc50259445684da1f2b577da8af04fd73ce2ae5d61e9f7902885a6520","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
