This article investigates the dynamic continuum of Filipino cultural identity, shaped by historical influences and contemporary global interactions. It employs theories of cultural hybridity, transnationalism, and identity to examine the interplay between tradition and modernity, revealing how Filipino culture navigates this complex landscape. Through a detailed analysis of traditional practices, modern adaptations, and the impacts of globalization and the COVID-19 pandemic, the study highlights the resilience and adaptability of Filipino cultural expressions. It further explores intergenerational perspectives on cultural preservation, the role of the diaspora in cultural exchange, and the emergence of new cultural forms in urban settings. By evaluating ongoing efforts to celebrate and preserve Filipino heritage, this paper emphasizes the necessity of recognizing both historical roots and contemporary realities. Ultimately, it issues a call to action for a collective commitment to the celebration and preservation of Filipino cultural heritage, underscoring its vital role in fostering identity and community in an increasingly interconnected world.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"783d5959823e803cd6c49ad61ea9a780df4e8556147d3a5188003d7ee3fa6a45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
