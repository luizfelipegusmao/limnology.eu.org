{"title":"The Effects of Novel miRNAs Found in Exosome Vesicles Derived from Cord Blood Stem Cells (CBSCs-EVs) on CHL1 Melanoma Cells Compared to Healthy Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1128/v1","date":1713336939000,"content":"This study aimed to investigate the potential of Cord Blood Stem Cell-derived exosome vesicles (CBSC-EVs) in regulating cancer growth and preventing cellular damage. The study aimed to examine the effects of CBSC-EVs on CHL1 cancer cells and healthy fibroblasts. The study results reveal that CBSC-EVs have an anti-cancer/antioxidant effect on CHL1 cancer cells without inducing any toxic effects on healthy lymphocytes. Further analysis of CBSC-EVs revealed the presence of seven miRNAs (noncoding RNA molecules), including three from the Let 7 family, two from the Let 5 family, and two novel miRNAs. The function of the novel miRNAs was the main focus of the study. To assess the efficacy of CBSC-EVs, CHL1 cells (a type of malignant melanoma cell line) and human fibroblasts were grouped into different treatments. One group of those cell lines were treated with CBSC-EVs, and in the second group, the cells were transfected with either miRNA inhibitor Novel 1 (miRNA IN1) plus CBSC-EVs or miRNA inhibitor Novel 2 (miRNA IN2) and CBSC-EVs to knock down those novel miRNAs in the CBSC-EVs. Therefore, by comparing these groups, the function of novel miRNAs is more understandable. In this study, the Comet assay was employed to evaluate cancer cells' DNA damage and CCK8 to measure cell viability. The findings revealed that CBSC-EVs caused an increase in DNA damage in CHL1 cells compared to cells without treatment (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"007e9506789ace495aa4263d6167d6ccfb64026eb534d2d37976bd2796f67022","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
