{"title":"Transcription factor CmHSFA4–CmMYBS3 complex enhances salt tolerance in chrysanthemum by repressing CmMYB121 expression","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/3119/7658671?rss=1","date":1714089600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Excessive soil salinity not only hampers plant growth and development but can also lead to plant death. Previously, we found that heat-shock factor A4 (<span>CmHSFA4</span>) enhances the tolerance of chrysanthemum (<span>Chrysanthemum morifolium</span>) to salt. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we identified a candidate MYB transcription factor, <span>CmMYB121</span>, which responded to salt stress. We observed that the <span>CmMYB121</span> transcription is suppressed by <span>CmHSFA4</span>. Moreover, overexpression of <span>CmMYB121</span> exacerbated chrysanthemum sensitivity to salt stress. CmHSFA4 directly bound to the promoter of <span>CmMYB121</span> at the heat-shock element. Protein–protein interaction assays identified an interaction between CmHSFA4 and CmMYBS3, a transcriptional repressor, and recruited the corepressor TOPLESS (CmTPL) to inhibit <span>CmMYB121</span> transcription by impairing the H3 and H4 histone acetylation levels of <span>CmMYB121</span>. Our study demonstrated that a CmHSFA4–CmMYBS3–CmTPL complex modulates <span>CmMYB121</span> expression, consequently regulating the tolerance of chrysanthemum to salt. The findings shed light on the responses of plants to salt stress.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"5f2d4b26c3c48afafbfad0932f4ce64b6f609fbe042c5d4cf3c3d40e38d1db6c","category":"Environment"}
