{"title":"Comparing the Performance of Automatic Milking Systems through Dynamic Testing Also Helps to Identify Potential Risk Factors for Mastitis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0859/v1","date":1726066762000,"content":"Automatic Milking Systems (AMS) are revolutionizing the dairy industry by boosting herd effi-ciency, primarily through increased milk yield per cow and reduced labor costs. The performance of milking machines, whether traditional or automated, can be evaluated using advanced vacuum meters through dynamic testing. This process involves scrutinizing the system and milking rou-tine to identify critical points, utilizing the VaDia™ logger (BioControl AS, Rakkestad, NO). Vacuum recordings were downloaded and analyzed using the VaDia Suite™ software under the guidance of a milking specialist. Access to data from AMS across various manufacturers and herds facilitated a retrospective study aimed at describing and comparing key milk emission parameters for different AMS brands while identifying potential mastitis risk factors. Using proper statistical procedures of SPSS 29.1 (IBM Corp, USA), researchers analyzed data from 4,878 individual quarter milkings from cows in 48 dairy herds. Results indicated significant variability in milking pa-rameters associated to quarter milk yield and AMS brand. Notably, despite AMS standardizing teat preparation and stimulation, the study revealed a surprisingly high frequency of two major mastitis risk factors—bimodality and irregular vacuum fluctuations—occurring more frequently than in conventional milking systems. This study, one of the few comparing different AMS brands and their performance, highlights the crucial role of dynamic testing in evaluating AMS perfor-mance under real-world conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c49023219b1bc48134c98bc78375de0fc4e2040e56bc90615ccbd8da06f40df5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
