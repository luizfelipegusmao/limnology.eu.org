{"title":"Chemical characterization and antibacterial activities of Brazilian propolis extracts from <i>Apis mellifera</i> bees and stingless bees (<i>Meliponini</i>)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307289","date":1721138400000,"content":"<p>by Karolina Oliveira Gomes, Lorena Cristina Fernandes Messias da Silva, Rebeca Dias dos Santos, Bruno Alcântara Prado, Patrícia da Silva Montes, Letícia Fernandes Silva Rodrigues, Marta Oliveira de Araújo, Carla Azevedo Bilac, Daniel Oliveira Freire, Eliana Fortes Gris, Izabel Cristina Rodrigues da Silva, Lívia Cristina Lira de Sá Barreto, Daniela Castilho Orsi</p>\r\n\r\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical composition and antibacterial activity of Brazilian propolis extracts from different types, concentrations, and extraction solvents and from different regions in Brazil. A total of 21 samples were analyzed, comprising 14 samples from <i>Apis mellifera</i> (12 green, 1 brown, and 1 red) and 7 samples from stingless bees (3 mandaçaia, 2 jataí, 1 hebora, and 1 tubuna). The analyses performed were dry extract, total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity (DPPH and ABTS). The antibacterial activity was performed by Determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC). The results showed that very low levels of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity decreased the antimicrobial activity of the propolis extracts from tubuna and jataí. However, there was no correlation between the increase in propolis concentration in the extract, and the increase in antimicrobial activity. The highest TPC and antioxidant activity was obtained for green propolis extract made with 70% raw propolis that presented similar antibacterial activity to the samples formulated with 30% or less raw propolis. The aqueous propolis extract showed lower antimicrobial activity compared to the alcoholic extracts, indicating that ethanol is a better solvent for extracting the active compounds from propolis. It was observed that the MIC (0.06 to 0.2 mg/mL) and MBC (0.2 to 0.5 mg/mL) values for Gram-negative bacteria were higher compared to Gram-positive bacteria (MIC 0.001–0.2 mg/mL, and the MBC 0.02–0.5 mg/mL). The propolis extracts that exhibited the highest antimicrobial activities were from stingless bees hebora from the Distrito Federal (DF) and mandaçaia from Santa Catarina, showing comparable efficacy to samples 5, 6, and 7, which were the green propolis from the DF. Hence, these products can be considered an excellent source of bioactive compounds with the potential for utilization in both the pharmaceutical and food industries.","author":"Karolina Oliveira Gomes","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"201e56a6ea1405594a1579ec048209d3e5aa8545b9bedb2e84040943ce45e1cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
