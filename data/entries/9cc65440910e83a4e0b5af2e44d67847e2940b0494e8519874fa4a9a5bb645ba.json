{"title":"Antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of Myrtus communis essential oils in cold‐stored lactic butter","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13791?af=R","date":1722603543000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>The use of natural antioxidants and antimicrobials in dairy production can increase the variety of dairy-based products. In this study, the antioxidant and antimicrobial changes in lactic butter samples made from heat-treated creams and enriched with <i>M. communis</i> essential oils (EOs) were investigated.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The best lactic butter properties were achieved by optimizing the process at 70 and 80 °C. <i>M. communis</i> EOs decreased lipid oxidation and spoilage microorganism growth in lactic butter during cold storage. <i>M. communis</i> EOs have antioxidant and antimicrobial activity in lactic butter equal to that of ascorbyl palmitate. <i>α</i>-Pinene, <i>p</i>-cymene, limonene, 3-carene, 1,8-cineol, <i>β</i>-linalool, <i>α</i>-terpineol and myretenol are the major contributors to the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of <i>M. communis</i> EOs. They exhibit antioxidant activity by neutralizing free radicals by donating hydrogen or acting as termination enhancers, and antimicrobial activity by disruption of cell membranes, which may result in the leakage of macromolecules or the loss of essential metabolites, ultimately leading to cell death during the storage of lactic butter samples.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The addition of <i>M. communis</i> EOs improves lactic butter stability equal to that of ascorbyl palmitate, and may be applied as a natural and effective preservative to maintain butter from lipid oxidation and microbial spoilage and enhance its safety.</p>\n<h2>Practical applications</h2>\n<p>The growing recognition of the health benefits of natural antioxidants, as opposed to synthetic ones, has led to the development of new applications for natural antioxidants. In this regard, <i>M. communis</i> L. EOs can be used to enhance the shelf stability of cold-stored lactic butter. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Turkan Mutlu Keceli, \nTuba Simsek Mertoglu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"9cc65440910e83a4e0b5af2e44d67847e2940b0494e8519874fa4a9a5bb645ba","category":"Environment"}
