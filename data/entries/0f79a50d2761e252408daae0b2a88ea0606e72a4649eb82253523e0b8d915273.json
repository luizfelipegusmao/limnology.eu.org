Focusing on the difficulties of the access of multiple microgrids for the low-carbon and economic operation of the system, this paper proposes an optimal interconnected heterogeneous multi-microgrid power–heat–carbon scheduling strategy for hydrogen-fueled vehicles. Firstly, an HFCV model is established, and then an optimal scheduling model is constructed for the cooperative trading of power–heat–carbon in a multi-microgrid, on the basis of which the low-carbon economic operation of the multi-microgrid is realized. The results of the case study show that the scheduling strategy in this paper reduces carbon emissions by about 7.12% and costs by about 3.41% compared with the independent operation of the multi-microgrid. The degrees of interaction of each multi-microgrid are also analyzed under different HFCV penetration rates.","author":"Dahu Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0f79a50d2761e252408daae0b2a88ea0606e72a4649eb82253523e0b8d915273","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
