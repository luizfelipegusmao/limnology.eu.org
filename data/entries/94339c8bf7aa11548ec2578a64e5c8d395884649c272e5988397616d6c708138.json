{"title":"Algae in the Anthropocene: Managing, conserving, and utilizing algae in an era of rapid environmental change","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13409?af=R","date":1708105134000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Anthropocene is defined as the current period in which humans have had a large influence over the status and trajectory of earth's climate and environment. Human-induced climate change, pollution, and coastal development have caused major changes to algal persistence, distribution, diversity, and function. This has not only brought new challenges for managing and conserving algae, but also new opportunities. This series of perspective pieces will touch on some of these challenges, potential solutions, and knowledge gaps that we must consider in supporting and understanding algae in the Anthropocene.</p>","author":"Melinda A.
