{"title":"Ingested Microplastics Act as Microbial Vectors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0559/v1","date":1710144249000,"content":"Microplastics (plastic particles &amp;lt; 5 mm) are ubiquitous pollutants that pose the ability to carry microbiota, including pathogens. Microbial adhesion is usually a sign of pathogenicity, thus we investigated the adherent strains found on 4 mm nylon strips, which were ingested and excreted by wild fish specimens. Polymer analysis of the excreted samples shown no signs of degradation, nor have their controls, represented by the nylon strips submerged in the same water tanks. Both the ingested samples and controls presented pathogens in large numbers, revealing the fact that nylon microplastics can be physical carriers for pathogens in the aquatic environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e605260a16b9bf0923ddbde7d520fe7a41b05f67edf4097187c73f52d0ed056f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
