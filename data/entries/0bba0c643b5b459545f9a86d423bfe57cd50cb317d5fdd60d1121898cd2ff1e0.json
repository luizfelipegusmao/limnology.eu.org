{"title":"Fine Sediment in Mixed Sand‐Silt Environments Impacts Bedform Geometry by Altering Sediment Mobility","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024WR037065?af=R","date":1721890800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Geometric characteristics of subaqueous bedforms, such as height, length and leeside angle, are crucial for determining hydraulic form roughness and interpreting sedimentary records. Traditionally, bedform existence and geometry predictors are primarily based on uniform, cohesionless sediments. However, mixtures of sand, silt and clay are common in deltaic, estuarine, and lowland river environments, where bedforms are ubiquitous. Therefore, we investigate the impact of fine sand and silt in sand-silt mixtures on bedform geometry, based on laboratory experiments conducted in a recirculating flume. We systematically varied the fraction of sand and silt for different discharges, and utilized an acoustic Doppler velocimeter to measure flow velocity profiles. The final bed geometry was captured using a line laser scanner. Our findings reveal that the response of bedforms to an altered fine sediment percentage is ambiguous, and likely depends on, among others, bimodality-driven bed mobility and sediment cohesiveness. When fine, non-cohesive material (fine sand or coarse silt) is mixed with the base material (medium sand), an increased dune height and length is observed, possibly caused by the hiding-exposure effect, resulting in enhanced mobility of the coarser material. However, weakly cohesive fine silt suppresses dune height and length, possibly caused by reduced sediment mobility. Finally, in the transition from dunes to upper stage plane bed, there are indications that the bed becomes unstable and dune heights vary over time. The composition of the bed material does not significantly impact the hydraulic roughness, but mainly affects roughness via the bed morphology, especially the leeside angle.</p>","author":"S.
