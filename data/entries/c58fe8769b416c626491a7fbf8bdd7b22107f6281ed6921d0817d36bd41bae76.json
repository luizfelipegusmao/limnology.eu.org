{"title":"Recruitment of the Basket Star Astrospartus mediterraneus Risso, 1826) (Ophiuroidea, Gorgonocephalidae)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2563/v1","date":1722428769000,"content":"The occurrence and abundance of Astrospartus mediterraneus (Risso, 1826) have significantly increased in the last three decades in several areas of the Mediterranean Sea. In the Tavolara â€“ Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Protected Area (NE Sardinia, Tyrrhenian Sea), 61 specimens were observed mainly on the granitic shoals of the Tavolara Channel, an area characterized by very intense currents and high sedimentation. The basket stars were mainly found living as epibionts of gorgonians (E. verrucosa, P. clavata and L. sarmentosa) and massive sponges (Spongia officinalis, S. lamella, Sarcotragus foetidus). We also documented 20 small specimens (3-20 mm in diameter of the oral disc) observed in June 2024 between 27 and 52 m depth on Eunicella verrucosa and Paramuricea clavata colonies. The bimodal size-frequency distribution of these specimens suggested that, probably, specimens belong to two different reproductive events occurring in spring 2023 and 2024.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c58fe8769b416c626491a7fbf8bdd7b22107f6281ed6921d0817d36bd41bae76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
