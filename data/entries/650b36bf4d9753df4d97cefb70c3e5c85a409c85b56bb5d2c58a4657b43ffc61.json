{"title":"Does managerial myopia promote enterprises over-financialization? Evidence from listed firms in China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309140","date":1725544800000,"content":"<p>by Yanchi Chen, Ju Ye, Qi Shi</p>\r\n\r\nThis paper analyzes the potential shortsightedness of enterprise managers through annual reports. Additionally, we use corporate financial statement data to measure enterprises over-financialization in terms of resource allocation. After testing with a causal inference model, we find that firms with managerial myopia significantly contribute to over-financialization. It remains robust even after the instrumental variable of whether the manager has experienced a famine is used. Furthermore, financial distress and financing constraints amplify the inclination of short-term-focused managers to amass greater financial assets.","author":"Yanchi Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"650b36bf4d9753df4d97cefb70c3e5c85a409c85b56bb5d2c58a4657b43ffc61","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
