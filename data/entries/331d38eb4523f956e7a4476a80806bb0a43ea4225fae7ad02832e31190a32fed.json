An often overlooked ecological adaptation is marcescence, where leaves and stems are retained beyond their typical shedding time, with implications for nutrient recycling and carbon sequestration. Marcescence can be expected in plants with conservative resource-use strategies, especially in environments with limited resources and marked seasonality, such as deserts and alpine regions. However, the extent to which marcescence occurs in different taxa across different habitats and its relationship to seasonality and plant functioning as reflected in ecophysiological traits remains understudied.\n\nWe studied 600 individuals across 40 Himalayan herb species found in desert, steppe, alpine and subnival habitats, spanning 3000–5400 m elevation. Marcescence was observed in 37 of the 40 species evaluated, with 57% of the sampled individuals displaying dead phytomass, indicating the widespread nature of this phenomenon in Himalayan ecosystems.\n\nEnvironment and plant traits emerged as significant factors influencing the amount of dead-standing biomass. These findings remained robust after accounting for intraspecific variation and phylogenetic inertia. Desert and steppe species exhibited greater marcescent biomass, characterized by 10-fold more dead stem biomass than alpine and subnival plants. In contrast, the proportion of dead phytomass increased with elevation due to increased dead leaf fraction.\n\nTaller desert species with heavily lignified stems and limited nitrogen and phosphorus content had high levels of stem marcescence, which not only may aid litter photodegradation and nutrient recycling but also deter herbivory and promote seed dispersal (tumbleweed). Conversely, slow-growing alpine and subnival plants with higher water-use efficiency, foliar C:N ratios and parenchymatic storage tissue rich in mobile carbohydrates had a high proportion of marcescent leaves, which may aid survival in these resource-limited environments by providing delayed nutrients through moisture-conserving mulch that also provides insulation and protection from frost.\n\nThis study provides new insights into the complex interplay of habitat, seasonality and plant traits in dead phytomass retention in Himalayan plants. Marcescence is prevalent in resource-conservative species in highly seasonal, resource-limited habitats and may significantly shape the functioning and biodiversity of Himalayan ecosystems.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/01/19/ecological-significance-of-marcescence-in-himalayan-plants-why-is-standing-dead-phytomass-more-important-in-demanding-resource-limited-environments/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Thinles Chondol, \nKiril A.
