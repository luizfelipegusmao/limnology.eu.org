In the present study, four IL-10 family members (IL-10, IL-20L, IL-22, and IL-26) were identified from spotted sea bass (<i>Lateolabrax maculatus</i>) and their expression patterns were investigated following <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. The four ILs of spotted sea bass shared conserved features of IL-10 family and were well clustered with the IL-10 family of fish, respectively. The expressions of these four ILs in normal tissues were different, but all were highly expressed in gills, indicating their roles in mucosal immunity. After <i>E. tarda</i> and LPS challenge, the four ILs were upregulated in several immune-related tissues (gills, head kidney, intestine, and spleen). These results indicated that these four ILs involved in the antibacterial immune responses of spotted sea bass, providing basis for understanding the function and networks of IL-10 family members in fish.</p>","author":"Yuxi Chen, \nQian Gao, \nZhitao Qi, \nChong Xu, \nTingshuang Pan, \nDong Liu, \nQigen Liu, \nHouguo Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"7422b36488cc288ef35c87f63cf4ef1e2bd17416a80f165022ca9823a0a64fed","category":"Environment"}
