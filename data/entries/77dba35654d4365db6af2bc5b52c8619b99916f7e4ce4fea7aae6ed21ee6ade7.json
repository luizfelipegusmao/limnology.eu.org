The study of samples such as soil aggregates and brain tissue has great challenges for microscopy because of their complex structure, multi-scaled details, and cryogenic temperature requirements. Mapping of the brain structures including all cellular objects and their connectivity at various length scales is challenging but vital to advance our understanding of how our brains work and how the anatomy changes in aged or disordered brains. Similarly, the study of microbes in undisturbed soil is essential to improve the predictive power of ecosystem, regional and global models, yet still is a challenge due to the complex multiscale pore structure of the soil, difficulty of preserving sample integrity, and the presence of organic matter and water [<a href=\"#ozae044.1036-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1036-B2\">2</a>]. Further advancement in these fields depends on new approaches from sample handling to specimen analysis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"77dba35654d4365db6af2bc5b52c8619b99916f7e4ce4fea7aae6ed21ee6ade7","category":"Environment"}
