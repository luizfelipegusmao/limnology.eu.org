This study sought to quantitatively summarize the clinical data comparing peripheral blood triglyceride (TG) concentrations between patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HCs). Studies were searched in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Databases up to March 2023. We also reviewed the reference lists of obtained articles. Mean (±SD) for TG concentrations were extracted, combined quantitatively using random-effects meta-analysis, and summarized as a standardized mean difference (SMD). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression was performed to explore the resource of heterogeneity. Thirty-eight studies measuring the concentrations of peripheral blood TG in 2604 patients with MDD and 3272 HCs were included. Meta-analysis results indicated that TG levels were significant higher in patients with MDD than in HCs (SMD = 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.16 to 0.46, Z<sub>46</sub> = 4.05, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.01). Heterogeneity was detected (χ<sup>2</sup> = 269.97, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.01, I<sup>2</sup> = 85%). Subgroup analysis demonstrated significant differences in TG levels between patients with MDD and HCs depended on age, body mass index and drug use (<i>p &lt;</i> 0.05), but no differences between groups. Meta-regression also found no significant variables. TG level was significantly elevated in depression, which may explain the increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in depression.","author":"Di-Ru Xu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d034e8e533f8a02640a2ead5d96794f8648ab58a1ad0c8b514da6a21732f10a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
