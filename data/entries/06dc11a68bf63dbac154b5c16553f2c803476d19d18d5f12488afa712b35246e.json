{"title":"Drimia maritima as a New Green Inhibitor for Al-Si Alloy, SAE Steel and Pure Al Samples in 0.5M NaCl Solution: Polarization and Electrochemical Impedance Analyses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2198/v1","date":1725008220000,"content":"Abstract: The corrosion inhibition effects of Drimia maritima (L.) Stearn sin. Urginea matima (L.) Backer on three different materials, i.e. as-cast Al-7 wt.% Si alloy, SAE 1020 low carbon steel and commercially pure Al samples, into a stagnant and naturally aerated 0.5 M NaCl solution are evaluated. For this purpose, both the potentiodynamic polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with equivalent circuit are utilized. It is found that inhibition effect in-creases up to certain minor Drimia maritima content. Adsorption isotherms (e.g. Langmuir and Temkin) have indicated that all three examined material comprise physical adsorption mecha-nism. Al-Si alloys have attained inhibition efficiency of about 96% at 25 oC with 1250 ppm of Drimia maritima, and ~43% with 625 ppm at 45 oC. On the other hand, the cp. Al and SAE 1020 samples attain ~ 89% and 68% with 1250 ppm and 500 ppm at 25 oC, respectively. This clearly in-dicates that the dosage of Drimia maritima green inhibitor into NaCl solution posses certain sus-ceptibility for each distinctive material examined. Impedance parameters obtained by using CNLS (complex non-linear least squares simulations) are correlated and discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"06dc11a68bf63dbac154b5c16553f2c803476d19d18d5f12488afa712b35246e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
