{"title":"Formulation of Epoxy Prepregs, Synthesization Parameters and Resin Impregnation Approaches &ndash; a Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0765/v1","date":1728534855000,"content":"Prepregs, which are resin-impregnated and expensive composites, are mainly limited to high-end applications within the aeronautical, defence, automotive, and energy sectors. Prepreg technology is mainly protected by under trade secrets resulting in limited studies on recent advancements. A Scopus search revealed 861 articles and 16 reviews for the keywords ‘epoxy’ and ‘prepreg’. However, this was narrowed down to 123 articles and 4 reviews using keywords ‘formula development’ and ‘B-stage’. In this review, the control strategies of B-staging, resin tack, and viscosity and their measuring techniques are discussed. Based on resin impregnation techniques and B-stage control, two approaches are proposed to develop prepreg resin formulations: conventional resin impregnation and viscosity-controlled resin impregnation. The approaches would be extremely useful especially for advancing beyond the existing prepreg applications and developing smart materials and functional composites through advanced resin modification strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"19c8ddc63e856d2271ed82443def4cdfa3421ab1b00adacd68ae96dd155e8f3a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
