Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have a crucial role in CRC progression and chemotherapy resistance, with exosomal lncRNAs emerging as potential biomarkers. This study aimed to predict key lncRNAs involved in OXP-resistance using <i>in-silico</i> methods and validate them using RT-qPCR methods in CRC cells and their isolated exosomes. Two public datasets, GSE42387 and GSE119481, were downloaded from the GEO database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) associated with OXP-resistance in the HCT116 cell line. The analysis of GSE42387 revealed 210 DEGs, and GSE119481 identified 73 DEmiRNAs. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of the DEGs identified 133 interconnected genes, from which the top ten genes with the highest degree scores were selected. By intersecting predicted miRNAs targeting these genes with the DEmiRNAs, 38 common miRNAs were found. Subsequently, 224 lncRNAs targeting these common miRNAs were predicted. LncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network were constructed and the top five lncRNAs with the highest degree scores were identified. Analysis using the Kaplan-Meier plotter database revealed that the key lncRNAs <i>NEAT1</i>, <i>OIP5-AS1</i>, and <i>MALAT1</i> are significantly associated with the overall survival of CRC patients. To validate these lncRNAs, OXP-resistant HCT116 sub-cell line (HCT116/OXR) was developed by exposing parental HCT116 cells to gradually increasing concentrations of OXP. Exosomes derived from both HCT116 and HCT116/OXR cells were isolated and characterized utilizing dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Western blotting. RT-qPCR confirmed elevated levels of <i>NEAT1</i>, <i>OIP5-AS1</i>, and <i>MALAT1</i> in HCT116/OXR cells and their exosomes compared to parental HCT116 cells and their exosomes. This study concludes that <i>NEAT1</i>, <i>OIP5-AS1</i>, and <i>MALAT1</i> are associated with the OXP-resistance in CRC. The high levels of these lncRNAs in exosomes of resistant cells suggest their involvement in intercellular communication and resistance propagation. This positioning makes them promising biomarkers for OXP-resistance in CRC.","author":"Roxana Sahebnasagh","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"58718a3554a99c345ca9b14951302c06b50cff9dda5a6b6b0a0de789ef3fc5c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
