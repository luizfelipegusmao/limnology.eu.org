{"title":"The Symmetry Group of the Grand Antiprism","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0116/v1","date":1722587507000,"content":"The grand antiprism A is an outlier among the uniform 4-polytopes, since it is not obtainable from Wythoff’s construction. Its symmetry group G(A) has been incorrectly described as [[10,2+,10]] or even as an `ionic diminished Coxeter group’. In fact, G(A) is another group of order 400, namely the group ±[D10×D10]·2, in the notation of Conway and Smith.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1c4925d81a2550aaaa88700f472d26dffb86e63a7e4f41dc0854184ad5451cc2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
