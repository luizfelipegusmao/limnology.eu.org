The summer 2018 drought in Europe impacted human health, ecosystems, and economic prosperity. Even locations with an abundance of fresh water, like Ireland, faced water restrictions due to depleted supplies. To characterize the effect of the 2018 drought on Irish rivers, we collected surface water samples from rivers across the island at the drought onset and termination. We analyzed samples for stable water isotopes δ<sup>18</sup>O and δ<sup>2</sup>H and calculated the fraction of evaporation from river groundwater and precipitation inflow (E/I) of rivers. We extended river δ<sup>18</sup>O and δ<sup>2</sup>H analysis to 2020 for rivers in two catchments, Corrib and Shannon, to investigate how Irish river systems respond to high precipitation events, and the role of loughs (lakes) in the system. River δ<sup>18</sup>O and δ<sup>2</sup>H values showed progressive depletion from west to east in response to precipitation depletion from airmasses arriving off the Atlantic Ocean. From onset to termination of the 2018 drought, river δ<sup>18</sup>O and δ<sup>2</sup>H values were enriched and the calculated E/I value increased for most rivers. D-excess were negatively correlated with E/I value, providing support for E/I calculations. Extended analysis of loughs along the Corrib and Shannon river systems showed that lough Corrib consistently induced isotopic enrichment, while loughs in the Shannon catchment inconsistently caused isotopic enrichment. Both systems exert control over river isotopic composition in hydrologic extremes. Findings promote additional research in hydrologic patterns in response to increasing frequency of floods and droughts.","author":"Devin F.
