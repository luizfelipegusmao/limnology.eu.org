{"title":"Opening the black box: New insights into the role of temperature in the marine distributions of Pacific salmon","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12825?af=R","date":1711502684000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Pacific salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus</i> spp.) spend much of their life near the ocean surface where climatic and oceanographic conditions affect their habitat and survival. Despite decades of study, critical knowledge gaps persist regarding their ecology and distributions. Consequently, it has been difficult to assess how environmental conditions influence the high-seas distribution and habitat use of these culturally and socioeconomically important fishes, presenting challenges to fisheries managers trying to evaluate how climate change and fishing activities may impact salmon populations. We used a recently compiled, comprehensive database of historical coastal and high-seas salmon survey data (1953â€“2022) in the North Pacific to fit species distribution models that (1) characterize the marine spatial distribution of six species of <i>Oncorhynchus</i>, (2) evaluate species-specific temperature preferences, and (3) investigate how species' temperature preferences influence distribution. Sea surface temperature, along with seasonal migrations associated with spawning and feeding, significantly affects the distribution of all species, where the warm limits of estimated preferred thermal ranges were more similar than the cold limits. Furthermore, the distributions of some species appear more responsive to temperature than others and recently observed warm conditions have likely impacted realized ranges. These models have expanded our understanding of salmon ocean distributions and thermal niches by providing a unique window into this often unobserved but important part of the life cycle. They also serve as a baseline for future investigations into the mechanisms influencing salmon spatial ecology, responses to climate change, and vulnerability to harvest across the North Pacific.</p>","author":"Joseph A.
