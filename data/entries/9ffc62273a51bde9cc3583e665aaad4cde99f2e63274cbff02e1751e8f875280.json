{"title":"The bilevel chamber revealed differential involvement of vasopressin and oxytocin receptors in female mouse sexual behavior","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304703","date":1718892000000,"content":"<p>by Himeka Hayashi, Kie Shimizu, Kazuaki Nakamura, Katsuhiko Nishimori, Yasuhiko Kondo</p>\r\n\r\nArginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) are well-known as neuropeptides that regulate various social behaviors in mammals. However, little is known about their role in mouse female sexual behavior. Thus, we investigated the role of AVP (v1a and v1b) and OT receptors on female sexual behavior. First, we devised a new apparatus, the bilevel chamber, to accurately observe female mouse sexual behavior. This apparatus allowed for a more precisely measurement of lordosis as receptivity and rejection-like behavior (newly defined in this study), a reversed expression of proceptivity. To address our research question, we evaluated female sexual behavior in mice lacking v1a (aKO), v1b (bKO), both v1a and v1b (dKO), and OT (OTRKO) receptors. aKO females showed decreased rejection-like behavior but a normal level of lordosis, whereas bKO females showed almost no lordosis and no change in rejection-like behavior. In addition, dKO females showed normal lordosis levels, suggesting that the v1b receptor promotes lordosis, but not necessarily, while the v1a receptor latently suppresses it. In contrast, although OTRKO did not influence lordosis, it significantly increased rejection-like behavior. In summary, the present results demonstrated that the v1a receptor inhibits proceptivity and receptivity, whereas the v1b and OT receptors facilitate receptivity and proceptivity, respectively.","author":"Himeka Hayashi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9ffc62273a51bde9cc3583e665aaad4cde99f2e63274cbff02e1751e8f875280","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
