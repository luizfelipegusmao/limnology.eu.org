{"title":"Restore Iranâ€™s marshes to prevent dust storms | Science","link":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado7062","date":1715259660000,"content":"Dust profoundly influences interactions between Earth and the atmosphere, particularly in arid regions (1). Dust storms, which are prevalent in dry, vegetation-free areas, can bury settlements, destroy agriculture, obstruct water infrastructure, cause visibility issues on roads, and substantially affect the environment (2). The Hur al-Azim Marshes, situated along the border of Iran and Iraq, have faced water shortages and pollution, which have increased the threat of dust storms. Iran and neighboring countries should work to restore the marshes to prevent damage caused by dust.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"63b829125530e5fbcedd73f88650d822f5da8d45746d3951702b7d6a3249c05d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
