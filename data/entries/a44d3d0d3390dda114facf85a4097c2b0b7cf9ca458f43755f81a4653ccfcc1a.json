Without the dedication of our reviewers, the journal would not have been successful. In 2023, 269 reviewers completed 434 reviews for the 174 manuscripts submitted to GeoHealth. Our reviewers are from all continents except Antarctica. Besides reviewers from North America, China, Europe, and China, we started to have reviewers from India, Latin America, and Africa.
