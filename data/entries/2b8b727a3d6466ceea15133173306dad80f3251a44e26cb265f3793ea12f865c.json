{"title":"The Evolution of Meteorological Satellite Cloud Detection Methodologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1916/v1","date":1716960127000,"content":"The accurate detection of clouds is an important first-step in the processing of remotely sensed satellite data analyses and subsequent cloud model predictions. While initial cloud retrieval technology began with the exploitation of one or two bands of satellite imagery, it has accelerated rapidly in recent years as sensor and retrieval technology have exploded, creating a new era in space exploration. Additionally, initial emphasis in satellite retrieval technology focused on cloud detection for cloud forecast models, more recently cloud screening in satellite acquired data is playing an increasingly critical role in the investigation of cloud free data for the retrieval of soil moisture, vegetation cover, ocean colour concentration and sea surface temperatures, as well as environmental monitoring of a host of products, e.g. atmospheric aerosol data, to study the Earthâ€™s atmospheric and climatic systems. With about 60% of the Earth covered by clouds, on average, it is necessary to both accurately detect clouds in remote sensing data to screen cloud contaminate data in remote sensing analyses. In this paper, the evolution of cloud detection technology is highlighted with advancement in sensor hardware technology and possible AI algorithmic advances. Additionally, a discussion is presented on methods to obtain the cloud truth data needed to determine the accuracy of these cloud detection approaches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b8b727a3d6466ceea15133173306dad80f3251a44e26cb265f3793ea12f865c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
