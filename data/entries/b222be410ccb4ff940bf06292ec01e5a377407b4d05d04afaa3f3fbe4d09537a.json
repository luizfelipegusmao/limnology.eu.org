{"title":"Exploring the Influence of Human Brands on the Formation of Generation Z&rsquo;s Digital Identity: A Netnographic Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1074/v1","date":1726216651000,"content":"Purpose: This study investigates the influence of human brands on the formation of Generation Z's digital identity. Given the increasing importance of the digital space in this generation's life, understanding how their identity is shaped by human brands in this environment is crucial. Method: Using a netnographic approach, qualitative data was collected and analyzed from 500 posts and interactions of Gen Z users on Instagram and TikTok platforms. Thematic content analysis was conducted using NVivo 12 software, with inter-coder reliability confirmed (κ = 0.85). Findings: Results indicate that human brands influence Gen Z's digital identity through three main mechanisms: 1) lifestyle emulation (β = 0.42, p &lt; 0.001), 2) value alignment (β = 0.38, p &lt; 0.001), and 3) self-presentation modeling (β = 0.35, p &lt; 0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed these three factors explain 67\\% of the variance in digital identity formation (R² = 0.67, F(3,496) = 335.42, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that human brands play a significant role in shaping Generation Z's digital identity. Understanding this influence can help marketers and policymakers design more effective strategies for engaging with this generation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b222be410ccb4ff940bf06292ec01e5a377407b4d05d04afaa3f3fbe4d09537a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
