In utero heat stressed calves have altered small intestine morphology and an impaired ability to absorb colostral immunoglobulin G (IgG). Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize potential cellular and molecular alterations in the small intestine of neonatal in utero heat stressed calves. In the last ~56 d of gestation pregnant dams were either heat stressed (shade; n = 41) or cooled (shade, fans, soakers; n = 41) resulting in heifers that were in utero heat stressed (IUHS, n = 15) or in utero cooled (IUCL, n = 15). Heifers were fed 3.78 L of high-quality colostrum within 2 h of birth. Apparent efficiency of absorption (AEA) of IgG was calculated by measuring IgG content fed in colostrum and in 24 h serum. Within 4.6 ± 2.3 h of birth a subset of calves (n = 8/treatment) not fed colostrum were euthanized to collect samples from the ileum. Tissue for histological analysis was placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin before being dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 μm thicknesses, and mounted to glass slides. The TUNEL method was used to identify apoptotic cells using the Keyence BZ-X800 Microscope. Tissue for gene expression analysis was snap-frozen and kept at -80°C before RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. The transcript abundance of endosomal (FCGRT, DAB2, MAMDC4), tight junction (ZO1, ZO2, ZO3, OCLN, CLDN1), and heat shock (HSP90, HSF1) related genes were measured by qPCR using the CFX96 Real-Time PCR detection System (BIO-RAD). Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED or PROC GLIMMIX depending on the response variable. TUNEL results are expressed as the proportion of positive cells to total cells. Quantitative PCR data were analyzed by assessing the estimates of the model relative to the geometric mean of 3 reference genes (ACTB, GADPH, RSP9; ΔΔCT). The concentration of colostrum IgG fed to calves was not different (136.1 vs. 122.5 g/L; IUHS vs. IUCL, respectively; <span>P</span> = 0.32), but AEA of IgG was reduced in IUHS relative to IUCL calves (23.5 vs. 33.3%; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). The proportion of apoptotic cells within the villi of the ileum was increased in IUHS calves compared with IUCL (2.11 vs. 1.57%; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Ileum gene transcript abundance of DAB2 and MAMDC4 were increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), while FCGRT transcripts tended to increase in IUHS calves (<span>P</span> = 0.08). All tight junction and heat shock-related gene transcripts were increased within the ileum of IUHS calves (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.02) with the exceptions of CLDN1 and HSP90, which were not different between treatments (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.22).These results suggest that exposure to heat stress in utero impact small intestine integrity after birth and affect key IgG transporters, providing insight into underlying mechanisms responsible for reduced IgG absorption in IUHS calves.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"07627daca5b2a73b6d10cb2a10eebd623a82fe373c33e2b74197fcb594df8d8a","category":"Environment"}
