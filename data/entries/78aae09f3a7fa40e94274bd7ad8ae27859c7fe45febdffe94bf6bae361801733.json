{"title":"Manufacturing and Properties of Jute Fiber Reinforced Epoxy Composites&mdash;A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0612/v1","date":1728437120000,"content":"Jute fiber reinforced composites have become a very promising alternative to synthetic fiber composites because of their favorable environmental characteristics, cost efficiency, and good mechanical properties. The present review provides a comprehensive examination of the manufacturing processes and mechanical properties of composites reinforced with jute fibers. This study investigates the influence of several fabrication methods, such as hand lay-up, compression molding, injection molding, pultrusion, etc. on the mechanical properties of the composites. It also provides the SWOT analysis of various manufacturing processes of jute fiber reinforced composites. The important aspects including fiber orientation, fiber-matrix adhesion, and the effects of different surface treatments on improving mechanical characteristics such as tensile strength, flexural strength, and impact resistance are discussed. The difficulties associated with moisture absorption, degradation, and the lack of uniformity in jute fibers, as well as approaches to alleviate these problems are presented. The goal of this study is to establish a basis for future investigation and advancement in enhancing the mechanical properties of jute fiber reinforced composites.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78aae09f3a7fa40e94274bd7ad8ae27859c7fe45febdffe94bf6bae361801733","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
