{"title":"The Impact of Aerobic Exercise on a Novice Athlete with Crohn's Disease: A Case Study from Greece","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1899/v1","date":1727179669000,"content":"This case study explores the impact of moderate-intensity exercise on a 35-year-old male novice runner diagnosed with Crohn's Disease (CD). Initially, his symptoms were managed with probiotics and rifaximin, but he experienced a resurgence after a COVID-19 infection, leading to treatment with budesonide. Despite initial hesitation, the patient resumed moderate-intensity running (60-80% VO2 max) after achieving remission. His bowel function, energy levels, and overall well-being improved significantly with exercise. This case suggests that structured physical activity can be beneficial for managing CD and maintaining remission, even amidst fluctuating symptoms and inflammatory markers. It supports the idea that moderate-intensity exercise, when carefully managed, does not inherently worsen the condition and can enhance quality of life. These findings advocate for personalized exercise programs as part of CD management, though further research is needed to establish comprehensive guidelines and evaluate the long-term effects of different exercise intensities on Crohn's Disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c860e53cd3d465c377a0c0f9b24ddf148bf863035a75aa28c8147653131397bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
