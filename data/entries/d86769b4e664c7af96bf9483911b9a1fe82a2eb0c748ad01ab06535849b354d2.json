This risk of exposure suggests the need for safety in responding to any pandemic. Therefore, to ascertain the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity, and their determinants amongst HP become relevant.</p> Methods <p>A cross sectional health facility-based study was carried-out amongst HP in the Centre Region of Cameroon from 1<sup>st</sup> February to 30<sup>th</sup> June 2021. Characteristics and access to preventive tools were collected using face-to-face administered questionnaire. Nasopharyngeal swabs and whole blood were collected for PCR, IgG and IgM testing respectively. STATA version 17 software was used for data analysis. Determinants of COVID-19 infection were explored by estimating crude and adjusted Odd Ratio.</p> Results <p>Out of 510 HP reached, 458 were enrolled with mean age of 35 (±10) years. Thirty-four (7.4%) were PCR-positive to SARS-CoV-2 with 73.5% being clinicians versus 9 (26.4%) non-clinicians (p = 0.05). Sero-positivity to SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM was 40.2% (184/458), with 84.2% being clinicians versus 29 (15.8%) non-clinicians (p = 0.733). Amongst the 34 HP with PCR-positivity, 16 (47%) had no antibodies, while, 15 (44%) were IgG only. An estimate of HP (43.7%) had at least an evidence of PCR, IgG or IgM contact to COVID-19. Determinants of PCR-positivity was being clinical staff (AOR = 0.29, P = 0.039); and that of IgG/IgM were being non clinical staff (AOR = 0.41, p = 0.018) and regular use of face masks (AOR = 0.44, p = 0.001). HP trained on IPC (24%) were mainly from peripheral level (74.7%, p = 0.002).</p> Conclusion <p>Active infections were within the range of pandemic control (&lt;10%). However, around two-fifths of participants have had contact with the virus, indicating that HP remains a population at risk of COVID-19 and other similarly-transmitted epidemic prone diseases, and also an important source of transmission. There is need of vaccine to achieve protectiveness, and optimal response also requires capacity building to improve the health system when challenged by a future pandemic.</p>","author":"Sen Claudine Henriette Ngomtcho","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d86769b4e664c7af96bf9483911b9a1fe82a2eb0c748ad01ab06535849b354d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
