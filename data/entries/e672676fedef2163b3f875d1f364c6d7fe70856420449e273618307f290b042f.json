{"title":"Phytochemical Screening of the Ethanolic Extract of Acanthospermum hispidum and Moringa oleifera for their Pharmacological Activities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0543/v1","date":1710145621000,"content":"Aim: M. oleifera, a tree that have medicinal applications. A.hispidum has been utilized in traditional medicine as a cure for microbial and other infections. The aim of this study is to evaluate the bioactive compounds of A.hispidum and M.oleifera and determination of Antioxidant, Anticancer, Antifungal and Antibacterial for their pharmaceutical importance.\n           Methods: Fresh leaves of these plants were collected from Akinmoorin and Awe in Nigeria. Particles Induced X-Ray Emission method was carried out via a 2.5MeV proton beam. Detection of phytochemicals was carried out by HPLC analysis. Disc diffusion method was used to determine MIC for fungi and MIC for bacteria. DPPH radical scavenging activity of these plant leaves was determined. Cancer cells were cultivated using 5% CO2 with 95% air in 100% relative humidity. The adherent cells were seeded and subjected to treatment with increase concentrations of the plant extracts from 48–72 h for anti-cancer activity. \nResults: The mean ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.M.) for all data were displayed. Three copies of the invitro experiment data were collected. For unpaired data, the student's t-test was applied at P &lt; 0.05, the differences in the data were deemed significant. The ethanolic extracts showed on the average a 50% reduction in cancer cell viability at 24.5μg mL−1 for MO and 16.0μg mL−1 for AH respectively. \nConclusions: The results of this study indicated these two plants have Antioxidant, Antitumor, Antifungal and Antibacterial activity and it is recommended that the active constituents be isolated and formulated into suitable dosage form.\nKeywords: Phytochemical Screening; pharmacological activities; Acanthospermum hispidum; Moringa oleifera.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e672676fedef2163b3f875d1f364c6d7fe70856420449e273618307f290b042f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
