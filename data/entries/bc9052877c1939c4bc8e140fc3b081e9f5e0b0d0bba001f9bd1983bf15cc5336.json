While previous research has explored additives to enhance these soils’ properties, the potential of sand remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of varying sand percentages on expansive clayey soils’ consistency, compaction, and permeability. This study examines how adding different percentages of sand influences the physical properties of expansive clayey soils. Laboratory tests involved systematic testing of texture, compaction, and permeability. Findings reveal a notable improvement in the physical properties of the soil with the addition of sand. Results from the laboratory tests provided data for empirical equations that facilitate the prediction of soil properties based on the sand content. The enhancement in soil properties underscores the potential of sand as an additive for expansive clayey soils. The empirical equations presented here provide practical benefits to geotechnical engineers and practitioners engaged in construction projects involving these soils, offering them valuable insights into the benefits of sand additives to improve physical characteristics. The insights gained from this research hold promising prospects for improving construction practices and addressing the challenges associated with these soils.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"bc9052877c1939c4bc8e140fc3b081e9f5e0b0d0bba001f9bd1983bf15cc5336","category":"Environment"}
