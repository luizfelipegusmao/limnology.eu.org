The spatial structure of the museum and the exhibit display largely determine what visitors see and in which order, thereby shaping their visit experience. Despite the importance of spatial properties in museum studies, few scientific tools have been developed to analyze and compare the results across museums. This paper introduces the six habitually used network science indices and assesses their applicability to museum studies. Network science is an empirical research field that focuses on analyzing the relationships between components in an attempt to understand how individual behaviors can be converted into collective behaviors. By taking the museum and the visitors as the network, this methodology could reveal unknown aspects of museum functions and visitor behavior, which could enhance exhibition knowledge and lead to better methods for creating museum narratives along the routes.","author":"Yuji Yoshimura","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ec43d1360217ef766c1de5c7fc60a3d0337a25910d9fdfbce47ced7bbcd51dee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
