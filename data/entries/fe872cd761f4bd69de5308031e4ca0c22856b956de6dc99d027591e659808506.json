{"title":"Plant enhancers exhibit both cooperative and additive interactions among their functional elements","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/7/2570/7633284?rss=1","date":1710979200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Enhancers are <span>cis</span>-regulatory elements that shape gene expression in response to numerous developmental and environmental cues. In animals, several models have been proposed to explain how enhancers integrate the activity of multiple transcription factors. However, it remains largely unclear how plant enhancers integrate transcription factor activity. Here, we use Plant STARR-seq to characterize 3 light-responsive plant enhancers—<span>AB80</span>, <span>Cab-1</span>, and <span>rbcS-E9</span>—derived from genes associated with photosynthesis. Saturation mutagenesis revealed mutations, many of which clustered in short regions, that strongly reduced enhancer activity in the light, in the dark, or in both conditions. When tested in the light, these mutation-sensitive regions did not function on their own; rather, cooperative interactions with other such regions were required for full activity. Epistatic interactions occurred between mutations in adjacent mutation-sensitive regions, and the spacing and order of mutation-sensitive regions in synthetic enhancers affected enhancer activity. In contrast, when tested in the dark, mutation-sensitive regions acted independently and additively in conferring enhancer activity. Taken together, this work demonstrates that plant enhancers show evidence for both cooperative and additive interactions among their functional elements. This knowledge can be harnessed to design strong, condition-specific synthetic enhancers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"fe872cd761f4bd69de5308031e4ca0c22856b956de6dc99d027591e659808506","category":"Environment"}
