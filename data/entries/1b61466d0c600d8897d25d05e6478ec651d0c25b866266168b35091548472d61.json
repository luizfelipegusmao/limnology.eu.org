However, the utilization of biomarkers such as potassium, B-type natriuretic peptide, albumin, and others for diagnosis or the prediction of in-hospital mortality and cardiac complications has not been well established. The study aims to investigate whether biomarkers can be utilized to predict mortality and cardiac complications among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Data were collected from 6,927 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021 at one quaternary (Henry Ford Health) and five community hospital registries (Trinity Health Systems). A multivariable logistic regression prediction model was derived using a random sample of 70% for derivation and 30% for validation. Serum values, demographic variables, and comorbidities were used as input predictors. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome was onset of AA. The associations between predictor variables and outcomes are presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Discrimination was assessed using area under ROC curve (AUC). Calibration was assessed using Brier score. The model predicted in-hospital mortality with an AUC of 90% [95% CI: 88%, 92%]. In addition, potassium showed promise as an independent prognostic biomarker that predicted both in-hospital mortality, with an AUC of 71.51% [95% Cl: 69.51%, 73.50%], and AA with AUC of 63.6% [95% Cl: 58.86%, 68.34%]. Within the test cohort, an increase of 1 mEq/L potassium was associated with an in-hospital mortality risk of 1.40 [95% CI: 1.14, 1.73] and a risk of new onset of AA of 1.55 [95% CI: 1.25, 1.93]. This cross-sectional study suggests that biomarkers can be used as prognostic variables for in-hospital mortality and onset of AA among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","author":"Rawan Omar","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"1b61466d0c600d8897d25d05e6478ec651d0c25b866266168b35091548472d61","category":"Environment"}
