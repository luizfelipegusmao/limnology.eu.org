{"title":"The drivers of benthic macroinvertebrates communities along a subtropical river system: Sediments chemistry or water quality?","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2649?af=R","date":1714025682000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Impacts of metal pollution, either on water or in sediments within aquatic systems have been a serious challenge globally. Little is known about the ecological impacts of metal pollution on benthic macroinvertebrates species in sub–tropical river systems. The aim of this study was to examine benthic macroinvertebrates community composition in relation to sediment metal concentrations and other physicochemical variables in the Mutshundudi River system. Benthic macroinvertebrates sampling and community composition analysis, sediment collection, processing, metal analysis and assessment of water variables in the river system were done across two seasons at 12 sampling sites. The river was categorized into three segments: upstream, midstream and downstream. The results from geo-accumulation (Igeo) values showed that sediments were loaded with Na, Zn, and B in all river segments. In comparison with South African water quality guidelines for aquatic ecosystems, water quality ranged from good at upstream sites because of low anthropogenic activities to very poor in downstream sites because of high anthropogenic activities. Sediments from the Mutshundudi River showed significant differences on high concentrations of metals (i.e., Mg, K, Na, and Cu) and seasonal variations. Both water quality and sediment chemistry were considered the driving factors of benthic macroinvertebrates, since species densities and composition reduced with a decline in water and sediment quality during both cool–dry and hot–wet seasons. Continuous build-up of the metal contaminants, such as Mg, K, Na, and Cu in river sediments may pose adverse impacts on macroinvertebrate community structure.</p>","author":"Linton F.
