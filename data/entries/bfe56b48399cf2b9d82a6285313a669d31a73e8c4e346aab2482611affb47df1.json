{"title":"Knockdown of circ_0076305 decreases the paclitaxel resistance of non-small cell lung cancer cells by regulating TMPRSS4 via miR-936","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae102/7710318?rss=1","date":1720569600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>Paclitaxel (PTX) is a commonly used as a chemotherapeutic drug for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Exploring the underlying mechanism of PTX resistance is of great significance for NSCLC treatment.<div>Methods</div>The expression levels of RNA and protein were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot assays. The targeted relationship was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA-pull down assay. The PTX resistance and cell proliferation were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and 5-Ethynyl-2â€²-deoxyuridine (EDU) assay, respectively. Cell migration and invasion were analyzed by transwell assays. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry, and cell glycolysis was analyzed using the commercial kits. The role of circular RNA_0076305 (circ_0076305) in regulating the PTX sensitivity in vivo was explored in xenograft tumor model.<div>Results</div>Circ_0076305 was up-regulated in PTX-resistant NSCLC tissues and cells. Mechanically, circ_0076305 bound to microRNA-936 (miR-936), and miR-936 targeted transmembrane serine protease 4 (TMPRSS4). Circ_0076305 could up-regulate TMPRSS4 expression by sponging miR-936 in NSCLC cells. miR-936 knockdown or TMPRSS4 overexpression reversed the anti-tumor effects of circ_0076305 knockdown in NSCLC cells with PTX treatment. Circ_0076305 silencing increased the PTX sensitivity of xenograft tumors in vivo.<div>Conclusion</div>Circ_0076305 silencing promoted PTX sensitivity by targeting miR-936/TMPRSS4 axis in NSCLC cells.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"bfe56b48399cf2b9d82a6285313a669d31a73e8c4e346aab2482611affb47df1","category":"Environment"}
