{"title":"Combination of fermentation and enzymolysis enhances bioactive components and function of de‐oiled rice bran","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13774?af=R","date":1722413024000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>De-oiled rice bran (DORB), a substantial yet underutilized byproduct of rice processing, boasts a rich composition of active ingredients but suffers from limited application. Previous studies have indicated that enzymatic or fermentation treatments enhanced these active components. In this study, lactobacilli and complex enzymes were employed to co-treat DORB, involving the determination of the changes in active components and functionalities of DORB extract (DORBE) before and after this treatment.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Following fermentation–enzymolysis, the total phenol and total flavonoid contents in DORBE were significantly increased by 43.59% and 55.10%, reaching 19.66 and 34.34 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Antioxidant tests <i>in vitro</i> demonstrated that the co-treatment enhanced the scavenging activities of DPPH, hydroxyl and ABTS radicals. Porcine intestinal epithelial cell experiments revealed that, compared to DORBE, the fermentation and enzymolysis DORBE (FDORBE) exhibited significantly improved cell viability and catalase activity as well as scavenging capacity for reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde after induction by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, FDORBE restored the decreased mRNA expression levels of <i>Nrf2</i>, <i>HO-1</i> and <i>NQO1</i> in the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway stimulated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Fermentation–enzymolysis co-treatment increases the contents of bioactive components of DORBE and enhances its antioxidant capacity, leading to a better protection against intestinal disorders induced by oxidative stress, suggesting that this co-treatment is a rational and effective strategy to increase the value of grains and promotes the use of DORB as a functional feed in animal production. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Meixin Hou, \nJianmin Wu, \nJingna Miao, \nHui Zeng, \nJinghong Liao, \nSuqin Hang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"441d49f484df84b75e6834cc47919b77af162d03fc821a7c9a2fcedb8ecd4ae0","category":"Environment"}
