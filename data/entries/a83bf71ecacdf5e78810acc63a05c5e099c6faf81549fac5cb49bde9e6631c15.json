{"title":"Potential Inhibitory Role of Amentoflavone Against Ebola Virus VP24 Structure: Insights from Docking Results","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0080/v1","date":1725263902000,"content":"This study investigates the potential inhibitory role of Amentoflavone against the Ebola virus, with a focus on the viral protein VP24 structure. Molecular docking simulations were conducted to assess the binding affinity and interaction between Amentoflavone and the VP24 protein. The results revealed promising docking scores, suggesting favorable binding of Amentoflavone to the VP24 structure. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic efficacy of Amentoflavone against Ebola virus infection by targeting specific viral proteins. Further experimental validation is warranted to confirm these docking results and elucidate the mechanism of action underlying Amentoflavone's antiviral activity. This study contributes to the ongoing efforts to develop novel therapeutic strategies for combating Ebola virus disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a83bf71ecacdf5e78810acc63a05c5e099c6faf81549fac5cb49bde9e6631c15","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
