{"title":"Bipolar Disorder: A Comprehensive Review of Genetics, Causal Hypotheses, Clinical Signs, Evolution, Biomarkers, and Treatment Options","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2235/v1","date":1725268310000,"content":"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex mental health condition characterized by alternating periods of mania and depression. This review provides a comprehensive overview of BD, focusing on its genetics, causal hypotheses, clinical signs and evolution, potential biomarkers with an emphasis on electroencephalography (EEG), and treatment options. Genetic studies have identified several susceptibility genes and polygenic risk scores, highlighting the heritable nature of BD. Various causal hypotheses, including monoamine dysregulation, kindling, circadian rhythm disruptions, and neuroinflammation, have been proposed to explain its pathophysiology. The clinical course of BD is characterized by recurrent episodes of mania/hypomania and depression, with significant heterogeneity among individuals. EEG and other biomarkers hold promise for improving diagnosis, predicting treatment response, and elucidating the neurobiological underpinnings of BD. Current treatment options include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and neuromodulation techniques, which can be tailored to individual needs based on clinical presentation and response to treatment. Future research should focus on identifying more specific biomarkers, developing novel treatments, and optimizing existing therapies to improve outcomes for individuals with BD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"efcb5283ac955de5bfb2a28fff3050f4b8b64a0bd6c97dcce27ef69b7212ce52","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
