{"title":"Association between the composite dietary antioxidant index and constipation: Evidence from NHANES 2005â€“2010","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311168","date":1727445600000,"content":"<p>by Shouxin Wei, Sijia Yu, Yunsheng Lan, Yingdong Jia</p>\r\nBackground <p>Dietary antioxidants have been found to improve various diseases, including digestive, cardiovascular, and urinary disorders. However, the relationship between CDAI and constipation remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the potential link between CDAI and constipation among adults in the United States.</p> Methods <p>This study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collected between 2005 and 2010. Dietary data from the respondents were obtained through two 24-hour dietary recall interviews. Multiple statistical methods, including multivariable logistic regression, subgroup analysis, and smooth curve fitting analysis, were used to explore the association between CDAI and chronic constipation.</p> Results <p>A total of 10,904 participants were included in the study, of whom 1,184 were identified as having chronic constipation. After adjusting for potential confounders, multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that higher CDAI was significantly associated with a lower risk of constipation (OR = 0.958 [0.929, 0.987]). Compared to the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of CDAI was associated with a significantly reduced prevalence of constipation (OR = 0.704 [0.535, 0.927]). Subgroup analysis indicated that differences in gender, alcohol intake, and smoking status might influence the association between CDAI and constipation. Smooth curve analysis revealed an \"n\" shaped relationship between CDAI and constipation among non-alcohol consumers, with a turning point at a CDAI value of 1.08.</p> Conclusion <p>An elevated CDAI is negatively correlated with the incidence of chronic constipation, suggesting that increasing dietary antioxidant intake may reduce constipation prevalence. These findings underscore the importance of dietary antioxidants in maintaining gut health and provide comprehensive guidance for clinical and public health practices.</p>","author":"Shouxin Wei","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f0179020314c1e1482f1d4c8437ddf5ae392449e111b83d5ac01728f0e63ed5b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
