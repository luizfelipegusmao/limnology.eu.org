This study was conducted to examine and evaluate the appropriateness of antibiotic doses. A cross-sectional study with a quantitative approach was conducted in three hospitals located in Savar from January 06, 2021 to October 17, 2022. This study had used a convenient sampling method to collect 405 filled prescription orders from heterogeneous pediatric patients prescribed by physicians from emergency, inpatient, and outpatient care units of various clinical settings. The Harriet Lane Handbook was used as reference to investigate inappropriate doses of antibiotics. Subsequently, all analyses were conducted using the RStudio 1.3.959 software. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the risk of inappropriate antibiotic prescription in pediatrics. The overall prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic dosing in pediatrics was 335 out of 545 (61.5%). Overdosing (36.3%) and oral antibiotic prescriptions (64%) were more common than underdosing (20.4%) and parenteral antibiotics (36%). The majority (230 out of 405, 56.8%) of pediatric patients had prescriptions with inappropriate antibiotic doses, with prevalence rates of 33.8% for inpatients, 86.7% for outpatients, and 50% for emergency pediatrics. The results also indicated that pediatric patients in outdoor and emergency care units, infants, toddlers, and early childhood, those prescribed two antibiotics simultaneously, and those receiving parenteral antibiotics, were less likely to have inappropriate antibiotic dosages in their prescriptions. This study demonstrated that about one out of every two prescriptions had inappropriate antibiotic doses; in particular, prescriptions containing only one antibiotic exhibited a substantial proportion of inappropriate antibiotic doses. Inappropriate antibiotic doses may result in therapeutic failure, patient harm, and antibiotic resistance. Good clinical pharmacy practice and careful adherence to pediatric dosing standards may minimize inappropriate antibiotic doses.","author":"A. F. M.
