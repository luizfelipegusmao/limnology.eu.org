{"title":"Elementary Particles and Their Interaction with Space-Time Curvature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.0809/v5","date":1723776509000,"content":"This article investigates the fundamental principles that establish universal limits in physical phenomena, such as the uniformity of physical laws and Energy conservation, leading to the concepts of maximum speed, locality, and maximum density. These principles guide me to explore Quantum Black Holesâ€”relativistically rotating, miniature charged black holes with a singular core at the highest possible density. Uniquely, these Quantum Black Holes maintain all quantized charges, including gravitational ones. The study further demonstrates that quarks and leptons are composed of these Quantum Black Holes, redefining them as the actual elementary particles.Exploring these particles reveals that they emit Energy outward, modifying the curvature of nearby space-time. This discovery provides new insights into local space-time dynamics, characterized by a single equation that includes the influence of all charges and hidden Energy. By the conclusion of this article, I show that Quantum Black Holes offer explanations for several Standard Model deficiencies: the nature of luminous, dark, and anti-Matter; the mass, size, and quantized charges of all elementary particles (including gravitational); the nature of neutrino oscillations; and the mechanism by which electric charges remain bound even though the same type of electric charge components must repeal each other.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f7b677d48a976285a0e6f472acdd8c29d7fe6000a4ad7e9dd6b9bf27ebf804e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
