{"title":"Water content for clot composition prediction in acute ischemic stroke","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304520","date":1716559200000,"content":"<p>by Kenichi Sakuta, Taichiro Imahori, Amir Molaie, Mahsa Ghovvati, Neal Rao, Satoshi Tateshima, Naoki Kaneko</p>\r\nBackground <p>Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has become the gold standard care for treating acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to large vessel occlusion. Emerging evidence suggests that understanding the composition of clots prior to intervention could be useful for the selection of neuroendovascular techniques, potentially improving the efficacy of treatments. However, current imaging modalities lack the ability to distinguish clot composition accurately and reliably. Since water content can influence signal intensity on CT and MRI scans, its assessment may provide indirect clues about clot composition. This study aimed to elucidate the correlation between water content and clot composition using human clots retrieved from stroke patients and experimentally generated ovine clots.</p> Materials and methods <p>This study involved an analysis of ten clots retrieved from patients with AIS undergoing MT. Additionally, we created ten red blood cells (RBC)-rich and ten fibrin-rich ovine blood clots, which were placed in a human intracranial vascular model under realistic flow conditions. The water content and compositions of these clots were evaluated, and linear regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship between clot composition and water content.</p> Results <p>The regression analysis in human stroke clots revealed a significant negative association between RBC concentration and water content. We also observed a positive correlation between water content and both fibrin and platelets in ovine blood clots.Conclusion</p>","author":"Kenichi Sakuta","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"187dc3faf92da230f17b97c19c3346cb8b7acba1c0211b6de11679bc53c5df81","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
