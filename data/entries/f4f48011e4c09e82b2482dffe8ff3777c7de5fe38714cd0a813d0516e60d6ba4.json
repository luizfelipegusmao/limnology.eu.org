Despite many studies evaluating the impacts of SM on vegetation activity, changes in vegetation sensitivity to SM are still poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the spatiotemporal changes of vegetation sensitivity to SM across the Loess Plateau (LP) region from 1982 to 2010 using satellite-based normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and reanalysis SM data. Our results showed a significant increase in NDVI (slope = 0.0015/year, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and a slight decrease in SM (slope = −0.0001 m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>/year, <i>p</i> = 0.7) over the past 29 years, indicating a greening trend in the LP. By establishing a multiple linear model, we found that the sensitivity of vegetation dynamics to SM has significantly increased during the same period (slope = 0.029, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Spatially, vegetation in over half (51.2%) of the total area showed enhanced sensitivity to SM. Further analysis using the Lindeman–Merenda–Gold method showed that atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> was the major contributor (27.20%) to the sensitivity changes, followed by nitrogen deposition (23.70%) and air temperature (20.11%). Ecosystem structure changes (represented by non-tree land cover fractions) and precipitation shifts contributed 16.13% and 12.83%, respectively, to sensitivity changes. These findings provide a better understanding of the spatiotemporal pattern and underlying mechanisms of ecosystem sensitivity to SM in the greening and warming LP.</p>","author":"Xi Wang, \nFubo Zhao, \nYiping Wu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"f4f48011e4c09e82b2482dffe8ff3777c7de5fe38714cd0a813d0516e60d6ba4","category":"Environment"}
