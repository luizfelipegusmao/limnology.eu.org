{"title":"Polymer Nanocomposite Ablatives - Part Iii","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0841/v1","date":1723499678000,"content":"Previous reviews by the authors [1, 2] indicate the continuing development and improvement of thermal protective systems through the introduction of polymer nanocomposites into polymer matrix composites. These materials perform as thermal protective systems for a variety of aerospace applications, such as thermal protection systems (TPS), solid rocket motors (SRM) nozzles, internal insulation of SRM, leading edges of hypersonic vehicles, and missile launch structures. A summary of the most recent, global technical research is presented. Polymeric resin systems continue to emphasize phenolic resins and other materials. New high-temperature organic resins based on phthalonitrile (PN), and polysiloxane are described and extend the increased temperature range of resin matrix systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c42d7cc558d3416d6e08bf47a25b3a9ee88eb1280dd06ec0da6ea5dbb4e82f1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
