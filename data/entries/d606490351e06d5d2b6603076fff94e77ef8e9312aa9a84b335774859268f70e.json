{"title":"Rebound Effects caused by Artificial Intelligence and\nAutomation in Private Life and Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0504/v1","date":1725608413000,"content":"Many tasks in a modern household are done by machines like e.g. a dishwasher or a\nvacuum cleaner and in the near future most household tasks can be done by smart service robots.\nThis relieves the residents who in turn can enjoy their free time. This newly gained free time turns\nout to cause the so called spare time rebound effect due to more resource consumption [1,2]. We\nroughly quantify this rebound effect and propose a CO2 -budget model to reduce or even avoid it. In\nmodern industry, automation and AI take over work from humans, leading to higher productivity of\nthe company as a whole. This is the main reason for economic growth which leads to environmental\nproblems due to higher consumption of natural resources. We show that, even though the effects of\nautomation at home and in the industry are different (free time versus higher productivity) in the\nend they both lead to more resource consumption and environmental pollution. We discuss possible\nsolutions to this problem such as carbon taxes, emissions trading systems and a carbon budget.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d606490351e06d5d2b6603076fff94e77ef8e9312aa9a84b335774859268f70e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
