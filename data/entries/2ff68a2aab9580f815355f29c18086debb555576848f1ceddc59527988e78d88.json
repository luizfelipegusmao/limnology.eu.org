This paper explores and compares two Ecotourism models: Chambok Ecotourism Site in Cambodia and Kerujuk Village Ecotourism in North Lombok, Indonesia. Through a comparative analysis, we examine how each community integrates tourism with local resources, empowers residents, and addresses environmental and social challenges. The study highlights the benefits of CBT in poverty alleviation and environmental conservation while also discussing the unique challenges each location faces.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ff68a2aab9580f815355f29c18086debb555576848f1ceddc59527988e78d88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
