Subsequently, a dependency on in situ primary productivity as the source of organic matter increases and warrants detailed investigation of the nature of primary production in urbanized river systems. In this study, primary productivity was estimated at multiple locations along the continuum of an engineered (Sabarmati) and a free flowing (Mahi) river systems in India using <sup>13</sup>C tracer incubation method. Significantly enhanced primary productivity in the riverfront (engineered construction along the Sabarmati that holds water supplied by a canal) and polluted downstream of the Sabarmati compared to free flowing Mahi was observed. It was also observed that water stagnancy, temperature, and nutrient availability were the key factors regulating the rates of primary productivity in the urban river system. The study highlights the salient features of riverine primary productivity associated with engineered modifications, which needs to be considered for future river development projects.</p>","author":"Siddhartha Sarkar, \nSanjeev Kumar","siteTitle":"Wiley: River: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0b74d58d2572beb2996093d38ec1aeffad4d7646e8152f056f56cbe7cdd98b36","entryHash":"2d78b6f0480ac39dfa6d6416d9e2344cdda545fb0e948f46c6d8569f2ec3b796","category":"Environment"}
