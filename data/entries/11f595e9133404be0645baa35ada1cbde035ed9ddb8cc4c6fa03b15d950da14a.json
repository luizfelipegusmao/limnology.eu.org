{"title":"Thin and Flexible PANI/PMMA/CNT Forest Films Produced via a Two-Step Floating Catalyst Chemical Vapor Deposition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1516/v1","date":1729511233000,"content":"In this paper, we explore a straightforward two-step method to produce high purity, vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Two distinct solutions are utilized for this CVD method: a catalytic solution consisting of ferrocene and acetonitrile (ACN), and a carbon source solution with camphor and ACN. The vapors of the catalytic solution inserted in the reaction chamber through external boiling, result in a floating catalyst CVD approach that produces vertically aligned MWCNTs in a consistent manner. MWCNTs are grown in a conventional CVD horizontal reactor, at 850°C under atmospheric pressure, and characterized by Raman spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Coating the MWCNTs with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) while still on the Si substrate, retains the structure and results in a flexible, conductive thin film suitable for electrodes. The film is 62 μm thick and stable in aqueous solutions, capable of withstanding further processes such as electropolymerization with polyaniline, to be used for energy storage applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"11f595e9133404be0645baa35ada1cbde035ed9ddb8cc4c6fa03b15d950da14a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
