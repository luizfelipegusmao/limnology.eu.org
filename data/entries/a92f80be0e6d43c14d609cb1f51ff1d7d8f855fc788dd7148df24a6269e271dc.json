{"title":"3D Stereophotogrammetry in the Evaluation of Pediatric OSAS: Preliminary Results","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1456/v1","date":1726742846000,"content":"Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of upper airway obstruction and involves intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, with potentially serious consequences for affected patients. (1–3).\nAlthough nocturnal polysomnography is the gold standard, it is an exam that is not readily available and is very expensive. (4). Hence, the need to find new diagnostic methods. Considering that the causes of OSAS can be divided into anatomical-structural ones, related to craniofacial anomalies, it has been hypothesized that anthropometric measurements taken by new 3D stereophotogrammetric systems could be useful as a diagnostic tool in pediatric patients with OSAS (5) (6).\nThe primary objective of the study is, therefore, to evaluate the correlation between mandibular length measured between menton and gonion, obtained through 3D stereophotogrammetry using the \"Face Scanner maxi 6\", and the severity of OSAS (AHI classification), defined by the score of the Sleep Clinical Record (SCR) questionnaire in a group of pediatric patients with suspected obstructive sleep disorders. The secondary objective concerns the identification of possible correlations between other mandibular parameters estimated by 3D stereophotogrammetry and the severity of OSAS, defined by the McGill Oximetry Score (MOS), and the association between MOS and SCR to determine the AHI level.\nMaterials and methods: The study considered patients who were prescribed a pulseoximetry exam due to suspected obstructive sleep disorders. All participating patients underwent a specialized orthodontic examination, which included completing the SCR questionnaire and taking facial photographs using a 3D stereophotogrammetric system.\nThe SCR questionnaire considers 11 dental, nasal, oropharyngeal, and facial phenotype parameters to determine a final score from 0 to 18, indicating the risk of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.\nThe acquired stereophotogrammetric images were processed using dedicated software to obtain a three-dimensional model representing the patient's facial phenotype. Subsequently, anatomical landmarks and relevant anthropometric measurements were identified on the model, and it was assessed whether one or more of these showed concordance criteria with the parameters derived from SCR and MOS. The anthropometric evaluation was performed by expert operators, taking into account mandibular variables.\nResults: Fifteen patients were analyzed, with 2 excluded due to alterations in the stereophotogrammetric images caused by poor patient cooperation during the acquisition of the photographs. Spearman's correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between anthropometric measurements, obtained by 3D stereophotogrammetry, and OSAS severity, by means of  SCR, MOS, and SCR+MOS. A significant and negative correlation was observed between right mandibular length (gonion-menton) and MOS (ρ=−0.586, p=0.036).\nConclusions: The result obtained has important implications for the field of study and suggests that future attention should focus more on the mandibular length variable as a determining factor for OSAS. However, the sample examined was relatively small, which might obscure the correlation with contralateral mandibular length and potential correlations with other mandibular/facial parameters. Additionally, the small sample size prevented stratification by sex and age. The study thus provides an important contribution to understanding the relationships between 3D stereophotogrammetry and pediatric OSAS but also highlights the need for further research that could potentially influence future developments in diagnosing OSAS in children.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a92f80be0e6d43c14d609cb1f51ff1d7d8f855fc788dd7148df24a6269e271dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
