{"title":"The Application of Multimodal Ultrasound Technology in Improving the Success Rate of Liver Tumor Puncture under Poor Visibility on Conventional Ultrasound Imaging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1266/v1","date":1718722926000,"content":"Abstract\nPurpose: This study aims to evaluate the potential of multimodal ultrasound techniques in improving the visibility of liver lesions that are indistinct under conventional ultrasound. Specifically, we will explore the application of fusion imaging, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), and high-frequency ultrasound in enhancing the visibility of liver masses. These techniques will be utilized to assist in visualizing liver lesions and to accurately localize them for the purpose of performing percutaneous tissue biopsy. Lastly, we will compare the biopsy results with the final diagnosis to assess whether multimodal techniques can enhance the success rate of percutaneous biopsy for liver masses that are not clearly visible under conventional ultrasound. Furthermore, the potential impact of these techniques on the development of personalized treatment strategies for patients was also discussed.\nMaterials and Results: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 144 patients with liver masses who underwent conventional ultrasound examinations at our hospital from October 2018 to January 2024. These patients had poor visibility on conventional ultrasound, but the tumor location was visible on abdominal computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We excluded 71 patients who did not undergo percutaneous liver tumor biopsy and 8 patients who remained non-visualized under multimodal ultrasound. Finally, 95 patients met the inclusion criteria and their clinical and radiological data were selected for analysis. Computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound (CT/MR-US) fusion imaging was performed in 55 patients, CEUS was conducted in 95 patients, and high-frequency ultrasound examination was performed in 21 patients. The visibility of the lesions using these three techniques was evaluated, and the consistency between the biopsy pathology and the final diagnosis was analyzed.\nResults: In the study, a total of 39 cases were identified as solitary liver lesions, 34 cases as multiple lesions, and an additional 23 cases as diffuse hepatocellular carcinoma. Among them, there were 13 cases (13.7%) of lesions located in the left lobe, 73 cases (76.8%) in the right lobe, and 9 cases (9.4%) at the junction of the left and right lobes. The average maximum diameter of the lesions was 2.7 cm (ranging from 0.7 cm to 10.0 cm). The detection rates of lesions using CT/MR-US fusion imaging, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), and high-frequency ultrasound examination were 49.1%, 96.8%, and 76.2%, respectively. All patients in the entire cohort underwent percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsy after confirming the target location of the lesions, including 9 patients underwent percutaneous microwave ablation. No severe complications were observed. The accuracy rate of the biopsies was 91.6%, and the positive concordance rate was 91.1%. The biopsy pathology included 39 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 16 cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), 22 cases of metastatic adenocarcinoma, 3 cases of hepatic adenoma (HA), 1 case of vascular sarcoma, and 1 case of mixed HCC-ICC. Among the 13 patients with negative pathology findings after biopsy, 8 cases were considered false negatives (based on follow-up laboratory tests and imaging results consistent with malignant tumor characteristics), resulting in a false negative rate of 8.9%.\nConclusions: The application of multimodal ultrasound technology can significantly improve the success rate of liver lesion biopsies that are difficult to visualize using conventional ultrasound. Furthermore, it will facilitate the guidance of microwave ablation therapy for lesions using multimodal ultrasound imaging, enabling collaborative precision treatment planning for patients with clinical physicians.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43552fb2b9eab671ae1b1fa39bd319e0488e7ea6b9ba93121fd44eaef85ec269","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
