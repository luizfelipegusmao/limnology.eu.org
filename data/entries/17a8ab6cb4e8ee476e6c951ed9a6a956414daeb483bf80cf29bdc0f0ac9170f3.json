{"title":"Metabolic Fingerprinting of Blood and Urine of Dairy Cows Affected by Bovine Leukemia Virus: A Mass Spectrometry Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1882/v1","date":1729755171000,"content":"This study investigated metabolic changes associated with Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) infection in dairy cows, focusing on pre-parturition alterations. Of 145 cows examined, 42 (28.9%) were BLV-seropositive. 38% of infected cows showed high somatic cell counts indicative of subclinical mastitis, with 15 experiencing additional health issues such as ketosis, milk fever, and lameness. Despite these conditions, no significant differences in milk yield or composition were observed between infected and control groups. Metabolomic analysis conducted at -8 and -4 weeks prepartum revealed significant metabolic differences between BLV-infected and healthy cows. At -8 weeks, 30 serum metabolites were altered, including sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines, amino acids, and acylcarnitines, suggesting disruptions in membrane integrity, energy metabolism, and immune function indicative of early neoplastic transformations. By -4 weeks, the number of altered metabolites reduced to 17, continuing to reflect metabolic disruptions in cows with leukemia. Multivariate analysis highlighted distinct metabolic profiles between infected and control cows, identifying key discriminating metabolites such as choline, aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and arginine. Urine metabolomics revealed significant prepartum shifts in metabolites related to glucose, asymmetric dimethylarginine, and pyruvic acid, among others. The research confirmed metabolomics' efficacy in defining a BLV infection metabolic profile, elucidating leukosis-associated metabolic disruptions. This approach facilitates identification of BLV-infected cows and enhances understanding of infection pathophysiology, providing a foundation for advanced management and intervention strategies in dairy herds. The study underscores the profound impact of leukosis on metabolic processes and highlights urine metabolomics' utility in non-invasively detecting BLV infection, offering potential for improved herd health management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17a8ab6cb4e8ee476e6c951ed9a6a956414daeb483bf80cf29bdc0f0ac9170f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
