{"title":"Explore an open-source value co-creation framework: A multiple case study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310516","date":1726840800000,"content":"<p>by Yang Luo, Yongsheng Jin, Yuanmao Ji</p>\r\n\r\nOpen-source communities(OSCs) are gaining significant attention in the current business environment of information technology(IT). More and more IT companies and individuals are exploring how to achieve innovation through open-source collaboration, and value co-creation(VCC) in the OSCs has become a trend. Therefore, it is particularly important to examine the mechanism of OSCs under the background of VCC theory. This study proposes a conceptual framework of open-source value co-creation (OSVCC), which is characterized by openness, sharing, collaboration, and freedom, for understanding the internal mechanisms and contextual conditions in the relationship between OSCs participants. This study constructed a pairwise combined four-category classification model combining the perspectives of the commercialization level (low and high) and the maturity stage (developmental and mature) of the OSCs. Based on the model, this study selects and analyzes four presentive cases of OSCs using a multiple case study approach. Then, this study proposes a framework for OSVCC to identify the crucial factors that promote the successful implementation of innovation and value creation. The OSVCC framework encompasses three primary participants, effective VCC processes, and key open-source principles. This study offers valuable managerial implications for enterprises that plan to participate in OSCs.","author":"Yang Luo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0f7c664f954490b800e73dd6c34566e9c0a1e3ee1a859359b5e5851aac958f47","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
