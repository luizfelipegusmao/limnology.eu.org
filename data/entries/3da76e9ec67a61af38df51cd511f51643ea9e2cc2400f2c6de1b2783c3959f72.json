{"title":"Robust Overbooking for No-shows and Cancellations in Healthcare","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0257/v1","date":1717577464000,"content":"The healthcare system is crucial to the development, standard of living, and sustainability of any country. Amid the pandemic, most developed countries are experiencing varying levels of difficulty managing their healthcare systems. Overloading of healthcare services is common, leading to prolonged waiting times for medical services; thus, the wastage of hospital resources must be addressed seriously. In this paper, we examine the problem of no-shows in outpatient clinics. Through a review of the literature and practical industrial experience, we identify the processes of these clinics. We then propose a robust optimisation approach for overbooking using a traditional overbooking model and a robust system. This model aims to mitigate the significant parameter uncertainties encountered during the pandemic. Considering risk aversion, the optimal policy for overbooking can be established while accounting for the costs associated with overbooking. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of an alternative method to address the uncertainty of no-shows using an overbooking technique.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3da76e9ec67a61af38df51cd511f51643ea9e2cc2400f2c6de1b2783c3959f72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
