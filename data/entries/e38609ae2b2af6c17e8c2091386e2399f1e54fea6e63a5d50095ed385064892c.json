{"title":"A Study on a Radio Source Location Estimation System Using High Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0998/v1","date":1723631092000,"content":"In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of illegal radio stations that exceed power limits or use illegal frequencies. There has been a radio monitoring system called the DEURAS system to control these illegal radio stations. This system monitors illegal radio stations by receiving illegal radio waves using sensor stations installed in various locations. However, these systems sometimes do not work well when there is no line of sight from the sensor stations to the illegal radio stations or when there are many reflected waves generated due to the surrounding environment. In this study, we proposed a radio wave source estimation using HAPS, an unmanned aerial vehicle flying at high altitude. The simulation results show that estimation from high altitude provides higher estimation probability and estimation accuracy than the conventional method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e38609ae2b2af6c17e8c2091386e2399f1e54fea6e63a5d50095ed385064892c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
