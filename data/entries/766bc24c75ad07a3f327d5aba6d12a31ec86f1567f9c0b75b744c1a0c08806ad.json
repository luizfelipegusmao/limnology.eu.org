{"title":"Sensitivity analysis of heat and mass transfer at working face in high-temperature mine","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306269","date":1719583200000,"content":"<p>by Hang Zhou, Xiangdong Zhang, Shuguang Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nThermal damage from heat sources severely affects the safety of deep mine production. Heat and mass transfer between heat sources and airflow leads to the increase of the airflow temperature (AFT), moisture content of airflow (AFMC) and relative humidity of airflow (AFRH). This study aims to quantify uncertainty contributions of the working face parameters on AFT, AFMC and AFRH and find their main contributors. The flow, geometric and physical parameters are chosen as uncertainty sources. Subsequently, Sobol indices are obtained using the point-collocation non-intrusive polynomial chaos method, denoting the sensitivity of each input parameter. It was found that the inflow wind temperature and the wind velocity are two top factors influencing AFT and AFMC, while relative humidity of inflow wind and the wind velocity are two top factors influencing AFRH. In the single factor analysis, the uncertainty contributions of the inflow wind temperature on AFT and AFMC, and relative humidity of inflow wind on AFRH can exceed 0.7, which is higher than those of the wind velocity. The geometric parameters of the working face, namely the length, width and height, and ventilation time are also significant quantities influencing AFT, AFMC and AFRH. Compared to AFT and AFMC, two other significant quantities influencing AFRH are the thermal conductivity of coal and the original temperature of the rock.","author":"Hang Zhou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"766bc24c75ad07a3f327d5aba6d12a31ec86f1567f9c0b75b744c1a0c08806ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
