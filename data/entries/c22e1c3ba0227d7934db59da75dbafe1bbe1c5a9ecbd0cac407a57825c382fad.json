{"title":"Balancing Nets and Lives: A Socio-Ecological Analysis of Sustainable Fisheries in the Gulf of Mannar","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0879/v1","date":1723532165000,"content":"The Gulf of Mannar, a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve, faces severe overfishing and habitat degradation threats. In this study, we investigate the pivotal role of ecosystem services in sustaining local livelihoods and overall well-being. By conducting a comprehensive survey of 480 respondents across two districts, we gathered extensive data on demographics, livelihoods, fishing practices, reliance on ecosystem services, and community management participation. The analysis reveals a critical dependence on the Gulf's resources (income, food security, traditions) with gender disparities (men fish, women in pre/post-harvest), but fishing is only allowed in the 10km buffer zone (not the core zone). The findings emphasize the promise of community-based strategies, such as Marine Protected Areas and reviving co-management committees, for achieving sustainable fisheries management. However, we also identify gaps, including the need for more nuanced well-being indicators and improved models for community management participation. To address these challenges, we advocate for sustainable fishing practices, tackling social inequities, especially gender disparities in resource access and decision-making, and investing in healthcare, education, and social safety nets for fishing communities. Promoting alternative livelihoods can alleviate pressure on fish stocks, and empowering local communities through capacity building and community-based management initiatives is crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainability of both the Gulf of Mannar ecosystem and the well-being of its dependent communities. This multifaceted approach holds significant promise for balancing ecological health with human prosperity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c22e1c3ba0227d7934db59da75dbafe1bbe1c5a9ecbd0cac407a57825c382fad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
