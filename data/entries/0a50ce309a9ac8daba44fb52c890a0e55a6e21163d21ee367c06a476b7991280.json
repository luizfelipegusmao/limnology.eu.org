The design of the NIF exchanges regular damage to the laser’s final optics for 300% (and increasing) more energy delivered to its targets.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0a50ce309a9ac8daba44fb52c890a0e55a6e21163d21ee367c06a476b7991280","category":"Environment"}
