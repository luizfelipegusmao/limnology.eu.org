{"title":"Targeted Delivery of STING agonist via Albumin Nanoreactor Boosts Immunotherapeutic Efficacy against Aggressive Cancers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2354/v1","date":1722318218000,"content":"Activating the cytosolic innate immune sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway via natural and synthetic agonists holds great potential for priming robust antitumor immunity. However, the effectiveness of STING agonists is often impeded by the insufficient tumor accumulation, poor cellular entry, and rapid clearance, thus leading to difficulty of their clinic translation. Herein, we apply the human serum albumin as the single-molecule nanoreactor to encapsulate SR-717 (SH-NPs) for enhanced targeting delivery efficiency and biological potency. SH-NPs with rational size distribution exhibited superior serum stability, considerable cellular uptake and abundant tumor accumulation, thus increasing the STING signaling including phosphorylation of STING-associated proteins (TBK1, IRF3), and cytokines secretion inside tumor region. Subsequently, SH-NPs remarkably reshape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment into an immunogenic one that boosts antitumor T-cell immunity and improves the therapeutic efficacy of checkpoint blockade against murine tumors. We also validate SH-NPs in freshly isolated human renal tumor tissues to highlight their clinic translation capability. These findings pave the way towards targeted STING agonist delivery for reinvigorated immunotherapy of intractable cancers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a18bed066334a97c4bbb70db4afb6da6607f407a2ccd47212ae4253e02497e0a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
