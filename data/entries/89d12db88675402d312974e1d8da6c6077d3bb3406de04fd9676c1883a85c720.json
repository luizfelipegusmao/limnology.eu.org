(Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), is widely distributed across Asia and Europe. At high latitudes, it overwinters, as adult in diapause, which then becomes the insect source for the following year. To fully understand the developmental duration and diapause characteristics of <span>D. baccarum</span>, the effects of photoperiod and temperature were studied in a population from Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China. The results indicated that the developmental duration was significantly prolonged at temperatures of 20 or 25 째C, with a prolonged light period; however, when the light period was prolonged to 16L:8D and 18L:6D, the developmental duration was shortened significantly. Furthermore, the developmental duration was also shortened significantly with increasing temperature, when the photoperiod was 12L:12D for short days and 16L:8D for long days. All individuals entered diapause under short-day conditions of 10L:14D and 12L:12D at a temperature of 20 째C; however, the diapause rate decreased significantly under 14L:10D and 16L:8D photoperiods, and the diapause rate decreased significantly at a temperature of 25 째C with prolonged photoperiod. Interestingly, when the photoperiod was fixed at 12L:12D, the diapause rates at different temperatures (20, 25, 28, and 30 째C) exceeded 95%; while the effect of temperature on diapauses was nonsignificant under this photoperiod, it was still sensitive to the photoperiod; at a photoperiod of 16L:8D, the effect of temperature on the diapause rate was noticeable, and the diapause rate decreased significantly with increasing temperature.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"89d12db88675402d312974e1d8da6c6077d3bb3406de04fd9676c1883a85c720","category":"Environment"}
