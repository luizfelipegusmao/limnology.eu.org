{"title":"JAK/STAT Inhibition Normalizes Lipid Composition in 3D Human Epidermal Equivalents Challenged with Th2 Cytokines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1794/v1","date":1711707867000,"content":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder presenting a dysregulated immune response and derangement of the epidermal barrier lipids. The Th2-type cytokines interleukin IL-4 and IL-13 play a prominent role in AD by activating the Janus Kinase/Signal Transduction and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) intracellular signal axis. This study aimed to investigate the role of JAK/STAT in the lipid perturbations induced by Th2 signaling in 3D-epidermal equivalents. We used tofacitinib, a low-molecular-mass JAK inhibitor, to screen for the JAK/STAT-mediated deregulation of lipid metabolism. Th2 cytokines decreased the expression of elongases 1, 3, and 4, and serine-palmitoyl-transferase and increased that of sphingolipid delta(4)-desaturase, and carbonic anhydrase 2. Th2 cytokines inhibited the synthesis of palmitate and caused a depletion of triglycerides. This depletion was associated with altered PC profiles and fatty acid (FA) metabolism. Overall, the ceramide profiles were minimally affected. Except for most sphingolipids and very long chain FAs, the effects of Th2 on lipid pathways were reversed by co-treatment with tofacitinib. An increase in the mRNA levels of CPT1A and ACAT1, reduced by tofacitinib, suggests that Th2 cytokines promote FA beta-oxidation. In conclusion, pharmacological inhibition of JAK/STAT activation prevents the lipid disruption caused by halted homeostasis of FA metabolism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"41b9395b017bcd671178bdf3a07d69e317b966fe3c253fd4ce89b969c6e8bb65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
