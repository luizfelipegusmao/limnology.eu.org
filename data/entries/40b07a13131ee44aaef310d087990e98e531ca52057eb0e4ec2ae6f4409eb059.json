{"title":"Improving the language of migratory bird science in North America","link":"https://academic.oup.com/condor/article/doi/10.1093/ornithapp/duad059/7378040?rss=1","date":1699315200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Several long-accepted terms are widely misused in ornithology and have led to a misperception of important concepts in the ecology of Nearctic–Neotropical migratory birds. The term “North America” (and its ancillary terms “North American species,” “North American habitats,” etc.) is widely used to refer to the United States and Canada, when in fact it should include all of the continent from the Arctic through Panama. In a similar vein, the terms “wintering” and “over-wintering” (whether used to describe the status of individual birds or species, or as a modifier for terms like habitats, ecology, or behavior), “spring migration” and “fall migration” are inappropriate for Nearctic–Neotropical migrants because they explicitly reference conditions in the temperate zone of the continent, even as most such species spend the majority of their annual cycle elsewhere, where these terms are inaccurate and unhelpful. We discuss the pitfalls of using these terms and suggest several alternatives and replacements. In particular, we urge more precision in the use of the term “North America”; for Nearctic–Neotropical migratory species (especially long-distance migrants), we suggest retiring the terms “wintering” and “over-wintering” in favor of “nonbreeding”; and for the same group of species we suggest retiring the terms “spring migration” and “fall migration” in favor of “pre-breeding,” “post-breeding,” or “post-natal” migration.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Ornithological Applications Current Issue","siteHash":"0adf13706282b3ccfec74e0cd9d72c5688cecb6af30a6dfa64315dbe0b12427f","entryHash":"40b07a13131ee44aaef310d087990e98e531ca52057eb0e4ec2ae6f4409eb059","category":"Environment"}
