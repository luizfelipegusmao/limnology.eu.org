This has allowed for the development of many large and small automation routines over the decades [<a href=\"#ozae044.208-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.208-B2\">2</a>]. Python was added into DigitalMicrograph about 5 years ago because of its increased popularity as a programming language [<a href=\"#ozae044.208-B3\">3</a>]. This addition lowered the threshold to scripting in DigitalMicrograph and at the same time expanded its capabilities by making all Python libraries immediately available, for example for machine learning (TensorFlow) and sophisticated data mining (SciKit-learn) [<a href=\"#ozae044.208-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3f505d31d5e0393327a17a6a09baf617107197cda0d9efe36d6c053567bb9ddb","category":"Environment"}
