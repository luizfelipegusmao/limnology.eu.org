{"title":"Research on Underwater SLAM System Based on Visual Feature Enhancement","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2010/v1","date":1717059783000,"content":"To enhance the performance of visual SLAM in underwater environments, this paper presents an enhanced front-end method based on visual feature enhancement. The method comprises three modules aimed at optimizing and improving the matching capability of visual features from different perspectives. Firstly, to address issues related to insufficient underwater illumination and uneven distribution of artificial light sources, a brightness consistency recovery method is pro-posed. This method employs an adaptive histogram equalization algorithm to balance the brightness of images. Secondly, a method for denoising underwater suspended particulates is introduced to filter out noise from the images. After image-level processing, a combined underwater acousto-optic feature association method is proposed, which associates acoustic features from sonar with visual features, thereby providing distance information for the visual features. Finally, utilizing the AFRL dataset, the improved system incorporating the proposed enhancement methods is evaluated for performance against the OKVIS framework. The system achieves better trajectory estimation accuracy compared to OKVIS and demonstrates robustness in underwater environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ff0a2eda3812c44dc7d119c347a8e938e69e3783bf20d8dd3927e85e35b6351","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
