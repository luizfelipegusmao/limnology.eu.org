{"title":"Closed Form Solution to the Hubble Tension Based on Rh = Ct Cosmology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1697/v1","date":1727087143000,"content":"Haug and Tatum have recently solved the Hubble tension within a type of R_h = ct cosmology using an intuitive, smart trial-and-error search algorithm. The trial-and-error algorithm demonstrates that one can start with the measured CMB temperature and a rough estimate of H0. Based on the algorithm, one ends up matching the entire distance ladder of the observed supernovas by finding a value for H_0. However, this is a numerical search procedure, even though it can be completed in a fraction of a second on a standard computer. Here, we will demonstrate that the trial-and-error numerical method is not needed and that the Hubble tension can be resolved using the same Haug and Tatum model through a closed- form solution. This means one simply solves an equation to find the correct H0 value. This is possible because an exact mathematical relation between H_0 and the CMB temperature has recently been established, in combination with the linearity in an R_h = ct model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e810ae9c5624266f10ec48e177a6c1d7ee807a7d41554c625a5a0876b23ec566","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
