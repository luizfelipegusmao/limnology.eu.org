{"title":"The Detection and Classification of Scaphoid Fracture in Radiograph by Using the Convolutional Neural Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1539/v1","date":1726746812000,"content":"Objective:\nScaphoid fractures, particularly occult and non-displaced fractures, are difficult to detect using traditional X-ray methods due to their subtle appearance and variability in bone density.\nThe study proposes a two-stage CNN approach to detect and classify scaphoid fractures using anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral (LA) X-ray views for more accurate diagnosis.\nMethods:\nThe study emphasizes the use of multi-view X-ray images (AP and LA views) to improve fracture detection and classification. The multi-view fusion module helps integrate information from both views to enhance detection accuracy, particularly for occult fractures that may not be visible in a single view. The proposed method includes two stages that are stage 1: Detect the scaphoid bone using Faster R-CNN and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for region proposal and small object detection. The detection accuracy for scaphoid localization is 100% with Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.8662 for AP views and 0.8478 for LA views. And stage 2: Perform fracture classification using a ResNet backbone and FPN combined with a multi-view fusion module to combine features from both AP and LA views. This stage achieves a classification accuracy of 89.94%, recall of 87.33%, and precision of 90.36%.\nResults:\nThe proposed model performs well in both scaphoid bone detection and fracture classification. The multi-view fusion approach significantly improves recall and accuracy in detecting fractures compared to single-view approaches.\nIn scaphoid detection, both AP and LA views achieved 100% detection accuracy.\nIn fracture detection, using multi-view fusion, the accuracy for AP views reached 87.16%, and for LA views, it reached 83.83%.\nConclusion:\nThe multi-view fusion model effectively improves the detection of scaphoid fractures, particularly in cases of occult and non-displaced fractures.\nThe model provides a reliable, automated approach to assist clinicians in detecting and diagnosing scaphoid fractures more efficiently.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d52d647b5eece2a9e48997f000ee0047555f76a0753e87c27f33ef2ee1d3cf6f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
