{"title":"Inter-Limb Asymmetry in Female Sepak Takraw Players: An Observational Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0741/v1","date":1718108932000,"content":"This study investigated the magnitude and direction of inter-limb asymmetry in 21 professional female sepak takraw players across several task-specific tests. Five inter-limb asymmetry assessments were employed: unilateral countermovement jump (Uni-CMJ), bilateral countermovement jump (Bi-CMJ), single leg hop (SLH), triple hop test (THOP), and isokinetic concentric peak torque of the knee flexors and extensors at 60 deg/sec-1, 120 deg/sec-1 and 180 deg/sec-1 angular velocities. A “true” inter-limb asymmetry was only observed for Uni-CMJ jump height (16.62%) and THOP distance (6.09%). Kappa coefficients demonstrated fair agreement in the direction of asymmetry between the Uni-CMJ and Bi-CMJ tests for jump height (Kappa = 26.67), but only slight agreement for peak force (Kappa = 0.11), propulsive impulse (Kappa = -0.12) and eccentric impulse (Kappa = -0.14), respectively. Fair agreement was observed between the SLH and THOP (Kappa = 0.32). Slight to moderate agreement was found for concentric peak torque across angular velocities for the knee extensors (Kappa = 0.08 to 0.48) while fair to nearly perfect agreement was noted for the knee flexors (Kappa = 0.31 to 1). The Uni-CMJ and THOP are most sensitive to detect between-limb asymmetries in female sepak takraw players. However, given the inconsistency in asymmetry direction across tests, monitoring asymmetry direction is crucial for conditioning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d02e01062c23dae885661a2ff2cef12cf5d5410c805e01857b32446ba7e0135","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
