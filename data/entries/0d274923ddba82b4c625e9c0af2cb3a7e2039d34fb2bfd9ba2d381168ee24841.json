{"title":"228 Evaluation of sire vs. dam influences on age at first parturition in Brahman heifers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/280/7757488?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to determine if sire or dam had a stronger impact on age at first parturition of Brahman heifers (n = 833) born between 2000-2021. Typically, in <span>Bos taurus</span> heifers, puberty occurs between 10 to 12 mo of age leading to parturition of the first calf occurring around 24 mo of age. However, in <span>Bos indicus</span> cattle, puberty is achieved between 15 to 17 mo of age leading to a first calf around 36 mo of age. The ability of heifers to achieve pubertal status earlier plays a vital role in reproductive success. For selection purposes, knowing if early pubertal attainment is influenced more by the sire or dam is important for herd management. For this study, to minimize any epigenetic and environmental changes, all heifers originated and were developed at the Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research Center at Overton. Sire groups (SG) and dam groups (DG) were established based on the number of offspring used in the study. Sire groups were comprised of SG-1 (1+ calves sired; n = 58 sires), SG-2 (5+ calves sired; n = 44 sires), SG-3 (10+ calves sired; n = 31 sires), SG-4 (15+ calves sired; n = 23 sires), SG-5 (20+ calves sired; n = 17 sires), and SG-6 (25+ calves sired; n = 12 sires). Dam groups consisted of DG-1 (1+ calves; n = 489 dams), DG-2 (2+ calves; n = 215 dams), DG-3 (3+ calves; n = 81 dams), DG-4 (4+ calves; n = 38 dams), and DG-5 (5+ calves; n = 9 dams). Statistical analysis (PROC GLM; SAS 9.4) included the fixed effect of sire group (dam group) and all dams (sires) utilized in that grouping. Significance for age at first calving was considered at <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05. Mean separation for age was performed using LSmeans. Sire significantly impacted age at first calving in SG-1 (<span>P</span> = 0.0173) vs dam effect (<span>P</span> = 0.3993; n = 489 dams), SG-2 (<span>P</span> = 0.0159) vs dam effect (<span>P</span> = 0.5476; n = 481 dams), SG-3 (<span>P</span> = 0.0023) vs dam effect (<span>P</span> = 0.2532; n = 439 dams), SG-4 (<span>P</span> = 0.0022) vs dam effect (<span>P</span> = 0.3997; n = 400 dams), SG-5 (<span>P</span> = 0.0002) vs dam effect (<span>P</span> = 0.0602; n = 361 dams), and SG-6 (<span>P</span> = 0.0005) vs dam effect (<span>P</span> = 0.1058; n = 305 dams). The dam impact on age at first calving was never significant in the dam groupings but sires did impact age at first calving in two groups: DG-1 (<span>P</span> = 0.3993) vs sire effect (<span>P</span> = 0.0173; n = 58 sires), DG-2 (<span>P</span> = 0.4823) vs sire effect (<span>P</span> = 0.0173; n = 56 sires), DG-3 (<span>P</span> = 0.3011) vs sire effect (<span>P</span> = 0.3420; n = 49 sires), DG-4 (<span>P</span> = 0.3911) vs sire effect (<span>P</span> = 0.6278; n = 40 sires), and DG-5 (<span>P</span> = 0.3042) vs sire effect (<span>P</span> = 0.9159; n = 23 sires). In summary, evaluation of sire and dam influences on age at first parturition for female offspring demonstrates that the ability to calve at an earlier age is influenced by the sire but not the dam. Further studies into the mechanisms for the transmission of this trait are warranted.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"0d274923ddba82b4c625e9c0af2cb3a7e2039d34fb2bfd9ba2d381168ee24841","category":"Environment"}
