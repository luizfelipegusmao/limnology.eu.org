Legumes can increase their WUE and PPUE with no changes in nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE). Consequently, observed trait relationships between studied traits in these legumes have significant differences with the non-legume species in the study.\nStoichiometry is helpful, in some cases, as an indicator of nutrient use efficiency and enables functional group differentiation.\nOur results strongly relate legumes' higher resource use efficiency with their success in dryland ecosystems.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/08/21/legumes-success-in-drylands-is-associated-with-resource-use-efficiency-and-nutrient-ratios/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Delia M.
