Sputtering yield is the number of atoms that sputter from the target surface, per incident ion. In theory, sputtering yield depends on ion beam incident angle (milling angle), ion energy (milling energy), ion mass, target atoms mass, and the target's surface binding energy. Surface binding energy is the energy that is necessary for a target atom to be rejected from the target surface [<a href=\"#ozae044.1090-B1\">1</a>]. Understanding the relationship between a materialâ€™s physical properties and the argon ion beam characteristics is critical when preparing samples for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging and analyses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4d71834998587e3af41832d7213f8152d81ca5bf114f6a50ecf52c349f002a8d","category":"Environment"}
