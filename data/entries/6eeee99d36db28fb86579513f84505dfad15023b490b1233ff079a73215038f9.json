{"title":"Algorithm Improvement for Mobile Event Detection with Intelligent Tunnel Robots","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0009/v1","date":1722503489000,"content":"Mobile inspections conducted by intelligent tunnel robots are instrumental in broadening the inspection reach, economizing on inspection expenditures, and augmenting the operational efficiency of inspections. Despite differences from fixed surveillance, mobile-captured traffic videos have complex backgrounds and device conditions that interfere with accurate traffic event identification, warranting more research. This paper proposes an improved algorithm based on YOLOv9 and DeepSORT for intelligent event detection in edge computing mobile device using the intelligent tunnel robot. The enhancements comprise the integration of the Temporal Shift Module to boost temporal feature recognition and the establishment of logical rules for identifying diverse traffic incidents in mobile video imagery. Experimental results show that our fused algorithm achieves a 93.25% accuracy rate, an inprovement of 1.75% over the baseline. The algorithm is also applicable to inspection vehicles, drones, and autonomous vehicles, effectively enhancing the detection of traffic events and improving traffic safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6eeee99d36db28fb86579513f84505dfad15023b490b1233ff079a73215038f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
