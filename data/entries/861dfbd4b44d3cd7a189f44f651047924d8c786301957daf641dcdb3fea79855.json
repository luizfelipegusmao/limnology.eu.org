{"title":"Polarised cell intercalation during <i>Drosophila</i> axis extension is robust to an orthogonal pull by the invaginating mesoderm","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002611","date":1714399200000,"content":"<p>by Claire M.

Blanchard, Jenny Evans, Alexander Nestor-Bergmann, Bénédicte Sanson</p>\r\n\r\nAs tissues grow and change shape during animal development, they physically pull and push on each other, and these mechanical interactions can be important for morphogenesis. During <i>Drosophila</i> gastrulation, mesoderm invagination temporally overlaps with the convergence and extension of the ectodermal germband; the latter is caused primarily by Myosin II–driven polarised cell intercalation. Here, we investigate the impact of mesoderm invagination on ectoderm extension, examining possible mechanical and mechanotransductive effects on Myosin II recruitment and polarised cell intercalation. We find that the germband ectoderm is deformed by the mesoderm pulling in the orthogonal direction to germband extension (GBE), showing mechanical coupling between these tissues. However, we do not find a significant change in Myosin II planar polarisation in response to mesoderm invagination, nor in the rate of junction shrinkage leading to neighbour exchange events. We conclude that the main cellular mechanism of axis extension, polarised cell intercalation, is robust to the mesoderm invagination pull. We find, however, that mesoderm invagination slows down the rate of anterior-posterior cell elongation that contributes to axis extension, counteracting the tension from the endoderm invagination, which pulls along the direction of GBE.","author":"Claire M.
