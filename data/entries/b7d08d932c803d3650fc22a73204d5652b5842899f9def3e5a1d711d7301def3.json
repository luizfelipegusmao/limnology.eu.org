{"title":"134 A 12-year summary of effects of body weight at breeding and synchronization protocols on reproductive success of Bos indicus-influenced beef heifers grazing warm-season grasses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/65/7617938?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A retrospective analysis of 5 studies (2011 to 2022) evaluated the effects of body weight and synchronization protocols before the start of breeding season on reproduction of Bos indicus-influenced beef heifers. Data were collected from 594 Brangus crossbred heifers weaned on average at 280 ± 26 d of age, allocated to bahiagrass pastures (4 to 5 heifers and 0.8 to 1.0 ha/pasture), and supplemented with soybean hulls-based concentrate (0.5 to 1.8% of body weight, (BW); dry matter basis] from 2 weeks post-weaning until the end of the breeding season (189 ± 24 days of supplementation). Heifers were initially sorted into those that were supplement (S) and were not supplemented (NS) assigned to an estrous synchronization protocol before the start of the breeding season. Then, within each synchronization group, heifers were sorted into those that were below (BE) or above (AB) the average BW of all heifers (300 kg) at the start of the breeding season (n = 130, 126, 146, and 192 for BE+NS, BE+S, AB+NS, and AB+S heifers, respectively). Data were analyzed using GLIMMIX procedure of SAS using synchronization, BW at breeding, and resulting interaction as fixed effects, and heifer (synchronization × BW), study, and pasture(study) as random effects. Effects of synchronization × BW at breeding and synchronization were not detected for heifer BW and overall average daily gain (ADG). However, AB heifers were always (P &lt; 0.0001) heavier from post-weaning until the end of the breeding season and had (P &lt; 0.0001) greater overall ADG than BE heifers. Effects of synchronization × BW at breeding tended (P = 0.07) to detected for puberty attainment at the start of the breeding season, which was least (P &lt; 0.01) for BE+NS, did not differ between BE+S vs. AB+NS (P = 0.37), and was greatest for AB+S heifers (31, 66, 60, and 81 ± 7.4%, respectively). However, final pregnancy and calving percentages differed (P &lt; 0.01) only for BE vs. AB heifers (68 vs. 81 ± 4.4% and 63 vs. 75 ± 5.2%, respectively). Effects of synchronization × BW at breeding tended (P = 0.10) to detected for percent of heifers calving within the first 30 days of the calving season, which was least (P &lt; 0.03) for BE+NS and did not differ (P = 0.20) among BE+S, AB+NS, and AB+S heifers (48, 69, 61, and 64 ± 5.9%, respectively). Hence, in Bos indicus-influenced beef heifers, BW above 300 kg at the start of the breeding season led to improved overall reproductive performance compared to BW &lt; 300 kg, whereas estrous synchronization protocols had positive effects to puberty attainment (regardless of heifer BW) and improved early calving distribution only when heifers were below 300 kg at the start of the breeding season.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"b7d08d932c803d3650fc22a73204d5652b5842899f9def3e5a1d711d7301def3","category":"Environment"}
