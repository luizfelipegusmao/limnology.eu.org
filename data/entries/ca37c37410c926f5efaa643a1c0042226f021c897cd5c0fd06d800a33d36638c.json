{"title":"Optimizing Power Flow in Northern Cameroon&rsquo;s Interconnected Grid: Challenges and Solutions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0718/v1","date":1723428175000,"content":"This paper presents an analysis of the power flow within the Northern Interconnected Grid of Cameroon. The Newton-Raphson method has been performed, known for its accuracy, under MATLAB software, to model and solve complex power flow equations. This study simulates a series of outage scenarios to evaluate the responsive-ness of the grid. The results obtained underline the crucial importance of reactive power management and highlight the urgent need to consolidate the grid infrastructure of North Cameroon. To increase grid resilience and stability, the paper recommends the strategic integration of renewables and the development of interconnections with other power grids. These measures are presented as viable solutions to meet cur-rent and future energy distribution challenges, ensuring a reliable and sustainable power supply for Cameroon.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca37c37410c926f5efaa643a1c0042226f021c897cd5c0fd06d800a33d36638c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
