In the present study, we investi-gated the effects of forest bathing on the levels of serotonin, oxytocin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) in blood, Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores, POMS, subjective fatigue symptoms and subjective sleep quality in female subjects with depression/depressive tendencies. Methods: Thirty-one female subjects aged 40.1Â±2.4 years with depression/depressive tendencies were recruited after obtaining informed consent. These subjects took day trips to a forest park, the birthplace of forest bathing in Japan named Akasawa Shizen Kyuyourin in Nagano Prefecture, and to a city area of Nagano Prefecture as a control in June 2023. On both trips, they walked 2.2-2.5 km for two hours each in the morning and afternoon on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Blood was sampled in the afternoon before and after each trip. Concentrations of serotonin, oxytocin, IGF-1 and lactic acid in blood were measured. The SDS scores, POMS test, and questionnaires for subjective fatigue symptoms and subjective sleep quality were conducted before and after the trips. Ambient temperature and humidity were monitoring during the trips. The Nippon Medical School Central Ethics Committee approved this study. Results: Forest bathing significantly decreased SDS scores and the effect lasted for one week after forest bathing. Forest bath-ing also significantly increased the level of serotonin in serum in subjects who were not taking antidepressants, significantly increased the levels of oxytocin and IGF-1 in blood, significantly increased the scores for vigor-activity and friendliness and de-creased the scores for anger-hostility, confusion-bewilderment, fatigue-inertia, tension-anxiety, depression-dejection and total mood disturbance compared with city walking (all p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b817d71c94b983c3eacc56a067f6daf2493c7995a69043fb9cc0ef664a90e9b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
