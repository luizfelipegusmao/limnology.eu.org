{"title":"Pulmonary Hypertension: Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Therapies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1266/v1","date":1716200189000,"content":"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a severe and chronic disease characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance and remodeling often precipitating right-sided heart dysfunction and death.  Although the condition is progressive and incurable, current therapies for the disease focus on multiple different drugs and general supportive therapies to manage symptoms and prolong survival, ranging from medications more specific to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to exercise training.  Moreover, there are multiple studies exploring novel experimental drugs and therapies including unique neurostimulation, to help better manage the disease.  Here we provide a narrative review focusing on current PH treatments that target multiple underlying biochemical mechanisms, including but not limited to imbalances in vasoconstrictor-vasodilator and autonomic nervous system function, inflammation, and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling.  We also focus on the potential of novel therapies for managing PH, focusing on multiple types of neu-rostimulation including acupuncture.  Lastly, we also touch upon the diseaseâ€™s different subgroups, clinical presentations and prognosis, diagnostics, demographics, and cost.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17bba885bdf640948014fd870298da03f542f2aa4282dee21d17ad916e98f57a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
