{"title":"Hydric-Rural Cartography for Improving Rural Contexts: Nazas and Aguanaval River Basins","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2158/v1","date":1717153580000,"content":"Using the limits of a specific watershed (river basin) to establish boundaries of precise rural and urban intervention strategies, can conduce to a better understanding of the dynamics between natural hydro-morphology of a hydrological region, water infrastructures (damns, canals, reservoirs) and urban and rural fabric. To perform watershed-based planning approaches with valuable indicators is necessary to generate hybrid cartographies combining urban, architectural, agricultural and hydrological boundaries. In some countries, the necessary information to produce these cartographies is not available; however, is possible to create fundamental layers using GIS software and national geospatial information and subsequently perform algorithmic calculations in the same software. Once these cartographies are developed and analyzed for a determined basin is possible to observe scenarios where rural and urban planning are better suited for precise hydric-urban restoration. In the following article a series of hybrid cartographies are presented. These types of maps are useful for interpretation of water usage flow in rural communities and their agricultural productive surfaces, and ultimately for analytical purposes in dealing with hydrological alterations of the water cycle. The diagnostic results can be used to develop specific rural interventions for fluvial restoration in territorial contexts, and improvement on hydrological infrastructure and the hydrological region water network.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"66cca14b344cdd6cd02b9062df97576bc76989ea7883b445d35a88f121179740","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
