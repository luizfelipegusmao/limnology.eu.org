{"title":"The structural characteristics and physicochemical properties of mung bean protein hydrolysate of protamex induced by ultrasound","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13251?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The limited physicochemical properties (such as low foaming and emulsifying capacity) of mung bean protein hydrolysate restrict its application in the food industry. Ultrasound treatment could change the structures of protein hydrolysate to accordingly affect its physicochemical properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ultrasound treatment on the structural and physicochemical properties of mung bean protein hydrolysate of protamex (MBHP). The structural characteristics of MBHP were evaluated using tricine sodium dodecylsulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, laser scattering, fluorescence spectrometry, etc. Solubility, fat absorption capacity and foaming, emulsifying and thermal properties were determined to characterize the physicochemical properties of MBHP.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>MBHP and ultrasonicated-MBHPs (UT-MBHPs) all contained five main bands of 25.8, 12.1, 5.6, 4.8 and 3.9 kDa, illustrating that ultrasound did not change the subunits of MBHP. Ultrasound treatment increased the contents of <i>α</i>-helix, <i>β</i>-sheet and random coil and enhanced the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of MBHP, but decreased the content of <i>β</i>-turn, which demonstrated that ultrasound modified the secondary and tertiary structures of MBHP. UT-MBHPs exhibited higher solubility, foaming capacity and emulsifying properties than MBHP, among which MBHP-330 W had the highest solubility (97.32%), foaming capacity (200%), emulsification activity index (306.96 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>) and emulsion stability index (94.80%) at pH 9.0.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Ultrasound treatment enhanced the physicochemical properties of MBHP, which could broaden its application as a vital ingredient in the food industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Shu‐Jing Bing, \nFen‐Fang Liu, \nYing‐Qiu Li, \nGui‐Jin Sun, \nChen‐Ying Wang, \nYan Liang, \nXiang‐Zhong Zhao, \nDong‐Liang Hua, \nLei Chen, \nHai‐Zhen Mo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"5ae6c5d9a59329467a4beb4366f8f82899d98d68149b93e44d35d760c003cf3d","category":"Environment"}
