{"title":"A Machine Learning Pipeline for Predicting Wine Quality from Viticulture Data: Development and Implementation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0366/v1","date":1725448346000,"content":"The quality of wine depends upon the quality of the grapes, which, in turn, are affected by different viticulture aspects and the climate during the grape-growing season. Obtaining wine professionalsâ€™ judgments of the intrinsic qualities of selected wine products is a time-consuming task. It is also expensive. Instead of waiting for the wine to be produced, it is better to have an idea of the quality before harvesting, so that wine growers and wine manufacturers can use high-quality grapes. The main aim of the present study was to investigate the use of machine learning aspects in predicting wine quality and to develop a pipeline which represents the major steps from vineyards to wine quality indices. This pipeline outputs the predicted yield, values for basic parameters of grape juice composition, values for basic parameters of the wine composition, and quality. We also found that the yield could be predicted because of input data related to the characteristics of the vineyards. Finally, through the creation of a web-based application, we have investigated the balance berry yield and wine quality. Using these tools further developed, vineyard owners should be able to predict the quality of the wine they intend to produce from their vineyards before the grapes are even harvested.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1ced10833863125af4b4016b984cf0dcfe24b6907dbbbad762d8677881e6355","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
