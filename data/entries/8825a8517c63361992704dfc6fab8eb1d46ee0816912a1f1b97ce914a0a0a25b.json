Elevated [O<sub>3</sub>] significantly reduced seed yield across cultivars and years.

A better understanding of the responses of crop yield to elevated [O<sub>3</sub>] under different levels of drought and high temperature stress is, therefore, critical for projecting future food production potential. Using a 15-year open-air field experiment in central Illinois, we assessed the impacts of elevated [O<sub>3</sub>] coupled with variation in growing season temperature and water availability on soybean seed yield. Thirteen soybean cultivars were exposed to a wide range of season-long elevated [O<sub>3</sub>] in the field using free-air O<sub>3</sub> concentration enrichment. Elevated [O<sub>3</sub>] treatments reduced soybean seed yield from as little as 5.3% in 2005 to 35.2% in 2010. Although cultivars differed in yield response to elevated [O<sub>3</sub>] (<i>R</i>), ranging from 17.5% to −76.4%, there was a significant negative correlation between <i>R</i> and O<sub>3</sub> dosage. Soybean cultivars showed greater seed yield losses to elevated [O<sub>3</sub>] when grown at drier or hotter conditions compared to wetter or cooler years, because the hotter and drier conditions were associated with greater O<sub>3</sub> treatment. However, year-to-year variation in weather conditions did not influence the sensitivity of soybean seed yield to a given increase in [O<sub>3</sub>]. Collectively, this study quantitatively demonstrates that, although drought conditions or warmer temperatures led to greater O<sub>3</sub> treatment concentrations and O<sub>3</sub>-induced seed yield reduction, drought and temperature stress did not alter soybean's sensitivity to O<sub>3</sub>. Our results have important implications for modeling the effects of rising O<sub>3</sub> pollution on crops and suggest that altering irrigation practices to mitigate O<sub>3</sub> stress may not be effective in reducing crop sensitivity to O<sub>3</sub>.</p>","author":"Shuai Li, \nChristopher M.
