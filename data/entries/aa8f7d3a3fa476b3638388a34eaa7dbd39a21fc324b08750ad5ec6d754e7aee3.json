{"title":"Identifying Robust Biomarker Panels for Breast Cancer Screening","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0996/v1","date":1715768993000,"content":"Breast cancer remains a major public health concern, and early detection can result in more treatment options, which are crucial for improving survival rates. Metabolomics offers the potential to develop blood-based screening and diagnostics tools that are less invasive and more cost-effective. However, the inherent complexity of metabolomic datasets makes identifying the most diagnostically relevant biomarkers a difficult task, with multiple studies demonstrating lim-ited agreement on the specific metabolites and pathways involved. This study aims to identify a set of biomarkers for early diagnosis of breast cancer using metabolomics data. Plasma samples from 185 breast cancer patients and 53 controls (CHTN) were analyzed. We utilized univariate Na√Øve Bayes, L2-regularized Support Vector Machines, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), along with feature engineering techniques, to select the most informative features. Multiple ma-chine learning models, including Support Vector Machines, Multidimensional Scaling, Logistic Regression, and Ensemble Learning were utilized for classification. The best-performing feature set comprised 4 biomarkers and 2 demographic variables, achieving an accuracy of 98%, demon-strating the potential for a robust, cost-effective, non-invasive breast cancer screening and diagnostic tool.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa8f7d3a3fa476b3638388a34eaa7dbd39a21fc324b08750ad5ec6d754e7aee3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
