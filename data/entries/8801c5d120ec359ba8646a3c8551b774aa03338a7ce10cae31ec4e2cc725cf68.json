{"title":"Similarity network aggregation for the analysis of glacier ecosystems","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/env.2875?af=R","date":1719378820000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The synthesis of information deriving from complex networks is a topic receiving increasing relevance in ecology and environmental sciences. In particular, the aggregation of multilayer networks, that is, network structures formed by multiple interacting networks (the layers), constitutes a fast-growing field. In several environmental applications, the layers of a multilayer network are modeled as a collection of similarity matrices describing how similar pairs of biological entities are, based on different types of features (e.g., biological traits). The present paper first discusses two main techniques for combining the multi-layered information into a single network (the so-called monoplex), that is, similarity network fusion and similarity matrix average (SMA). Then, the effectiveness of the two methods is tested on a real-world dataset of the relative abundance of microbial species in the ecosystems of nine glaciers (four glaciers in the Alps and five in the Andes). A preliminary clustering analysis on the monoplexes obtained with different methods shows the emergence of a tightly connected community formed by species that are typical of cryoconite holes worldwide. Moreover, the weights assigned to different layers by the SMA algorithm suggest that two large South American glaciers (Exploradores and Perito Moreno) are structurally different from the smaller glaciers in both Europe and South America. Overall, these results highlight the importance of integration methods in the discovery of the underlying organizational structure of biological entities in multilayer ecological networks.</p>","author":"Roberto Ambrosini, \nFederica Baccini, \nLucio Barabesi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmetrics: Table of Contents","siteHash":"4718a208dff669d8713b9a4772fb9e30bd4e6b10bc59ba738841df9ffc8f1e42","entryHash":"8801c5d120ec359ba8646a3c8551b774aa03338a7ce10cae31ec4e2cc725cf68","category":"Environment"}
