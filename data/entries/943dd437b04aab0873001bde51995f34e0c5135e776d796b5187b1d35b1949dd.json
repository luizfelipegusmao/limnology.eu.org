{"title":"New Isomeric Dipyridothiazine Dimers &mdash; Synthesis, Structural Characterization and Cytotoxicity Screening","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0291/v1","date":1714991629000,"content":"New dimers of selected dipyridothiazines with an m-xylene linker have been designed, synthesized and characterized. Their structure was identified using 1H and 13C NMR as well as 2D NMR techniques (COSY, ROESY, HSQC and HMBC experiments) and HR MS spectrometry. The compounds were subjected to preliminary in silico biological profile tests using the Way2Drug server and analysis of the probable cytotoxic effect on various cancer cell lines. Preliminary in vitro cytotoxicity tests were performed against normal cell lines (HaCaT) and five cancer cell lines (SW480, SW620, MDA-MB-231, A-549, LN-229) showing moderate activity. An analysis of the structure-activity relationship was performed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"943dd437b04aab0873001bde51995f34e0c5135e776d796b5187b1d35b1949dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
