{"title":"HoloGaussian Digital Twin: Reconstructing 3D Scenes With Gaussian Splatting for Tabletop Hologram Visualization of Real Environment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1253/v1","date":1729074590000,"content":"Several studies have explored the use of hologram technology in architecture and urban design, demonstrating its feasibility. Holograms can represent 3D spatial data and offer an immersive experience, potentially replacing traditional methods such as physical 3D, and offering a promising alternative to mixed-reality display technologies. Holograms can visualize realistic scenes such as buildings, cityscapes, and landscapes using the novel view synthesis technique. This study examines the suitability of spatial data collected through the Gaussian splatting method for tabletop hologram visualization. Recent advancements in Gaussian splatting algorithms allow for real-time spatial data collection of higher quality compared to photogrammetry and neural radiance fields. Both hologram visualization and Gaussian splatting share similarities in recreating 3D scenes without the need for mesh reconstruction. In this research, unmanned aerial vehicle-acquired primary image data were processed for 3D reconstruction using Gaussian splatting techniques and subsequently visualized through holographic displays. Two experimental environments were used including a building and a university campus. As the result, 3D Gaussian data has proven to be an ideal spatial data source for hologram visualization, offering new possibilities for real-time motion holograms of real environments and digital twin.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e92247cb7326390fa028523f470127fdc2b0cd5a4bfbcaaaddff6fec7e351c29","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
