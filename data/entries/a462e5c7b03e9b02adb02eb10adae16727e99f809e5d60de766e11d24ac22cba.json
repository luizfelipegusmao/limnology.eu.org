{"title":"Changes in Gut Microbiota in a Peruvian Cattle Genetic Nucleus by Breed and Correlations with Beef Quality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0935/v1","date":1726104515000,"content":"This study investigates the correlation between gut microbiota diversity and various hematological and meat quality parameters in different cattle breeds, including Angus, Simmental, Braunvieh, Brahman and F1(SMxBR). Using 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequencing, microbial communities were profiled to discern breed-specific impacts on gut microbiota. Significant correlations were identified between gut microbiota diversity and health parameters, emphasizing the role of microbial diversity in influencing skin condition, fat deposition, and muscle quality. Key bacterial genera such as Blautia, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, and Coprococcus exhibited significant correlations with meat quality traits. In fungi, genera like Rhodotorula exhibited positive correlations with muscle quality, while protist genera such as Cryptosporidium negatively correlated with meat quality parameters. These findings suggest that host genetics significantly shape the gut microbiota and highlight the potential for targeted microbiota management to optimize gut health, enhance feed efficiency, and improve meat quality in livestock.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a462e5c7b03e9b02adb02eb10adae16727e99f809e5d60de766e11d24ac22cba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
