The copper shells can be used as wear tools for the die sinking EDM process. The AMSME process was selected to achieve complex geometries with microscopic details. The obtained results demonstrate high-quality copper depositions with excellent reproduction levels. Additionally, the process generates three-dimensional geometries that are impossible to achieve using conventional material removal manufacturing technologies. Throughout the experimental phase, special attention was given to controlling the electrical parameters of the electrochemical process, which are responsible for ensuring correct deposition during the geometry formation phase.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"484ed6b113d1a5f6b41a4cd92418268b6a790e6106657acf8feffe9349bb5605","category":"Environment"}
