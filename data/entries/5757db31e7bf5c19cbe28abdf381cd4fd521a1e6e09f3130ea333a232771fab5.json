Tylianakis (“Teach Indigenous knowledge alongside science,” Policy Forum, 9 February, p. 592) give an overly rosy picture of New Zealand’s policy of “mana ōrite,” or equal status for mātauranga Māori, in science education, which they say teaches Indigenous knowledge “alongside” science rather than “as” science. They suggest that this policy avoids problems such as teaching creationist myths in science class. However, the New Zealand Ministry of Education placed supernatural content directly into science and math curricula with no clarification that it was nonscientific material.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"5757db31e7bf5c19cbe28abdf381cd4fd521a1e6e09f3130ea333a232771fab5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
