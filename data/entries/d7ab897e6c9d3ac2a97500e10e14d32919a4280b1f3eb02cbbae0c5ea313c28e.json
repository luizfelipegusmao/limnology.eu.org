{"title":"Assessing the Effect of Predator Control on Black‐Footed Cat Survival in Central South Africa","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aje.13316?af=R","date":1724178560000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The black-footed cat, a small felid endemic to southern Africa, is particularly vulnerable to killing by larger carnivores while also being prone to developing renal diseases. Here, we investigated the effect of predator control on black-footed cat populations by comparing adult annual survival between two sites, a nature reserve with little predator management and a sheep and game farm where jackals and caracals were lethally controlled. Although relatively low, survival rates were similar for both sites, suggesting that intraguild killing did not have an additive effect on black-footed cat mortality. Disease was however prevalent and weakened individuals might have a reduced ability to evade predators.</p>","author":"Sandra Lai, \nChloé Warret Rodrigues, \nHolly O'Donnell, \nMartina Küsters, \nJason Herrick, \nArne Lawrenz, \nNadine Lamberski, \nMichelle Schroeder, \nBeryl Wilson, \nAlexander Sliwa","siteTitle":"Wiley: African Journal of Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0a8ec0da97c05188d45f40eaa6dd19ed9528e14fad92d29cce59e67ce4030364","entryHash":"d7ab897e6c9d3ac2a97500e10e14d32919a4280b1f3eb02cbbae0c5ea313c28e","category":"Environment"}
