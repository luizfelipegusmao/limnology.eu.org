{"title":"Growth Performance, Meat Quality and Lipid Oxidation in Pigs Fed Diets Containing Grape Pomace","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1402/v1","date":1724148234000,"content":"Grape pomace is a winery byproduct rich in polyphenols with antioxidant capacity, which makes it an attractive product for use in pig diets. The study aimed to investigate the effect of 0, 5, and 10% inclusion of dehydrated grape pomace (DGP) in finishing pig diets. Including 10% of DGP in the diets increased (P&amp;lt;0.05) daily feed intake, backfat thickness at the first rib, P2 backfat thickness, fat area, and fat to meat ratio and decreased (P&amp;lt;0.05) the percentage of lean meat. Grape pomace did not affect TBARS and fresh meat quality characteristics, except for intramuscular fat. When 10% DGP was included in the diet, intramuscular fat, ΣSFA, ΣMUFA, and Σω-3 increased and ω-6:ω-3 ratio was reduced. In conclusion including up to 10% of DGP in the diet of finishing pigs did not affect growth performance, and the oxidative stability of processed meat, but increased the adiposity of the carcasses. Meat quality was improved through an increase in intramuscular fat and ω-3 fatty acids at 10% inclusion. It is feasible to include DGP in pig diets at a level of at least 10%, which would contribute to the rational use and reduction of environmental liability of by-products from the winery industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cb871866b3a08d4409e4c3abfa0c6f3499f88eda8b97f44aa6b1692151e6a1e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
