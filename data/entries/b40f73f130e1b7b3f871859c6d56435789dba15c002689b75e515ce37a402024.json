{"title":"Liver Cirrhosis: The Immunocompromised State","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2415/v1","date":1722317681000,"content":"Systemic inflammation and immunodeficiency are the key components of Cirrhosis Associated Immune Dysfunction (CAID); its severity is dynamic and progressive and is associated with the greater deterioration of the liver function. There are two different immune phenotypes: the low-grade systemic inflammation phenotype and the high-grade systemic inflammation phenotype. Each of these phenotypes is related with the function of liver cirrhosis; thus, the presence of high-grade inflammation is correlated with the severity of the hepatic insufficiency, the bacterial translocation, and the organic insufficiency, with which the risk of infections increases and the prognosis worsens. Bacterial translocation plays a relevant role in the persistent systemic inflammation in patients with cirrhosis; the prophylactic employment of antibiotics is useful for reducing events of infection and mortality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b40f73f130e1b7b3f871859c6d56435789dba15c002689b75e515ce37a402024","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
