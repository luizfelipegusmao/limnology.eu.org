{"title":"Additives Improving the Efficiency of Biogas Production as an Alternative Energy Source&mdash;A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2566/v1","date":1722428412000,"content":"Additives for anaerobic digestion (AD) can play a significant role in optimising the process by increasing biogas production, stabilising the system and improving digestate quality. The role of additives largely boils down to: (i) enhancing direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) between microbial communities, resulting in improved syntrophic interactions and methane production rates (e.g. biochar, magnetite and carbon nanotubes), (ii) adsorption of toxic substances that may inhibit microbial activity (e.g. activated carbon, zeolites), (iii) improving microbial activity and increasing process stability (e.g. cobalt, nickel, iron, selenium), (iv) maintaining optimal pH levels for microbial activity (e.g. magnesium oxide), (v) reducing inhibition (the aforementioned adsorbents and conductive substances), (vi) accelerating the decomposition of complex organic materials into simpler compounds that are more easily digested by microorganisms, thereby increasing the rate of hydrolysis (enzymes, including cellulases, proteases and lipases). Through the aforementioned action, additives can significantly affect AD performance. The function of these materials varies, from enhancing microbial activity to maintaining optimal conditions and protecting the system from inhibitors. The choice of additives should be carefully tailored to the specific needs and conditions of the digester to maximise benefits and ensure sustainability. In light of these considerations, this paper characterizes the most commonly used additives and their combinations based on a comprehensive review of recent scientific publications, including a report on the results of conducted studies. The publication features chapters that describe: carbon-based conductive materials, metal oxide nanomaterials, trace metal and biological additives, including enzymes and microorganisms. It concludes with a chapter summarising reports on various additives and discussing their indications for functional systems with determined properties. A notable advantage of this work is the updated literature data, clear summaries, and a substantive description of the performance of the additives discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3143b6c3e284c2b4b51574975bd17cf02e850595318df807781c28db2cd34716","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
