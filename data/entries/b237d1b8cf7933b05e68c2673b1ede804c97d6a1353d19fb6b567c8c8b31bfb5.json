Contrary to many countries on the African continent, the Government of Malawi did not impose a lockdown or a stay-at-home order in response to the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that, in the absence of such requirements to restrict social interactions, individuals would primarily seek to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during contacts, rather than reduce the extent of their social contacts. We analyzed 4 rounds of a panel survey spanning time periods before, during and after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi. Five hundred and forty-three participants completed 4 survey interviews between April and November 2020. We found that the likelihood of attending various places and events where individuals work and/or socialize remained largely unchanged during that time. Over the same time frame, however, participants reported adopting on a large scale several behaviors that reduce the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 during contacts. The percentage of panel participants who reported practicing physical distancing thus increased from 9.8% to 47.0% in rural areas between April-May 2020 and June-July 2020, and from 11.4% to 59.4% in urban areas. The percentage of respondents who reported wearing a facial mask to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also increased, reaching 67.7% among rural residents in August-September 2020, and 89.6% among urban residents. The pace at which these behaviors were adopted varied between population groups, with early adopters of mask use more commonly found among more educated office workers, residing in urban areas. The adoption of mask use was also initially slower among women, but later caught up with mask use among men. These findings stress the importance of behavioral changes in containing future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in settings where access to vaccination remains low. They also highlight the need for targeted outreach to members of socioeconomic groups in which the adoption of protective behaviors, such as mask use, might be delayed.","author":"Jethro Banda","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"b237d1b8cf7933b05e68c2673b1ede804c97d6a1353d19fb6b567c8c8b31bfb5","category":"Environment"}
