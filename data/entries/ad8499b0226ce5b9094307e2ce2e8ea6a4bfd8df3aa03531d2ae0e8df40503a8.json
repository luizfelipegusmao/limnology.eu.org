{"title":"Analysis of flavor substances in Shaoxing traditional hand‐made Jiafan wine with different amounts of ZaoShao liquor","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13349?af=R","date":1711022057000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Adding ZaoShao liquor (high-concentration liquor) is one of the most important steps in the brewing process of Shaoxing Jiafan wine, a product protected by Chinese geographical indications. The focus of this study is the effect of different additive amounts of liquor on the flavor of end products.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this study, four kinds of Shaoxing Jiafan wine were brewed by changing the amount of ZaoShao liquor. Headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry were used to detect the flavor substances of four kinds of Jiafan wine. The difference in flavor of four kinds of Jiafan wine was evaluated by electronic nose analysis technology and verified by sensory evaluation. Finally, the reliability of the experimental results was verified through an aroma reconstruction experiment of rice wine. In this study, the differences in flavoring substances under different amounts of ZaoShao liquor were verified from various angles. The results showed that the flavors of the four kinds of wines were significantly different.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The composition of flavor substances in Shaoxing rice wine varies with the amount of ZaoShao liquor. This study provided a scientific basis for the improvement of production technology of Shaoxing wine. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Qi Peng, \nKai Meng, \nXinyi Yang, \nZhuoqin Xu, \nLili Zhang, \nHuajun Zheng, \nHefeng Yu, \nYuhao Zhang, \nGuangfa Xie","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"ad8499b0226ce5b9094307e2ce2e8ea6a4bfd8df3aa03531d2ae0e8df40503a8","category":"Environment"}
