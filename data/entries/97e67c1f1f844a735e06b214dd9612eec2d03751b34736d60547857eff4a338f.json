{"title":"Understanding the genetic sex-determining mechanism in <i>Hyla eximia</i> treefrog inferred from H-Y antigen","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304554","date":1717164000000,"content":"<p>by Aidet Ruiz, Guadalupe CÃ¡rdenas, Desiderio Velasco, Luis Ramos</p>\r\n\r\nGenetic sex-determining mechanisms have been extensively elucidated in mammals; however, the sex chromosomes, sex-determining genes, and gene regulatory networks involved in sex differentiation remain poorly understood in amphibians. In this study, we investigated the sex-determining mechanism in the <i>Hyla eximia</i> treefrog based on karyotypic analysis and identification of H-Y antigen, a sex-linked peptide that is present in the gonads of the heterogametic sex (XY or ZW) in all vertebrates. Results show a diploid chromosome number 2n = 24 with homomorphic sex chromosomes. The heterogametic sex, ZW-female, were hypothesized based on H-Y antigen mRNA expression in female gonads (24,ZZ/24,ZW). The treefrog H-Y peptide exhibited a high percentage of identity with other vertebrate sequences uploaded to GenBank database. To obtain gene expression profiles, we also obtained the coding sequence of the housekeeping <i>Actb</i> gene. High H-Y antigen expression levels were further confirmed in ovaries using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during non-breeding season, we noted a decrease in the expression of the H-Y antigen during breeding season. This study provides evidence that sex hormones might suppress H-Y antigen expression in the gonads of heterogametic females 24,ZW during the breeding season. These findings suggest that H-Y gene expression is a well-suited model for studying heterogametic sex by comparing the male and female gonads.","author":"Aidet Ruiz","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"97e67c1f1f844a735e06b214dd9612eec2d03751b34736d60547857eff4a338f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
