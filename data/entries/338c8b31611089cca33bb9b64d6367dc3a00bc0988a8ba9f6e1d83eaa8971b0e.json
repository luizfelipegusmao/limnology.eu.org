{"title":"Epigenetics and plant hormone dynamics: a functional and methodological perspective","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/17/5267/7610782?rss=1","date":1708300800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant hormones, pivotal regulators of plant growth, development, and response to environmental cues, have recently emerged as central modulators of epigenetic processes governing gene expression and phenotypic plasticity. This review addresses the complex interplay between plant hormones and epigenetic mechanisms, highlighting the diverse methodologies that have been harnessed to decipher these intricate relationships. We present a comprehensive overview to understand how phytohormones orchestrate epigenetic modifications, shaping plant adaptation and survival strategies. Conversely, we explore how epigenetic regulators ensure hormonal balance and regulate the signalling pathways of key plant hormones. Furthermore, our investigation includes a search for novel genes that are regulated by plant hormones under the control of epigenetic processes. Our review offers a contemporary overview of the epigeneticâ€“plant hormone crosstalk, emphasizing its significance in plant growth, development, and potential agronomical applications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"338c8b31611089cca33bb9b64d6367dc3a00bc0988a8ba9f6e1d83eaa8971b0e","category":"Environment"}
