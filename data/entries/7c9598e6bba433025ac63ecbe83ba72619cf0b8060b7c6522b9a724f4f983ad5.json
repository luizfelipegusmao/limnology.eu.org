{"title":"Neuroprotective potential of <i>Mentha piperita</i> extract prevents motor dysfunctions in mouse model of Parkinson’s disease through anti-oxidant capacities","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302102","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Rabia Anjum, Chand Raza, Mehwish Faheem, Arif Ullah, Maham Chaudhry</p>\r\n\r\nParkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world. Neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra (SN) and diminished release of dopamine are prominent causes of this progressive disease. The current study aims to evaluate the protective potential of ethanolic extract of <i>Mentha piperita</i> (EthMP) against rotenone-mediated PD features, dopaminergic neuronal degeneration, oxidative stress and neuronal survival in a mouse model. Swiss albino male mice were assigned to five groups: control (2.5% DMSO vehicle), PD (rotenone 2.5 mg/kg), EthMP and rotenone (200mg/kg and 2.5mg/kg, respectively), EthMP (200 mg/kg), and Sinemet, reference treatment containing levodopa and carbidopa (20 mg/kg and rotenone 2.5mg/kg). Behavioral tests for motor functional deficit analysis were performed. Anti-oxidant capacity was estimated using standard antioxidant markers. Histopathology of the mid-brain for neurodegeneration estimation was performed. HPLC based dopamine level analysis and modulation of gene expression using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for the selected genes. EthMP administration significantly prevented the rotenone-mediated motor dysfunctions compared to PD group as assessed through open field, beam walk, pole climb down, stepping, tail suspension, and stride length tests. EthMP administration modulated the lipid peroxidation (LPO), reduced glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, as well as glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT) activities in mouse brain. EthMP extract prevented neurodegeneration in the SN of mice and partially maintained dopamine levels. The expression of genes related to dopamine, anti-oxidant potential and synapses were modulated in <i>M</i>. <i>piperita</i> (MP) extract treated mice brains. Current data suggest therapeutic capacities of MP extract and neuroprotective capacities, possibly through antioxidant capacities. Therefore, it may have potential clinical applications for PD management.","author":"Rabia Anjum","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7c9598e6bba433025ac63ecbe83ba72619cf0b8060b7c6522b9a724f4f983ad5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
