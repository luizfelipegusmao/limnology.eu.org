{"title":"15-Minute City: An Attempt to Measure Proximity to Urban Services in Rome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1182/v1","date":1726482441000,"content":"This paper aims to assess the proximity of urban services through the lens of the 15-minute city concept, using the Municipality of Rome as a case study. The question of whether Rome qualifies as a 15-minute city is explored by examining proximity in terms of the \"intensity\" of urban services accessible within a 15-minute walking or cycling distance. A simple model, based on GIS techniques, is implemented to measure proximity to urban services at the neighborhood level. Furthermore, proximity levels in urban areas characterized by similar socioeconomic conditions, referred to as the \"seven cities,\" are analyzed to identify potential inequalities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ca102fd10b589c52db3b3afac97299bdf7309a51e5c75eb4c58f4265813b171","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
