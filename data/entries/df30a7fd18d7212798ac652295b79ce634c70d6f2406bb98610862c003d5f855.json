{"title":"Tapioca Starch Films: Functional Properties and Application in Sustainable Food Packaging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0505/v1","date":1717765803000,"content":"Tapioca, an abundant constituent of starch, is extensively grown and consumed, while a wet pathway is usually employed for starch extraction from it. The purpose of the study is to determine the functional properties like tensile properties, barrier properties such as oxygen, and water vapor transmission rate, as well as biodegradability of the standardized tapioca film, all in the context of its appropriateness for packaging purposes for a variety of food categories. Tapioca starch film was standardized with glycerol and citric acid by casting techniques in a film-making machine. The tensile strength of obtained films was measured as 0.71 MPa, with 11.5 percent elongation at break. The oxygen transmission rate was 750.52 cc/m²/day while the water vapor transmission rate ranged from 0.81 to 0.84 cm³/m²/24h/0.1MPa. This study revealed that tapioca starch films are appropriate for packing cereals, legumes, spices, condiments, extruded items, as well as sugar candies for prolonged periods hence even after 120th day, the total microbial count of the standardized film was 5.7 x 101 CFU/g which is below the permissible limit. In moist topsoil and vermicompost, it degrades completely within 24 days. The research findings highlight the tapioca starch films' potential as environmentally friendly and practical packaging solutions for a wide range of food items and a promising alternative for single-use plastics in the food sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df30a7fd18d7212798ac652295b79ce634c70d6f2406bb98610862c003d5f855","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
