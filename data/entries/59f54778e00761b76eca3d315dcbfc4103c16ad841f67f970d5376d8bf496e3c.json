Belperio</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>We assessed the prognostic utility of circulating levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in the IPF-PRO Registry.</p> Methods <p>MMP and TIMP concentrations were quantified by ELISA in plasma from 300 patients. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to assess associations between select MMPs and TIMPs and death and disease progression (absolute decline in forced vital capacity â‰¥10% predicted, death, or lung transplant).</p> Results <p>Over a median follow-up of 30.4 months, 98 patients died and 182 patients had disease progression. In unadjusted analyses, higher concentrations of MMPs 2, 3, 8 and 9 and TIMPs 1, 2 and 4 were associated with an increased risk of death. MMPs 2 and 8 and TIMP1 remained associated with death after adjustment for clinical factors. In unadjusted analyses, higher concentrations of MMPs 8 and 9 and TIMPs 1 and 4 were associated with an increased risk of disease progression. MMPs 8 and 9 and TIMP1 remained associated with progression after adjustment for clinical factors.</p> Conclusion <p>Circulating levels of MMP8 and TIMP1 may provide information on the risk of outcomes in patients with IPF not captured by clinical measures.</p>","author":"Olawale Amubieya","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"59f54778e00761b76eca3d315dcbfc4103c16ad841f67f970d5376d8bf496e3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
