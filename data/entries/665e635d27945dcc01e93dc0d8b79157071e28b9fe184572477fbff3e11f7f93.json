{"title":"An Analysis of the Time Required for Diagnosis of ASD and the Factors Influencing Its Duration in a Sample of the Pediatric Population from Poland","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0153/v1","date":1727867149000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Early diagnosis of ASD a very important factor in improving the quality of life of people on the spectrum, but it still remains a major problem in Europe, especially concerning girls. In this study, we tried to answer the question of what factors affect the age of diagnosis in Poland. Additionally, we tried to establish the time between the first visit to the mental health center and the diagnosis in this population, and what factors affect its length. Methods: 77 children were randomly recruited among the patients who came to local MHC at the Child and Family Health Center in Sosnowiec. All participants were tested using the ADOS-2 protocol. In addition, the study used TAS-20 test and BDI. Results The mean age of the first enrollment in the MHC was 9.09 years for girls and 6.42 for the boys. The time needed to obtain a diagnosis from the first visit was consecutively 2.90 years and 4.29 years, but the difference was not statistically significant (p&amp;gt;0.05). Obtaining a different psychiatric diagnosis did not affect the average time to diagnosis and the age of diagnosis. Conclusions: The results of the study indicate that the diagnosis of ASD is still a significant problem both in Poland and in the world. The long time needed to obtain the correct diagnosis, the frequent need to change diagnosticians in order to obtain it is a common problem. the diagnostic process should be flexible, and the diagnostician should always take into account the axial symptoms, but remain aware that \"overdiagnosis\" of ASD can also have harmful consequences for the child.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"665e635d27945dcc01e93dc0d8b79157071e28b9fe184572477fbff3e11f7f93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
