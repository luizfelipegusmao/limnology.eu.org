{"title":"Importance of Modulating Kynurenine Metabolism&mdash;Approaches for the Treatment of Dementia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0362/v1","date":1728292198000,"content":"In this article we focus on kynurenic acid metabolism, a biochemical part of L-tryptophan catabolism, in processes related to memory and cognitive impairment and its subsequent relevance to neuropsychiatric disorders and the ageing process. Kynurenic acid is synthesised from L-kynurenine by kynurenine aminotransferases.Experimental pharmacological studies have shown that elevated levels of kynurenic acid in the brain are associated with impaired learning and that lowering kynurenic acid levels can improve these symptoms. The discovery of new compounds with the ability to block kynurenine aminotransferase opens up new therapeutic avenues against memory impairment and dementia. The newly developed Helix pomatia snail model of memory is being used for this pharmacological approach. In conclusion, diet, exercise and physical activity have a significant impact on the endogenous pharmacology of kynurenic acid and significantly modulate steady-state conditions and delay the events of the ageing process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"950a5bc6286a4dc571a51a3481083521d0d651f76ad3dcc9f5f2fe52f4e6c23f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
