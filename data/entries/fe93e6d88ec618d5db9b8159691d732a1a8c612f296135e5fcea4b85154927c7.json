I have no doubt that global food producers will be able to meet that demand, but it will not be easy. Certainly, high-quality, nutrient dense proteins will be a major part of that effort. But there are a lot of head winds against increasing food production, weather pattern shifts, water scarcity, reduction of arable land, and reduced labor to name a few, so how is this possible? I do not think it is a secret that the improvement in food production through the adoption of technology that improves crop yields, reduces water usage, and improves animal genetics, is one of the keys to achieve these goals. A key factor in a more sustainable global beef production system is economics and ensuring efficiencies within the supply chain.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Animal Frontiers Current Issue","siteHash":"d2ebbba5d44268c4d5ae0a0fd5e2619282136fd9be49453f0fee01876d4d13af","entryHash":"fe93e6d88ec618d5db9b8159691d732a1a8c612f296135e5fcea4b85154927c7","category":"Environment"}
