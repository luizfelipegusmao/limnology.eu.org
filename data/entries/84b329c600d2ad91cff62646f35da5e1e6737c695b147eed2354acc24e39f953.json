{"title":"Apigenin Induces Oxidative Stress in Triggering the Intrinsic Apoptotic Pathway in ELT3 Rat Uterine Leiomyoma Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2017/v1","date":1721884654000,"content":"Background and aim: Apigenin (API), a dietary flavone subclass of flavonoid found in herbs, fruits, and vegetables, exhibits various pharmacological effects. However, its role in triggering oxidative stress- induced apoptosis in uterine cells remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis induced by apigenin in rat uterine leiomyoma ELT3 cells. Material and methods: ELT3 cells were treated with 50 and 100 ÂµM API for 48 hours. We assessed oxidative stress markers (reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde), antioxidant defense (glutathione reductase activity), cell proliferation, and apoptotic gene expression (p53, Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, caspase-9) using relevant assays and real-time PCR. Results: API treatment decreased cell proliferation and glutathione reductase activity in ELT3 cells. This coincided with increased levels of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and lactate dehydrogenase activity, indicating oxidative stress and cell damage. Furthermore, apigenin upregulated pro-apoptotic genes (p53, Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9) and downregulated the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, suggesting activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Conclusion: API induces apoptosis in rat uterine leiomyoma cells through a mechanism involving oxidative stress-mediated activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84b329c600d2ad91cff62646f35da5e1e6737c695b147eed2354acc24e39f953","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
