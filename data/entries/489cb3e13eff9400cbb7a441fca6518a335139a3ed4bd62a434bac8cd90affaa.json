{"title":"Ergonomic Evaluation of Nail Technicians with Quick Exposure Check","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2621/v1","date":1722462328000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Nail technicians frequently have musculoskeletal pain, which impairs their job performance. A high-risk profession linked to back discomfort that causes morbidity is nail technician. QEC is a tool used for observing and assessing risks in a work environment. The goal of this research is to assess the ergonomic risks, pain, and their relationship with posture among manicurists. Methods: The 35 nail technicians filled the assessment form which consists of occupational information, pain, European Community Respiratory Health Survey, Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire and QEC worker part. Physicians assessed nail technicians’ workspace and QEC outcomes. Results: It was stated that they worked an average of 61.92±11.09 hours per week, served an average of 11±5 customers per day, and their condition lasted 53.96±36.51 months. There is a strong significant correlation between discomforts, time spent in occupation (p=0,000) and working hours. Manicure, pedicure, unwanted hair removal, correction of eyebrow were considered for ergonomic risk evaluation. Each occupation accompanied repeated bad postures. Most of them were scored in very high risk categorization for back static positions (more than 29 point). Conclusions: This study may be useful for nail technicians seeking ergonomic improvements in the areas of engineering, administration, behavior, or personal.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"489cb3e13eff9400cbb7a441fca6518a335139a3ed4bd62a434bac8cd90affaa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
