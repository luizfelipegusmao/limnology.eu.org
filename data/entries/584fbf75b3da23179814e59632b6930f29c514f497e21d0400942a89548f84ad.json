{"title":"<i>Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis</i>: Whole genome sequencing reveals unforeseen and relevant genetic diversity in this pathogen","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309282","date":1724680800000,"content":"<p>by Ekkehard Hiller, Verena HÃ¶rz, Reinhard Sting</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis</i> (CPS) is an important bacterial animal pathogen. CPS causes chronic, debilitating and currently incurable infectious diseases affecting a wide range of livestock and wild herbivores including camelids worldwide. Belonging to the <i>Corynebacterium diphtheria</i>e complex, this pathogen can also infect humans. The classical characterization of CPS is typically based on the testing of nitrate reductase activity, separating the two biovars Equi and Ovis. However, more refined resolutions are required to unravel routes of infection. This was realized in our study by generating and analyzing whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. Using newly created core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) profiles we were the first to discover isolates grouping in a cluster adjacent to clusters formed by CPS biovar Equi isolates. This novel cluster includes CPS isolates from alpacas, llamas, camels and dromedaries, which are characterized by a lack of nitrate reductase activity as encountered in biovar Ovis. This is of special interest for molecular epidemiology. Nevertheless, these isolates bear the genes of the nitrate locus, which are characteristic of biovar Equi isolates. However, sequence analysis of the genes <i>narG</i> and <i>narH</i> of the nitrate locus revealed indels leading to frameshifts and inactivity of the enzymes involved in nitrate reduction. Interestingly, one CPS isolate originating from another lama with an insertion in the MFS transporter (<i>narT</i>) is adjacent to a cluster formed by ovine CPS isolates biovar Equi. Based on this knowledge, the combination of biochemical and PCR based molecular biological nitrate reductase detection can be used for a fast and uncomplicated classification of isolates in routine diagnostics in order to check the origin of camelid CPS isolates. Further analysis revealed that partial sequencing of the ABC transporter substrate binding protein (CP258_RS07935) is a powerful tool to assign the biovars and the novel genomovar.","author":"Ekkehard Hiller","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"584fbf75b3da23179814e59632b6930f29c514f497e21d0400942a89548f84ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
