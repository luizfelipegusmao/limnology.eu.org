{"title":"Investigating the crystallinity of hard candies prepared and stored at different temperatures with low field‐NMR relaxometry","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13847?af=R","date":1724846070000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>In this study, hard candies were produced by using sucrose, glucose syrup and water. They were cooked at different temperatures, changing from 135 to 145 °C with an interval of 2.5 °C. They were stored at different storage temperatures, which were 25, 4, −18 and −80 °C. Hard candies placed at room temperature were stored for 2 months. In order to understand the crystallization characteristics of the hard candies, time domain (TD) proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H-NMR) parameters of longitudinal relaxation time (<i>T</i>\n<sub>1</sub>) and second moment (<i>M</i>\n<sub>2</sub>) measurements were conducted. Moisture contents of the hard candies were determined by Karl–Fischer titration. X-ray diffraction experiments were also conducted as the complementary analysis.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Increasing cooking temperature increased the crystallinity and decreased the moisture content of the hard candies significantly (<i>P</i> ≤0.05). Furthermore, storage temperature and storage time had significant effects on the crystallinity of the hard candies (<i>P</i> ≤0.05). The results of <i>T</i>\n<sub>1</sub> and <i>M</i>\n<sub>2</sub> correlated with each other (<i>r</i> &gt; 0.8, <i>P</i> ≤ 0.5) and both produced the highest value at the cooking temperature of 145 °C and storage temperature of 4 °C (<i>P</i> ≤ 0.05). The values of <i>T</i>\n<sub>1</sub> and <i>M</i>\n<sub>2</sub> were obtained as 245.9 ms and 13.0 × 10<sup>−8</sup> Hz<sup>2</sup>, respectively, for the cooking temperature of 145 °C and storage temperature of 4 °C.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This study demonstrated that the crystallinity of hard candies can be observed and examined by TD-NMR relaxometry, as an alternative to commonly used methods. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Sena Kuzu, \nBaris Ozel, \nSirvan Sultan Uguz, \nSarper Dogdu, \nMehmet Ali Marangoz, \nLeonid Grunin, \nMecit Halil Oztop","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"6524f56abfdd1a3e28f4e725a16caa9053c1b2c1290cd8c3253ffed3e052fe05","category":"Environment"}
