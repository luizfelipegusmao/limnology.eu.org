{"title":"Seismic performance of base-isolated structures for swimming pool reactors under different foundation conditions","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311216","date":1729260000000,"content":"<p>by Jie Zhao, Jianshan Wang, Jiehua Huang</p>\r\n\r\nThe swimming pool reactor (SPR) is an innovative and environmentally friendly heating source. An SPR building was selected as the research subject, and a 3D dynamic interaction model incorporating the liquid sloshing effect was created using ANSYS software and the secondary development characteristics of user-programmable features (UPFs). Energy dissipation from scattered waves was accounted for using viscous-spring boundary elements, while the dynamic hydraulic effect was modeled via the Housner equivalent mechanical model. Considering soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects, this study examines the impact of isolation measures on the structureâ€™s seismic mitigation performance. It investigates how varying foundation conditions affect the seismic resistance of the isolated structure. Results indicate that seismic isolation ratios for acceleration, floor response spectra, displacement, and base shear diminish as site stiffness decreases. However, regarding sloshing wave height, seismic isolation amplified the height under all conditions but remained within safe limits. These findings offer valuable insights for seismic design across different SPRs.","author":"Jie Zhao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"794f39d338b93392291b7e88510eeeed0c717c852bb295383977b3315bb4c031","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
