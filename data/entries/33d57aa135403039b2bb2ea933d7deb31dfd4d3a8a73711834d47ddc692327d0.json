{"title":"A Comprehensive Review on Viscoelastic Parameters Used for Engineering Materials Including Soft Materials and the Relationships between Different Damping Parameters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0973/v1","date":1723620556000,"content":"The physical properties of a structure such stiffness although can be determined by some statical tests, the identification of damping parameter requires a dynamic test. In general, both theoretical prediction and experimental identification of damping are quite difficult. There are many different techniques available for damping identification, and each method gives a different damping parameter. The dynamic indentation method, rheometry, atomic force microscopy, and resonant vibration tests are commonly used to identify the damping of materials, including soft materials. While the viscous damping ratio, loss factor, complex modulus and viscosity are quite common to describe damping of materials, there are also other parameters such as the specific damping capacity, loss angle, half-power bandwidth, and logarithmic decrement to describe damping of various materials. Often one of these parameters is measured in practical applications and the measured damping parameter needs to be converted into another damping parameter for comparison purposes. In this review, the theoretical derivations of different parameters for the description and quantification of damping and their relationships, and the methods for damping identification are presented. The expressions for both high damping and low damping are included and evaluated. This paper could be a primary resource for damping research and teaching.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33d57aa135403039b2bb2ea933d7deb31dfd4d3a8a73711834d47ddc692327d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
