{"title":"H2BFWT Variations in Sperm DNA and Its Correlation to Pregnancy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0207/v1","date":1714978042000,"content":"Abnormalities in sperm nuclei and chromatin can interfere with normal fertilization, embryonic development, implantation, and pregnancy. We aimed in this study to determine the impact of H2BFWT gene variants in sperm DNA on ICSI outcomes in couples undergoing ART treatment. One hundred and nineteen partners were divided into pregnant (G1) and non-pregnant (G2) groups. After semen analysis, complete DNA was extracted from purified sperm samples. The sequence of the H2BFWT gene was amplified by PCR and then subjected to Sanger sequencing. The results showed that there are three mutations in this gene: rs7885967, rs553509 and rs578953. rs553509 and rs578953 showed significant differences in the distribution of alternative and reference alleles between G1 and G2 (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.0020, respectively). However, there was no association between these SNPs and the studied parameters. This study is the first to shed light on the connection between H2BFWT gene variants in sperm DNA and pregnancy after ICSI therapy. This is a pilot study, so further investigations about these gene variants at the transcriptional and translational levels, in a larger cohort of patients, are needed to determine its functional consequences and to understand the mechanism of how the pregnancy is affected by sperm DNA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c47d1b8425ca065f9d8030dd6d9b1e73cae3fdbffcfce615504bfa3673532b6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
