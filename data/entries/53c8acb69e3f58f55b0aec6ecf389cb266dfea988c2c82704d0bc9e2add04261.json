{"title":"Efficiency Improvement on Indium Tin Oxide Films for Dye-sensitized Solar Cell using Oxygen Plasma by Bias-magnetron RF Sputtering Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1462/v1","date":1724147963000,"content":"DSSC devices are among the most widely studied thin-film solar cells because of their cost-effectiveness, low toxicity, and simple fabrication method. However, there is still much scope for replacing current DSSC materials due to their high cost, low volume, and lack of long-term stability. Accordingly, ITO-nanorod films were fabricated by E-beam evaporation using the glancing angle deposition method in this study. Then, the ITO-nanorod was treated by oxygen plasma via a bias-magnetron RF sputtering process to improve the efficiency of DSSC under a varying gas flow rate of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 sccm. The FE-SEM investigation of the ITO film structure revealed that the obtained nanorod structures have slightly different diameters. At the same time, an increase in the oxygen flow rate resulted in a rougher film surface structure. In this, the lower sheet resistance was received because of rougher morphology. When comparing the DSSC efficiency test results, we found that at a gas flow rate of 100 sccm, the highest efficiency value showed by 9.5%. On the other hand, the ITO-nanorod without plasma treatment exhibited the lowest efficiency. Hence, plasma technology can be practically applied to improve the efficiency of DSSC devices. This study will be a prototype of a highly advanced solar cell manufacturing method for the solar cell industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53c8acb69e3f58f55b0aec6ecf389cb266dfea988c2c82704d0bc9e2add04261","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
