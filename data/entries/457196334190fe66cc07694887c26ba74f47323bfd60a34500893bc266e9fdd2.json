{"title":"An improved diagnostic method for taurodontism and a comparative study on its effectiveness evaluation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302810","date":1715090400000,"content":"<p>by Yunmeng Da, Le Zhang, Zhihong Chai, Hongfang Du, Lele Hao, Li Zhang, Zhiyin Zhang, Yongfan Shen</p>\r\nObjective <p>The two commonly used diagnostic methods for taurodontism are susceptible to aging changes, mastication wear and other factors. Therefore, this study proposed an improved diagnostic method for taurodontism, and compared it with the previous two methods as a supplement for taurodontism diagnosis.</p> Methods <p>The included patients were aged 10–89 years and admitted to the Department of Stomatology of Hebei Eye Hospital from June 1, 2022 to May 31, 2023. Eighty cone-beam computed tomography images were divided equally into 4 groups: 10–29, 30–49, 50–69, and 70–89 years old. The right mandibular first molars were selected as measurement objects. Firstly, |BD| and taurodontism index (TI)-related parameters were measured using Shifman and Chanannel’s method and crown-body(CB) and root (R) lengths was measured by Seow and Lai’s method. The improved method used the length from the cementoenamel junction(CEJ) to the root bifurcation point(body, B)and the root length(root, R)as the measurement objects. Finally, TI, CB/R ratios, and B/R ratios were calculated according to the formulas given below. One-way ANOVA analysis was mainly used to compare the differences in the values, indices and ratios of taurodontism among different age groups (p&lt;0.05).</p> Results <p>With the increase of age, |BD| and TI values decreased significantly (p&lt;0.01). The CB/R ratios of 70–89 years group were significantly lower than those of the other three groups (p&lt;0.01). Ratios derived from the improved method were significantly lower in the 70–89 years than in 10–29 years group (p&lt;0.05).</p> Conclusions <p>The |BD| and TI parameters proposed by Shifman and channel are significantly influenced by age. The measurements of Seow and Lai (CB/R ratios) were less affected by age compared with those of the former. The improved method(B/R ratios) was least affected by age, which would reduce error and bias in the measurement of taurodontism and obtain more objective results in older patients.</p>","author":"Yunmeng Da","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"457196334190fe66cc07694887c26ba74f47323bfd60a34500893bc266e9fdd2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
