{"title":"Enhancing the Reliability of NO2 Monitoring Using Low-Cost Sensors by Compensating for Temperature and Humidity Effects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0455/v1","date":1728379190000,"content":"The study investigates methods to enhance the reliability of NO2 monitoring using low-cost electrochemical sensors to measure gaseous pollutants in air by addressing the impacts of temperature and relative humidity. The temperature within a plastic container was controlled using an internal mica heater, an external hot air blower or cooling packs, while relative humidity was adjusted using glycerin solutions. Findings indicated that the Auxiliary Electrode (AE) signal is susceptible to temperature and moderately affected by relative humidity. In contrast, the Working Electrode (WE) signal is less affected by temperature and relative humidity; however, adjustments are still required to determine gas concentrations accurately. Tests involving on/off cycles showed that the AE signal experiences exponential decay before stabilizing, requiring the exclusion of initial readings during monitoring activities. Additionally, calibration experiments in zero air allowed the determination of the compensation factor nT across different temperatures and humidity levels. These results highlight the importance of compensating for temperature and humidity effects to improve the accuracy and reliability of NO2 measurements using low-cost electrochemical sensors. This refinement makes the calibration applicable across a broader range of environmental conditions. However, the experiments also show a lack of repeatability of the zero calibration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f33d8464d5f0c9a98dbbbb77818eff9eddb787fa00d6cbbc0fa201ce8365e6b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
