{"title":"Electronic Aid for Unfamiliar Environments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1630/v2","date":1714530720000,"content":"In everyday life, the birth of a number of blind people takes place and millions of people are already available. Visually impaired people struggle to walk safely and in- dependently because they have trouble detecting obstacles. In this work, we suggest a novel approach to detecting obstacles utilizing an Arduino UNO board and an ul- trasonic sensor (HC-SR04). The main goal of this research is to increase the mobility and security of blind people in a variety of settings. The suggested system makes use of the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor’s capability to precisely measure distance and identify nearby obstructions. As the main processor component, the Arduino UNO board processes algorithms for real-time obstacle detection while also collecting data from the sensor. The device is intended to give the visually impaired user immedi- ate aural input while informing them of the location and proximity of obstacles. To Extensive testing is done in controlled and real-world settings to assess the system’s performance and dependability. In the studies, the effectiveness of obstacle detec- tion, the system’s response time, and its practicality and usefulness for blind people are all measured. The findings show that the suggested obstacle detection method provides very accurate obstacle identification at a safe distance. Users who are blind or visually handicapped may successfully  understand  their  surroundings  thanks  to the aural feedback system, which helps them to navigate by making judgments that are well-informed. Additionally, the system responds quickly, guaranteeing that the user receives real-time obstacle updates to increase safety and confidence while mov- ing. The study’s conclusions demonstrate the possibility of using the Arduino UNO board with the HC-SR04  ultrasonic sensor  as  a  practical  and  affordable  approach for detecting obstacles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b38bfb65c5da7dc7954000305c30ab457507a535ee374ca0c15f3fbad0beaee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
