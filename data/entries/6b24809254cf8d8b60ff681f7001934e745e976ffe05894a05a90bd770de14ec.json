{"title":"H2O2 negatively regulates aluminum resistance via oxidation and degradation of the transcription factor STOP1","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/3/688/7344683?rss=1","date":1699056000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Aluminum (Al) stress triggers the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in roots. However, whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> plays a regulatory role in aluminum resistance remains unclear. In this study, we show that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> plays a crucial role in regulation of Al resistance, which is modulated by the mitochondrion-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein REGULATION OF ALMT1 EXPRESSION 6 (RAE6). Mutation in <span>RAE6</span> impairs the activity of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, resulting in the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and increased sensitivity to Al. Our results suggest that higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations promote the oxidation of SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY 1 (STOP1), an essential transcription factor that promotes Al resistance, thereby promoting its degradation by enhancing the interaction between STOP1 and the F-box protein RAE1. Conversely, decreasing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels or blocking the oxidation of STOP1 leads to greater STOP1 stability and increased Al resistance. Moreover, we show that the thioredoxin TRX1 interacts with STOP1 to catalyze its chemical reduction. Thus, our results highlight the importance of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in Al resistance and regulation of STOP1 stability in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"6b24809254cf8d8b60ff681f7001934e745e976ffe05894a05a90bd770de14ec","category":"Environment"}
