Decentralised point-of-use drinking water treatment systems offer alternative solutions in remote or resource constrained settings. The main aim of this study was to assess the long-term (3 year) operation and performance of a point-of-use drinking water treatment system (POU-DWTS). A biologically contaminated urban drainage pond was used as a water source and the quality of the produced drinking water was assessed over two independent trials. The decentralised POU-DWTS combined ultrafiltration membranes with disinfection from electrochemically generated hypochlorous acid (HOCl). The operational parameters, such as flow rate, free available chlorine and transmembrane pressure, were monitored in real-time and recorded via a remote monitoring system. Water quality from the source and treated water was assessed over two trial periods within the 3-year operational trial: an 11-week period at the start and a 22-week trial at the end. All water samples were assessed for a range of basic, chemical, microbiological and metal water quality parameters. The results demonstrate that the decentralised POU-DWTS is capable of continuously producing high quality drinking water when HOCl is continuously used to dose water prior to entering the ultrafiltration [UF] membranes. Over the 3-year operational study, the continuous dosing of HOCl pre-UF membranes resulted in stable permeability, indicating no occurrences of irreversible biofouling within the UF membranes and that good membrane ‘health’ was maintained throughout. As such, there was no need to replace the UF membranes nor undertake acid/alkaline chemical cleans at any point throughput the three-year study. The POU-DWTS continuously produced high quality drinking water, resulting in 6453 m<sup>3</sup> of drinking water produced over the trial period, that met international water quality standards, at a community scale within the location studied.","author":"Gillian E.
