One significant challenge, however, is that it cannot be grown in the form of large crystals as is possible with Si and SiC. The semiconductor industry therefore relies on the deposition of thin films of GaN on various substrates such as sapphire, silicon carbide or aluminum-oxide. Due to the mismatch in their lattice constants, GaN films tend to have a high dislocation density, on the order of 10<sup>8</sup> defects per square centimeter. Such defects affect the properties of the GaN films and lead to stress and strain in the material.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"09ca0e3db498bb32c40facbc31ed0a4ebf997e27d79937abb244fe936c7263e0","category":"Environment"}
