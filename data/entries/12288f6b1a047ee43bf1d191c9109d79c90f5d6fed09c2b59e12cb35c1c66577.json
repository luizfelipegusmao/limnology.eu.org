{"title":"Design, Simulation and Analysis of a LowTech Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (CMUT)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1542/v1","date":1711446692000,"content":"This paper introduces a low-tech capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) designed with low environmental footprint materials. The fabrication process involves a copper plate as the fixed bottom electrode, a polymer-based adhesive as a dielectric material, and an aluminum foil as the top electrode.Finite element simulations include studies of displacement, mechanical stresses, and eigenfrequency. Experimental measurements validate the device's electromechanical behavior, showing an eigenfrequency of 88.6 kHz and a displacement of 22 pm. The low-tech CMUT demonstrates potential for applications such as ultrasonic actuation and energy harvesting, offering simplicity, biocompatibility, and low environmental impact. While not directly ready for applications, these transducers provide hands-on experience with technology similar to high-performance silicon-based implementations. These low-tech MUTs are perfect practical case studies for teaching purposes, combining simulation and experimental validation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"12288f6b1a047ee43bf1d191c9109d79c90f5d6fed09c2b59e12cb35c1c66577","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
