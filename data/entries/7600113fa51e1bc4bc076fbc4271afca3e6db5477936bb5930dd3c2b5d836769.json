{"title":"Targeting the Hippo Pathway in Melanoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0621/v1","date":1712645568000,"content":"Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. In the advanced stage of development it is resistant to currently available therapeutic modalities. Increased invasiveness and metastatic potential depend on a number of proteins involved in various signal transduction pathways. Hippo signaling plays an important role in malignant transformation. Dysfunctions of the Hippo pathway initiate the expression of tumor growth factors and is associated with tumor growth and metastasis formation. This review summarizes the recent achievements in studying the role of the Hippo pathway in melanoma pathogenesis and points to the potential specific targets for anti-melanoma therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7600113fa51e1bc4bc076fbc4271afca3e6db5477936bb5930dd3c2b5d836769","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
