Present study evaluates the toxicity of a widely used fungicide tebuconazole (Trigal®) by the assessment of mortality and developmental alterations at acute, subchronic, and chronic exposure during the embryo-larval development of the South American toad <i>Rhinella arenarum</i>. Also, the sensitivity of the different embryonic stages was evaluated with 24-h pulse exposure treatments. The results demonstrated that larvae were more sensitive than embryos at acute exposure (LC50-24 and 96 h = 74.62, 31.92 mg/L and 24.27, 16.81 mg/L for embryos and larvae, respectively). Nevertheless, embryos toxicity increased significantly achieving a sensitivity very similar to larvae at chronic exposure (LC50-168 and 504 h = 13.31, 4.35 mg/L and 14.47, 6.83 mg/L for embryos and larvae, respectively). Embryos exhibited several sublethal effects from 5 mg/L at 96 h onwards, such as delayed development, reduce body size, edemas, tail/axial flexures, weakness, and absence of movements. The teratogenic index at 96 h was 10.13, indicating the severe teratogenic potential of the fungicide. 24-h pulse exposure treatments showed an increased sensitivity in intermediate stages as S.11, S.18, S20, and S.23 (NOEC-96 h = 100, 200, 75, and 20 mg/L, respectively), while stage S.25 was the most sensitive to the fungicide (NOEC-96 h = 5 mg/L). About metamorphic process, tebuconazole caused an acceleration of metamorphosis at the lowest concentration (0.001 mg/L), but also an increase in mortality and in addition, significant differences in the weight in all treatments. The results obtained throughout this work indicate that tebuconazole cause several adverse effects in <i>Rhinella arenarum</i> embryo-larval development.</p>","author":"Mercedes Acquaroni, \nFlorencia Nuñez Cresto, \nCristina Pérez Coll, \nGabriela Svartz","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"b87e7c620bcda755370c62bd4d09f7b5e67f4db2203ea9e9dcb426c0d78f296d","category":"Environment"}
