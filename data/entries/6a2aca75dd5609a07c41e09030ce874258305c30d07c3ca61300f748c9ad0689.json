Individual bumblebees consistently foraged from around 10 different plants, regardless of their species, the farm they were on, or the time of year. They also showed strong preferences for particular plants, implying there may be something special about these species. Our findings emphasize the importance of diversity and quality (not just quantity) of floral resources when selecting plants to include in pollinator conservation schemes.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\n\nPollen and nectar are crucial resources for bees but vary greatly among plant species in their quantity, nutritional quality and timing of availability. This makes it challenging to identify an appropriate range of plants to meet the nutritional needs of bees throughout the year, though this information is important in the design of pollinator conservation schemes.\n\nUsing DNA metabarcoding of pollen loads, we record the floral resource use of UK farmland bumblebees at different stages of their colony lifecycle, and compare this with null models of ‘expected’ resource use based on landscape-scale resource availability (pollen and nectar), to identify foraging priorities and preferences. We use this approach to ask three main questions: (i) what is the foraging breadth of individual bumblebees?; (ii) do bumblebees utilise a greater or lesser diversity of plant species than expected if they foraged in proportion to resource availability?; (iii) which plant species do bumblebees preferentially utilise?\n\nIndividual bumblebees foraged from a highly consistent number of different plant taxa (mean: 10 ± 0.37 SE per bee), regardless of their species, sampling site or time of year. This high consistency in foraging breadth, despite large changes in the quantity, identity and diversity of resource availability, implies a strong behavioural tendency towards a fixed range of foraging resources. This effect was most striking in April when foraging diversity was maintained despite very low landscape-level resource diversity.\n\nBumblebees used some plant taxa significantly more than predicted from their landscape-level floral abundance, nectar or pollen supply, implying certain desirable characteristics beyond the mere <i>quantity</i> of resource. These included <i>Allium</i> spp. and <i>Vicia</i> spp. in April; <i>Trifolium repens</i> and <i>Lotus corniculatus</i> in July and Cardueae spp. (thistles) and <i>Taraxacum officinale</i> in September.\n\n<i>Practical implication</i>: Our results strongly indicate that resource <i>quantity</i> is not the only factor driving bumblebee foraging patterns and that resource <i>diversity</i> and <i>quality</i> are also important factors. Thus, in addition to providing large quantities of floral resources, we recommend that pollinator conservation schemes also focus on providing a sufficient diversity of preferred floral resources, enabling pollinators to self-select a diverse and nutritious diet.\n</p>","author":"T.
