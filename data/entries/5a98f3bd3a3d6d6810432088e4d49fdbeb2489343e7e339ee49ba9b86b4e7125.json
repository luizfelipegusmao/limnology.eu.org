{"title":"Research Hotspots and Trend Analysis in Modeling Groundwater Dense Nonaqueous Phase Liquids Contamination based on Bibliometrics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0737/v1","date":1725946502000,"content":"Modeling dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) contamination in groundwater is challenging because of its multiphase distribution. To understand the research trends of DNAPL modeling in groundwater, a bibliometric analysis was conducted using CiteSpace based on 614 publications from the WoS Core Collection database (1993-2023). The publications were statistically analyzed, and the research hotspots and trends were summarized. The statistical analysis of the publications indicates that: the United States is leading the international research on DNAPL models, followed by China and Canada; collaboration between countries and disciplines in this field needs to be strengthened. The summary of keyword clustering and burst detection reveals that: the current research hotspots focus on multiphase flow models, mass transfer models, back diffusion, and practical applications of the models; the research trends are centered on back diffusion mechanisms, characterization of contamination source zones and prediction of contaminant distribution in real-world sites, as well as the optimization of remediation strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a98f3bd3a3d6d6810432088e4d49fdbeb2489343e7e339ee49ba9b86b4e7125","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
