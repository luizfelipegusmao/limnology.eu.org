{"title":"Age-Dependent Changes in Protist and Fungal Microbiota in a Peruvian Cattle Genetic Nucleus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1556/v1","date":1719215351000,"content":"In this study, we investigated the relationship between age and microbial diversity in cattle, revealing significant changes in both protist diversity and fungal microbiota composition with age. Using fecal samples from 21 Simmental cattle, we analyzed microbial communities through 18S rRNA gene sequencing. Results indicated significant differences in alpha protist diversity among the three age groups, while fungal composition varied notably with age and was linked to hematological parameters. Despite the stability of fungal alpha diversity, compositional changes suggest the gut as a stable niche for microbial colonization influenced by diet, clinical parameters, and microbial interactions. All cattle were maintained on a consistent diet, tailored to meet specific nutritional needs of each age group. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding age-related microbial dynamics to enhance livestock management and animal health, contributing to broader ecological and biomedical research. However, the study was limited by the lack of comprehensive metabolic analyses correlating microbiota changes with specific age-related variations, indicating a need for further research in this area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3910750c2fd7393428b0d1c86c322aeefd576f68b6135599c8d8ad5044c19e6a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
