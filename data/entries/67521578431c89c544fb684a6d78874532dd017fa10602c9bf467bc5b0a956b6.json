{"title":"Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of La0.7Pr0.3Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by La2NiO4 impregnation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0496/v1","date":1717763772000,"content":"Three types of double perovskite La1-xPrxBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ(x=1,0.3,0) are prepared using the EDTA-citrate method and identified as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes. The microstructures, as well as electrochemical performances of La1-xPrxBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ (LPBSCF) and La2NiO4-impregnated LPBSCF (LN-LPBSCF) cathodes, are investigated in detail. An optimum impregnation amount of LN-LPBSCF (LN loading of 0.64 mg/cm2) electrode exhibits relatively lower electrode polarization resistance (Rp) and better stable performance as compared to that of pure LPBSCF electrode in symmetrical SOFCs. The maximum power density of LN-LPBSCF single cells is 800 mW/cm2 at 800 °C and demonstrates good stability for 100 h in short-term testing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67521578431c89c544fb684a6d78874532dd017fa10602c9bf467bc5b0a956b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
