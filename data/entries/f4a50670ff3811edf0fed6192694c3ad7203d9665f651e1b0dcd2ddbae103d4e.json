{"title":"Pedestrian Fall Detection Methods for Public Traffic Areas: Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1968/v1","date":1724796846000,"content":"Crowd accident surveys have shown that regardless of the initial triggering factors, pedestrian fall behaviour is the most critical factor causing and aggravating crowd accidents in public traffic areas (PTAs). Application of pedestrian fall behaviour detection methods in PTAs is significant. Once deployed, it would prevent many pedestrians from losing life in crowed traffic areas accidents. However, most existing methods is still focused on medical assistance for the elderly. Therefore, this paper conducted bibliometric and content analyses, combining fall detection-related keywords to retrieve from internationally recognized literature databases and benchmark pedestrian behaviour datasets. Based on the analysis of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) achievements in fall detection methods, the fall detection methods were classified into different categories according to the research approach. Among them, it undertakes a comprehensive analysis of five predominant methods, namely computer vision, Internet of Things, smartphone, kinematic, and wearable device-based methods. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets including fall scenarios were introduced and compared. Finally, it provides a detailed discussion of existing fall detection methods, and possible future directions are identified considering application requirements in PTAs. This overview may help researchers understand the SOTA fall detection methods and devise new methodologies by improving and synthesizing the highlighted issues in PTAs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f4a50670ff3811edf0fed6192694c3ad7203d9665f651e1b0dcd2ddbae103d4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
