{"title":"Sympathetic Activation Promotes Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter-1 Protein Expression in Rodent Skeletal Muscle","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0116/v1","date":1717483786000,"content":"The hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is linked to obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, with elevated norepinephrine (NE) levels being a key feature. Previous research has shown increased sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) protein in kidneys of hypertensive rodents, prompting investigation into SGLT1 expression in other tissues such as skeletal muscle. This study aimed to assess: i) whether skeletal muscle cells and tissue express SGLT1 and SGLT2 protein; ii) if NE increases SGLT1 in skeletal muscle cells and iii) whether skeletal muscle of neurogenically hypertensive mice exhibits increased SGLT1 expression. We found that i) skeletal muscle cells and tissue are a novel source of SGLT2 protein and ii) NE significantly elevated SGLT1 in skeletal muscle cells. As SGLT2 inhibition (SGLT2i) with Empagliflozin increased SGLT1, in vivo studies with the dual SGLT1/2i, Sotagliflozin were warranted. Treatment of neurogenically hypertensive mice with Sotagliflozin significantly reduced blood pressure. Our findings suggest that SNS activity upregulates the therapeutic target, SGLT1 in skeletal muscle, potentially worsening cardiometabolic control. As clinical trial data suggests cardiorenal benefits with SGLT2i, future studies should aim to utilize sole SGLT1i which may offer a therapeutic strategy for conditions with heightened SNS activity, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"656f91f448a318031059ca982cd3206fdc20d9de74e1fa9e2e08fe23fa82d065","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
