{"title":"Seasonal shifts in gut microbiota and cold tolerance metrics in a northern population of Reticulitermes flavipes (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/3/447/7640949?rss=1","date":1712188800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Eastern subterranean termites, <span>Reticulitermes flavipes</span> (Kollar), are widely distributed across North America where they are exposed to a broad range of environmental conditions. However, mechanisms for overwintering are not well understood. Wisconsin is a unique location to study mechanisms of cold tolerance as it represents the northern boundary for persistent <span>R. flavipes</span> populations. In this study, we evaluated seasonal shifts in cold tolerance using critical thermal minimum (CT<sub>min</sub>) and supercooling point (SCP) and examined how these measurements correlate to changes in the microbial community of the termite gut. Results showed seasonal acclimatization to cold, which is consistent with the use of behavioral freeze-avoidant mechanisms. However, these insects also demonstrated an increased susceptibility to freezing later in the season, which may be tied to changes in gut microbiota. Our results found shifts in the composition of the gut microbiome in <span>R. flavipes</span> between mid- to late summer and early to late fall. These differences may be suggestive of a change in metabolism to adjust to a period of reduced feeding and increased metabolic stress during overwintering. Specifically, results showed an increased abundance of <span>Methanobrevibacter sp</span>. (Euryarchaeota) associated with cold, which may be indicative of a metabolic shift from acetogenesis to methanogenesis associated with overwintering. Further work is needed focusing on specific contributions of certain gut microbes, particularly their role in metabolic adaptability and in providing protection from oxidative stress associated with changes in environmental conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"0fb81982ea022207994395d13fefe76cde8397499c7444de85e21c1099b96060","category":"Environment"}
