{"title":"Global Helium Industry Chain Analysis and Implications for China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1799/v1","date":1729677962000,"content":"Helium is a strategic rare gas resource related to national security and the development of high-tech industries, the high-quality development of helium industry chains has a great significance to improve the security of helium resource. This paper through literature and market research, summarizes the progress of helium resource endowmen, exploration and development, supply and demand pattern, trade market and industrial technology, equipment through literature and market research in the world, analyses the development situation of global helium resources industry chains. This study proposes the development status and challenges of China's helium industry and the corresponding development path of helium industry based on the upstream, midstream, downstream and downstream indicators. Most of the countries in the world have not started helium exploration or remain in low exploration level, but the exploration practice shows that global helium resource potential is considerable; helium exploration and development subjects become diversified in recent years, which may change the global helium supply and demand pattern; The helium reservoir forming theory and exploration and development technology are underdeveloped, and the helium extraction equipment is continuously improved; The global helium production capacity, supply and demandï¼Œtrade pattern market would be profoundly changing. For a long time, the United States has had an absolute say in the global helium trade system, the contradiction between supply and demand would persist for a long time and significant price fluctuations. China's helium development challenges and opportunities coexist considering the global helium industry chain existing pattern and the new trend of development. There is an urgent need to build an independent and controllable , stable and resilient helium industrial chain, and provide helium resources guarantee for the development of high-tech industries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"48c99febf2af940b1bf6af118c43f06b84df381d7d69020075451aa8ea7cb58a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
