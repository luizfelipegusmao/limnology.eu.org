{"title":"A New Quinazolinone Alkaloid from Rhodiola tibetica Endophytic Fungus Penicillium sp. HJT-A-6","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1012/v1","date":1713258177000,"content":"A new quinazolinone alkaloid, named peniquinazolinone A (1), as well as eleven known compounds, 2-(2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionamido)-N-methylbenzamide (2), viridicatin (3), viridicatol (4), (±)-cyclopeptin (5a/5b), dehydrocyclopeptin (6), cyclopenin (7), cyclopenol (8), methyl-indole-3-carboxylate (9), 2,5-dihydroxyphenyl acetate (10), methyl m-hydroxyphenylacetate (11), conidiogenone B (12), was isolated from the endophytic Penicillium sp. HJT-A-6 derived from the stem of Rhodiola tibetica. The chemical structures of all compounds were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic analysis, including 1D, 2D NMR and HRESIMS. The absolute configuration at C-13 of peniquinazolinone A (1) was established by applying the modified Mosher’s method. Compounds 2, 3, and 7 exhibited an optimal promoting effect on the seed germination of Rhodiola tibetica at a concentration of 0.01 mg/mL, while the optimal concentration for compounds 4 and 9 to promote Rhodiola tibetica seed germination is 0.001 mg/mL. Compound 12 showed optimal seed-germination-promoting activity at a concentration of 0.01 mg/mL. Compared with the positive drug 6-benzyladenine (6-BA), compounds 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, and 12 could extend the seed-germination period of Rhodiola tibetica up to the 11th day.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d751d996dd88dfe0f42289d50c8806d1dcddefd533c4d44cc529cafdb2a517d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
