{"title":"Cutaneous Metastases of Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma Mimicking an Atypical Drug Eruption: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1073/v1","date":1728913483000,"content":"Cutaneous metastases from clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRC) are uncommon and often indicate a poor prognosis. These metastases typically occur on the scalp, face, and trunk, and they can be difficult to diagnose due to their resemblance to benign dermatological tumors. We report the case of a 56-year-old patient with a history of ccRC (TNM stage 4) who was referred to our Dermatology department with two rapidly enlarging, painful lesions on the left jawline and scalp, which had developed one month and one week earlier, respectively. On examination, the lesions appeared as well-defined, round to oval plaques with a central ulceration and a peripheral red rim. Dermoscopic examination revealed a structureless pink to orange pattern, atypical central vessels, and irregular linear vessels in a corona-like arrangement. Despite the patient's stable oncological treatment for six months, pain management had recently included paracetamol, tramadol, and NSAIDs. Given the recent medication changes and the clinical presentation, differential diagnoses initially included drug-induced eruptions such as erythema multiforme or fixed drug eruption. However, a biopsy of the facial lesion revealed immunohistochemical positivity for CD10, CAIX, and PAX8, confirming the diagnosis of metastatic ccRC with sarcomatoid differentiation. Unfortunately, despite continued targeted therapies and palliative care, the patientâ€™s condition deteriorated rapidly, leading to death two months later. This case highlights the aggressive progression and poor prognosis associated with cutaneous metastases from renal cell carcinoma, particularly once the skin is involved.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"916b508f2c8c2fd5a33a5f9f89353b3e2a06228d6b69e5b1d1fd5f399ce559fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
