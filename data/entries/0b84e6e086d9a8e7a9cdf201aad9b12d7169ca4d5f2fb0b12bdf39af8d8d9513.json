When CO<sub>2</sub>R is powered by electricity generated by renewable energy resources, it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ameliorate climate change. [<a href=\"#ozae044.855-B1\">1</a>] One of the critical challenges for practical CO<sub>2</sub>R is optimizing selectivity and efficiency. Determining the structure and chemistry of active CO<sub>2</sub>R electro-catalysts through experimental <span>in situ</span> and <span>operando</span> studies can provide a framework for rational design and optimization of high-performance CO<sub>2</sub>R electrocatalysts. Copper and some of its alloys are the only known species to produce significant amounts of high value C<sub>2+</sub> products. Thus they are the focus of an intense effort to understand and optimize their catalytic performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0b84e6e086d9a8e7a9cdf201aad9b12d7169ca4d5f2fb0b12bdf39af8d8d9513","category":"Environment"}
