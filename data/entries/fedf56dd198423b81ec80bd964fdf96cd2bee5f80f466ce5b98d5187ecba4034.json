{"title":"Using oxygen isotopes in phosphate to assess biological phosphorus cycling in a small and shallow freshwater lake system","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12571?af=R","date":1716913718000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Reducing excess phosphorus (P) loads that cause eutrophication in aquatic systems is essential for meeting water quality standards. The oxygen isotopic composition of phosphate (δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub>) is a powerful tool for tracking P sources and cycling in diverse natural ecosystems. Here, we use δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> distribution in a small freshwater body (a lagoon–lake system) with high biological activity. We report δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> values seasonally along the water flow path in lagoon–lake system adjacent to Lake Biwa, Japan. The δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> values of inflowing water originating as agricultural runoff were constant throughout the study period at +16.3‰ ± 0.2‰. The δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> values in the system were generally offset from temperature-dependent isotopic equilibrium with the surrounding water, ranging from +11.1‰ to +17.8‰. The δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> values of the lake water approached equilibrium values in July and October, when dissolved inorganic P (DIP) retention rates were high, consistent with extensive biologically mediated phosphate cycling. A δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> two end-member mixing model, involving inflowing P and biologically recycled P, suggests that P turnover rates in the lagoon–lake system were high during the productive seasons. In contrast, the longer lake water residence time in the non-irrigation season (winter) allowed δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> values to deviate toward lower values relative to both equilibrium and agricultural source δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> values, suggesting that P metabolism was dominated by extracellular/ecto-enzymatic hydrolysis of dissolved organic P under low DIP concentrations. This work highlighted the utility of δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> for understanding P dynamics in shallow lake ecosystems.</p>","author":"Rong Yi, \nTakuya Ishida, \nPeixue Song, \nTohru Ikeya, \nNoboru Okuda, \nAdina Paytan, \nSyuhei Ban","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"483837404a651916bc0fc2a986656bb768431b5eda97cb95890947a6f32d3b51","entryHash":"fedf56dd198423b81ec80bd964fdf96cd2bee5f80f466ce5b98d5187ecba4034","category":"Environment"}
