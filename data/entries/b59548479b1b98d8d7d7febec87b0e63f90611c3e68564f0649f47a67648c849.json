In this study, the impulse response analysis was conducted to identify the causal factors, which are responsible for fluctuating two main indices of gold and land prices during 1990–2022. For this purpose, a vector autoregression model (VAR), with 12 endogenous variables, was constructed, using EViews software. The results revealed that the shock of the inflation rate, market capitalization, and gasoline prices will not significantly fluctuate gold and land prices in Iran. Besides, the results revealed that some variables, such as GDP per capita, stock traded value, the exchange rate, global gold price, and global oil price may fluctuate national gold and land indices in Iran during the observation periods. Among these causal factors, only the shock of exchange rate, with high decomposition variance (&gt; 78%), will immediately fluctuate national gold and land prices. Hence, the co-movement of gold and land price toward the signals of the exchange rate is obvious and could be forecasted for future periods. An important managerial implication is to focus on the controlling approaches of the exchange rate, which is the main driving power of economic fluctuations and instabilities in Iran.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"b59548479b1b98d8d7d7febec87b0e63f90611c3e68564f0649f47a67648c849","category":"Environment"}
