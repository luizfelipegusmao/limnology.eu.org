{"title":"Response of Land Surface Albedo to Fire Disturbance in the Sierra Nevada Seasonal Snow Zone Over the MODIS Record","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF004172?af=R","date":1719385200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Wildfires in the snow zone can brighten winter and spring landscapes by removing forest canopy, revealing underlying snow cover. Land surface albedo (LSA) alterations associated with transitioning from a canopied, snow-hiding vegetation regime to a snow-revealing landscape have impacts on the surface energy balance, with implications for climate and water supply. Forest fires are increasing in frequency, size, and elevation, but the change in LSA due to fire in the seasonal snow zone (SSZ) is poorly understood. This study addresses this knowledge gap for the Sierra Nevada, where recent climatic changes have contributed to droughts, earlier and more rapidly declining snowpacks, and worsening wildfire impacts. Remotely sensed snow fraction and LSA data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer were used to assess the impact of wildfire on landscapes in the Sierra Nevada SSZ by comparing LSA in burn scars to unburned control areas and the historical average LSA, then quantifying the surface radiative forcing (RF) associated with change in LSA. Among high and moderate burn severity fires, winter LSA varied depending on snow cover, land characteristics, and burn severity, ranging from 0.12 in low-snow fire scars to 0.47 in snow-covered fire scars. This study adds to understanding of how landscapes respond to wildfires and the subsequent impacts on the surface energy balance.</p>","author":"J. M. Gayler, \nS. M.
