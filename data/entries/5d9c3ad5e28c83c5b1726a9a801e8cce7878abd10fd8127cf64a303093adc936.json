{"title":"Intersecting Influences: Exploring Intimate Partner Violence among Sudanese Refugees in the Great Plains","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2308/v1","date":1722290547000,"content":"Research on intimate partner violence among refugee and immigrant communities in the United States has been extensive over the past three decades, but little attention has been given to Sudanese refugees. This qualitative study examines intimate partner violence within Sudanese refugee communities in the Great Plains region of the United States, focusing on how Sudanese cultural traditions influence such violence. The research employs a grounded theory approach, utilizing loosely structured in-depth interviews conducted in early 2015 with twenty male and female Sudanese refugees. Key findings from this study are as follows: 1) Male partners often use traditional cultural beliefs to justify psychological and physical violence. These cultural norms are invoked to maintain control over their partners, reflecting deeply ingrained attitudes towards discipline and gender roles. 2) A combination of low educational attainment, unemployment, and financial disputes contribute to the prevalence of intimate partner violence, especially when it intersects with the cultural context. Conflicts often arise from financial pressures, including the obligation to send remittances to relatives back in Sudan and managing household expenses. 3) Victims of intimate partner violence within this community are generally reluctant to involve the police. Instead, they prefer seeking help from traditional leaders, who are seen as more aligned with their cultural values and more likely to provide a culturally sensitive resolution. The study calls for further investigation into why Sudanese women prefer traditional leaders over police, considering distrust of law enforcement, fear of stigma, and perceived effectiveness of traditional methods. It also highlights the need to understand the challenges faced by women after their husbands' imprisonment, such as economic hardship and social isolation. Effective intervention requires a nuanced understanding of these cultural dynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d9c3ad5e28c83c5b1726a9a801e8cce7878abd10fd8127cf64a303093adc936","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
