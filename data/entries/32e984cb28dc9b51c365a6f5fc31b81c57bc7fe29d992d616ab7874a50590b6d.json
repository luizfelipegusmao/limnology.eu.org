{"title":"Impact of corporate social responsibility on employee loyalty: Mediating role of person-organization fit and employee trust","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300933","date":1711029600000,"content":"<p>by Hebo Jin, Xuexiao Li, Guangsen Li</p>\r\n\r\nThe study explores the impact of employee perceptions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in improving employee loyalty by examining the direct and indirect role of person-organization fit and employee trust. A convenient sampling technique was employed to collect the data sample. A total of 338 questionnaires were collected at three different China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects in Pakistan. The SmartPLS-3 was used to test the study hypotheses. The results revealed that CSR positively and significantly influenced employee loyalty. The findings indicated a partial mediating impact of P-O fit and employee trust in the relationship between CSR and employee loyalty. Discussions, implications, limitations, and future research direction are also given.","author":"Hebo Jin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"32e984cb28dc9b51c365a6f5fc31b81c57bc7fe29d992d616ab7874a50590b6d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
