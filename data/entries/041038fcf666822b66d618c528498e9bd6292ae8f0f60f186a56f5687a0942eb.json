{"title":"Is Mild Really Mild?&rdquo;: Generating Longitudinal Profiles of Stroke Survivor Impairment and Impact Using Unsupervised Machine Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1156/v1","date":1721035892000,"content":"The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is used worldwide to classify stroke severity as ‘mild’, ‘moderate’ or ‘severe’ based on neurological impairment. Yet stroke survivors argue that the classification of ‘mild’ does not represent the holistic experience and impact of stroke on their daily lives. In this observational cohort study, we aimed to identify different types of impairment among stroke survivors classified as mild. We used mild stroke survivors’ data from the START longitudinal stroke cohort (n=73) with measures related to sensorimotor, cognition, depression, functional disability, physical activity, work and social adjustment over 12 months. Given the multi-source, multi-granular and unlabelled nature of data, we utilised a structure-adapting, unsupervised machine learning approach, the Growing Self-organising Map (GSOM) algorithm to generate distinct clinical profiles. These diverse impairment profiles revealed that mild stroke survivors experience varying degrees of impairment and impact (cognitive, depression, physical activity, work/social adjustment) at different time points, despite the uniformity implied by their NIHSS-classified ‘mild’ stroke. This emphasises the necessity of creating a holistic and comprehensive representation of mild stroke survivors’ needs over the first-year post-stroke to improve rehabilitation and post-stroke care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"041038fcf666822b66d618c528498e9bd6292ae8f0f60f186a56f5687a0942eb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
