{"title":"Strategic drivers for the deployment of energy economics principles in the developing construction industry: A Nigerian perspective","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14351?af=R","date":1715141849000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In developing countries, there is a scarcity of research focusing on the factors that drive the adoption and utilization of energy economics principles (EEPs). EEPs encompass a diverse set of strategies and practices designed to encourage energy efficiency, promote the adoption of renewable energy sources, and foster sustainable energy practices among construction stakeholders. Despite their potential benefits, such as reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, there remains a knowledge gap regarding the specific drivers influencing the implementation of EEPs in developing countries. Therefore, this study addresses this knowledge gap by examining the primary drivers for utilizing EEPs in the Nigerian construction industry. To achieve this objective, a quantitative research approach was adopted. Close-ended questionnaires were developed and distributed to professionals in the construction industry, encompassing architects, builders, engineers, and quantity surveyors. The normality of the data was confirmed through univariate skewness and kurtosis analysis. Based on the relative importance index (RII) and mean scores, the highest-ranked driver was government policies and regulations, followed by economic growth and job creation. Environmental sustainability ranked third, while energy cost savings and return on investment occupied the fourth and fifth positions respectively. Through exploratory factor analysis and fuzzy synthetic evaluation, six key criteria that drive the adoption of EEPs were identified: financial-related drivers, environmental-related drivers, social-related drivers, government-related drivers, technological-related drivers, and behavioral-related drivers. By identifying these six distinct clusters of drivers, this study enhances the understanding of the drivers for implementing EEPs, ultimately facilitating the transition to more energy-efficient and sustainable practices in the construction sector and beyond.</p>","author":"Ayodeji Emmanuel Oke, \nJohn Aliu, \nAndrew Ebekozien, \nTaiwo Marcus Akinpelu, \nTosin Michael Olatunde, \nOluwabukunmi A.
