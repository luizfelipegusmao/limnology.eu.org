{"title":"AI Learning through SUSY Field Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1767/v1","date":1729694544000,"content":"We propose a SUSY-inspired loss framework to address the generalizationrobustness trade-off in AI. Combining bosonic and fermionic components, the loss ensures smooth learning and robustness against adversarial attacks. Parallel transport stabilizes weight updates across non-Euclidean loss landscapes. Validation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates stable convergence and enhanced performance under FGSM and PGD attacks, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Keywords: Supersymmetry, Generalization, Robustness, Adversarial Attacks, Parallel Transport, Loss Optimization, CIFAR-10.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a098b2907fd9c6c5981a446e2511a0115ea86cd4156602ae26f471412c63c21e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
