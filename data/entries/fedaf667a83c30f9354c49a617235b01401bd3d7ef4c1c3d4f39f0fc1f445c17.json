{"title":"Machine Learning Analysis of Precipitation as Trigger for Shallow Landslides: Ometepe Island, Nicaragua","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0526/v1","date":1725620668000,"content":"In this study, we address the need for improved landslide forecasting by exploring innovative machine learning approaches to classify shallow landslide events. Focusing on Ometepe Island, Nicaragua, known for its susceptibility to hydrometeorological incidents and seismic activities, we constructed a comprehensive shallow landslide database using coherence layers derived from SAR images. We applied coherence thresholds ranging from 0.9 to 0.99, in conjunction with 7-day aggregated spatio-temporal precipitation data. By employing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier, we established a correlation between precipitation patterns and landslide occurrences. The Support Vector Classifier with a Sigmoidal kernel proved to be the most effective, achieving an F1 score of 0.67. Our results demonstrate a linkage between precipitation and landslide events, confirming the critical role of rainfall over 7-day periods in triggering these events. The study also indicates that, while rainfall is a crucial factor, it is not the sole trigger for landslides, as seismic activities also play a significant role. This research contributes valuable insights into landslide prediction and risk assessment, underscoring the potential of machine learning in enhancing environmental hazard analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fedaf667a83c30f9354c49a617235b01401bd3d7ef4c1c3d4f39f0fc1f445c17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
