{"title":"Design Oriented Analysis of a Self-Bias Circuit for Boost Derived Converters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0773/v1","date":1712823749000,"content":"Boost-derived converters are most popular in Power Factor Correction AC-DC conversion applications and alternative energy generation systems. The proper operation of such converters relies on housekeeping power supplies providing auxiliary power for their control circuitry. The purpose of this study is to present a design-oriented analysis of a simple, passive, isolated, self-bias circuit that can provide a stabilized voltage for the control circuits of boost-derived converters. The circuitâ€™s output voltage inherently follows the main regulated output and therefore, does not require an additional active control. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the circuit and offers design guidelines. Following the presentation of the basic idea several variations of the circuit, that can be used in special applications, are presented. The feasibility of the proposed bias circuits was verified by simulation and experiment on a laboratory prototype.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1aa35c6af3ba1ee94c939a0dde381ea99a0f72511208fa1d361c506da4f7517b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
