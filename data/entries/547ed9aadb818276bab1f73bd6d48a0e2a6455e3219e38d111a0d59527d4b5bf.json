From superconducting circuits, trapped ions, semiconductor quantum dots, and diamond vacancies, to the emerging topological superconductors systems, significant progress have been made in device engineering, thereby enhancing coherence times and gate fidelities together with the number of qubits in the system. However, a ubiquitous challenge hindering optimal performance across these platforms is material disorder â€“ surfaces, interfaces, defects, alloy segregation, charge defects, and impurities. In this regard, we are addressing these challenges by using and developing advanced electron microscopy techniques, together with advance image processing techniques using Python libraries, to reveal the structure and chemistry of emerging topological superconductor systems at the atomic and mesoscopic level.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"547ed9aadb818276bab1f73bd6d48a0e2a6455e3219e38d111a0d59527d4b5bf","category":"Environment"}
