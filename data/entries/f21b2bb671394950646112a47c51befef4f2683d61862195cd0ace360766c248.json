{"title":"Barriers to Digital Learning: Challenges in Online Education in Pakistan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1489/v1","date":1726739145000,"content":"The learning system is primarily based on teaching, and teaching through digital resources is referred to as e-learning. As the world progresses towards success day by day, the use of technology, digital devices, and modern techniques is becoming increasingly prevalent. The global shift from traditional paperwork to digital learning is one of the most significant changes in the education sector. However, many factors have created numerous hurdles during the online setup. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to serious problems all over the world, with the education sector being one of the most affected. One of the greatest challenges students face during online education is the lack of digital infrastructure, especially in remote areas of Pakistan. The biggest challenge is connecting students with teachers due to limited internet access. Without proper internet connectivity, both students and teachers cannot access educational materials. In this context, the government plays a crucial role in providing adequate facilities to students, particularly in primary schools. If proper infrastructure is not made available during this pandemic, students will be deprived of a good quality education. Therefore, good infrastructure is essential for effective online education. With the proper resources in place, students will be able to receive a quality education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f21b2bb671394950646112a47c51befef4f2683d61862195cd0ace360766c248","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
