{"title":"The Immunomodulatory Role of Regulatory T Cells in Preterm Birth and Associated Pregnancy Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1325/v1","date":1729101254000,"content":"Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB), defined as live birth before 37 weeks of gestational age, is associated with immune dysregulation and pro-inflammatory conditions that profoundly impact newborn health. The question of immune integrity at the maternal-fetal interface is a focus of recent studies centring not only sPTB but the conditions often affiliated with this outcome. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical anti-inflammatory role in pregnancy, promoting fetal tolerance and placentation. Due to this gestational role, it is hypothesised that decreased or dysfunctional Tregs may be implicated in cases of sPTB. This review examines studies comparing Treg presence in healthy term pregnancies and those with sPTB-associated conditions, revealing conflicting findings across different conditions and within sPTB itself. Treg deficiencies may contribute to health issues in preterm newborns. Current sPTB treatments are limited, underscoring the potential of in utero therapies targeting inflammation, including T cell interventions. Future research aims to establish consensus on the role of Tregs in sPTB and associated conditions and advancing understanding of mechanisms leading to Treg deficiencies in adverse pregnancy outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c193eb53be676a118086763867e5f1f7ff29cc62d28d64e0f44f38a5488aa21c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
