{"title":"Biomaterials technology and policies in the building sector: a review","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10311-023-01689-w","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Traditional building materials have some drawbacks in the construction industry, particularly in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. Biomaterials derived from renewable sources are a promising alternative, significantly reducing the greenhouse effect and enhancing energy efficiency. However, traditional materials still dominate the construction sector, and there is a lack of understanding among some policymakers and developers regarding biomaterials. Here, we review building biomaterials and their policies and life cycle assessment through case studies. Bio-based materials have the potential to reduce over 320,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. They also exhibit advantages like decreasing water absorption by 40%, reducing energy consumption by 8.7%, enhancing acoustic absorption by 6.7%, and improving mechanical properties. We summarize recent advancements in mycelial materials, bioconcrete, natural fibers, and fiber-reinforced composites. We also explore the contributions of nanotechnology and microalgae technology in enhancing biomaterials' thermal insulation and eco-friendliness.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"dbcec598350db7112a0c3c1555d4596db1595d4ec6abd165a353637e785ee0ca","category":"Environment"}
