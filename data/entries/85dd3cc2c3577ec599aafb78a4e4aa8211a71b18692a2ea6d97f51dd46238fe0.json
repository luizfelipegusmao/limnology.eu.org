{"title":"The Impact of Bioactive Molecules from Probiotics on Child Health: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0110/v1","date":1727858710000,"content":"This review investigates the impact of bioactive molecules produced by probiotics on child health, focusing on their roles in modulating gut microbiota, enhancing immune function, and supporting overall development. Key metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bacteriocins, exopolysaccharides (EPS), vitamins, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are highlighted for their ability to maintain gut health, regulate inflammation, and support neurodevelopment. Clinical studies demonstrate that specific probiotics and their metabolites can reduce gastrointestinal disorders, enhance immune responses, and decrease the incidence of allergies and respiratory infections in pediatric populations. Additionally, postbiotics—bioactive compounds from probiotic fermentation—offer promising benefits, such as improved gut barrier function, reduced inflammation, and enhanced nutrient absorption, while presenting fewer safety concerns compared to live probiotics. By examining the mechanisms of action and clinical evidence, this review underscores the potential of integrating probiotics and postbiotics into pediatric healthcare strategies to promote optimal growth, development, and overall health in children.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"85dd3cc2c3577ec599aafb78a4e4aa8211a71b18692a2ea6d97f51dd46238fe0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
