{"title":"Histological and biophysical changes of cassava roots during retting, a key step of fufu processing","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13130?af=R","date":1715852592000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Retting is a key step of cassava processing into widely consumed foods (fufu, chikwangue, miondo and bobolo) in sub-Saharan Africa. For some populations, retting ability is a major quality criterion that drives the adoption of new cassava varieties. Despite this importance, the physiological basis associated with this process remains poorly understood, and should lead to improved screening tools for breeding. Eight cassava varieties contrasting in retting ability properties were used in the present study. Roots and soaking water were sampled during retting and characterized at both histological and biochemical levels.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Histological data highlighted the degradation of root cell wall during retting. The average pH of soaking water decreased from 5.94 to 4.31 and the average simple sugars decreased from 0.18 to 0 g L<sup>−1</sup>, whereas the organic acids increased up to 5.61 g L<sup>−1</sup>. In roots tissue, simple sugars and organic acid contents decreased from 22.9 to 0 g kg<sup>−1</sup> and from 80 to 0 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The total pectin content of roots among varieties at harvest was similar, and decreased during the retting process. Overall, there was a negative correlation between total pectins content and root softening, although this did not reach statistical significance.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Major histological and biochemical changes occurred during cassava root retting, with some of them associated with the process. Retting affected starch pasting properties more than starch content. Although this process is characterized by root softening and degradation of cell wall structure, the present study strongly suggested that pectin is not the only cell wall component involved in these changes. © 2023 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Germaine‐Alice Wakem, \nLibert Brice Tonfack, \nEmmanuel Youmbi, \nApollin Fotso‐Kuate, \nCargele Masso, \nKomi K.
