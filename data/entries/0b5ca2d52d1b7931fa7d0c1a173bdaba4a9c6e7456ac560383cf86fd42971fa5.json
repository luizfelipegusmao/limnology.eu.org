{"title":"Design and Implementation of a Dashboard for Battery Health Monitoring in Context to Industry 4.0","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0247/v1","date":1719972568000,"content":"Lithium-ion batteries have gained immense popularity in electric vehicles(EVs) due to their high energy density, offering an extended driving range. This has made them the preferred choice in the automotive industry, driving the shift towards EVs. However, alongside their popularity, safety concerns have arisen. The main issues include the potential for thermal runaway leading to fires or explosions, which can occur due to overcharging, physical damage, or manufacturing defects. While safety features and rigorous testing aim to mitigate these risks, ongoing research and development focus on enhancing safety measures to further ensure the reliability and safety of lithium-ion batteries in EVs. This paper focuses on the development and deployment of a real-time monitoring dashboard for Li-ion battery health monitoring using STM32 Microcontroller within the framework of Industry 4.0. Leveraging advanced sensor technology and data analytics, the dashboard provides continuous, comprehensive insights into battery performance, including state of charge and temperature. Integrating with Industry 4.0 principles, such as IoT, the system enables predictive maintenance, optimizing production processes and ensuring efficient utilization of resources. The implementation showcases the integration of real-time monitoring tools for Li-ion batteries, aligning with the transformative paradigms of Industry 4.0 to enhance operational efficiency and reliability within industrial settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b5ca2d52d1b7931fa7d0c1a173bdaba4a9c6e7456ac560383cf86fd42971fa5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
