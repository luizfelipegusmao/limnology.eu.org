{"title":"Surviving the serenade: how conflicting selection pressures shape the early stages of sexual signal diversification","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/5/835/7618583?rss=1","date":1709510400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Understanding how the early stages of sexual signal diversification proceed is critically important because these microevolutionary dynamics directly shape species trajectories and impact macroevolutionary patterns. Unfortunately, studying this is challenging because signals involve complex interactions between behavior, morphology, and physiology, much of which can only be measured in real-time. In Hawaii, male Pacific field cricket song attracts both females and a deadly parasitoid fly. Over the past two decades, there has been a marked increase in signal variation in Hawaiian populations of these crickets, including novel male morphs with distinct mating songs. We capitalize on this rare opportunity to track changes in morph composition over time in a population with three novel morphs, investigating how mate and parasitoid attraction (components of sexual and natural selection) may shape signal evolution. We find dramatic fluctuation in morph proportions over the three years of the study, including the arrival and rapid increase of one novel morph. Natural and sexual selection pressures act differently among morphs, with some more attractive to mates and others more protected from parasitism. Collectively, our results suggest that differential protection from parasitism among morphs, rather than mate attraction, aligns with recent patterns of phenotypic change in the wild.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"843dda0fac1b8b534d7e7a6372cf1c01995774c102e49bf2ee319f7d2ecc2280","category":"Environment"}
