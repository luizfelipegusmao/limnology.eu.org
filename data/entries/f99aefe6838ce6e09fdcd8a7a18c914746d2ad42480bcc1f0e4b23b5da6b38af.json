{"title":"New Insights into the Effect of Temperature Variation on the Force Released by Superelastic Orthodontic Wires. Part II: Phase Transition Temperatures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1378/v1","date":1721216776000,"content":"(1) Background: The aim of this investigation is to determine the effect of archwires’ deflection on the temperature transitions driving the austenite to martensite transformation (and vice versa) and the force released by NiTi and CuNiTi orthodontic wires. (2) Methods: Round cross-section archwires have been investigated. The calorimetric approach has been used for measuring transition temperatures occurring in the unstressed (e.g. undeflected) state of the wires. Static Thermo-mechanical analysis in a temperature controlled wet environment has been performed in the range of temperature between 5°C and 55°C for measuring temperature transitions occurring in highly deflected archwires in conjunction with the force released by these wires. (3) Results: Plateau forces investigated in Part I and those reported in the literature describes the wire’s behaviour only at deflection levels close to the end point of the force plateau extension detected at 37°C. Upon heating or cooling, the austenite finish (Af) transition temperature and the martensite start (Ms) temperature largely depends on the deflection level for both NiTi and CuNiTi. (4) Conclusions: The plateau force levels at 37°C, broadly reported in the literature, only represent the lower boundary force that a superelastic wire releases at 37°C above its elastic limit. For both NiTi and CuNiTi, plateau force levels at 37°C can be predicted by the static TMA profile matching the end point of the force plateau extension. Transition temperatures in largely deflected wires are significantly higher than those determined through the calorimetric approach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f99aefe6838ce6e09fdcd8a7a18c914746d2ad42480bcc1f0e4b23b5da6b38af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
