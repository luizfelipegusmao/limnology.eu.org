{"title":"Converting Tessellations into Graphs: from Voronoi Tessellations to Complete Graphs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0494/v1","date":1720157313000,"content":"A mathematical procedure enabling the transformation of an arbitrary tessellation of a surface into a bi-colored complete graph is introduced. Polygons constituting the tessellation are represented by vertices of the graphs. Vertices of the graphs are connected by two kinds of links/edges, namely, by a green link, when polygons have the same number of sides, and by a red link, when the polygons have a different number of sides. This procedure gives rise to a semi-transitive, complete, bi-colored Ramsey graph. The Ramsey number was established as R_trans (3,3)=5. Shannon entropies of the tessellation and graphs are introduced. Ramsey graphs emerging from random Voronoi and Poisson Line tessellations were investigated. The limits ζ=lim┬(N→∞)⁡〖N_g/N_r 〗, where N is the total number of green and red seeds, N_g and N_r, were found ζ=0.272±0.001 (Voronoi) and ζ= 0.47±0.02 (Poisson Line). The Shannon Entropy for the random Voronoi tessellation was calculated as S= 1.690±0.001 and for the Poisson line tessellation as S =1.265±0.015.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b127d4e5d661876cbfb9b008eacf6ebba669c218ca8da1ee236d88c0edc2a5e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
