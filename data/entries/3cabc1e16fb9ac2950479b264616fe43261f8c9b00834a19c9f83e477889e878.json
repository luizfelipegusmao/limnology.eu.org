{"title":"Diploid and triploid Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) exhibit differential immunological responses to acute thermal stress","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13998?af=R","date":1720853105000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Exposure to temperatures outside of a fish's optimal range results in suppression of the immune system, ultimately leaving aquaculture stocks susceptible to disease outbreaks. This effect is exacerbated in triploid fishes, which demonstrate greater susceptibility to stress than their diploid counterparts. This study investigates the impacts of acute heat stress on the abundance of immune transcripts and proteins in diploid and triploid Chinook salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>\n<b>)</b>, an important finfish crop. This study also demonstrates that acute heat stress induces significant increases in the abundance <i>hsp70</i>, <i>hsp90</i> and <i>il1b</i> transcripts in the head kidneys, gills and heart ventricles of both diploid and triploid Chinook salmon. Widespread dysregulation of antigen-presentation transcripts was also observed in fish of both ploidies. These results suggest that acute heat stress activates acute-phase responses in Chinook salmon and dysregulates antigen presentation, potentially leaving fish more susceptible to infection. At the protein level, IL-1β was differentially expressed in the head kidney and ventricles of diploid and triploid salmon following heat shock. Differential expression of two tapasin-like proteins in diploid and triploid salmon subjected to heat shock was also observed. Altogether, these data indicate that diploid and triploid Chinook salmon respond differently to acute thermal stressors.</p>","author":"Noah P. Rogozynski, \nIvan G.
