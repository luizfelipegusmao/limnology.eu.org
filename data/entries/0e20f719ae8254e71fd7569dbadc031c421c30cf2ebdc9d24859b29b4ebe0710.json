{"title":"How do bacterial endosymbionts work with so few genes?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002577","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by John P. McCutcheon, Arkadiy I. Garber, Noah Spencer, Jessica M. Warren</p>\r\n\r\nThe move from a free-living environment to a long-term residence inside a host eukaryotic cell has profound effects on bacterial function. While endosymbioses are found in many eukaryotes, from protists to plants to animals, the bacteria that form these host-beneficial relationships are even more diverse. Endosymbiont genomes can become radically smaller than their free-living relatives, and their few remaining genes show extreme compositional biases. The details of how these reduced and divergent gene sets work, and how they interact with their host cell, remain mysterious. This Unsolved Mystery reviews how genome reduction alters endosymbiont biology and highlights a “tipping point” where the loss of the ability to build a cell envelope coincides with a marked erosion of translation-related genes.","author":"John P.
