{"title":"THE INDUS SCRIPT AS AN ALPHABET Examining Conformity in the Usage of the Indus Script","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1473/v1","date":1724154173000,"content":"This paper presents a novel approach to decoding the Indus script, which was used by the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) from approximately 3300 to 1900 BCE. The main focus of this research is the structural analysis of the signs within the Indus script. The central objective of the paper is to determine whether the Indus script can be classified as an alphabet, and it aims to provide compelling evidence regarding the number of primary signs. This includes establishing the actual count of Indus signs through the decomposition of compound signs, identifying diacritics and analyzing their consistent usage, as well as exploring the underlying concepts and implications associated with sign extraction. To comprehensively examine the Indus script, the paper analyzes over 400 signs, encompassing the entire script rather than a select subset of signs or texts. The visual decomposition of the signs employs a simple grid methodology. By summarizing the logical findings, the paper successfully identifies the primary signs and develops an understanding of their phonetic representation within the alphabet. The study recognizes the diverse writing styles used to combine the basic signs, The writing style of the Indus script incorporates variations in formation, composition, and combination, resulting in a significant number of signs. The research findings indicate that the Indus Script primarily consists of only 40 core signs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"066c1eb8e3bf935103f0dc7d8d6a0d7db12fed8be7454e0200cab2e29fd72ea2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
