{"title":"Ultrasoft Long-Lasting Reusable Hydrogel-Based Sensor Patch for Biosignal Recording","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1104/v1","date":1721011955000,"content":"Here, we report an ultrasoft extra long-lasting reusable hydrogel-based sensor that enables high quality electrophysiological recording with low motion artifacts. The developed sensor can be used and stored in the ambient environment for months before being reused again. The developed sensor is made of a self-adhesive electrical-conductivity-enhanced ultrasoft hydrogel, mounted in an Ecoflex-based frame. Hydrogel’s conductivity was enhanced by incorporating polypyrrole (PPy), resulting in the conductivity of 0.25 S m-1. Young’s modulus of the sensor is only 12.9 kPa and it is stretchable up to 190%. The sensor was successfully used for the electrocardiography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG). Our results indicate that using developed hydrogel-based sensor, the signal-to-noise ratio of recorded electrophysiological signals was improved in comparison to that when medical grade silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) wet gel electrodes were used (33.55 dB in comparison to 22.16 dB). Due to the ultra-softness, high stretchability, and self-adhesion of the developed sensor, it can conform to the skin and therefore, it shows low susceptibility to motion artifacts. Also, the sensor shows no sign of irritation or allergic reaction that usually occurs after long-term wearing medical grade Ag/AgCl wet gel electrodes on the skin. Further, the sensor is fabricated using a low cost and scalable fabrication process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"159eccefe58038cd14828ff2231c01dad24fd07819ef3fd927fa41ad1d32f1c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
