{"title":"Inhibitive Mechanism of Loquat Flower Isolate on Tyrosinase Activity and Melanin Synthesis in Mouse Melanoma B16 Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1798/v1","date":1714294670000,"content":"Melanin is extensively distributed in organisms and believed to be synthetized by tyrosinase (TYR), leading to aberrant coloring and skin conditions when over-produced. Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl.) flowers contain large amounts of bioactive substances currently few studied on their suppressive capabilities to melanin synthesis. Its isolate product (LFP) was obtained by ethanol solution extraction and resin purification, of which the inhibitory mechanism on TYR activity was elaborated by enzyme kinetics and multi-spectroscopy determinations and the impact on related proteinsâ€™ expression in mouse melanoma B16 cells was analyzed with Western blotting. HPLC-MS analysis indicated that LFP was identified into 137 compounds, with 12 including flavonoids (quercetin, isorhamnoin, p-coumaric acid, etc.), cinnamic acid and its derivatives as well as benzene and its derivatives owning TYR inhibitory activities. LFP inhibited TYR activity in a concentration-dependent manner with its IC50 value being 2.8 mg/mL and an anti-competitive mechanism involved altering the enzyme's conformation. LFP reduced the expression of TYR, TRP1, and TRP2 in melanoma B16 cells, hence inhibiting the synthesis of melanin. Considered collectively, LFP would be a viable option for treating hyperpigmentation caused by tyrosinase, providing a theoretical basis for the value-added utilization of loquat flower resource in beauty and aging related functional products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"893965b7d953909ebde9fda354adb9b919f27222298719fbf4def112170634fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
