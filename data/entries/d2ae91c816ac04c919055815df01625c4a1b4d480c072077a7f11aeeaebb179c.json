While the stress-gradient hypothesis predicts the strength of competition to decrease with increasing stress, our understanding of how competition varies with stress is limited by a lack of mechanistic understanding of how resource-use traits underlying competitive dynamics respond to stress.\n\nHere, we use duckweeds in the <i>Lemna</i> species complex to measure how phenotypic and genetic variation in <i>R*</i> (a resource acquisition trait representing the minimum resource requirement for positive population growth) varies with high-temperature stress to better understand how stress alters competitive ability for essential resources.\n\nWe found that heat stress increased the <i>R*</i> of <i>Lemna</i> plants for nitrogen acquisition. Because lower <i>R*</i> values predict dominance in competitive dynamics where resources are limiting, this indicates that under stressful, high temperatures, plants could experience reduced competitive ability due to the higher resources required to sustain positive population growth rates.\n\nWe found minimal genetic variation in <i>R*</i> across 11 local genotypes within the <i>Lemna</i> species complex, indicating that selection on resource acquisition strategies for essential resources such as nitrogen may be constrained in nature. The expression of genetic variation in <i>R*</i> for nitrogen was further reduced under heat stress, suggesting that the response to selection for <i>R*</i> could be particularly constrained under high-temperature stress.\n\nContrary to predictions drawn from the gleanerâ€“opportunist trade-off, we did not find evidence for a trade-off in resource acquisition strategies under benign conditions or high-temperature stress. Plants with lower <i>R*</i> (i.e. higher growth rates under lower nitrogen levels) were not constrained to have lower growth rates under higher nitrogen levels, possibly because the chosen genotypes have not diverged across resource acquisition strategies or because <i>Lemna</i> spp. has escaped this constraint.\n\nImportantly, our work indicates that high-temperature stress could increase sensitivity to competition through an increased requirement for resources while reducing the evolutionary potential for <i>Lemna</i> species to respond to selection for resource traits. This study acts as a key step to understanding the mechanistic traits behind competitive dynamics in resource-limited and stressful environments.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/04/17/high-temperatures-increase-the-nutrient-demands-for-a-small-aquatic-plant/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Graydon J.
