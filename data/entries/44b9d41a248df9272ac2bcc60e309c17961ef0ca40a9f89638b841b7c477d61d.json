{"title":"Small Natural Cyclic Peptides from DBAASP Database","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1489/v1","date":1716442517000,"content":"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising tools for combating microbial resistance. However, their therapeutic potential is hindered by two intrinsic drawbacks – low target affinity and poor in vivo stability. Macrocyclization, a process that improves the pharmacological properties and bioactivity of peptides, can address these limitations. As a result, macrocyclic peptides represent attractive drug candidates. Moreover, many drugs are macrocycles that originated from natural product scaffolds, suggesting that nature offers solutions to the challenges faced by AMPs. In this review, we explore natural cyclic peptides from the DBAASP database. DBAASP is a comprehensive repository of data on antimicrobial/cytotoxic activities and structures of peptides. We analyze the data on small (≤25 AA) ribosomal and non-ribosomal cyclic peptides from DBAASP according to their amino acid composition, bonds used for cyclization, targets they act on, and mechanisms of action. This analysis will enhance our understanding of the small cyclic peptides that nature has provided to defend living organisms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44b9d41a248df9272ac2bcc60e309c17961ef0ca40a9f89638b841b7c477d61d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
