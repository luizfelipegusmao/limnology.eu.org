{"title":"Towards periodic whole-body lipofuscin removal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202208.0229/v8","date":1712576434000,"content":"Lipofuscin is indigestible garbage that accumulates in the autophagic vesicles and cytosol of post-mitotic cells with age.  Drs. Brunk and Terman postulated that lipofuscin accumulation is the main or at least a major driving factor in aging.  They even posited that the evolution of memory is the reason why we get lipofuscin at all, as stable synaptic connections must be maintained over time, meaning that the somas of neurons must also remain in the same locale.  In other words, they cannot dilute out their garbage over time through cell division.  Mechanistically, their position certainly makes sense given that rendering a large percentage of a post-mitotic cellâ€™s lysosomes useless must almost certainly negatively affect that cell and the surrounding microenvironment.  Here, I explore the possibility that the accumulation of lipofuscin may to some extent exacerbate every other kind of age-related damage.  I do not think that lipofuscin removal will reverse/prevent all forms of aging, just the major component facing us currently.  In this piece, I will review what is known about lipofuscin accumulation from evolutionary and mechanistic standpoints and discuss a method of removing it from single cells in vitro.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"caf5ed9575debb56ae16b24be38fdd8d5cacf17c4b6721eef489d9bf9ff0e4c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
