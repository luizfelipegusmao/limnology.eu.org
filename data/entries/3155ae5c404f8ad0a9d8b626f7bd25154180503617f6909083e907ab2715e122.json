{"title":"Design of a New Neuro-generator with Neuronal Module to Produce Pseudorandom and Perfectly Pseudorandom Sequences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0795/v1","date":1712822861000,"content":"This paper presents the design of a new neuro-generator of pseudorandom number type PRNG Pseudorandom Number Generator, which produces complex sequences with an adequate bit distri-bution. The circuit is connected to a neuronal module with six impulse neurons with different be-haviors: spike frequency adaptation, phasic spiking, mixed mode, phasic bursting, tonic bursting and tonic spiking. This module aims to generate a non-periodic signal that becomes the clock sig-nal for one of the LFSRs Linear Feedback Shift Register that the neuro-generator has. To verify its correct operation, the neuro-generator was subjected to a series of tests where the frequencies of the impulse neurons were modified. This modification allows generating a greater number of pulses at the output of the neuronal module, to obtain sequences with different characteristics that pass different NIST statistical tests National Institute of Standards and Technology of U.S. The results show that the new neuro-generator maintains pseudo-randomness in the sequences obtained with different frequencies and it can be implemented on reconfigurable FPGA Field Programmable Gate Array Virtex 7 xc7vx85t-2ffg1761 device. Therefore, it can be used for applications such as biologi-cal systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3155ae5c404f8ad0a9d8b626f7bd25154180503617f6909083e907ab2715e122","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
