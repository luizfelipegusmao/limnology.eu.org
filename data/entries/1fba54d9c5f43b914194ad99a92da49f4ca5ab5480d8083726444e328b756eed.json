{"title":"Successful Resolution of Cervical Insufficiency after Administration of a Novel Triple Antibiotic Therapy: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0141/v1","date":1725355287000,"content":"Background\nCervical insufficiency, marked by recurrent painless cervix dilation leading to second-trimester pregnancy losses, is traditionally managed through cerclage placement and vaginal progesterone administration. However, a recent experimental approach targeted intra-amniotic inflammation or infection in a selected group of women with cervical dilation over 1 cm, intact membranes, and no uterine contractions in the second or third trimester.\nCase presentation \nWe report a case of a 21 year old primigravid  woman who  experienced resolution of mid-trimester cervical insufficiency after the administration of triple antibiotic therapy, as confirmed by ultrasound monitoring. Remarkably, the patient successfully carried the pregnancy to term and delivered a healthy baby.\nConclusions\nThis case highlights the potential effectiveness of a novel combination of antibiotics, even in the presence of several high-risk pregnancy conditions, and underscores the possibility of a favorable outcome.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1fba54d9c5f43b914194ad99a92da49f4ca5ab5480d8083726444e328b756eed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
