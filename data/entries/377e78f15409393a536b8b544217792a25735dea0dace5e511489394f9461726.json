{"title":"Making the Research and Innovation Ethical: A Conceptual Framework for Ethics Assessment of Nanotechnology Innovations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1342/v1","date":1716260379000,"content":"In the current era of emerging technologies and cutting-edge inventions, it is equally important to consider the ethical aspects of research and innovations to have an ethical space for the sustainable progress and safety of humanity. The field of nanotechnology research and innovation often faces criticism due to its potential adverse impacts on health, the environment, limited accessibility, high costs, and concerns about data privacy. Therefore, it is crucial to address and resolve these ethical issues systematically. In this regard, we present our findings and methods for exploring the application of the ethics technology assessment method by considering its relevance at different stages of innovation development. Specifically, the present work provides a conceptual framework for ethics technology assessment focused on evaluating a significant innovation in nanotechnology within the domain of food safety with specific reference to mycotoxin remediation. By leveraging the value-sensitive design approach, we described various strategies for analyzing the ethical implications of nanotechnology-based innovations in mycotoxin remediation. Through comprehensive ethics technology assessment, nanotechnology-based innovations can be guided toward becoming more value-oriented, thereby making substantial contributions to social progress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"377e78f15409393a536b8b544217792a25735dea0dace5e511489394f9461726","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
