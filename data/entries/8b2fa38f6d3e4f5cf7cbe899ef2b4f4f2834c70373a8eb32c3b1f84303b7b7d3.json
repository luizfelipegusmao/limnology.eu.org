{"title":"Comparison of Leadership Priorities Among Undergraduate and Graduate Nursing Students","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1781/v1","date":1724653515000,"content":"Effective leadership is reflected by evidence-based attributes, competencies, and behaviors. The Future of Nursing Report (2011) identified a gap in leadership knowledge, recommending development of creative and innovative strategies to strengthen nursing leadership curricula. These results provided an impetus and charge for nursing education to reexamine and revise leadership content. This mixed methods study analyzed baccalaureate and masters nursing students’ development of their leadership knowledge and skills. Through reflections, undergraduate (n=60) and master’s (n=52) students identified their perceived priorities and tips for success for nursing leaders across the healthcare continuum. Qualitative content analysis aligned students’ comments with the American Organization for Nursing Leadership (AONL) Nurse Executive Competencies (2015). Descriptive data provided the summaries of which leadership competencies were represented. Alignment to the competencies varied, commensurate with the level of educational program: BSN-level management skills vs. MS-level executive skills. Common responses across both programs prioritized communication, professionalism, and leadership behaviors. The results provide an opportunity for students’ synthesis of leadership skills and practices, may guide educators in the design of multi-level leadership curricula, and support development of clinical leaders in practice. This study was prospectively registered with the Campus Institutional Review Board on January 23, 2023, protocol code: 0086-001.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b2fa38f6d3e4f5cf7cbe899ef2b4f4f2834c70373a8eb32c3b1f84303b7b7d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
