However, many dynamic mechanisms are not fully understood, and some theories rely on post treatment observations to infer the correct microstructural mechanisms. One such example is Abnormal Grain Growth (AGG), which can be observed during the heat treatment of Nano-crystalline Nickel, where some grains grow favourably whilst a smaller matrix grain size is maintained [<a href=\"#ozae044.284-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.284-B2\">2</a>]. This dynamic event is difficult to predict and can vary depending on the material. Of particular interest are the parameters that control the initiation of these larger grains, however the beginnings of AGG are difficult to observe. The combination of an in-situ stage with integrated heating element, and a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) allow for the real-time investigation of the initiation and growth mechanisms of AGG.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"90d183f304e1b6693694974ce8191404d86d8e8fc8a85ecf8b0ba41617e096ac","category":"Environment"}
