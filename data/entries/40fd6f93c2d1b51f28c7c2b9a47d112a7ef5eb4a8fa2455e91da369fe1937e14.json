{"title":"Effect of Post-Processing Heat Treatment on the Micro-Contact Damage of Zirconia-Reinforced Lithium Silicate Dental Materials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1405/v1","date":1711349974000,"content":"Zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) is utilized as a material for prosthetic tooth crowns, offering enhanced strength compared to other dental glass-ceramics. In this study, we investigate a commercial ZLS material, provided in a fully crystallized form. We examine the effects of an optional post-processing heat treatment on micro-contact damage using controlled indentation tests simulating the primary modes of contact during chewing: axial and sliding. Our findings indicate that the heat treatment does not affect mechanical properties such as the elastic modulus, hardness and indentation fracture toughness. However, it does enhance the resistance to contact damage by fracture and chipping in both axial and sliding modes, as well as the resistance to crack initiation measured from sliding tests. This improvement is attributed to the refinement of the flaw population achieved through the heat treatment. The results are analysed within the framework of contact and fracture mechanics, and the implications for prosthetic dentistry are briefly discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40fd6f93c2d1b51f28c7c2b9a47d112a7ef5eb4a8fa2455e91da369fe1937e14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
