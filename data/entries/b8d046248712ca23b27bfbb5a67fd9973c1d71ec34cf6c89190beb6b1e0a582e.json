That is to say, we have an apparent incompatibility, at the deepest level, between the two fundamental pillars of contemporary theory...” J. S. Bell (2004, p. 171)        The inability to delineate a unified physical ontology that accounts simultaneously for the laws of special relativity and the results of quantum experiments has been a defining problem in physics for more than 100 years. Although various primitive ontologies (including Bohmian pilot wave, spontaneous collapse, and objective collapse theories) along with wave function realism ontologies, many-worlds interpretations, and multi-field theories address the tension between special relativity and quantum mechanics, none has successfully resolved it.       This analysis addresses the problem by positing an ontic, mixed ontology composed of a “discrete” 4D spacetime and a physical, ultra-high dimensional (3 x N) “Planck Space.” Together, Planck Space and the three spatial dimensions of 4D spacetime form a tightly integrated ((3 x N) + 3) hyperspace (the “Dual Ontology”). 4D spacetime’s three spatial dimensions and the N dimensions of Planck Space are composed of two substructures: discrete, three-dimensional, quantized units of space (\"Planck Spheres\") and an ontic State of Absolute Nothingness (the \"SOAN\") whose sole physical characteristic is onticness.       Critically, the Dual Ontology’s structure replaces 1) the continuous, differentiable manifold of 4D spacetime with a discrete 4D spacetime and 2) mathematical 3N configuration spaces with a physical (3 x N) Planck Space. Moreover, structurally and dynamically, the Dual Ontology is predicated on the one-to-one mapping and identity between the Planck Spheres that simultaneously form 4D spacetime and Planck Space. The one-to-one mapping and identity physically and theoretically support an integrated quantum dynamics based upon the dynamic evolution of single and N-body quantum states in 4D spacetime in full compliance with the laws of special relativity and the instantaneous collapse of all quantum states in an ontic Planck Space, where special and general relativity and more generally, 4D spacetime’s laws of physics, do not apply.
