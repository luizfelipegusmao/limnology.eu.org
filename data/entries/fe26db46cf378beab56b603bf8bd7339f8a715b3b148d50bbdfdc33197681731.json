{"title":"Urban Forestry in Sub-Saharan Africa: Challenges, Contributions, and Future Directions for Combating Climate Change and Restoring Forest Landscape","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1360/v1","date":1726652266000,"content":"Since the 1960s, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa have been affected by an urban crisis due to the demographic explosion in cities and the resulting land pressures. These have resulted in the proliferation of spontaneous housing areas which question the future of urban vegetation and its degree of inclusion in city planning. To analyze the state of knowledge on the research already carried out on the development of urban landscape, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, a literature review on urban forestry covering the period 1998-2022 was carried out in order to better orient future research works for a greater consideration to urban forestry and their contributions in combating the adverse effects of climate change. Out of a set of 110 scientific papers selected, 50 were considered relevant because of their direct link with urban forestry. From the analysis of this papers, a classification of the articles according to 05 themes was carried out. These are: management of green spaces in urban areas, functions of trees in an urban environment, development of urban forestry, characterization of urban tree flora and financing of urban forestry. Thus, “function of trees in an urban environment and the characterization of urban tree flora” are the most addressed respectively at 42% and 28%. “Financing urban forestry” is practically not addressed (2%). The analysis of the 50 selected articles reveals a significant geographic concentration of urban forestry research. Countries like South Africa, Kenya, and Ghana are more represented in the literature, while vast regions in Central and Western Africa (e.g., Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, and Niger) have minimal or no documented research on urban forestry. Future research should address these underrepresented themes, as they are crucial for the long-term sustainability of urban forestry projects. Particularly, research on financing mechanisms is essential to unlock sustainable funding sources for urban forestry, a critical barrier to its expansion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe26db46cf378beab56b603bf8bd7339f8a715b3b148d50bbdfdc33197681731","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
