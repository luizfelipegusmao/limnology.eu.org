{"title":"Blind Cyclostationary Based Carrier Number and Spacing Estimation for Carrier-Aggregated Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum Cellular Signals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0431/v1","date":1725516912000,"content":"Automatic and blind parameter estimation based on the inherent features of wireless signals is a major research area due to the fact that these techniques lead to the simplification of receivers, especially in terms of coarse synchronization, more importantly reduce down the signaling load at the control channels. Thus, in the literature many techniques are proposed to estimate a vast set of parameters including modulation types and orders, data and chip rates, phase and frequency offsets and so on. In this paper, a cyclostationary feature detection based method is proposed to estimate the carrier numbers and carrier spacing of carrier-aggregated direct sequence spread spectrum cellular signals blindly. The particular chip rate of the signal is also estimated through the process jointly. In the paper, after the proposed method is formulated, the measurement setup which is developed to collect the data for the validation of the proposed method is introduced. The measurement results are post-processed for performance analysis purposes. To that end, the method is investigated in terms of SNR values, different channel conditions, and measurement durations. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of energy detection. Measurement results indicate superior performance of the proposed method under significant wireless channel impairments and in low-SNR regions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca3437a7e565699ad366a36318b58c7612d2f21fd89899955ee45b9d6ad78a94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
