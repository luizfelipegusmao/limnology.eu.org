{"title":"African Swine Fever Virus Immunosuppression and Virulence Related Gene","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1094/v1","date":1718603853000,"content":"African swine fever virus (ASFV), a highly contagious pathogen characterized by a complex structure and a variety of immunosuppression proteins, causes hemorrhagic, acute, and aggressive infectious disease that severely injure the pork product and industry. However, there is no effective vaccine or treatment. The main reasons are not only the complex mechanisms that lead to immunosuppression, but also the unknown functions of various proteins. This review summarizes the interaction between ASFV and host immune system, along with the involvement of virulence related genes and proteins, as well as the corresponding molecular mechanism of immunosuppression of ASFV, encompassing pathways such as cGAS-STING, NF-ÎºB, JAK/STAT, apoptosis, and other modulation. The aim is to summarize the dynamic process during the ASFV infection and entry into host cell, provide a rational insight into development of vaccine and a better clear knowledge of how ASFV impacts host.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0cbf7ce1f3741155c48061ba25aa281cd33c80645bcbc02a89c05d6bf1cf0ad3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
