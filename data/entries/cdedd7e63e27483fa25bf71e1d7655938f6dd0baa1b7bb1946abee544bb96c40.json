Recently, a group of researchers uncovered a hormone produced in the intestine without any known function, which they named cholesin, that suppresses sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2), the master regulator of cholesterol synthesis in the liver.</strong></span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Life Metabolism Current Issue","siteHash":"d3cf61b7d69b232b580c1102d6441106867080e8dca2814adef0cc08b7e63ed3","entryHash":"cdedd7e63e27483fa25bf71e1d7655938f6dd0baa1b7bb1946abee544bb96c40","category":"Environment"}
