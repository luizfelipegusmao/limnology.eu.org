{"title":"Stability of high internal‐phase emulsions prepared from phycocyanin and small‐molecule sugars","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13184?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The use of high internal-phase Pickering emulsions in the food industry is widespread due to their excellent stability and special rheological properties. Proteins are often used as food-grade Pickering stabilizers due to their safety and nutritious properties. Nowadays, the development and efficient utilization of novel proteins as Pickering stabilizers has become a new challenge.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Phycocyanin complexes with small-molecule sugars (SMS), formed as a result of non-thermal interactions, can serve as stabilizers for high internal-phase Pickering emulsions. The addition of SMS-enabled gel-like emulsions significantly reduced the amount of emulsifier used. When the SMS was sorbitol, the emulsion had excellent elastic properties and self-supporting ability and was stable during long-term storage, when subjected to centrifugation, and under different temperature conditions. The fluorescent property of phycocyanin was utilized to investigate the formation mechanism of the emulsion. Small-molecule sugars were able to form ‘sugar-shell’ structures on the surface of proteins to enhance the structural stability of proteins. Phycocyanin-SMS-stabilized emulsions provided superior protection for photosensitive and volatile substances. The retention rates of <i>trans</i>-resveratrol and <i>n</i>-hexane increased by 384.75% and 30.55%, respectively.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These findings will encourage the development of proteins that stabilize Pickering emulsions. They will also provide new ideas for protecting photosensitive and volatile substances. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xiaolin Sun, \nZhong Zhang, \nWenjun Li, \nHongye Tian, \nLi Yuan, \nXingbin Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"5f90cb307f04874f999a193b1a235bc507417ee0a51f87bba0c422c7032e7def","category":"Environment"}
