{"title":"CFD Simulation and Aerodynamic Optimization of Turbomachinery Based on Modified NSGA-II","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1301/v1","date":1726566590000,"content":"A novel approach to optimizing turbomachinery performance is presented in this chapter, which integrates Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, an artificial neural network (ANN) with a modified Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). Using this enhanced algorithm, substantial performance improvements can be achieved through geometric optimization. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated in two case studies: an inducer for a centrifugal pump and a Savonius wind turbine. The inducer is designed to maximize head coefficient, hydraulic efficiency, and net positive suction head by optimizing factors such as inlet and outlet blade angles. The optimization process employs the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) for objective function modeling, followed by Pareto front plotting and TOPSIS for identifying trade-off optimal points. Results indicate significant improvements in head coefficient, hydraulic efficiency, and NPSHR by 14.3%, 0.3%, and 30.2%, respectively. Twist angle, aspect ratio, and overlap ratio are also optimized for wind turbine blades. The power coefficient is enhanced by 5.32%, the torque coefficient by 13.74%, and the rotational speed by 0.071% through multi-objective optimization. As a result of this approach, efficiency improves, and valuable insights into the optimal design principles for turbomachinery components are also gained.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"35d91484a4f49e417981ad0879a79927454a4547ff356630d8f4602c85ec1ae1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
