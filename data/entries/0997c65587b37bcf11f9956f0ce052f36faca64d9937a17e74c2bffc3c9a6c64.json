We conducted a population-based study to elucidate all-cause and cause-specific mortality among men and women with HCV infection.</p> Methods <p>The study population consisted of adult participants from the 1999–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, including 945 HCV-infected and 44,637 non-HCV-infected individuals. HCV infection was defined as either HCV seropositivity or detectable HCV RNA. Participants were followed until the date of death or December 31, 2019, to determine survival status.</p> Results <p>The HCV-infected population, both male and female, tended to be older, more likely to be Black, single, have lower income, lower BMI, higher prevalence of hypertension, and were more likely to be current smokers. During a median follow-up of 125.0 months, a total of 5,309 participants died, including 1,253 deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 1,319 deaths from cancer. The crude analysis showed that the risk of death from all causes and from cancer, but not from CVD, was higher in the HCV-infected population. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that both HCV-infected men (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.10–1.81) and women (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.36–3.02) were equally at increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to their non-HCV infected counterparts (p for interaction &gt; 0.05). The risk of cancer-related mortality was significantly increased in HCV-infected women (HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.01–4.53), but not in men, compared to non-HCV-infected counterparts. Among HCV-infected population, there was no difference in the risks of all-cause, CVD-related, or cancer-related death between men and women.</p> Conclusion <p>Both men and women with HCV infection had an increased risk of death from all causes compared to their non-HCV infected counterparts, but we did not observe a significant sex difference.</p>","author":"Hung-Wei Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0997c65587b37bcf11f9956f0ce052f36faca64d9937a17e74c2bffc3c9a6c64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
