{"title":"Enhancing Medication Adherence in Asthma and COPD: Crafting a Targeted Pharmaceutical Interview Framework","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0324/v1","date":1712239173000,"content":"(1) Background: Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD ) are major global health issues, impacting morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Despite the proven benefits of pharmacist involvement in managing these conditions, their potential in hospitals remains underused. This study aimed to identify patients at high risk of rehospitalisation post-exacerbation of asthma or COPD, to target pharmaceutical interventions. (2) Methods: Data from the University Hospital for January-December 2019 on adult admissions for asthma/COPD were analyzed, focusing on demographics, hospitalization, and clinical outcomes. (3) Results: Among the 140 patients enrolled, a significant majority (91%) underwent adjustments in their treatment regimens during their hospital stay, and nearly 59% faced readmission within six months. A survival analysis highlighted a notable disparity in the rates of rehospitalisation-free survival between patients with asthma and those with COPD, identifying COPD patients as having a higher susceptibility to rehospitalisation. (4) Conclusion: The study found COPD pa-tients at greater risk but didn't specify a priority profile, suggesting the necessity for broad, cus-tomized interventions to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare strain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e5e37430181863ce63782066efe0b2580676c9a356611b4f159aec2e0a2df9b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
