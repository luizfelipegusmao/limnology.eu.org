Participants were assigned to syllable repetition or discrimination tasks and then tested for syllable discrimination in noise. In four experiments, results showed that participants in the repetition group outperformed those in the discrimination group. Syllable repetition can serve as a primer for the motor system, improving accessibility to speech representations to facilitate perception. \n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Considerable debate exists about the interplay between auditory and motor speech systems. Some argue for common neural mechanisms, whereas others assert that there are few shared resources. In four experiments, we tested the hypothesis that priming the speech motor system by repeating syllable pairs aloud improves subsequent syllable discrimination in noise compared with a priming discrimination task involving same–different judgments via button presses. Our results consistently showed that participants who engaged in syllable repetition performed better in syllable discrimination in noise than those who engaged in the priming discrimination task. This gain in accuracy was observed for primed and new syllable pairs, highlighting increased sensitivity to phonological details. The benefits were comparable whether the priming tasks involved auditory or visual presentation. Inserting a 1-h delay between the priming tasks and the syllable-in-noise task, the benefits persisted but were confined to primed syllable pairs. Finally, we demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in older adults. Our findings substantiate the existence of a speech production–perception relationship. They also have clinical relevance as they raise the possibility of production-based interventions to improve speech perception ability. This would be particularly relevant for older adults who often encounter difficulties in perceiving speech in noise.</p>","author":"Maxime Perron, \nQiying Liu, \nPascale Tremblay, \nClaude Alain","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences: Table of Contents","siteHash":"98c7119f6adff358c1cf3a15f5efdc68ead59681d375d3da00900b474221c3c5","entryHash":"72e0e5ced4208002d3f79f7c8421d675285e75cb8791309bf46227d2390e4c0e","category":"Environment"}
