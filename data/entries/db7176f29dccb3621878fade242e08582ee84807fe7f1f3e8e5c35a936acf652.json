{"title":"A Novel Eu3+ Doped Glasses in the MoO3‐WO3‐La2O5‐ B2O3 System: Preparation, Structure and Photoluminescent Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0145/v1","date":1725357319000,"content":"A novel multicomponent glasses with nominal compositions of (50-x)MoO3:xWO3:25La2O3:25B2O3, x = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 mol% doped with 3 mol % Eu2O3 were prepared using a conventional melt quenching method. Their structure, thermal behavior and luminescent properties were investigated by Raman spectroscopy, differential thermal analysis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Physical parameters as density, molar volume, oxygen molar volume and oxygen packing density were determined. Glasses are characterized with high glass transition temperature. Raman analysis revealed that the glass structure is built up mainly from tetrahedral (MoO4)2- and (WO4)2- units providing Raman bands of around 317 cm-1, 341-352 cm-1, 832-820 cm-1 and 928-935 cm-1. At the same time with the replacement of MoO3 with WO3 some fraction of WO6 octahedra are produced, which number increases with the increasing WO3 content. A strong red emission from the 5D0 level of Eu3+ ions was registered under near UV (395 nm) excitation using the 7F0 →5L6 transition of Eu3+. PL emission gradually increases with increasing WO3 content evidencing that WO3 is more appropriate component than MoO3. The integrated ﬂuorescence intensity ratio R (5D0 →7F2/5D0 →7F1) was calculated to estimate the degree of asymmetry around the active ion, suggesting a location of Eu3+ in non-centrosymmetric sites.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db7176f29dccb3621878fade242e08582ee84807fe7f1f3e8e5c35a936acf652","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
