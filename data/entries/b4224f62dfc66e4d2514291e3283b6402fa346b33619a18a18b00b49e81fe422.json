{"title":"From Observer to Agent: On the Unification of Physics and Intelligence Science","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0479/v2","date":1729590595000,"content":"Research shows that observers and agents, as key concepts in physics and intelligence science respectively, exhibit profound intrinsic consistency. Based on this understanding, we propose and construct Theory of Universal Intelligent Evolution, known as Omega Theory, which offers an innovative exploration of Theory of Everything (ToE) from the perspective of intelligence science. Within the framework of Omega Theory, this paper unifies the research subjects and dynamic mechanisms of physics and intelligence science, revealing that the intelligence level of the observer is the fundamental source of the differences among classical mechanics, relativity, and quantum mechanics. Furthermore, this paper proposes that core concepts such as subjectivity and objectivity, determinism and uncertainty, as well as time and space, are inherently related to the intelligent state of agents and Universe.Omega Theory consists of three core models: Standard Agent Model, General Model of Agent Evolution, and Intelligent Universe Evolution Model. Standard Agent Model serves as a foundational axiom, defining the unified structure and functional framework of agents, and it is the cornerstone of the theory. Building upon this, we derive General Model of Agent Evolution and Intelligent Universe Evolution Model. Omega Theory posits that the fundamental units of Universe are agents, and that the entire universe is itself an agent. Matter is a special manifestation of agents, and each agent continuously evolves between the states of absolute zero intelligence and omniscience and omnipotence, driven by two intelligent forces that are derived from the theory.To validate this theory, we have designed a thought experiment in the \"Experimental Universe 1,\" where classical mechanics, relativity, and quantum mechanics experiments can be simultaneously conducted. By adjusting the intelligence level of the observer, we observe that different physical theory scenarios emerge in succession as the observer's intelligence level changes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4224f62dfc66e4d2514291e3283b6402fa346b33619a18a18b00b49e81fe422","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
