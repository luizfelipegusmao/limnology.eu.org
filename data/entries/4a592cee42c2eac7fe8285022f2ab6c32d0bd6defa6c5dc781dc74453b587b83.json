{"title":"High Fat Diet Induces Epigenetic 1-Carbon Metabolism and HFpEF","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1252/v1","date":1726493503000,"content":"The chronic high fat dysbiosis diet (HFD) instigates cardiac remodeling, dysfunction and chronic heart failure (CHF). The therapeutic approaches focusing oxidative stress, inflammation and hyperlipidemia have not yielded significant positive clinical outcomes. Recent studies report that although mitochondrial ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) supports cardiac function, however, decreases more in human HFpEF than HFrEF. Interestingly, the ACLY synthesizes lipids and creates hyperlipidemia. Epigenetically, ACLY acetylates histone. The mechanism(s) are unknown. One hypothesis is that the HFD induces epigenetic folate 1-carbon metabolism (FOCM), heperhomocysteinemia (HHcy, a cause of abrogation of sleep-time dipping in blood pressure and hypertension) and heart failure. Interestingly, the probiotics utilizes the fat/lipids post-biotically, and increases the mitochondrial bioenergetics and attenuates the HFD induced heart failure. We suggest a novel and paradigm-shift epigenetic mitochondrial sulfur transsulfuration pathways that selectively target HFD-induced CHF. The HFD via transport and metabolomic pathways instigates cardiac remodeling and dyfunction. Previous studies from our laboratory, using a single cell analysis, revealed increase in transporter (SLC25A) of s-adenosine-methionine (SAM) during elevated levels of homocysteine (Hcy, i.e., hyperhomocysteinemia, HHcy), a consequence of impaired epigenetic recycling of Hcy back to methionine by increase in FOCM methylation of H3K4, K9, H4K20 and gene writer (DNMT) and decrease in eraser (TET/FTO). The Hcy transported to mitochondria by SLC7A for clearance via sulfur metabolomic transsulfuration by 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (3MST). Interestingly, the HHcy decreases ATP, OCR, H2S, PGC1Î±, TFAM, and increase in fission/fusion ratio, causing mitochondria dysfunction. We suggest that gut dysbiosis by HFD disrupts rhythmic epigenetic memory via FOCM and increase in DNMT1 and creates HHcy, leading to decrease mitochondrial transsulfuration and bioenergetics. The treatment with a probiotic, lactobacillus will eat the fat/lipids post-biotically and bi-directionally will produce folic acid and lactone-ketone body that will mitigate the HFD-induced mitochondrial remodeling and heart failure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a592cee42c2eac7fe8285022f2ab6c32d0bd6defa6c5dc781dc74453b587b83","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
