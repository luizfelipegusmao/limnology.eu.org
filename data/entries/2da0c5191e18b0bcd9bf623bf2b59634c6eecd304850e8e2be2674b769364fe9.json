{"title":"SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Co-Infection: Fair Competition or Sinister Combination?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1316/v1","date":1713506752000,"content":"The COVID-19 pandemic remains a serious public health problem globally. During winter flu seasons, more aggressive SARS-CoV-2 infections with fatalities have been documented, indicating that influenza co-infections may significantly impact the disease outcome of COVID-19. Both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses share many similarities in their transmission and cellular tropism for their replication in the human respiratory tract. However, it is still unclear how the two pathogens interplay to ensure their survival in the same lung microenvironment. In addition, clinical studies on influenza co-infections in COVID-19 patients do not provide conclusive evidence on how influenza co-infection mechanistically modifies the disease outcome in COVID-19. This mini-review discusses various viral as well as host factors that potentially influence the survival or synergism of these two respiratory pathogens in the infected lung microenvironment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2da0c5191e18b0bcd9bf623bf2b59634c6eecd304850e8e2be2674b769364fe9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
