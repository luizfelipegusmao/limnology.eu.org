{"title":"Comprehensive Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Researchâ€“(CCQR): Reporting Guideline for Global Health Qualitative Research Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1690/v1","date":1719230027000,"content":"The requirement for in-depth exploration of complex issues beyond the scope of other research methods in the health industry has increased the demand for qualitative research globally. The authors aimed to improve the accessibility and comprehensiveness of reporting guidelines for qualitative research. A comprehensive review of scientific articles was conducted on PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, and Embase, and it retrieved 1989 plus 13 more articles through the snowball method. After screening, 17 key articles were identified, which led to the development of Comprehensive Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research that comprises 14 categories, offering key elements in an organized table. This novel guideline complements the two widely used guidelines, Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research and Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research, by including additional aspects like objectives, existing knowledge, rationale behind methodologies, conclusions, recommendations, and reference citations. The study responds to the rising need for improved qualitative research reporting guidelines in global health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9c1ca18beef0de4c51dc46393e6ea0e310d2fa4e582a528823387f6c117f60a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
