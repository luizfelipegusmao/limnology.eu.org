{"title":"Non-stationary Transformer Architecture: A Versatile Framework for Recommendation Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0378/v1","date":1715074970000,"content":"Recommendation systems are crucial in navigating the vast digital market. However, user data’s dynamic and non-stationary nature often hinders their efficacy. Traditional models struggle to adapt to the evolving preferences and behaviours inherent in user interaction data, posing a significant challenge for accurate prediction and personalisation. Addressing this, we propose a novel theoretical framework, the Non-stationary Transformer, designed to capture and leverage the temporal dynamics within data effectively. This approach enhances the traditional transformer architecture by introducing mechanisms accounting for non-stationary elements, offering a robust and adaptable solution for recommendation systems. Our experimental analysis, encompassing deep learning and reinforcement learning paradigms, demonstrates the framework’s superiority over benchmark models. The empirical results confirm the efficacy of our proposed framework, which not only provides significant performance enhancements, approximately 8% in Logloss reduction and up to 2% increase in F1 score but also underscores its potential applicability across accumulative reward scenarios. These findings advocate adopting Non-stationary Transformer models to tackle the complexities of today’s recommendation tasks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05b8d1ca7a9078ec6e2b18fe9d36b5d4861ff139b8971546fd291ed170da76a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
