{"title":"Panoramic on Pantalar Intact Dislocation: A Scooping Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0194/v1","date":1727874980000,"content":"This scoping review aims to systematically examine and analyse the available literature on pure total talar dislocation, focusing on its epidemiology, clinical presentation, imaging techniques, surgical options, rehabilitation protocols, and complications. Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The search yielded 185 articles, from which 30 met the inclusion criteria, focusing on pure total talar dislocation without fractures. Data from each study were extracted, including patient demographics, injury characteristics, treatment methods, and outcomes. A total of 30 articles were included in this review after screening and quality assessment by five independent reviewers. The studies included case reports, case series, and reviews. Despite the heterogeneity of available studies, key findings suggested that early reduction, careful wound management, and soft tissue preservation are crucial in minimising complications such as avascular necrosis (AVN), post-traumatic arthritis, and infection. Long-term outcomes varied, and the risk of AVN remained high, particularly in cases with compromised blood supply to the talus. Pure total talar dislocation is a rare and challenging condition with no established management protocol. While talar reimplantation and joint fixation offer promising outcomes in preserving function, the risk of complications, particularly AVN, remains significant. Further research is needed to standardise treatment protocols and improve clinical outcomes for this rare but severe injury.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f572c65531cd3bc29fa77199a42e81dcaf1a1e756c15d484709037d94fbdb23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
