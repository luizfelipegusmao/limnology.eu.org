Despite its crucial importance, little is understood about the onset and progression of radiolysis in beam-sensitive molecular crystals [<a href=\"#ozae044.902-B2\">2</a>]. Since the typical metric used for monitoring the degradation induced by radiolysis is the attenuation of Bragg reflections in electron diffraction patterns [<a href=\"#ozae044.902-B3\">3</a>], the scope of previous analyses [<a href=\"#ozae044.902-B2\">2-6</a>] has mostly been limited to indirect observation via the back focal plane. A simultaneous visualization of the effects of electron beam-induced radiolysis—in both real space and reciprocal space—remains elusive.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"46a6e8a6a038dcd6fd038467653bbfee498282cc9a96a48801e70d699644c91c","category":"Environment"}
