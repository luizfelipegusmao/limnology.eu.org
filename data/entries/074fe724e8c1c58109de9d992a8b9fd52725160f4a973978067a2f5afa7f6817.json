{"title":"Yoga and Swimming – a Symbiotic Approach with Positive Impact on Health and Athletes’ Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1856/v1","date":1721831318000,"content":"Yoga promotes acceptance, compassion, physicality, active postures, mental and emotional awareness, and spiritual benefits. It involves breath techniques, postures, and body locks, maintaining balance and strength. It's based on ethical principles. Beyond simple performance, swimming is a catalyst for overall well-being. Complementarily, yoga serves as an invaluable adjunct for swimmers, enhancing flexibility, strength, and body awareness - a triad essential to aquatic excellence. The confluence of yoga and swimming, particularly through the practice of aqua yoga asanas, presents a new paradigm for both athletes and non-performers alike. Athletes who embrace the harmonious fusion of swimming and yoga unearth the potential for achieving not just athletic mastery but also a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle. This blend provides a route not only to enhance performance in the water but also to elevate the overall quality of life. We examined the feasibility of incorporating yoga and swimming practice into Romanian subjects' lifestyles, designing a factor analysis in SmartPLS software, based on an online survey. The study assesses the participants' knowledge of yoga's theory and philosophy, as well as their perceptions of the swimming practice's benefits for social and health issues. According to our study, Romanian participants practice yoga and swimming as often as possible to reduce stress, improve concentration for work-related tasks, and improve joint elasticity, balance, and muscular tone. Thus, Yoga and swimming are substitutes for other approaches in prevention and therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"074fe724e8c1c58109de9d992a8b9fd52725160f4a973978067a2f5afa7f6817","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
