{"title":"Evaluation of Kinetic and Thermodynamic Parameters of Pyrolysis and Combustion Processes for Bamboo Using Thermogravimetric Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2103/v1","date":1727347813000,"content":"As interest in renewable fuels grows, biomass has gained increasing attention for its potential applications. Understanding the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of biomass pyrolysis and combustion are crucial for optimizing its valorization. In this study, TGA was employed to examine bamboo powder's pyrolysis and combustion behaviors under different temperature ramps in nitrogen and air environments. The TG and DTG curves reveal that bamboo pyrolysis occurs in three distinct stages: drying, devolatilization, and carbonization. Similarly, combustion also proceeds through three stages: drying, devolatilization, and char combustion. Notable differences in the temperature ranges of the key stages were observed between pyrolysis and combustion. Moreover, kinetic parameters were evaluated using the KAS, FWO, and STR model-free approaches. The findings indicate that, the activation energy during the oxidative devolatilization stage of combustion are notably lower compared to those during pyrolysis devolatilization. The disparity in activation energy is even more pronounced in the third stage. Thermodynamic analysis shows that the pyrolysis and combustion of bamboo are endothermic and non-spontaneous. It can be stably converted into value-added energy through pyrolysis or combustion process. This study provides essential data to aid in designing and scaling up the thermochemical conversion processes for bamboo.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e28ce70fe018947d25fbd4d40049a9d3bb5e5432ceb49716d3c43a3c40430e7b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
