{"title":"Research Collaboration in Viral Hepatitis: A Network Analysis of 60,720 Publications over Two Decades","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2041/v1","date":1727334245000,"content":"Aim: This study aims to analyze the structure of the co-authorship network in viral hepatitis research from 2000 to 2023 using data from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection. The objective is to identify key researchers, evaluate the collaborative dynamics, and understand the evolution of scientific contributions in this field. Method: This study utilized network analysis techniques to evaluate 60,720 publications related to viral hepatitis research indexed in the WoS Core Collection between 2000 and 2023. The analysis was conducted using Python (Version 3.10.5) in the PyCharm development environment (Software Version 2022.1.3). The co-authorship networks were assessed using macro-level indicators such as network density (the ratio of actual to possible connections), clustering coefficient (degree of node clustering), number of components (distinct connected subgroups), and average path length (average distance between nodes). Micro-level indicators including degree centrality (importance based on the number of connections), closeness centrality (proximity to other nodes), and betweenness centrality (frequency of a node on the shortest paths between others) were also analyzed.Result: The findings reveal that the viral hepatitis research network is characterized by low network density, indicating sparse overall collaboration. However, the clustering coefficient is high, suggesting strong collaborations within small, cohesive groups. Over the years, researchers such as Stefan Zeuzem, Maria Buti, and Fabien Zoulim have played pivotal roles, serving as central figures in the network. A noticeable increase in network density and clustering from 2020-2023 suggests growing collaboration in recent years.Conclusion: This study underscores the importance of international collaboration in advancing viral hepatitis research. Key researchers have emerged as influential contributors, facilitating global research activities. Network analysis provides valuable insight into the structure of these collaborations and helps identify potential areas for future research and partnerships to combat viral hepatitis globally. The results of this study should be used to reduce global healthcare disparities, promote research collaboration, and address viral hepatitis as a global public health problem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8be742614ca8255964c6669437b072e85c5884f78ef654f5314dec7be24df86f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
