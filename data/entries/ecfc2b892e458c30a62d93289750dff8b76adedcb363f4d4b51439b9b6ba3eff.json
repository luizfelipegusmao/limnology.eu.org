{"title":"Neuromodulation and the Gut-Brain Axis: Therapeutic Mechanisms and Implications for Gastrointestinal and Neurological Disorders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0188/v1","date":1712047218000,"content":"The gut-brain axis (GBA) represents a complex, bidirectional communication network that intri-cately connects the gastrointestinal tract with the central nervous system (CNS). Understanding and intervening in this axis opens a pathway for therapeutic advancements. In light of this, the current review assesses the effectiveness of neuromodulation techniques in treating neurological and gastrointestinal disorders by modulating the GBA, involving key elements such as gut micro-biota, neurotrophic factors, and proinflammatory cytokines. Through a comprehensive literature review encompassing PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, and analyzing 182 relevant articles, this research highlights how neuromodulation can positively impact the management of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), chronic pain, inflammation, and a range of GI disorders like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Despite existing challenges, the ability of neuromodulation to adjust disrupted neural pathways, alleviate pain, and mitigate in-flammation is significant in improving the quality of life for patients, thereby offering exciting prospects for future advancements in patient care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ecfc2b892e458c30a62d93289750dff8b76adedcb363f4d4b51439b9b6ba3eff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
