{"title":"Relationship between Instagram, Body Satisfaction, and Self-Esteem in Early Adulthood","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0420/v1","date":1717739760000,"content":"Our study focused on investigating the impact of Instagram use on body satisfaction and self-esteem among participants aged 20 to 40 years (N = 95) through a cross-sectional survey design in which the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ), and ad hoc designed questions were administered. The results highlight the influence of Instagram on body dissatisfaction (p = .005) but not on self-esteem (p = .211). Gender was not found to be an influential factor (p = .173). However, it was found that greater body satisfaction correlates with higher self-esteem and vice versa (p &lt; .001). Finally, we concluded that the number of hours users in the sample spend on Instagram is related to greater body dissatisfaction but not to lower self-esteem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6fbf985820048e34b08203fb5da9056f2c6ff452cb377de0072516c5b4623306","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
