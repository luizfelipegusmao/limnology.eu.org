{"title":"347 Quantifying phenotypic and genetic variation for cow fertility phenotypes in American Simmentals using total herd reporting data","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/41/7757172?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Inefficiencies in reproduction are the largest drivers of loss in United States beef production. Nearly all reproductive traits are at least modestly heritable, making genetic selection and improvement possible over the long term. Cow-centric reproductive traits present unique challenges, as they are not expressed in male animals and will not be observed until later in the productive life of a female, if at all. This makes cow-centric fertility traits ideal candidates for selection with Expected Progeny Differences (EPDs). We used a commercially generated dataset from the American Simmental Association (ASA) to explore the phenotypic and genetic variation in these traits. The dataset comprised Total Herd Enrollment (THE) records, which required unbiased reporting of enrollment, calving, and disposal for 303,158 females (132,403 cows and 170,755 heifers). Using the THE data, we calculated three continuous and two discrete traits that are indicators of heifer and cow fertility and rebreeding ability. These traits were: 1) calving date (calving date of the cow relative to the start of the calving season), 2) calving interval (days between calves), 3) first calving interval (calving interval observation between the first and second calving record for a female), 4) heifer pregnancy (did the animal calve as 2-yr-old?), and 5) discrete early calving (did animal calve in the first 30 d of the calving season?). We observed a significant difference in calving date in mature cows that calved in the first 30 d of the calving season of their contemporary group as heifers compared with those that calved later (Table 1). Early calving heifers averaged a nearly 10 d sooner calving date throughout their productive lives compared with those that calved after 30 d as heifers (29.9 d vs. 40.2 d, <span>P</span>-value &lt; 0.01). We used a combined pedigree and genomic approach, implemented in GIBBSF90+, to estimate genetic, environmental, and permanent environmental variance components. We estimated heritabilities of 0.24 (± 0.037215) for heifer pregnancy, 0.06 (± 0.009265) for calving date, 0.07 (± 0.015451) for discrete early calving, 0.04 (± 0.003954) for calving interval, and 0.04 (± 0.009604) for first calving interval. We observed positive phenotypic and genetic correlations between these traits, ranging from 0.01 to 0.96 (Table 2). This work provides an extensive population survey of phenotypic trends in reproductive performance and management in a large seedstock population. The heritable nature of the inspected traits motivates further work in understanding their genetic architectures and how they are affected by heterosis in crossbreeding programs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"62d97ed676a992c4d1aeb926be0d3064cece0187958dfb3ca140a3a687444db7","category":"Environment"}
