{"title":"Effect of Usage of Industrial Robots on Quality, Labor Productivity, Exports and Environment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0441/v1","date":1720084558000,"content":"Industrial robots are slowly but surely entering manufacturing companies. This paper explores the effects that robots have on productivity, exports, quality, sustainability and labor in European manufacturing companies. There is lack of research on industrial robot usage and its effects in developed countries. Most research is done on Chinese companies and often the data is outdated. The data in this paper is from the European Manufacturing Survey project conducted in 2022 and includes 476 manufacturing companies. Results of the effects of Industrial robots on Quality, Labor Productivity, Exports and Environmental saving technologies are done by use of T-test between industrial robots’ adopters and non-adopters. However, the effect of higher investment into environmental technology by industrial robots’ adopters was researched by 2-step OLS regression analysis with control variables representing the contextual characteristics of companies. The results show positive effects on all variables. Results show that larger usage of robots are in low to medium-technology-intensity industries, that robots contribute to labor productivity, exports and that companies employing robots usually also employ environmentally saving technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c9995ec914f9734530c797ab0a645867f18c47b48e5f3ed9c6763f12057f6f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
