{"title":"Shoals in troubled waters? The impact of rising temperatures on metabolism, foraging, and shoaling behavior in mixed‐species shoals","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15707?af=R","date":1710227704000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Rising water temperatures across aquatic habitats, in the current global climate change scenario, can directly affect metabolism and food intake in fish species. This can potentially alter their physiological, behavioral, and shoaling properties. In the current study, we examined the effects of high temperatures on metabolism, foraging, and shoaling in tropical fish. Mixed-species (comprising flying barbs, zebrafish, and gambusia) and single-species (flying barbs and zebrafish) shoals were conditioned for 45 days to three kinds of temperature regimes: the current temperature regime (CTR), in which shoals were maintained at water temperature of 24°C (i.e., the current mean temperature of their habitat), the predicted temperature regime (PTR) at 31°C (i.e., simulating conditions projected for their habitat in 2100), and the dynamic temperature regime (DTR), which experienced daily temperature fluctuations between 24 and 31°C (i.e., resembling rapid temperature changes expected in their natural environments). We found species-specific responses to these temperature regimes. Flying barbs exhibited significantly lower body weight at PTR but maintained consistent muscle glycogen content across all temperature regimes. In contrast, zebrafish and gambusia displayed significantly elevated muscle glycogen content at PTR, with similar body weights across all three temperature regimes. Cohesion within flying barb shoals and cohesion/polarization in mixed-species shoals decreased significantly at PTR. Shoals exposed to DTR exhibited intermediate characteristics between those conditioned to CTR and PTR, suggesting that shoals may be less impacted by dynamic temperatures compared to prolonged high temperatures. This study highlights species-specific metabolic responses to temperature changes and their potential implications for larger-scale shoal properties.</p>","author":"Ishani Mukherjee, \nAnuradha Bhat","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"fd74ee8284c8ca4e34cde573cf062cab127eb8833a82191c4311efc6d764180b","category":"Environment"}
