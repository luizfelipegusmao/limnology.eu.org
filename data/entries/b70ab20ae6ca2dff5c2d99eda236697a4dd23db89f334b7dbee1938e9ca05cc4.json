However, accurate urban flood modeling and assessing the associated damages are challenging due to complex urban layouts and rugged topography. Furthermore, the rapid development of urban underground spaces has introduced additional complexities. To address the demanding need for accurate flood modeling and damage assessment in cities, a fine-scale flood damage assessment method was proposed in this study, based on the 1D/2D coupled hydrodynamic model, which can not only assess the flood damage on the ground surface but also evaluate the flood loss in underground spaces. Taking the Gangxi drainage area in Wuhan City, China as a case, this study extensively discussed the flood inundation processes on the ground surface as well as in the buildings and underground spaces, under different rainfall scenarios with the return period ranging from 2 to 200 years. Based on the high spatial-temporal hydrodynamic simulations, the flood damage degrees were evaluated for the buildings and underground spaces with different industry types. The results indicated that the inundation of buildings and underground spaces in densely built cities cannot be neglected in urban flood modeling. Buildings with public service attributes can have a higher flood damage degree, as compared with other types of buildings and underground spaces.</p>","author":"Boliang Dong, \nJunqiang Xia, \nQijie Li, \nXiaojie Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: River: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0b74d58d2572beb2996093d38ec1aeffad4d7646e8152f056f56cbe7cdd98b36","entryHash":"b70ab20ae6ca2dff5c2d99eda236697a4dd23db89f334b7dbee1938e9ca05cc4","category":"Environment"}
