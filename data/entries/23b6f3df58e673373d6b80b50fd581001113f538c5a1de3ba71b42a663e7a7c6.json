{"title":"263 Effects of source of calcium carbonate and microbial phytase on standardized total tract digestibility of calcium by growing pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/158/7664991?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this experiment was to test the hypothesis that there are differences in the standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) of Ca and in response to microbial phytase among sources of calcium carbonate obtained from different regions of the world. Barrows [n = 320; average body weight (BW) = 17.47 kg; SD = 1.28] were allotted to 40 diets using a completely randomized block design with eight blocks of 40 pigs for a total of eight replicate pigs per diet. All diets were based on corn and potato protein concentrate. Twenty sources of calcium carbonate were obtained from different regions of the world, including the United States, Europe, Asia, and South Africa. Each source of calcium carbonate was used in two diets, one diet without microbial phytase and one diet that contained 1,000 phytase units/kg diet. Pigs were housed individually in metabolism crates. Pigs were provided feed at 3.0 times the maintenance requirement for energy. Feces were collected for 4 d following the adaptation period after 5 d of adaptation. Fecal samples were dried, ground, and analyzed for Ca to calculate the digestibility. The initial statistical model included calcium carbonate source, phytase, and the Ca-source × phytase interaction as fixed effects; however, no interactions between Ca source and phytase were observed. Therefore, the final statistical model included only Ca source and phytase as fixed effects. A second analysis was performed to compare the digestibility of Ca in calcium carbonate obtained from different regions of the world (i.e., Europe, Asia, the United States, and South Africa). In this model region, phytase, and the region × phytase interaction were fixed effects. However, no interactions between region and phytase were observed and therefore, the final statistical model included only region and phytase as fixed effects. Concentrations of Ca in the 20 sources of calcium carbonate ranged from 32.1 to 40.9% (Table 1). Differences in the STTD of Ca were observed among pigs fed diets containing different sources of calcium carbonate (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). Pigs fed diets containing 1,000 units of phytase had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) STTD of Ca compared with pigs fed diets containing no phytase. The STTD of Ca in calcium carbonate from the United States was less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) than in calcium carbonate from Europe, Asia, or South Africa. In conclusion, the use of microbial phytase increases the STTD of Ca in calcium carbonate, but the STTD of Ca varies among different sources and among sources from different regions. Therefore, consideration should be given to differences in analyzed concentrations of Ca, values for STTD of Ca, and response to microbial phytase among different sources of Ca carbonate to ensure Ca is not being oversupplied when formulating diets.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"23b6f3df58e673373d6b80b50fd581001113f538c5a1de3ba71b42a663e7a7c6","category":"Environment"}
