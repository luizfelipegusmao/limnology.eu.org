{"title":"Optics Effect on the Observed Image about Sgr A* and Orbits of S-Stars","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2142/v1","date":1721973815000,"content":"Light is dispersive in gravitational field. It results in that, under the condition of strong gravitational field, the observed numbers, size, distance and spectrogram of a celestial object is different from the real ones. Therefore, the observed jets of the Sgr A* and M87 need be understood further with the orbit of the stars around them. And, the observed orbits of the S-stars around the Sgr A* is different from the real ones. It implies that the observed optical images of the distant celestial body with strong gravitational field need be further understood with other observations and physics laws to accurately and precisely know the real physical configuration of it.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6353a6bb742c8ffbb8bea1d5076a5ecb014e8881a2edf52d34cb47334d67822f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
