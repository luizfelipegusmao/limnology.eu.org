Osbeck) promotes the production of active metabolites from its flavonoids during in vitro colonic fermentation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13204?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Recent studies reveal that dietary fiber (DF) might play a critical role in the metabolism and bioactivity of flavonoids by regulating gut microbiota. We previously found that Shatianyu (<i>Citrus grandis</i> L. Osbeck) pulp was rich in flavonoids and DF, and Shatianyu pulp flavonoid extracts (SPFEs) were dominated by melitidin, obviously different from other citrus flavonoids dominated by naringin. The effects of Shatianyu pulp DF (SPDF) on the microbial metabolism and bioactivity of SPFEs is unknown.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>An <i>in vitro</i> colonic fermentation model was used to explore the effects of SPDF on the microbial metabolism and antioxidant activity of SPFEs in the present study. At the beginning of fermentation, SPDF promoted the microbial degradation of SPFEs. After 24 h-fermentation, the supplemented SPFEs were almost all degraded in SPFEs group, and the main metabolites detected were the dehydrogenation, hydroxylation and acetylation products of naringenin, the aglycone of the major SPFEs components. However, when SPFEs fermented with SPDF for 24 h, 60.7% of flavonoid compounds were retained, and SPFEs were mainly transformed to the ring fission metabolites, such as 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, 3-phenylpropionic acid and 3-(3-hydroxy-phenyl) propionic acid. The fermentation metabolites of SPFEs showed stronger antioxidant activity than the original ones, with a further increase in SPDF supplemented group. Furthermore, SPFEs enriched microbiota participating in the deglycosylation and dehydrogenation of flavonoids, while co-supplementation of SPDF and SPFEs witnessed the bloom of <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, contributing to the deglycosylation and ring fission of flavonoids.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>SDPF promote SPFEs to transform to active metabolites probably by regulating gut microbiota. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Mei Deng, \nJiamin Ye, \nRuifen Zhang, \nShuai Zhang, \nLihong Dong, \nFei Huang, \nXuchao Jia, \nDongxiao Su, \nQin Ma, \nDong Zhao, \nMingwei Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"993515de73c21384a1f00b87130d80e497e113c662a701fb9b547e77dc617dc7","category":"Environment"}
