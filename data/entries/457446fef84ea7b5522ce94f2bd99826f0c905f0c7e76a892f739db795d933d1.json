{"title":"Are There Co-variations between Herpes Simplex Virus Status and Oral Risk Habits in a Cohort of Sri Lankan Male Oral Fibroepithelial Polyp Patients?: Findings from a Preliminary Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2070/v1","date":1724893978000,"content":"The relationship between Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and oral risk habits is still uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the connection between oral risk habits and HSV status in a group of male patients from Sri Lanka who have oral fibroepithelial polyps. We collected 25 fibroepithelial polyps from nine oro-maxillofacial units in six provinces of Sri Lanka. Tissue samples were taken from frozen excisional biopsies to avoid contamination and tested for HSV- DNA using a real-time PCR assay. The results showed that HSV-DNA was present in 44% of the samples, with 66.67% being HSV-1 and 33.33% being HSV-2. However, there was no significant correlation between HSV status and oral risk habits such as betel quid chewing, smoking, and alcohol abuse. The study suggests the need for larger case-control studies to determine any significant associations between different types of Herpes Simplex Virus and oral risk habits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"457446fef84ea7b5522ce94f2bd99826f0c905f0c7e76a892f739db795d933d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
