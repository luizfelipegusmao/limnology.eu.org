{"title":"Analysis of the Motion of a Robotic Arm for Fruit Harvesting Using Matlab Software","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1624/v1","date":1726841976000,"content":"This article presents a kinematic analysis of a 4-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm equipped with a 3-finger gripper, specifically designed for harvesting fruits of varying sizes. The kinematic modeling is thoroughly detailed, encompassing the equations of motion, homogeneous transformation matrices, and kinematic solutions required for the efficient operation of the robotic arm. This analysis is crucial for optimizing both the design and programming of agricultural robots, aiming to enhance harvesting efficiency and reduce labor costs. Additionally, an in-depth examination of the 3-finger gripperâ€™s movement is provided, illustrating how MATLAB facilitates the simulation and visualization of its dynamic behavior during the opening and closing processes. The benefits of using MATLAB for this purpose are emphasized, including its ease of implementation, advanced simulation capabilities, and seamless integration with other tools to optimize the performance of robotic systems in agricultural settings. This study makes a valuable contribution to the field of agricultural robotics, offering technical insights that can be applied in the development of sophisticated robotic solutions for the modern agricultural industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"27ba3649bc9644775eebd96daf996849882340de96d8004f3f5063ae8838dd38","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
