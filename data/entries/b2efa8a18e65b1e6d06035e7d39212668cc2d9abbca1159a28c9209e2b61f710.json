Such chemodiversity has emerged, occasionally in a lineage-specific manner, as plants adapted to challenging environmental niches on land (<a href=\"#kiae227-B12\">Wang et al. 2019</a>; <a href=\"#kiae227-B5\">Maeda and Fernie 2021</a>). How has phytochemical diversity evolved? How do plants develop a new biosynthetic pathway for specialized metabolites? These fundamental questions have been studied using genomics, biochemistry, and metabolomics, with the potential for metabolic engineering in synthetic biology platforms (<a href=\"#kiae227-B4\">Maeda 2019</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"b2efa8a18e65b1e6d06035e7d39212668cc2d9abbca1159a28c9209e2b61f710","category":"Environment"}
