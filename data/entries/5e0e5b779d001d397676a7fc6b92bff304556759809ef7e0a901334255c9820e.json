{"title":"Comparative Evaluation of Lipid Profile, C-reactive Protein and Paraoxonase-1 Activity in Dogs with Inflammatory Protein-Losing Enteropathy and Healthy Dogs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1000/v1","date":1726189374000,"content":"Chronic inflammation alters lipoprotein metabolism and causes changes in serum concentrations of lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), and paraoxonase-1 activity (PON-1), an enzyme, which in the gastrointestinal tract may act as a local detoxifier, antioxidant, and immunomodulator. However, unlike in people with inflammatory bowel disease, scarce information is available in dogs with protein-losing enteropathy secondary to chronic inflammatory enteropathy (iPLE). The first aim was to describe and compare the lipid profile, CRP concentrations and PON-1 activity in healthy dogs and in dogs with iPLE. The second aim was to evaluate correlations among clinicopathological, histologic data, and lipid profiles in dogs with iPLE. Serum samples from 51 iPLE and 40 healthy dogs were used to study albumin, total protein, CRP, PON-1 activity, cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein classes obtained by electrophoretic separation. There was a significant difference of all serum analytes between iPLE and healthy dogs. Significant correlations between the lipid profile and the existing chronic enteropathy activity index were not found. Some lipoprotein classes correlated with CRP and PON-1. Triglycerides were significantly higher in dogs with both inflammation and lymphangiectasia. Lipoproteins, CRP and PON-1 activity are altered in dogs with iPLE. Results need to be confirmed in further studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e0e5b779d001d397676a7fc6b92bff304556759809ef7e0a901334255c9820e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
