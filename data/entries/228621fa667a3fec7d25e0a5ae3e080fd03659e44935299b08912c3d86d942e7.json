{"title":"Formulation of a probiotic product using Almond gum","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13301?af=R","date":1712732400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The application of probiotics in food has expanded significantly, yet its viability remains a challenge. In response to this issue, this study explores a unique approach. Almond gum, a natural extract from <i>Prunus dulcis,</i> is utilized as the primary carrier matrix for a novel probiotic product featuring <i>Saccharomyces boulardii</i>, a probiotic yeast.</p>\n<h2>METHODS</h2>\n<p>This study involves the entrapment of <i>S. boulardii</i> in almond gum through centrifugation (5 min at 1300 × <i>g</i>) and subsequent 24 h drying at 50 °C. Sensory evaluation and other investigations were conducted at different pH levels to assess viability and performance.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Post-drying entrapment efficiency was 83.85%, underscoring the benefits of choosing almond gum as a carrier matrix. Promising results were observed from viability testing conducted in gastric juice (pH 1.2) and in simulated intestinal fluid (pH 6.8). Matrix stability was assessed by measuring cfu ml<sup>−1</sup> following 7 days’ storage at different temperatures, complemented by sensory analysis.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Almond gum is a promising carrier matrix for probiotic products. Its high entrapment efficiency and its viability under challenging pH conditions demonstrate its efficacy. It is rich in carbohydrates and serves a dual purpose by acting as a prebiotic source, as confirmed through ultraviolet–visible (UV–visible) analysis. The study underscores the potential of this novel approach, providing insights into responses to viability challenges in probiotic food products. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Padmapriya Rasamani","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"228621fa667a3fec7d25e0a5ae3e080fd03659e44935299b08912c3d86d942e7","category":"Environment"}
