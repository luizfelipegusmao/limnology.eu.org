{"title":"Agrifood Sustainability Transitions in Firms and Industry: A Bibliographic Analysis of Research Themes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1807/v1","date":1716870026000,"content":"There is a growing consensus that the modern food system lies at the centre of the grand challenges facing humanity and requires urgent and profound changes in the way that food is produced, processed, distributed and consumed. This review analyses sustainability transitions within agrifood systems, focusing on the role of firms and industries as defined by the Sustainable Transitions Research Network (STRN). This paper conducts the first systematic literature review using bibliometric analysis to assess the current state of research on this theme. The findings reveal a significant increase in publications related to firms and industries within agrifood sustainability transitions. Furthermore, the current research is geographically concentrated in the European Union. The review identifies four key themes in the literature based on co-occurrence of keywords. These are agriculture, innovation, governance, food systems and agroecology. The review identifies increasing awareness of the role of farmers in driving sustainability transitions at the farm level. Furthermore, there is an increasing awareness of the interrelated characteristics of the agrifood system which acknowledges the need for sustainable innovations to occur at multiple stages of the agrifood system. It also shows that there is growing evidence that innovations can occur through disruptive as well as incremental innovation, and highlights the importance of governance influencing transitions. The literature raises questions about Alternative Food Networks as sustainable innovations, their potential for significant change in the established food system and the validity of their claims to food equity and environmental sustainability. A key theme emerging from the literature is an ecological perspective that identifies the complex biological processes and ecosystems as an integral part of agricultural production. These findings provide a greater understanding of the current literature landscape of agrifood sustainable transitions relating to firms and industries and lay a foundation for future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9aab1bf29fc807aafd40fcac72b6e7434df7b8d5b07b5a7bc076adec4710fedf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
