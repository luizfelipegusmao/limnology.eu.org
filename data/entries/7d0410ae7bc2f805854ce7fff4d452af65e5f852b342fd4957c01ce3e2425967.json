{"title":"Understanding Cerebellar Input Stage through Computational and Plasticity Rules","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0361/v1","date":1715073101000,"content":"A central hypothesis on brain functioning is that plasticity regulates the signals transfer function by modifying the efficacy of synaptic transmission. In the cerebellum, granular layer has been shown to control the gain of signals transmitted through the mossy fiber pathway. Until now, the impact of plasticity on incoming activity patterns was analyzed by combining electrophysiological recordings in acute cerebellar slices and computational modeling, unraveling a broad spectrum of different forms of synaptic plasticity in the granular layer, often along with forms of intrinsic excitability changes. Here, we attempt to provide a brief overview of the most prominent forms of plasticity at excitatory synapses formed by mossy fibers onto principal neurons (granule cells, Golgi cells and unipolar brush cells) in the granular layer. Specifically, we will highlight current understanding of the mechanisms and their functional implications of the synaptic and intrinsic plasticity, providing valuable insights into how inputs are processed and reconfigured at the cerebellar input stage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d0410ae7bc2f805854ce7fff4d452af65e5f852b342fd4957c01ce3e2425967","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
