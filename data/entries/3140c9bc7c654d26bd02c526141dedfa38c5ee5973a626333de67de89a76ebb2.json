{"title":"Unveiling subcellular secrets: A novel sensor to visualize heme distribution in plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/691/7718464?rss=1","date":1721692800000,"content":"<span>Heme is just not a magic ingredient for the “Impossible burger” that gives the burger its meaty flavor but an essential molecule for every biological function in living organisms. It is a vital cofactor and signaling molecule that acts as a circlet of atoms to hold iron like a diamond ring. In contrast to animals, where heme is synthesized in mitochondria, in plants heme synthesis takes place in plastids, followed by its distribution to other cellular compartments (<a href=\"#kiae388-B5\">Wang et al. 2022</a>). Inside cells, heme is usually present as “labile (loosely bound),” “regulatory (signaling),” “free (non-protein bound),” or “heme pool” (<a href=\"#kiae388-B2\">Gallio et al. 2021</a>). Owing to the importance in cellular signaling, several methods, including biochemical and quantitative assays, have been developed to determine the subcellular distribution of heme (<a href=\"#kiae388-B4\">Richter et al. 2019</a>). However, quantification of intracellular heme in plants is more complex due to the intricate purification and excess of tetrapyrrole end-products (<a href=\"#kiae388-B1\">Espinas et al. 2012</a>). Considering the importance of heme in biological processes, effective measurements of heme distribution in living cells are needed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"3140c9bc7c654d26bd02c526141dedfa38c5ee5973a626333de67de89a76ebb2","category":"Environment"}
