{"title":"Retail and Consumer Behavior: Bibliometrics Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202312.0510/v3","date":1714377848000,"content":"This article conducts a bibliometric analysis focusing on the influence of globalization and technology in the academic context. Previous studies have focused on analyzing the relationship between the number of research citations and international collaboration, but no study has explored it in the scope of consumer behavior and retail. Leveraging the Scopus database, the research analyzes a significant corpus of 2,111 documents from 1971 to 2022. The findings reveal a distinct surge in academic output related to the topic of technology, reflecting a growing interest in understanding the interaction between technological factors and consumer behavior. The study also explores trends in international collaboration in publications as well as its impact on citation counts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d40f32e6f3567f1795af700cbe3282d20804eb2d6a2db69be9657ddde5a1988","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
