It attracts a diverse range of visitors, both local and international, while enhancing appreciation for regional culinary traditions. This study employs scenario planning to uncover pivotal factors influencing food tourism in rural Iran. Methodologically, it combines objective-driven, descriptive-analytical approaches with future studies methodologies. Data sourced from literature reviews, field studies, and expert surveys, facilitated by MICMAC and ScenarioWizard software, identified six key drivers: promotional activities, pricing, food quality, infrastructure, government support, and investment. The study forecasts future scenarios based on these drivers, revealing optimistic, stagnant, and crisis condi-tions impacting food tourism development. To achieve favorable outcomes, prioritizing these drivers is essential, ensuring sustainable growth and seizing tourism opportunities in rural Iran. This research contributes by systematically analyzing critical factors driving food tourism using scenario-based insights, essential for sector longevity and prosperity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fcd68414f47aeb1418aea6afd03ad4ced8792e4a08883c6063ceb6f78319d153","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
