{"title":"Untargeted metabolomics‐based identification of bioactive compounds from Mangifera indica L. seed extracts in drug discovery through molecular docking and assessment of their anticancer potential","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13421?af=R","date":1710246926000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p><i>Mangifera indica</i> L. (mango), a medicinal plant rich in biologically active compounds, has potential to be used in disease-preventing and health-promoting products. The present investigation reveals and uncovers bioactive metabolites with remarkable therapeutic efficiency from mango (family: Anacardiaceae) seeds.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Biological activity was determined by antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticancer assays, and metabolite profiling was performed on gas chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOF-MS) and liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) platforms. Validation of active metabolites was carried out by <i>in silico</i> molecular docking (Molinspiration Cheminformatics Server and PASS). Extracted and identified metabolites were screened; 54 compounds associated with various groups were selected for the <i>in silico</i> interaction study.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>Molecular docking revealed lead molecules with a potential binding energy score, efficacy and stable modulation with a selected protein domain. Investigation, directed by <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> analysis, confirms mango seeds as an excellent source of potential metabolites as a therapeutic agent. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Mital Kaneria, \nKalpna Rakholiya, \nKaushal R Bavaliya, \nMohit H Pandya, \nTahir N Sipai, \nSharmishtha A Vadher, \nMargi Patel, \nVirendra Kumar Yadav, \nRaghu Solanki, \nSunita Patel, \nDipak Kumar Sahoo, \nAshish Patel","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"4eaa96619fd3d05bc183a5cada8cc7624ece055f287598e4afadb7b5ba16f2f0","category":"Environment"}
