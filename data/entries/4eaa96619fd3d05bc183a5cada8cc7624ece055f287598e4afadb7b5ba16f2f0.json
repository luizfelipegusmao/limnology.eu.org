(mango), a medicinal plant rich in biologically active compounds have potential to be used in disease-preventing and health-promoting products. The present investigation reveals and uncovers bioactive metabolites with remarkable therapeutic efficiency from mango (Family: Anacardiaceae) seeds.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Biological activity was determined by antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer assays, and metabolite profiling was performed on the gas chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOF-MS) and liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) platforms. Validation of active metabolites was carried out by <i>in silico</i> molecular docking (Molinspiration Cheminformatics Server and PASS). Extracted and identified metabolites were screened; 54 compounds associated with various groups were selected for the <i>in silico</i> interaction study.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Molecular docking revealed lead molecules with a potential binding energy score, its efficacy and stable modulation with a selected protein domain. Investigation, directed by <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> analysis, confirms mango seeds as an excellent source of potential metabolites as a therapeutic agent.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
