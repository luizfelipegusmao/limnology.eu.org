{"title":"Identifying facilitators and barriers to the uptake of medication for opioid use disorder in Washington, DC: A community-engaged concept mapping approach","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306931","date":1721397600000,"content":"<p>by Britta Gullahorn, Irene Kuo, Artius M. Robinson, Johnny Bailey, Jennifer Loken, Tamara Taggart</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Opioid overdose is a major public health challenge. We aimed to understand facilitators and barriers to engagement in medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) among persons with OUD in Washington, DC.</p> Methods <p>We used a cross-sectional mixed-methods concept mapping approach to explore MOUD engagement between 2021–2022. Community members at-large generated 70 unique statements in response to the focus prompt: “What makes medication for opioid use disorder like buprenorphine (also known as Suboxone or Subutex) difficult to start or keep using?” Persons with OUD (n = 23) and service providers (n = 34) sorted and rated these statements by theme and importance. Data were analyzed with multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis, producing thematic cluster maps. Results were validated by our community advisory board.</p> Results <p>Seven themes emerged in response to the focus prompt: availability and accessibility; hopelessness and fear; unmet basic needs; characteristics of treatment programs; understanding and awareness of treatment; personal motivations, attitudes, and beliefs; and easier to use drugs. “Availability and accessibility,” “hopelessness and fear,” and “basic needs not being met” were the top three identified barriers to MOUD among consumers and providers; however, the order of these priorities differed between consumers and providers. There was a notable lack of communication and programming to address misconceptions about MOUD’s efficacy, side effects, and cost. Stigma underscored many of the statements, showcasing its continued presence in clinical and social spaces.</p> Conclusions <p>This study distinguishes itself from other research on MOUD delivery and barriers by centering on community members and their lived experiences. Findings emphasize the need to expand access to treatment, dismantle stigma associated with substance use and MOUD, and address underlying circumstances that contribute to the profound sense of hopelessness and fear among persons with OUD–all of which will require collective action from consumers, providers, and the public.</p>","author":"Britta Gullahorn","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8a36f8b68990167b6ac0b4ad224207891515dee14a71d47a3520874bdc6eaffa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
