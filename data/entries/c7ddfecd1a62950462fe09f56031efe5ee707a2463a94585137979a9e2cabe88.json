{"title":"99 The Effects of β-caryophyllene on butyrate utilization and metabolism in Caco 2 cells","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/265/7757461?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Butyrate is important for regulating energy status and cellular metabolism. Beta-caryophyllene (BCP) is a plant compound which may exert potentially beneficial effects on intestinal epithelial cells, such as barrier integrity and modulation of nutrient utilization. The goal of this preliminary study was to investigate the effects of BCP on butyrate utilization and metabolism in intestinal epithelial cells. Caco 2 cells were used as a model for the intestinal barrier. Cells were seeded in multi-well plates with hanging inserts (n = 4) and grown for 18 d. On d 19, 1 of 4 treatments was added to triplicate wells per plate. Treatments included vehicle control (VC), 40 µM BCP, 2 mM butyrate (BTR), and butyrate plus BCP (BB). Treatments were added to the apical side and incubated for 24 and 48 h. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER; ohms/cm<sup>2</sup>) readings and supernatant samples from both the apical and basolateral sides of the cell layer were taken at each time point, and butyrate and β- hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations measured. Butyrate utilization was calculated as absolute nmol lost. Statistical analyses were performed using lm and emmeans packages of R, with treatment, time and side (of cell layer) as fixed effects. All wells started with the same statistical TEER values on h 0. After 24 and 48 h BCP showed no changes in TEER (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). Compared with VC, the mean TEER for BTR and BB was greater at 24 h (579 vs 878 and 1,008 ± 35, respectively; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). After 48 h, all groups returned to baseline, except BB which had a greater TEER (883 ± 35; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) compared with other treatments. After 24 and 48 h BCP showed no changes for both sides of the cell layer (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). Overall, absolute BHB concentrations increased from 24 to 48 h in all treatments (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Production of BHB in each of the VC and BC groups was less than 15 nmol at each time point. For BB and BTR groups, more nmol BHB was detected on the basolateral side (31.9 and 22.2 ± 1.3) vs apical (14.0 and 10.4 ± 1.3, respectively; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) after 24 h. After 48 h, BHB was also greater on the basolateral side (58.2 and 45.2 ± 1.3 nmol for BB and BUT, respectively) vs apical side (30.2 and 24.0 ± 1.3 nmol; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). When looking at BTR utilization, the BB treatment had greater butyrate disappearance than BTR in 24 h (254 vs 169 ± 12.6 nmol; <span>P</span> = 0.0005) and 48h (707 vs 573 ± 12.6 nmol; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001). BCP may promote the metabolism of butyrate by intestinal epithelial cells. More research is needed to understand the mechanism of how BCP increases cellular butyrate utilization.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"c7ddfecd1a62950462fe09f56031efe5ee707a2463a94585137979a9e2cabe88","category":"Environment"}
