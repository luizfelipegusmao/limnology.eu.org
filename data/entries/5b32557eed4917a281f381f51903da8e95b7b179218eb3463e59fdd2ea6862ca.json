{"title":"Identification and Characterization of Human Breast Milk and Infant Fecal Culturable Lactic Acid Bacteria Isolated in Bulgaria: A Pilot Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0196/v1","date":1722596067000,"content":"During the last few decades, the main focus of numerus studies has been on the human breast milk microbiota and its influence on the infant intestinal microbiota and overall health. The presence of lactic acid bacteria in breast milk affects both the quantitative and qualitative composition of the infant gut microbiota. The aim of this study was to assess the dominant cultivable rod-shaped lactic acid bacteria, specific for breast milk of healthy Bulgarian women and fecal samples of their infants over the first month of life, in 14 mother-infant tandem pairs. Additionally, we evaluated strain diversity among the dominant newly isolated species. 68 gram-positive and catalase negative strains were subjected to identification by using MALDI-TOF technique. Predominant culturable populations belonging to the rod-shaped lactic acid bacteria have been identified as Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Limosilactobacillus fermentum, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei and Limosilactobacillus reuteri. Also, we confirmed the presence of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus gasseri. 27 isolates were selected as representatives and analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing for strain identity confirmation and a phylogenetic tree based on 16S rDNA gene sequence was constructed. Comparative analysis by four RAPD primers revealed genetic differences between newly isolated L. rhamnosus strains. This pilot study provides data for the current first report concerning investigation on characteristic microbiota of human breast milk and infant feces in Bulgaria.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b32557eed4917a281f381f51903da8e95b7b179218eb3463e59fdd2ea6862ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
