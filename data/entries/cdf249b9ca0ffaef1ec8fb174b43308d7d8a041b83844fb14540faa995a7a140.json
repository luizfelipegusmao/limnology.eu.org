Supplier disruptions can cause financial damages, inefficiencies, and reduced competitive edge, highlighting the need for robust supplier risk management. This paper scrutinizes recent studies on supplier risk management spanning 2020 to 2023. This review examines supplier risk management, focusing on supplier evaluation, payment terms, contract duration, and buyer-supplier collaboration as critical factors influencing risk mitigation and control in the procurement of goods and services. Through a systematic literature review, the study identifies the multifaceted nature of supplier risks, including production delays, quality issues, and financial challenges. It underscores the importance of proactive risk identification, comprehensive supplier evaluation, strategic payment terms, appropriate contract durations, and robust buyer-supplier collaboration. Despite the benefits, challenges remain, such as understanding regulatory impacts and ensuring methodological consistency. This review contributes to the discourse on supplier risk management, offering insights for future research and practical applications to enhance resilience and operational efficiency in global supply chains. Based on the findings, future studies should concentrate on formulating holistic supplier risks management approaches that nurture buyer-supplier collaboration and harness innovative technologies to enhance risk management practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cdf249b9ca0ffaef1ec8fb174b43308d7d8a041b83844fb14540faa995a7a140","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
