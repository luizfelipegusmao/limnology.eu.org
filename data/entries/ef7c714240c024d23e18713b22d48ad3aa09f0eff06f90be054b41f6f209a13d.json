There is less evidence of the extent to which such strips can reduce pest damage in orchards.\n\nHere we examined the effect of managed, perennial flower margins on fruit damage by an economically significant crop pest, <i>Dysaphis plantaginea</i>, rosy apple aphid, in conventional apple orchards over 2 years, compared to orchards without flower margins.\n\nWe found orchard flower margins reduced the percentage of apple trees with fruit damage by <i>D. plantaginea</i>, from 80% to 48%. In 2021, a period of severe infestation (65% of trees had fruit damage), there was reduced spread of <i>D. plantaginea</i> on infested apple trees and the number of trees with fruit damage was significantly reduced up to 50 m into orchards. During 2022, a period of lower infestation (25% of trees damaged), fruit damage was significantly reduced up to 10 m from the flower margin.\n\nA significant reduction in predation of aphids from bait cards in flower margin compared with control orchards suggests specialists, rather than generalist predators, may be driving the positive effects of the margin on pest pressure. There was no significant effect of flower margins on abundance of important aphid predators, including Syrphidae (hoverflies) and Coccinellidae (ladybirds).\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>: To our knowledge, this study is the first to detect a reduction in fruit damage by pests at harvest in orchards with a flower margin. We highlight the potential for established perennial flower margins to deliver measurable, sustainable, <i>D. plantaginea</i> control benefits and provide insights into the optimal spatial arrangement of flower strips in orchards.\n</p>","author":"Charlotte Howard, \nMichelle T.
