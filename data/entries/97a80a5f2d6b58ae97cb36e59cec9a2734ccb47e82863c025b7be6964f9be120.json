{"title":"Bethe&rsquo;s Wave-Function Revisited","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0124/v1","date":1712020080000,"content":"The scattering eigenstates of any Hamiltonian of electrons, coupled through a two-body force and moving on a one-dimensional lattice, are shown to be Bethe's wave-functions. The energy of the groundstate is compared with values, obtained previously for the Hubbard Hamiltonian by means of Bethe's wave-function and within the framework of the correlated Fermi gas. The same analysis is applied to electrons, interacting on neighbouring sites. The significance of those various groundstates is assessed with help of thermodynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97a80a5f2d6b58ae97cb36e59cec9a2734ccb47e82863c025b7be6964f9be120","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
