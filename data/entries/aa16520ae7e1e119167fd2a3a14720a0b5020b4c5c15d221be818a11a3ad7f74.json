{"title":"Relationship between Semantic Memory and Social Cognition in Schizophrenia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1999/v1","date":1717049647000,"content":"This study examines the relationship between semantic memory and social cognition in schizophrenia, addressing how these cognitive domains intersect. Semantic memory, which includes general world knowledge and word meanings, was evaluated using verbal fluency tasks and the Camels and Cactus Test. Social cognition, essential for social interaction, was assessed through emotion recognition (Faces Test) and Theory of Mind (Hinting Task). Participants included 50 individuals with schizophrenia and 30 controls. The schizophrenia group showed significantly lower performance on both semantic memory and social cognition tasks. Notably, strong correlations were found between the Camels and Cactus Test and social cognition measures, suggesting that social cognition deficits in schizophrenia may be linked to semantic memory impairments. Regression analyses highlighted that the Camels and Cactus Test significantly predicted social cognition performance, independent of symptomatology. These findings underscore the interconnectedness of semantic memory and social cognition in schizophrenia, suggesting that semantic memory deficits, particularly in non-categorical associations, play a important role in social cognitive impairments. This study provides new insights into the cognitive underpinnings of schizophrenia, emphasizing the need for further research to explore these relationships and their implications for cognitive models and therapeutic interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa16520ae7e1e119167fd2a3a14720a0b5020b4c5c15d221be818a11a3ad7f74","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
