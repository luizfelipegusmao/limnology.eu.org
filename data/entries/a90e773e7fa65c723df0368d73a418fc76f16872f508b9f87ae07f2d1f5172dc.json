The identification of sex-related markers and candidate genes holds significance for the sex-controlled breeding of <i>P. sinensis</i>. In this study, through an integration of whole-genome resequencing and Sanger sequencing, 21 female-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Based on these SNPs, the rapid and cost-effective molecular methodologies for genetic sex identification in <i>P. sinensis</i> were established. Of note, 19 validated SNPs are located within the zinc and ring finger 3 (<i>ZNRF3</i>) gene, which has been reported to be testis-determining in mammals. Cloning of the <i>ZNRF3</i> gene from <i>P. sinensis</i> (<i>PsZNRF3</i>) and analysis of its expression profile in tissues and in response to sex steroid hormone treatment demonstrated exhibiting a female-biased expression pattern. These findings not only provide molecular markers for sex-controlled breeding in <i>P. sinensis</i> but also open up a solid basis for revealing the sex-determination mechanism of this species.</p>","author":"Dan Zeng, \nMengying Chen, \nJiawei Zeng, \nYangyang Tu, \nYucheng Zhang, \nMeiling Tan, \nXiaoqing Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"a90e773e7fa65c723df0368d73a418fc76f16872f508b9f87ae07f2d1f5172dc","category":"Environment"}
