{"title":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Biomarkers of Muscle","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0444/v1","date":1722941360000,"content":"This review is focused on the current status of quantitative MR (qMR) of skeletal muscle. The first section covers the techniques of qMR in muscle with the focus on each quantitative parameter, the corresponding imaging sequence, discussion of the relation of the measured parameter to underlying physiology/ pathophysiology, the image processing and analysis approaches, and studies on normal subjects. We cover the more established parametric mapping from T1 weighted imaging for morphometrics including image segmentation, proton density fat fraction, T2 mapping, diffusion tensor imaging to emerging qMR features such as magnetization transfer including ultralow TE imaging for macromolecular fraction, and strain mapping. The second section is a summary of current clinical applications of qMR of muscle; the intent is to demonstrate the utility qMR in different disease states of the muscle rather than a complete comprehensive survey.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"445fd3794bde2fefc7463a798b60ca2f2f9578fb055762091ca98fcd0c14365b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
