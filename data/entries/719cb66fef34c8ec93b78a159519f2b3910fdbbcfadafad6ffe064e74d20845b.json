{"title":"Evaluating the Role of Organizational and Management Factors in Enhancing the Performance of Sidama Bunna Football Club","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0514/v1","date":1728312224000,"content":"This study aimed to assess the contribution of organizational and management factors to the performance of Sidama Bunna Football Club. For this study, a cross-sectional survey design was adopted. The study's target population were Sidama Bunna football club players, coaches and club managers (n=44) selected using a comprehensive sampling technique. Key informant interviews and questionnaires were used as instruments. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient and multiple regression were used to analyze the data at the 0.05 significant level. The result shows that there was a strong positive significant relationship between club performance and human resource (r=0.774**, p&amp;lt;0.01), materials resources (r= 0.697**, p&amp;lt;0.01), finance (r= 0.765**, p&amp;lt;0.001), strategic factors (r= 0.788**, p&amp;lt;0.001), communication (r= 0.779**, p&amp;lt;0.001), whereas there were no significant relationships between club performance and club structure (r=0.263, p&amp;gt;0.05). The findings also confirmed that The R Square value of 0.794 indicates that 79.4% of the variance in club performance is explained by these factors, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive approach that considers multiple dimensions. The Adjusted R Square of 0.760 further supports the model's robustness. The ANOVA results (F (6, 37) = 23.745, p &amp;lt; 0.001) confirm the significant influence of these variables on club performance. In this combined model, Strategic Factors (B = 0.360, p = 0.002) and Finance (B = 0.196, p = 0.054) remain significant, reinforcing their critical roles. However, communication, structure, human resources, and materials resources are not statistically significant in this combined model, indicating that their influence may be overshadowed by the more dominant factors of strategic planning and finance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"719cb66fef34c8ec93b78a159519f2b3910fdbbcfadafad6ffe064e74d20845b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
