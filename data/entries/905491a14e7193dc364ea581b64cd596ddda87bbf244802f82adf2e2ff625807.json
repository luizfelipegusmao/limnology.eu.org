{"title":"Exploring the eco-friendly potential of Moringa oleifera parts as biosorbents for atrazine removal","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13762-024-05462-6","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The ecosystem and humans have been exposed to many types of pesticides, including atrazine. However, few studies evaluated the different parts of <em>Moringa</em> <em>oleifera</em> (<em>Moringa</em>) plant for the removal of pesticides. Thus, this work aimed to study the physicalâ€“chemical characteristics of <em>Moringa</em> as an environmentally friendly biosorbent to remove atrazine in contaminated water. For this, three parts of <em>Moringa</em>, seed pulp (seed), seed husks (husk) and pod husks (pod), were characterized by chemical analysis to obtain in-depth discussions about their composition, thermal stability, morphology and structure. Atrazine biosorption from synthetic water was evaluated using seed, husk and pod separately. Results showed that the different parts of <em>Moringa</em> presented similar composition, but seeds presented higher content of proteins and fatty acids and lower amount of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin than husks and pods. Maximum atrazine removal obtained was 85%, 73% and 60% for husk, seed and pods, respectively. The simple preparation and the adsorption atrazine results indicate that <em>Moringa</em> is a promising eco-friendly lignocellulosic and low-cost material for the removal of organic pollutants.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"905491a14e7193dc364ea581b64cd596ddda87bbf244802f82adf2e2ff625807","category":"Environment"}
