{"title":"Non-Coding RNAs as Potential Diagnostic/Prognostic Markers for Hepatocellular Carcinoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0397/v1","date":1728293721000,"content":"The increasing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) together with the poor effectiveness of the available therapeutic treatments, make an early diagnosis and an effective screening of utmost relevance. Liquid biopsy represents a potential novel approach for early HCC detection and monitoring. The identification of blood markers has many desirable features among which the absence of any significant risk for the patients, the possibility to be used as screening tool and to perform multiple tests thus allowing a real-time monitoring of HCC evolution. Unfortunately, the available blood markers of HCC have several limitations mostly related to specificity and sensitivity. In this context, the employment of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) may represent an interesting and novel diagnostic approach. ncRNAs which includes among others, micro interfering RNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), regulate human gene expression via the interaction with their target mRNA. Notably, their expression can be altered in HCC thus reflecting the diseased status. In this review, we discuss some noticeable works, which describe the use of miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNA as HCC biomarkers. Despite some open aspects related to ncRNA use, the presented works strongly support the potential effectiveness of these molecules as diagnostic/prognostic markers for HCC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7cda9d313ff1f786b40963d41840b1f51bea0b523fd579f22ed2ec40ee2aea31","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
