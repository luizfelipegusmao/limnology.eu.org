{"title":"The implementation of a new measles vaccine mandate in Germany: A qualitative study in local health departments","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306003","date":1719324000000,"content":"<p>by Sophia Werdin, Julia Neufeind</p>\r\nBackground <p>Measles is a highly contagious disease with the potential for severe complications. Despite the availability of effective vaccines, there have been recurrent measles outbreaks in Germany over the past decades. In response, a new measles vaccine mandate was introduced on March 1, 2020, aimed at closing vaccination gaps in high-risk populations. This study evaluates the mandate’s implementation, identifies operational challenges, assesses the impact of the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and investigates expert attitudes towards the new policy.</p> Methods <p>Semi-structured expert interviews were conducted with staff members of 16 different local health departments in Germany. The interviews, carried out in April and May 2021, were electronically recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the Framework method.</p> Results <p>The implementation of the measles vaccine mandate in local health departments varied substantially. Challenges in implementing the mandate primarily arose from uncertainties regarding procedural specifics, such as handling fraudulent medical certificates and imposing sanctions, leading to a call from many interviewees for uniform guidelines to ensure coherent implementation. At the time the measles vaccine mandate came into force, managing the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic was a priority in most local health departments, often delaying the implementation of the mandate. Despite the difficulties encountered, most experts considered the mandate to be an effective step towards measles elimination.</p> Conclusions <p>The measles vaccine mandate has imposed a new responsibility on staff in German local health departments, which is associated with implementation challenges such as procedural uncertainties and vaccine hesitancy, but also the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic as a contextual impediment. Significant differences in the implementation approach underscore the need for harmonization to enhance implementation efficiency and public acceptance of the mandate. Despite the mandate’s potential to increase vaccination rates, our findings advocate for a comprehensive approach, incorporating public education, accessible vaccination, and measures to address social disparities.</p>","author":"Sophia Werdin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a6f823d67875125a999b6f320331d0b76ec598a76e7544c4f1b959e8f01e8016","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
