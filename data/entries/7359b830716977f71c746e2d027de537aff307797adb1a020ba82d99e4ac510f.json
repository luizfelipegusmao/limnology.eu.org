{"title":"Based on the Concept of Absolute Airspace Reference system A Further Discussion on the Physical Principle of the Time-Shift Effect of Special Relativity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0529/v1","date":1715304921000,"content":"The paper suggests that the physical priciple of special relativity's space-time transformation effect is wrong, Uniform linear motion without acceleration does not exist objectively, nor does its same reference frames. Therefore, it is inferred that the space-time transformation effect of special relativity is caused by the acceleration of moving objects, special relativity is only a part of general relativity, not a theoretical system that exists independently from general relativity. The corresponding mathematical demonstration and calculation verification are carried out, and the result proves that the inference of the paper is correct. At the same time, it further explains that the concept of absolute airspace is correct. Special relativity has serious errors in the concept of space, the principle of relativity and the physical principle of space-time transformation effect. Therefore, it is necessary to make a series of revisions to the theory of relativity and to reinterpret some related physical problems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7359b830716977f71c746e2d027de537aff307797adb1a020ba82d99e4ac510f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
