{"title":"Peptide Functionalization of Emulsion-Based Nanocarrier towards Blood Brain Barrier","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1667/v1","date":1721627413000,"content":"New strategies for enhancing drug delivery to the bloodâ€“brain barrier (BBB) represents a major challenge in treating cerebral diseases. Nano-emulsion based nanocarriers represent an ideal candidate to improve drug delivery thanks to their versatility in functionalization and cargo protection. In this work, a paclitaxel loaded nano-emulsion has been firstly functionalized and stabilized with two layers constituted of chitosan and hyaluronic acid, and, secondly, the latter has been conjugated to the CRT peptide. CRT is a bioactive peptide that selectively recognizes bEnd.3 cells, model of the BBB, thanks to its interactions with transferrin (Tf) and its receptor (TfR). \nCytotoxic results showed a higher uptake of CRT functionalized nano-emulsion 41.5 % more than the negative control, demonstrating the ability of this novel tool to be accumulated on the brain endothelium tissue. Thanks to these results, our approach can be fully generalizable to the design of multifunctional nanocarriers for delivery of therapeutic agents to the central nervous systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0303e0e6f75486ab091f9ada4f22060405bf63637c9698b4593668c1d07c1002","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
