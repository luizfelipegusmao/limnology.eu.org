{"title":"Depression in the Elderly Population: A More Serious Problem Than Perceived and Its Impact on Geriatric Rehabilitation Outcomes â€“ A Study from Switzerland","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2140/v1","date":1727360006000,"content":"Background: Depression is a common disorder in older people. It affects their physical recovery and general well-being, leading to longer hospital stays and higher healthcare costs. Under-standing the prevalence of depression and its impact on functional outcomes in the population is crucial for improving strategies and patient care. This study aims to determine the prevalence of depression in elderly patients in geriatric rehabilitation and assess its impact on their functional abilities during the rehabilitation process; Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Lucerne Cantonal Hospital Wolhusen, Switzerland, between 2015 and 2020, involving 1,159 patients aged 65 years and older. Depression was assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) Short Form, while functional abilities were measured using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and the Tinetti test. The data was analyzed using TIBCO Statistica 13.3, with sta-tistical significance set at p &lt; 0.05; Results: The study found that 25.4% of participants had depressive symptoms, with higher rates in women (27.8%) than in men (21.2%). Based on FIM and Tinetti scores, these patients had lower functional abilities at admission and discharge. However, all patients, regardless of depression status, showed significant improvements in functional scores during rehabilitation; Conclusions: Depression is proving to be a problem in older people par-ticipating in geriatric rehabilitation that significantly impairs their functional progress. These findings underline the importance of recognizing and treating depressive symptoms to increase the effectiveness of rehabilitation and improve the well-being of older patients. Integrating mental health support into geriatric rehabilitation programs is critical to optimizing patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ea4fc11d6347f02c383311d5e5eb0e1615785d256fcb278969dcd4e3515694b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
