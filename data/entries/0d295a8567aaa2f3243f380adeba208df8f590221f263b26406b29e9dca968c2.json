While most of the products are no longer produced domestically, the release of asbestos fibers from these and other non-anthropogenic sources into the environment presents persistent public health concerns. To that end, several electron microscopy (EM) test protocols have been developed to identify asbestos in environmental and ambient air samples [<a href=\"#ozae044.318-B1\">1-3</a>]. Fiber identification by EM involves the determination of fiber morphology by imaging, elemental composition by energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and crystal structure by electron diffraction. When the test protocols were developed, scanning EMs (SEMs) and transmission EMs (TEMs) were both available, but SEMs were unable to provide crystallographic information from individual fibers. For this and other reasons, TEMs were considered mandatory to demonstrate the presence of asbestos and more importantly to differentiate asbestos fibers from other fibrous materials using selected area electron diffraction. Since then, numerous transmission electron imaging and diffraction methods have been implemented in SEMs [<a href=\"#ozae044.318-B4\">4-7</a>], effectively opening the door to using SEMs for tasks that were previously reserved exclusively for TEMs. In this contribution, we demonstrate how some of those SEM methods can be used to easily obtain electron diffraction patterns (DPs) from asbestos fibers as well as different ways to visualize fibers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0d295a8567aaa2f3243f380adeba208df8f590221f263b26406b29e9dca968c2","category":"Environment"}
