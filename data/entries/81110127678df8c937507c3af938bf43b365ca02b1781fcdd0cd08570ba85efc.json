{"title":"Association between metabolic score for insulin resistance and regression to normoglycemia from prediabetes in Chinese adults: A retrospective cohort study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308343","date":1723039200000,"content":"<p>by Xue-Hui Liu, Qiang Xu, Lei Zhang, Hong-Jun Liu</p>\r\nBackground <p>Metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR) is a surrogate index to estimate insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to examine the association between METS-IR and regression to normoglycemia in Chinese adults with prediabetes.</p> Methods <p>A total of 15,415 Chinese adults with prediabetes defined by their fasting blood glucose were included in this retrospective study. The association between METS-IR and regression to normoglycemia from prediabetes was evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. A Cox proportional hazards regression with cubic spline function was performed to explore the nonlinear association between METS-IR and regression to normoglycemia. Kaplan-Meier curves was used to describe the probability of regression to normoglycemia from prediabetes.</p> Results <p>In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, the increase in METS-IR was independently associated with a reduced probability of regression to normoglycemia from prediabetes (all p &lt; 0.01 in models 1–3). A nonlinear association between METS-IR and the probability of regression to normoglycemia was observed, with an inflection point of 49.3. The hazard ratio on the left side of the inflection point was 0.965 (95% CI 0.953–0.976). Subgroup analyses demonstrated the robustness of our findings.</p> Conclusion <p>This study demonstrated a negative and nonlinear association between METS-IR and regression to normoglycemia in Chinese adults with prediabetes. When METS-IR is below 49.3, reducing METS-IR could significantly increase the probability of regression to normoglycemia from prediabetes.</p>","author":"Xue-Hui Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"81110127678df8c937507c3af938bf43b365ca02b1781fcdd0cd08570ba85efc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
