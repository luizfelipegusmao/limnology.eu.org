Adoption by microscopy core facilities enables labs with many research scopes the ability to answer ultrastructural morphological questions of their chosen organism or field of study by generating volume EM datasets. Successful SBF-SEM datasets of a given sample are highly dependent on preparation, mounting and selected imaging parameters. Given the difficult nature of biological samples, the volume EM field has focused on the exploration of proper sample preservation methods in order to optimize contrast and conductivity. While there are many successful publications that utilize SBF-SEM with sufficient methodologies in sample preparation, there are few sources that discuss the details of sample mounting or dataset imaging parameters. We will use several successful projects as examples to discuss our strategies for sample mounting and imaging of serial block face-SEM imaging. The goal is to impart theory and strategies to ensure sample cutting stability while mitigating electron charge accumulation; both of which influence signal contrast and the minimum achievable voxel size of a sample volume.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"32ef5c0b94cc0f9e054160c2351fb7d53fdfd93682a66838ea534e93124b2cc8","category":"Environment"}
