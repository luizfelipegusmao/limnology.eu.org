Consequently, U.S. production nutritionists have begun exploring the incorporation of fiber into their nutrition programs. However, incorporating fiber into diets is not without challenges. Analytical capabilities for assessing fiber content have improved, yet accessing accurate data remains a hurdle. Furthermore, the cost of analysis limits the ability of nutritionists to utilize these advanced methods for ingredient analysis. The lack of information around fiber requirements in the diet may be due to the insufficient methodology that has historically been available to measure the indigestible fraction of the diet. In the nursery phase, research findings on the effects of fiber have been mixed, likely influenced by the health status of the animals. Short-term growth performance trials may not fully capture the benefits of fiber, and more comprehensive, long-term studies focusing on health-related parameters are lacking. Similarly, research on sow nutrition faces challenges due to the limitations of barn structures and feed lines. Sow trials typically involve only a small number of treatments, often requiring before- and after- assessments. Moreover, the benefits of fiber are more apparent in later reproductive cycles, necessitating prolonged research efforts. Given the limited phases in sow diets, primarily lactation and gestation, conducting sow research is both challenging and costly. Evidence from European literature and recent U.S. studies suggests that the total dietary fiber and the level of soluble, fermentable fiber have a crucial role in swine diets, particularly for sows and piglets. However, the availability and affordability of such fiber types in the U.S. are limited. The majority of fiber-rich ingredients in the U.S. consist mostly of insoluble fiber. To address this limitation, technological advancements will be needed to transform available fiber sources into the desired fiber constructs, rather than relying solely on fiber-rich ingredients. A stimbiotic, which encourages fiber fermentation, may be key to achieving the desired fiber profile. The addition of a stimbiotic has been shown to increase the digestibility of fiber. It also increases the capacity of the beneficial microbiome to break down and ferment fiber, which leads to an increase in the production of volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic and butyric). In conclusion, U.S. swine nutritionist must explore alternative dietary strategies to capturing the ideal fiber composition.Key word: fiber, nursery, sow</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"f6cb44d46dcc1b9cc65953ead293babe6ea4f8e4accfab4a3a466af5226718b9","category":"Environment"}
