{"title":"Advances in the Ecological Restoration of Landscapes with Diverse Mycorrhizae","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1470/v1","date":1726737426000,"content":"Several degraded ecosystems worldwide need to attain a stable vegetal cover after mandatory active restoration; thus, plants soil, and soil biodiverse microbes can be taken into consideration for a successful mission. Among environmental and biological variables, interactions with soil and its microorganisms are critical for permanent plant establishment. Thus, advances in the use of microbial management such as inoculation of mycorrhizas and bacteria become a modern aspect of active restoration programs. New strengths have increased worldwide since most plant species, including grasses, associate to mycorrhizae, Thus, a high percent of restored areas, which were degraded due to the increasing mining or conventional agriculture, rest to be monitored.  This study shows current reports on active restoration of degraded landscapes as well as the methodology required for a successful ecosystem restoration. Active restoration has been recognized as the best method to restore tropical forests; however, the higher cost of active restoration, which requires planting seedlings, direct seeding, root inoculation of microorganisms or mitigation of disturbances, which aid the recovery process despite monitoring. On the other hand, the spontaneous recovery of trees that colonize and establish in abandoned fields or natural disturbances, named natural regeneration, is less targeted and can require more time to achieve results. We conducted a web of science search of recent published articles on restoration and analyzed them. We confirmed the important role of AMF on root colonization and soil AMF spores as drivers of restoration of main ecosystems according to previous results from restored sites in Brazil. In the restored sites AMF (more than 8 species) was generally found, while in preserved sites dominated Gigaspora, Scutellospora and Acaulospora, restored sites presented relevant AMF richness as well as the preserved sites. Root colonization by AMF in experimental mined sites was high. Vesicles were frequent in restored sites.; however, colonization intensity was generally the same despite treatments. In general, in the control treatments, values of root colonization remain high.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e99efb3e7aae1424d0e4e39f2ef1ee5f0ba582f489322ec691e88fe5e9cf55a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
