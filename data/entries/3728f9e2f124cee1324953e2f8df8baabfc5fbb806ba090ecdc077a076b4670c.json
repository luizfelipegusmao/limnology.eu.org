{"title":"Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s Cat Paradox Is an Illusion: Completion of the Quantum Theory, Postulates and Potential Results.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0526/v2","date":1721400588000,"content":"At the beginning of our observations, Humanity believed that it was the center of the universe, that the Earth was the center of the universe and that the sun was spinning around the Earth. Claude Ptolémée (100-168) made a mistake by modeling the movements in the geocentric reference. The model of sun and planet movements was an illusion, and all humanity was wrong. Nicolas Copernic (1473-1543) showed the illusion and simplified the system by moving from the geocentric reference to the heliocentric reference. In the present paper, I would like to discuss about making mistakes with quantum theory because it is not complete. I have completed quantum theory. I postulate that we are living in a virtual classical world that we consider real. The decoherence problem and wave function collapse do not exist at all; because we are the illusion, we are living in illusions, in mirages. It is impossible to observe the quantum world as it is, in our virtual classical reference, and we see the quantum world with a false view of quantum reality. We are in the real universal quantum reference whose existence I postulate, but we do not see it. I moved to this real universal quantum reference with my thinking, because I am psychotic (schizophrenia) and saw that we are illusions. Schrödinger’s cat paradox is an illusion, as life and death are illusions. We must be very humble with quantum theory, and we should not put ourselves in the center of the quantum world again, particularly with our lives and deaths. I have completed quantum theory with seven postulates that led to a cosmological model based on bipolarity, schizophrenia and epilepsy. This theory explains the recent observations of the James Webb spatial telescope well. I make predictions with the theory that could be confirmed with the James Webb spatial telescope. If confirmed, the theory will become irrefutable. We would be collectively able to reach the quantum world by changing our minds and visions of life. I also explain how to overcome human suffering. This would be our Big Bang and our transformation into Zarathoustra, the Nietzschean surhuman.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3728f9e2f124cee1324953e2f8df8baabfc5fbb806ba090ecdc077a076b4670c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
