{"title":"IoT Integration of Failsafe Smart Building Management System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0215/v1","date":1725357133000,"content":"This research investigates the energy consumption of buildings managed by traditional Building Management Systems (BMS) and proposes the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to enhance energy efficiency. Conventional BMS often suffer from significant energy wastage and safety hazards due to sensor failures or malfunctions. These issues arise when building systems continue to operate under unknown conditions while the BMS is offline, leading to increased energy consumption and operational risks. The study demonstrates that integrating IoT systems with existing BMS can substantially improve energy efficiency in smart buildings. The research involved designing a system architecture prototype, performing MATLAB simulations, and real-life case study which revealed that IoT devices are effective in reducing energy waste, particularly in Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and lighting. Additionally, an auxiliary bypass system was incorporated in parallel with the IoT system to enhance reliability in the event of IoT system failures. Preliminary findings indicate that the integration of IoT systems with traditional BMS significantly boosts energy efficiency and safety in smart buildings. This integration offers a promising solution for advancing energy management practices and policies, thereby improving both operational performance and sustainability in building management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f388d17839eb5c3edb40a4dbc8f2f915231d646925e23af3c66aa9a8fad9139a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
