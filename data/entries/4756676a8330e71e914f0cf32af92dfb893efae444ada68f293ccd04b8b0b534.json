This paper explores its applications in digital health and healthcare, focusing on enhancing patient engagement through medical history collection, symptom assessment, and decision support to improve diagnostic accuracy. We also examine its role in promoting health literacy and clinical decision-making across various organ systems. Despite its advantages, the integration of ChatGPT in healthcare poses limitations and risks, including the potential for inaccurate information, overreliance by users, and ethical concerns related to informed consent. We discuss the challenges of keeping pace with rapidly evolving medical knowledge and highlight the need for continuous updates. Additionally, the paper addresses intellectual property and regulatory issues associated with AI deployment in medicine. Through this analysis, we provide insights into the benefits and potential risks of employing ChatGPT in healthcare.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4756676a8330e71e914f0cf32af92dfb893efae444ada68f293ccd04b8b0b534","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
