{"title":"Variations in colostrum metabolite profiles in association with sow parity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae062/7663688?rss=1","date":1714694400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Information about the full spectrum of metabolites present in porcine colostrum and factors that influence metabolite abundances is still incomplete. Parity number appears to modulate the concentration of single metabolites in colostrum. This study aimed to 1) characterize the metabolome composition and 2) assess the effect of parity on metabolite profiles in porcine colostrum. Sows (<span>n</span> = 20) were divided into three parity groups: A) sows in parity 1 and 2 (<span>n</span> = 8), B) sows in parity 3 and 4 (<span>n</span> = 6), and C) sows in parity 5 and 6 (<span>n</span> = 6). Colostrum was collected within 12 h after parturition. A total of 125 metabolites were identified using targeted reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and anion-exchange chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Gas chromatography additionally identified 19 fatty acids (FAs). Across parities, colostrum was rich in creatine and creatinine, 1,3-dioleyl-2-palmitatoylglycerol, 1,3-dipalmitoyl-2-oleoylglycerol, and sialyllactose. Alterations in colostrum concentrations were found for eight metabolites among parity groups (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) but the effects were not linear. For instance, colostrum from parity group C comprised 75.4% more valine but 15.7%, 34.1%, and 47.9% less citric, pyruvic, and pyroglutamic acid, respectively, compared to group A (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). By contrast, colostrum from parity group B contained 39.5% more spermidine than from group A (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Of the FAs, C18:1, C16:0, and C18:2 n6 were the main FAs across parities. Parity affected four FAs (C18:3n3, C14:1, C17:0ai, and C17:1), including 43.1% less α-linolenic acid (C18:3n3) in colostrum from parity group C compared to groups A and B (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Signature feature ranking identified 1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-<span>sn</span>-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine and the secondary bile acid hyodeoxycholic acid as the most discriminative metabolites, showing a higher variable importance in the projection score in colostrum from parity group A than from groups B and C. Overall, results provided a comprehensive overview about the metabolome composition of sow colostrum. The consequences of the changes in colostrum metabolites with increasing parity for the nutrient supply of the piglets should be investigated in the future. The knowledge gained in this study could be used to optimize feeding strategies for sows.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"e875d1481960ee2aba1b081dad32bf704bb0528a74e7a6f53aa7030a50174706","category":"Environment"}
