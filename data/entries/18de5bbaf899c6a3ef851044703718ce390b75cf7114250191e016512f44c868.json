{"title":"How Does the Threshold for Urban Household Registration in China Affect the Willingness of Rural to Urban Migrant Population to Settle Down?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1205/v2","date":1726696262000,"content":"The scale of China's floating population is very large, and it is a key group that needs attention in promoting the equalization of basic public services. This study explores the impact and mechanism of adjusting the urban household registration threshold on the acquisition of citizenship status by the \"rural-urban\" floating population, with the household registration threshold as the link. It was found that the threshold for household registration has an impact on the willingness of rural urban migrant population to settle down from two aspects. On the one hand, a high threshold for household registration implies the unaffordability of obtaining citizenship status for the \"rural-urban\" migrant population, which has a significant crowding out effect on their willingness to settle down. Moreover, the high skilled \"rural-urban\" migrant population without housing is more sensitive to the high threshold for household registration. On the other hand, from the perspective of urban scale, the increase in the threshold for household registration has had a crowding out effect on the floating population for Type I large cities, mega cities, and super large cities. The increase in the threshold for settling in mega cities has the strongest crowding out effect on the floating population, which means that as the urban population expands, the welfare benefits enjoyed by the floating population in these cities will decrease, leading them to be more inclined to leave these cities and seek development opportunities in other cities. This study effectively answers how the threshold for household registration affects the willingness of rural urban migrant population to settle, providing mathematical support for urban development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"18de5bbaf899c6a3ef851044703718ce390b75cf7114250191e016512f44c868","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
