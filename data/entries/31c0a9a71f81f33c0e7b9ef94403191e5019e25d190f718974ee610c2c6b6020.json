{"title":"Gradient Based Aero-Stealth Optimization of a Simplified Aircraft","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1903/v1","date":1716966629000,"content":"Modern fighter aircraft increasingly need to conjugate aerodynamic performance and low observability. In this paper we showcase a methodology for a gradient-based bidisciplinary aero-stealth optimization. The shape of the aircraft is parametrized with the help of a CAD modeler, and we optimize with the SLSQP algorithm. The drag, computed with the help of a RANS method, is used as the aerodynamic criterion. The stealth criterion, a function is derived from the radar cross section in a given cone of directions, weighed with a function whose goal is to cancel the electromagnetic intensity in a given direction. Stealth is achieved passively by scattering back the electromagnetic energy away from the radar antenna and no energy is absorbed by the aircraft, which is considered as a perfect conductor. A Pareto front is identified by varying the weights of the aerodynamic and stealth criteria. The Pareto front allows for an easy identification of the CAD model corresponding to a chosen aero-stealth trade-off.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31c0a9a71f81f33c0e7b9ef94403191e5019e25d190f718974ee610c2c6b6020","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
