{"title":"Earthquake Risk Increasing Severity and Urgent Need for Disaster Management in Afghanistan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1501/v1","date":1726822555000,"content":"Afghanistan is located on the Eurasian tectonic plate's edge, a highly seismically active region. It is bordered by the northern boundary of the Indian plate and influenced by the collisional Arabian plate to the south. The Hindu Kush and Pamir Mountains in Afghanistan are part of the western extension of the Himalayan orogeny and have been uplifted and sheared by the convergence of the Indian and Eurasian plates. These tectonic activities have generated numerous active deep faults across the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region, many of which intersect Afghanistan, resulting in frequent high-magnitude earthquakes. This tectonic interaction produces ground shaking of varying intensity, from high to moderate and low, with the epicenters often located in the northeast and extending southwest across the country. The reoccurrence and severity of earthquakes have been increasing since 1900. This study maps Afghanistan's tectonic structures, identifying the most active geological faults and regions with heightened seismicity. The increasing trend in recurrence and intensity of the earthquakes are drawn. Historical earthquake data were reviewed, and recent destructive events were incorporated into the national earthquake dataset to improve disaster management strategies. Additionally, the study addresses earthquake hazards related to building and infrastructure design, offering potential solutions and directions to mitigate risks to life and property.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61b8d0371fb6e68ff27b8521c1f6e1b6b8cc7d7a2d076fdb572ab85dab91a0f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
