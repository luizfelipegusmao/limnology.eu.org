In particular, the single-photon emission behavior in PNCs has potential applications in quantum information technologies [<a href=\"#ozae044.765-B3\">3-5</a>]. This work involves studying PNCs of varying sizes infused within a matrix with strong quantum confinement regime to gain insights into their single-photon emission capabilities. In particular, a 3D-FAPbBr3 matrix incorporated with FAPbI<sub>3</sub> and FAPb(Br<sub>x</sub>I<sub>1-x</sub>)<sub>3</sub> were imaged. Synthesizing these materials involves colloidal methods where metal halides react with organic ligands in a solvent to control nanocrystal size, composition, and properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9bccb9799d4bcc5077cd1512de200f6353eee9daeeb5147a5272316930081cf4","category":"Environment"}
