{"title":"Reviewing Digestate Thermal Valorization: Focusing on the Energy Demand and the Treatment of Process Water","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2244/v1","date":1727581311000,"content":"Anaerobic digestion is a feasible solution for the treatment of organic wastes. The process can reduce the amount of biowaste by stabilizing the organic material and producing biogas susceptible to energetic valorization. However, the digestate needs further valorization when land application is considered unfeasible. Thermal treatments, such as gasification, pyrolysis, and hydrothermal carbonization, are alternatives capable of transforming this material into valuable syngas, obtaining, in many cases, a carbonized stream known as biochar. The feasibility of the process depends on the energy demand for the drying stage and the treatments available for removing contaminants from the syngas, attaining high-quality products, and treating the process-derived water. In the present manuscript, these critical aspects were reviewed considering the characteristics of digestates based on their origin, the modifications of this material during anaerobic digestion, and the way digestate structure affects the final thermal valorization outcome. Emphasis was placed on the energy demand of the global approach and by-product treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3e278407e911bb69a9f17a5e5dcb4fa874db42a373144465c26efa2ae3efeb4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
