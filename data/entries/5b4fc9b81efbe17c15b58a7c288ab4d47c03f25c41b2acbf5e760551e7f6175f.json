Nile tilapia fingerlings were housed in eight 20-gallon tanks at Purdue University, acclimated to 26 ± 2°C water conditions before the experiment. The tilapia was divided into groups with varying water temperatures and feed supplements: control fish in warm water, and experimental groups in cold water with increased levels of Vitamin C and Zinc. Stress was induced by lowering the water temperature to 15 ± 2°C in four tanks, while the remaining tanks were kept at the optimal growth temperature. Results demonstrated that Vitamin C and Zinc supplementation significantly enhanced immune response and muscle regeneration in cold-stressed tilapia, allowing them to achieve growth rates comparable to those of control fish in optimal warm water conditions. These findings highlight the potential benefits of combined Vitamin C and Zinc supplementation in improving the immune response and growth performance of tilapia under suboptimal temperature conditions.","author":"Ahmed Mustafa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5b4fc9b81efbe17c15b58a7c288ab4d47c03f25c41b2acbf5e760551e7f6175f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
