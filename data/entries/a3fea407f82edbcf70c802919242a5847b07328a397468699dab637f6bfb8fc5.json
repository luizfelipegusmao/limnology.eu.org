{"title":"Venoms and Cell-Penetrating Peptides: A New Frontier in Drug Delivery Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0689/v1","date":1728468154000,"content":"Animal venoms are complex mixtures of bioactive peptides and enzymes that have garnered significant interest for their therapeutic potential, particularly in drug delivery systems. Among these peptides, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have emerged as promising candidates due to their ability to traverse cellular membranes and deliver a variety of molecular cargos, including drugs, imaging agents, and nanoparticles. Recent advancements in omics technologies have enhanced our understanding of the structural and functional properties of CPPs, leading to their classification based on conformation, origin, and physicochemical characteristics. This review discusses the diverse types of CPPs, including three-finger toxins, disintegrins, and bradykinin-potentiating peptides, highlighting their roles in targeted drug delivery and therapeutic applications. The potential of venom-derived peptides in developing novel strategies for drug delivery and disease treatment is explored, emphasizing their impact on biotechnological and biomedical research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a3fea407f82edbcf70c802919242a5847b07328a397468699dab637f6bfb8fc5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
