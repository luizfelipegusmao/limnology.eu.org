{"title":"Entanglement and Generalized Berry Geometrical Phases in Quantum Gravity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0410/v1","date":1717728665000,"content":"A new formalism is introduced that makes it possible to elucidate the physical and geometric content of quantum spacetime. It \nis based in the Minimum Group Representation Principle (MGRP). Within this framework new results for entanglement and geometrical/topological phases are found and implemented in cosmological and black hole space-times. \nOur main results here are: \n{\\bf(i)} We find the Berry phases for inflation and for the cosmological perturbations and express them in terms of the observables, as the spectral scalar and tensor indices, $n_S$ an $n_T$, and the tensor to scalar ratio $r$. The Berry phase for de Sitter inflation is imaginary with the sign describing the exponential acceleration.\n{\\bf(ii)} The pure entangled states in the  minimum group (metaplectic) $Mp(n)$ representation for quantum de Sitter space-time and black holes are found. {\\bf(iii)} For entanglement, the relation between \nthe Schmidt type representation and the \nphysical states of the $Mp(n)$ group \nis found: This is a {\\it new non-diagonal} coherent state \nrepresentation complementary to the known \nSudarshan diagonal one. {\\bf(iv)} Mean value generators of $Mp(2)$ are\nrelated to the adiabatic invariant and   topological charge of the spacetime (matrix element of the \ntransition $-\\infty &lt; t &lt; \\infty$). {\\bf(v)} The basic {\\it even} and {\\it odd} $n$-sectors of the Hilbert space are intrinsic to the quantum spacetime and its discrete levels (in particular continuum for $n \\rightarrow \\infty$),  they  do not require any extrinsic generation \nprocess as the standard Schrodinger cat \nstates, and are {\\it entangled}. {\\bf(vi)}  The gravity or cosmological domains in one side and another of the Planck scale are  {\\it entangled}. Examples: The quantum primordial trans-Planckian de Sitter vacuum and the classical late de Sitter vacuum today; the central quantum gravity reqion and the external classical gravity region of black holes. The classical and quantum dual gravity regions of the space-time are entangled. {\\bf(vii)} The general classical-quantum gravity duality is associated to the Metaplectic $Mp(n)$ group symmetry which provides the complete full covering of the phase space and of the quantum space-time mapped from it.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"474a61ba83986864864ca53cd9366916df8eb801899be0ad2cf1b0d7f5fa6b66","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
