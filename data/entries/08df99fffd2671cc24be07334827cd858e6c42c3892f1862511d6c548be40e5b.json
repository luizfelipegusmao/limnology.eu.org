{"title":"Spatial Population Structuring and Genetic Analysis of Exotic Grevillea robusta in Northwestern India","link":"https://academic.oup.com/forestscience/article/70/2/132/7606240?rss=1","date":1707523200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The introduction of exotics is common in forestry, and majorly important species, like eucalypts, poplar, and <span>Casuarina</span> sp., occupy vast areas in the Indian subcontinent. Importantly, with the latest cost-effective sequencing techniques, genetic diversity research through molecular marker approaches on major exotics provides novel information for genetic improvement in economic traits with climatic adaptation. The study was carried out on <span>Grevillea robusta</span> to assess genetic relatedness and diversity among 228 genotypes belonging to five northwestern states in India. These genotypes were assayed using twelve simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A population structure analysis using <span>structure</span> software identified four major gene pool subgroups with clear-cut differences from each other. Principal coordinate analysis also supports the clustering patterns of the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean analysis. In the case of genetic diversity assessment, a total of seventy-three alleles were detected from twelve SSRs, with an average of 6.08 ± 0.71 per locus. Polymorphism information content ranged from 0.17 to 0.67 with a mean of 0.44 ± 0.045, indicating high levels of polymorphism across the genotypes. All the evaluated SSRs demonstrated moderate genetic diversity (observed heterozygosity = 0.31 ± 0.03; expected heterozygosity = 0.32 ± 0.03; and genetic differentiation = 0.295) among the sampled genotypes. These findings indicate significant genetic variability in the germplasm to warrant selection and have potential for a long-term tree improvement program of <span>G. robusta</span> in India.Study Implications: The study on population genetics of <span>Grevillea robusta</span> in exotic environments assessed probable gene pools, provenances, and genetic diversity in geographical distribution range of the species in the Indian scenario. The basic population genetic measures revealed the high diversity areas and probable seed zones of <span>G. robusta</span> in its exotic range. Importantly, the study will be helpful in the selection of candidate plus trees of <span>G. robusta</span> to further strengthen the genotype × environment interaction study for future breeding programs. Further, studying the genetic makeup for moderately diverse species offers valuable insights into evolutionary history, population dynamics, and ecological interactions, which may lead to conservation efforts and guidance for the management of trees such as <span>G. robusta</span> in their native and introduced regions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Forest Science Current Issue","siteHash":"05e2fee9ae6a27cd288c89ae75adf607539d339849a171c4fab1eaa2f11b4162","entryHash":"08df99fffd2671cc24be07334827cd858e6c42c3892f1862511d6c548be40e5b","category":"Environment"}
