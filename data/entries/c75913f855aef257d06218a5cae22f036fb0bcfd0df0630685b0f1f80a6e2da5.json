The method is well suited for conducting sample searches in aberration-corrected scanning/transmission electron microscopes (S/TEM), where the survey can be very time-consuming because of the limited field of view imposed by the highly excited objective lens after fine-tuning the aberration correctors. For implementation, a digital image of the sample and the TEM holder was captured using a simple stereo-optical microscope. Naturally presented geometric patterns on the holder were referenced to construct a projective transformation between the electron and optical coordinate systems. The test results demonstrated that the method was accurate and required no electron microscope or specimen holder modifications. Additionally, it eliminated the need to mount the sample onto specific patterned TEM grids or deposit markers, resulting in universal applications for most TEM samples, holders and electron microscopes for fast FOI identification. Furthermore, we implemented the method into a Gatan script for graphical-user-interface-based step-by-step instructions. Through online communication, the script enabled real-time navigation and tracking of the motion of samples in TEM on enlarged optical images with a panoramic view.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"c75913f855aef257d06218a5cae22f036fb0bcfd0df0630685b0f1f80a6e2da5","category":"Environment"}
