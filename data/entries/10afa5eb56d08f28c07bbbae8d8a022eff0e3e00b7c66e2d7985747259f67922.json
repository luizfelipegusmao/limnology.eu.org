Nonetheless, the difficulty of experimentally identifying and understanding the topological textures within general ferroelectric nanostructures has remained, due to the necessity to precisely map the local polarization in three dimensions at the atomic level. We recently reported complex topological polar structures in ferroelectric BaTiO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles using atomic electron tomography (see Fig. 1) [<a href=\"#ozae044.891-B5\">5-12</a>]. Our three-dimensional (3D) polarization mappings reveal the toroidal ordering, along with the coexistence of polar ordering, referred to as a polar-toroidal multiorder state (see Fig. 2) [<a href=\"#ozae044.891-B12\">12</a>]. Additionally, we reported that these vortex configurations exhibit size-dependent topological transitions, evolving from a single vortex structure to multiple vortices, corroborating with the effective Hamiltonian simulation [<a href=\"#ozae044.891-B12\">12</a>]. Finally, we observed non-trivial 3D polar structures including fractional skyrmions or a Bloch point at the atomic scale by calculating the topological invariants for each 3D polar structure within ferroelectric nanoparticles, even in the absence of epitaxial strain. These findings will provide a comprehensive understanding of the intricate topological nature of nanoscale ferroelectrics.
