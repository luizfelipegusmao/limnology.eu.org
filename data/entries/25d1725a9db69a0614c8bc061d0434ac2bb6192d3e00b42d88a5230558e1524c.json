{"title":"Building a framework for fake news detection in the health domain","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305362","date":1720447200000,"content":"<p>by Juan R.

Therefore, it is crucial to detect and combat it effectively. In this article, we provide three elements to aid in this fight: 1) a new framework that collects health-related articles from verification entities and facilitates their check-worthiness and fact-checking annotation at the sentence level; 2) a corpus generated using this framework, composed of 10335 sentences annotated in these two concepts and grouped into 327 articles, which we call KEANE (faKe nEws At seNtence lEvel); and 3) a new model for verifying fake news that combines specific identifiers of the medical domain with triplets subject-predicate-object, using Transformers and feedforward neural networks at the sentence level. This model predicts the fact-checking of sentences and evaluates the veracity of the entire article. After training this model on our corpus, we achieved remarkable results in the binary classification of sentences (check-worthiness F1: 0.749, fact-checking F1: 0.698) and in the final classification of complete articles (F1: 0.703). We also tested its performance against another public dataset and found that it performed better than most systems evaluated on that dataset. Moreover, the corpus we provide differs from other existing corpora in its duality of sentence-article annotation, which can provide an additional level of justification of the prediction of truth or untruth made by the model.","author":"Juan R.
