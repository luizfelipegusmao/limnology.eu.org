{"title":"Therapeutic Potential of Pomegranate Extract for Women&#039;s Reproductive Health and Breast Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0046/v1","date":1722503223000,"content":"Pomegranate extract has potential benefits for women's reproductive health, including fertility enhancement, menstrual cycle regulation, pregnancy support, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) treatment. It possesses antioxidant properties, reducing oxidative stress and improving fertility. Phytoestrogens in pomegranate extract may help regulate hormonal imbalances and promote regular menstrual cycles. The extract's rich nutrient profile supports placental development and fetal growth and may reduce the risk of preterm birth. Additionally, pomegranate extract shows promise in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing inflammation and oxidative damage in PCOS. Some studies suggest its potential anticancer properties, particularly against breast cancer. However, further research, including human clinical trials, is necessary to establish its effectiveness and safety. The current evidence is limited and primarily based on in vitro studies, animal studies, and clinical trials. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the benefits of pomegranate extract for women's reproductive health and breast cancer, serving as a reference for future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"725dad116119bcd37345de363add766d7d99f8772f2199fdc90db62828e5fda1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
