{"title":"Revisiting ant-plant-pollinator interactions: plant fitness depends on mutualist identity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/biolinnean/blae086/7796459?rss=1","date":1727654400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Two species may share a mutualistic interaction if the benefits gained by the interaction outweigh the costs incurred. In this study, we tested experimentally how the identity of ants (pinned) and floral visitors of an extrafloral nectary (EFN)-bearing plant can affect plant fitness. We quantified ant activity and floral visitor visitation overlap over time, floral visitor behaviour, amount of floral resources collected, and plant fitness as influenced by the ant species identity in an EFN-bearing plant from Brazilian Cerrado savanna, <span>Qualea multiflora</span> (Vochysiaceae). We found that: (i) ant activity and floral visitation overlap greatly in time; (ii) floral visitors vary in their response to the presence of ants; (iii) different ant species have different impacts on floral visitors; (iv) ants affected the amount of floral resources collected by pollinators, but their levels were contingent on ant identity; and (v) plant fitness components (fruit production, seed weight, and seed size) were most strongly affected by the largest and most aggressive ant species. Our results suggest that the balance of the trade-off between the beneficial effects of ant protection against herbivorous insects and the negative consequences for plant fitness by deterring pollinators depends on the species identity of both the ants and the floral visitors to the plant.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"968f4822d04bb9763c6f2c56ab96f839af5388ce0cf3e33d8837e57ec1c929fc","category":"Environment"}
