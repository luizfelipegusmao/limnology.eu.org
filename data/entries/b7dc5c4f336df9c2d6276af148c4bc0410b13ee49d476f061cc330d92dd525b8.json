{"title":"Extreme value statistics of nerve transmission delay","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306605","date":1720188000000,"content":"<p>by Satori Tsuzuki</p>\r\n\r\nDelays in nerve transmission are an important topic in the field of neuroscience. Spike signals fired or received by the dendrites of a neuron travel from the axon to a presynaptic cell. The spike signal then triggers a chemical reaction at the synapse, wherein a presynaptic cell transfers neurotransmitters to the postsynaptic cell, regenerates electrical signals via a chemical reaction through ion channels, and transmits them to neighboring neurons. In the context of describing the complex physiological reaction process as a stochastic process, this study aimed to show that the distribution of the maximum time interval of spike signals follows extreme-order statistics. By considering the statistical variance in the time constant of the leaky Integrate-and-Fire model, a deterministic time evolution model for spike signals, we enabled randomness in the time interval of the spike signals. When the time constant follows an exponential distribution function, the time interval of the spike signal also follows an exponential distribution. In this case, our theory and simulations confirmed that the histogram of the maximum time interval follows the Gumbel distribution, one of the three forms of extreme-value statistics. We further confirmed that the histogram of the maximum time interval followed a Fr√©chet distribution when the time interval of the spike signal followed a Pareto distribution. These findings confirm that nerve transmission delay can be described using extreme value statistics and can therefore be used as a new indicator of transmission delay.","author":"Satori Tsuzuki","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b7dc5c4f336df9c2d6276af148c4bc0410b13ee49d476f061cc330d92dd525b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
