{"title":"DFMG decreases angiogenesis to uphold plaque stability by inhibiting the TLR4/VEGF pathway in mice","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302387","date":1713448800000,"content":"<p>by Pingjuan Bai, Xueping Xiang, Jiawen Kang, Xiaoqing Xiang, Jingwen Jiang, Xiaohua Fu, Yong Zhang, Lesai Li</p>\r\n\r\nThe aim of this study was to elucidate the specific mechanism through which 7-difluoromethoxy-5,4’-dimethoxygenistein (DFMG) inhibits angiogenesis in atherosclerosis (AS) plaques, given its previously observed but poorly understood inhibitory effects. In vitro, a model using Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial (HUVEC-12) cells simulated the initial lesion in the atherosclerotic pathological process, specifically oxidative stress injury, by exposing cells to 30 μmol/L LPC. Additionally, an AS mouse model was developed in ApoE knockout mice through a 16-week period of high-fat feeding. DFMG demonstrated a reduction in tubule quantities in the tube formation assay and neovascularization induced by oxidative stress-damaged endothelial cells in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay. Furthermore, DFMG decreased lipid levels in the blood of ApoE knockout mice with AS, along with a decrease in atherosclerotic plaques and neovascularizations in the aortic arch and descending aorta of AS animal models. DFMG treatment upregulated microRNA140 (miR-140) expression and suppressed VEGF secretion in HUVEC-12 cells. These effects were counteracted by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) overexpression in HUVEC-12 cells subjected to oxidative injury or in a mouse model of AS. Dual-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-140 directly targeted TLR4. Immunohistochemical assay findings indicated a significant inverse relationship between miR-140 expression and TLR4 expression in ApoE knockout mice subjected to a high-fat diet. The study observed a close association between DFMG inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and plaque stability in AS, and the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB/VEGF signaling pathway, negatively regulated by miR-140.","author":"Pingjuan Bai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"94015dbf9dd3fe705d5f04f7ab17afcd7194a88a86b76b63a3b73bbe166b794f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
