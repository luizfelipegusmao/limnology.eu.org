{"title":"Probing Defectivity Beneath the Hydrocarbon Blanket in 2D hBN Using TEM-EELS","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/4/650/7717223?rss=1","date":1721347200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The controlled creation and manipulation of defects in 2D materials has become increasingly popular as a means to design and tune new material functionalities. However, defect characterization by direct atomic-scale imaging is often severely limited by surface contamination due to a blanket of hydrocarbons. Thus, analysis techniques that can characterize atomic-scale defects despite the contamination layer are advantageous. In this work, we take inspiration from X-ray absorption spectroscopy and use broad-beam electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to characterize defect structures in 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) based on averaged fine structure in the boron K-edge. Since EELS is performed in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), imaging can be performed in-situ to assess contamination levels and other factors such as tears in the fragile 2D sheets, which can affect the spectroscopic analysis. We demonstrate the TEM-EELS technique for 2D hBN samples irradiated with different ion types and doses, finding spectral signatures indicative of boronâ€“oxygen bonding that can be used as a measure of sample defectiveness depending on the ion beam treatment. We propose that even in cases where surface contamination has been mitigated, the averaging-based TEM-EELS technique can be useful for efficient sample surveys to support atomically resolved EELS experiments.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0fe647d4257f71d61af749ee894870af1ec0a8d3240af94cd94ad3b6ad413e2e","category":"Environment"}
