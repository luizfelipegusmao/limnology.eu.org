Emotional responses, such as frustration and anxiety, significantly influence consumer loyalty, underscoring the role of empathetic engagement and support from brands. Aligning with consumer expectations and delivering on promises are essential for sustaining loyalty and reducing the risk of consumer defection. The study concludes that navigating supply chain disruptions requires brands to prioritize trust, reputation, crisis management, consumer-centric strategies, emotional intelligence, and alignment with consumer expectations. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of consumer behavior in crisis contexts and provide strategic implications for brands seeking to enhance resilience and maintain loyalty in dynamic market environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1db03633ee10d837749496f531530685f92e74a68b1c9a21c6ff5d5bafbb5538","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
