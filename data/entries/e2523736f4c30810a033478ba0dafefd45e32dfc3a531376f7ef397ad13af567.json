{"title":"Long-term assessment of the presence of the non-native estuarine copepod Pseudodiaptomus trihamatus Wright, 1937 (Calanoida) and spatial investigation after 30 years of invasion in Northeastern Brazil","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10530-024-03413-3","date":1730419200000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>We aimed to investigate the presence of the copepod <em>Pseudodiaptomus trihamatus</em> in an estuary in Northeastern Brazil, from a long-term perspective (1987–2023), and its distribution in other nearby estuaries, after 30 years of invasion, especially considering its impacts on native congeneric species. We tested the following hypotheses: (i) The abundance of <em>P. trihamatus</em> increases over time and the abundance of native species decreases; (ii) The β diversity decreases over time; (iii) Copepod composition and β diversity differs over time. The study was carried out in six estuarines systems in Pernambuco, in the Northeastern Brazil. The investigation of long-term variation (1987–2023) was based on the Capibaribe River Estuarine System (CRES), while for the spatial variation (2020–2021), six estuarine systems were considered. We observed that <em>P. trihamatus</em> has occurred in CRES since 1991, 10 years before the first record of the species in Pernambuco. The abundance of <em>P. trihamatus</em> did not increase over time. Furthermore, β diversity increased over time, showing that the presence of <em>P. trihamatus</em> did not cause biotic homogenization through loss of biodiversity. In the spatial variation (2020–2021), we found <em>P</em>. <em>trihamatus</em> in four of the estuaries and was it the third most representative species of the family. The occurrence of <em>P. trihamatus</em> did not significantly affect the Pseudodiaptomidae family and the copepod assemblage, for either long-term or spatial variation. The undetected or negligible impact of <em>P. trihamatus</em> need to be monitored, to prevent a sleeper population from becoming highly abundant and, perhaps, disruptive in this region of Brazil.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"e2523736f4c30810a033478ba0dafefd45e32dfc3a531376f7ef397ad13af567","category":"Environment"}
