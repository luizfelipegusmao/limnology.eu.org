{"title":"Zooplankton densities reduced by increases in resource N:P in hypereutrophic mesocosms","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05557-8","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Ecological stoichiometry of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) has been well studied as a driver of zooplankton dynamics in lakes; yet, we still lack a thorough investigation of the impact of varying N loads, and the resulting variation in resource N:P stoichiometry. We used a mesocosm experiment in which we altered inputs of N and P to observe the impact of stoichiometric variation in nutrient concentrations on zooplankton density and community composition for a period of 10 weeks. Our experiment achieved a wide gradient of environmental N:P availability primarily by altering N loading, while keeping P inputs consistent across treatments. Across all treatments, we observed declines in zooplankton density through time and a reduction in cladocerans relative to copepods. These temporal patterns correlated to a loss of P in the water column and higher food resource N:P, as well as warming temperatures throughout the experiment. Our experiment highlights the potential importance of resource quality over quantity for supporting higher zooplankton densities, as well as the impacts of high temperatures. These results suggest disproportionately high N loads relative to P as is common in agricultural landscapes could reduce zooplankton populations, despite stimulating greater primary production.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"04ebbb5f2aaf173248cd7e5a65199defc2792fa0d81c0e6ece22c92985fab64f","category":"Environment"}
