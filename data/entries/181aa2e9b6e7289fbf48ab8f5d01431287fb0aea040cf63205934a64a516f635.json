{"title":"Combined Compact Symplectic Schemes for Solving Good Boussinesq Equations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1509/v1","date":1718959697000,"content":"Good Boussinesq equations will be considered in this work. First we apply three combined compact schemes to approximate spatial derivatives of good Boussinesq equations. Then three fully discrete schemes are developed based on symplectic scheme in time direction, which are sympletic-structure preserving.Meanwhile, the convergence and conservation of the fully discrete schemes are analyzed. Finally, we present numerical experiments to confirm our theoretical analysis. Both our analysis and numerical test indicate that the fully discrete schemes are efficient in solving the spatial derivative mixed equation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"181aa2e9b6e7289fbf48ab8f5d01431287fb0aea040cf63205934a64a516f635","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
