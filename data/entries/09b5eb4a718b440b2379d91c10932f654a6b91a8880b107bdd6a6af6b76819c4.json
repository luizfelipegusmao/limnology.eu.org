Annually resolved paleoclimatic reconstructions spanning the pre- and post-industrial eras from the Indonesian maritime continent may provide hindcasting and diagnostic targets. Here we report <i>δ</i>\n<sup>18</sup>O observations from dendrochronologically dated teak (<i>Tectona grandis L</i>. <i>f</i>.) <i>α</i>-cellulose samples collected at Muna Island, Sulawesi (5.3°S, 123°E, elevation 10 m), for November-April growing seasons during the period 1969/70–2004/5. Age-modeled, annually averaged <i>α</i>-cellulose <i>δ</i>\n<sup>18</sup>O anomalies are significantly correlated with simulated <i>α</i>-cellulose <i>δ</i>\n<sup>18</sup>O at the study site. We show that the correlation is largely explained by the amount effect in local and regional precipitation <i>δ</i>\n<sup>18</sup>O. Significant correlation with SST anomalies over the study period suggest that replicated multicentury <i>α</i>-cellulose records from this archive may be interpreted as ENSO indicators.</p>","author":"I.
