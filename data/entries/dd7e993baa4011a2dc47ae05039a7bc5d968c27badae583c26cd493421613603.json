{"title":"PSVI-14 Changes in zinc oxide concentration in feed and effects of probiotic addition to weaning to finishing pig diet by microbiome analysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/328/7665080?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>To analyze the implications of dietary zinc oxide (ZnO) with probiotic administration on productivity, fecal index, meat quality characteristics, odorous substances, and microbiome analysis in weaning-finishing pigs, 200 weaned piglets (3 barrows and 2 gilts) were radomly assigned (average body weight = 6.65 Â± 0.66 kg) into four treatments with ten repetitions per treatment. The treatments consisted of varying ZnO content (2,500 ppm or 75 ppm) and probiotic percentages (0.1% or 0.3%), as follows: TRT1 (75 ppm ZnO), TRT2 (75 ppm ZnO with 0.3% or 0.1% probiotic), TRT3 (2,500 ppm or 75 ppm ZnO), and TRT4 (2,500 ppm or 75 ppm ZnO with 0.3% or 0.1% probiotic). In comparison with the TRT1 treatment group, the TRT2 and TRT4 treatment groups had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) body weight at wk 12, 18, and 22 of the trial and greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) average daily gain at wk 12, 18, 22, and the overall period (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, pigs fed ZnO with the probiotic included a diet that reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) NH<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S at wk 18 and 22, and CO<sub>2</sub> at wk 22, in the TRT2 and TRT4 groups compared with the TRT1 group. However, the fecal score and meat quality exhibited no substantial change (P &gt; 0.05). By incorporating probiotics into the pig diet along with ZnO supplementation, a significant (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) increase in alpha diversity and beta diversity, as well as a higher relative abundance of phyla and genera of Firmicutes was found. Furthermore, based on taxonomic analysis, the dietary treatment group (TRT 4) showed a significant (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) increase in beneficial bacteria (Prevotella, Lactobacillus) while simultaneously reducing (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) pathogenic bacteria (Clostridium_sunsu_strico_1, Campylobacteria, Olsenella) compared with the TRT1 treatment group. An improvement in diversity and expansion of the identified taxonomic groups has been associated with healthier gut health. The results indicated that the effects of ZnO with probiotics on the improvement of performance and reduced gas emissions in pigs may be associated with the modulatory effect on the gut microbiome. In conclusion, the current study provides insights into using decreased ZnO with probiotic inclusion as a novel feeding strategy to improve pig gut health and overall performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"dd7e993baa4011a2dc47ae05039a7bc5d968c27badae583c26cd493421613603","category":"Environment"}
