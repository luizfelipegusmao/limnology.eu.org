{"title":"Insights into artificial waterhole utilization patterns by elephants and rhinos: Lessons from a South African Nature Reserve","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312158","date":1729087200000,"content":"<p>by Eilidh Smith, Leslie Robert Brown, Alan Sean Barrett</p>\r\n\r\nArtificial water provisioning is a common practice in southern African nature reserves, where different game species exhibit preferences for specific waterhole types. The movement patterns and behaviour of elephants and rhinos are closely linked to water availability, with these mega-herbivores noticeably influencing the environment and other species they interact with at waterholes. Since there is limited research on this topic, understanding preferences for different types of artificial waterholes is crucial, particularly during periods of water scarcity. This knowledge enables reserve managers to effectively manage the numbers and types of waterholes. In this study, we investigate artificial waterhole selection and preferences by elephants and rhinos in the Olifants West Nature Reserve, South Africa. The study area featured various waterhole types, including earth dams, concrete pans, reservoirs, and troughs. By employing camera traps, we analysed visitation frequency, timing of visits, and factors influencing visit frequency. Our findings revealed distinct preferences for specific waterhole types among different social groupings of the study species. Breeding herds of elephants predominantly utilized reservoirs and occasionally visited troughs, while bachelor herds favoured earth dams. Black rhinos showed a preference for earth dams, whereas white rhinos selected troughs and earth dams, with bachelor groups favouring troughs and female rhinos favouring earth dams. The outcomes of this study have significant implications for the development of comprehensive conservation plans in areas where these species reside, and for potential release sites.","author":"Eilidh Smith","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"18b1bb3999b87c3c99fd944e203be6fcf3f51e99ac7ca55c6860b89c65f1f782","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
