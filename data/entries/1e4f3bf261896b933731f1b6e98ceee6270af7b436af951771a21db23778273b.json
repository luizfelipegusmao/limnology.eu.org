This process not only facilitates the conversion of heat into mechanical energy but also significantly mitigates environmental impacts. ORC stands out as the preferred technology for enhancing energy efficiency and leveraging low-temperature resources optimally. With the advent of artificial intelligence, particularly fuzzy logic, these systems have witnessed integration, providing a robust solution to address uncertainties. Unlike traditional logic, which offers binary outcomes, fuzzy logic offers a more adaptable approach by accommodating uncertainty, thus enabling modeling of complex real-world situations. In this study, utilizing the fuzzy logic method, we estimated the energy and exergy efficiency of the ORC, resulting in an impressive 90% estimation accuracy.</p>","author":"Ahmet Elbir, \nMehmet Erhan Åžahin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"1e4f3bf261896b933731f1b6e98ceee6270af7b436af951771a21db23778273b","category":"Environment"}
