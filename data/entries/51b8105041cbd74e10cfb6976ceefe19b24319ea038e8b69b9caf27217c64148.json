The exposome interacts with individual genetic and epigenetic characteristics to affect human health and disease, but large-scale studies that characterize the exposome and its relationships with human disease are limited. To address this gap, we used extensive questionnaire data from the diverse North Carolina-based Personalized Environment and Genes Study (PEGS, n = 9, 429) to evaluate exposure associations in relation to common diseases. We performed an exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) to examine single exposure models and their associations with 11 common complex diseases, namely allergic rhinitis, asthma, bone loss, fibroids, high cholesterol, hypertension, iron-deficient anemia, ovarian cysts, lower GI polyps, migraines, and type 2 diabetes. Across diseases, we found associations with lifestyle factors and socioeconomic status as well as asbestos, various dust types, biohazardous material, and textile-related exposures. We also found disease-specific associations such as fishing with lead weights and migraines. To differentiate between a replicated result and a novel finding, we used an AI-based literature search and database tool that allowed us to examine the current literature. We found both replicated findings, especially for lifestyle factors such as sleep and smoking across diseases, and novel findings, especially for occupational exposures and multiple diseases.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Exposome Current Issue","siteHash":"27aa3afbf6b3566893318f33336c2cccdce9e1be4dc71aed3dd28b492f91a313","entryHash":"51b8105041cbd74e10cfb6976ceefe19b24319ea038e8b69b9caf27217c64148","category":"Environment"}
