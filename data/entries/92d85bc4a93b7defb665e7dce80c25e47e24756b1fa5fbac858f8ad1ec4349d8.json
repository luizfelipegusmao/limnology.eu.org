{"title":"The status and prospect on nature-based solution in South Asia: A policy-based analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000289","date":1709560800000,"content":"<p>by Shobha Poudel, Deepthi Wickramasinghe, Mahua Mukherjee, Imon Chowdhooree, Chimi Chimi, Bhogendra Mishra, Kumar Abhinay, Sudip Mitra, Rajib Shaw</p>\r\n\r\nSouth Asian countries face a disproportionate impact from disasters due to their unique topography, poverty, low literacy rates, and socio-economic status. Human activities, such as unplanned urbanization and poorly designed rural road networks, have further contributed to disasters in the region. The article explores the potential of nature-based solutions (NbS) as a means of addressing these challenges through the integration of green, blue, and grey infrastructure. The analysis evaluates the significance of NbS and examines policies and regional cooperation in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, highlighting the importance of incorporating NbS into national policies and promoting collaboration among these countries. The study identifies the current low implementation of NbS in South Asia, with limited research in this area. While there are existing policy tools related to coastal zone management, water, forest, and urban development, policies related to NbS should be coherent, connected, and integrated with natural resources, climate change, disaster risk reduction, and socio-economic growth to achieve sustainable development in the region. Overall, the article emphasizes the need for effective policy implementation and research to enhance resilience to climate change and promote sustainable development in South Asia.","author":"Shobha Poudel","siteTitle":"PLOS Climate","siteHash":"ab511bb583c9cc103fc6bd74737f07eb1311e1e62c758b30431d090c3da71072","entryHash":"92d85bc4a93b7defb665e7dce80c25e47e24756b1fa5fbac858f8ad1ec4349d8","category":"Environment"}
