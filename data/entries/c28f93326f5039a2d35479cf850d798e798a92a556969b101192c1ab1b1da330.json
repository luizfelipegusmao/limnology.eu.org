{"title":"Alcohol Intake and Prevalent Kidney Stone: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007&ndash;2018","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1756/v1","date":1721662174000,"content":"The association of alcohol intake with kidney stone disease (KSD) is not clear. We examined the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2018 and used logistic regression analyses to determine the independent association between alcohol intake and prevalent KSD. 29,684 participants were eligible for the final analysis including 2,840 prevalent stone formers (SF). Mean alcohol intake was 37.0±2.4 g/day among SF compared to 42.7±0.9 among non-SF (p=0.04). Beer [Odds ratio (OR)=0.76, 95% CI: 0.61-0.94, p=0.01] and wine (OR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.59-0.96, p=0.03) intakes were strongly associated with lower odds of prevalent KSD while liquor intake had no association. The effect from beer was dose dependent with an OR of 0.34 (95% CI: 0.20–0.57, p56g/day of beer to non-drinkers. Interestingly, the effect from wine was only significant among participants drinking moderate amount, with an OR of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.36–0.81, p=0.003) compared to non-drinkers. These effects were consistent in spline models. This study suggests that both moderate to heavy beer intake and moderate wine intake are associated with a reduced risk of KSD. Future prospective studies are needed to clarify the causal relationship.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c28f93326f5039a2d35479cf850d798e798a92a556969b101192c1ab1b1da330","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
