{"title":"Advancements in Date Palm Genomics and Biotechnology Genomic Resources to the Precision Agriculture: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1327/v2","date":1719554486000,"content":"In many parts of the Asia, particularly in the arid regions of the middle east the date palm i.e. Phoneix dactylifera L. is considered a significant plant both culturally and economically. Over the past decade numerous biotechnological tools have been applied to revolutionize the date palm research and its cultivation process. In this comprehensive review ,we provided the in depth overview of the cutting edge developments in the date palm biotechnology, mentioning the important areas such as genomics, genetic engineering, in vitro propagation, omics technologies, and the integration of the artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI-ML).Due to these advancements ,in the date palm production how the date palm production lead the production of superior date palm cultivars with the improved yield ,fruit quality and resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses. Also it explores the application of the biotech tools in the enhancing pest and disease management strategies, increasing date palm productivity and developing the date palm based bio-factories for the production of high value compounds. This review highlights the current challenges faced by the date palm industries ,including the limited water resources ,genetic erosion , pests and disease and the need for improved postharvest handling and processing. It examines how these tools coupled with AI-based approaches can be leveraged to address these challenges and ensure the long term sustainability of date palm cultivation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf760a423a60e9db897273d86cd7809f132f98fbf8faaa1d22a1eb3e1312c618","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
