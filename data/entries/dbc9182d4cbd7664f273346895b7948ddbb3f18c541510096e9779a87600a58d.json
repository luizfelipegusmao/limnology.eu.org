{"title":"98 Adding parasite resistance to the breeding objective in hair sheep","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/32/7664817?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Economic selection indexes provide the best method to achieve genetic gain for multiple traits simultaneously. Hair sheep enterprises, particularly in environments with substantial gastrointestinal nematode challenge, may benefit from incorporating parasite resistance in a selection index. However, obtaining the relative economic value (REV) for parasite resistance is challenging; information on its impact on productivity is incomplete, as are the costs of treatment given anthelmintic resistance. The National Sheep Improvement Program (NSIP) currently provides producers with an index designed to increase total weight of lamb weaned per ewe lambing (TW). Our objective was to assess the effects of including fecal egg count, an indicator of parasite resistance, as an additional goal trait. Including the benchmark scenario with TW as its sole objective, 10 indexes were constructed using standard index theory. Post-weaning fecal egg count (PFEC) was added to this breeding objective with a REV of -1 and the REV for TW was varied from +1 to +5 at +0.5 increments. Weaning weight, number of lambs born and weaned, and PFEC were the selection criteria, modelled as either phenotypes or estimated breeding values (EBV). Phenotypes and EBV were simulated for 1,000 lambs by Cholesky decomposition and used to generate index scores. Ten replicates were run and the top 3% of males and 26% of females were retained on index scores. Annual responses in the goal traits were estimated. Responses in PFEC were expressed as a percentage, assuming a mean PFEC of 2,089 eggs/g as in NSIP. Concordances with those selected in the benchmark scenario were determined. Using EBV as selection criteria, TW increased by 1.7 kg/yr in the benchmark scenario (Table 1). However, unfavorably, PFEC increased by 2.3%/yr. When phenotypic criteria were used, TW increased by 0.5 kg/yr, and PFEC by 0.3%/yr. Once added to the breeding objective, PFEC decreased regardless of the REV of TW. However, response in TW also reduced, although less so as its REV increased. With EBV as the criteria, the REV of +3 for TW appeared preferable: PFEC reduced by 7.1%/yr with 98% of the response in TW retained. With phenotypic selection criteria, PFEC reduced by 5.2%/yr with 94% of the response in TW retained. With +3 REV for TW and EBV as the selection criteria, on average 65% and 82% of males and females, respectively, were chosen in common with the benchmark. When phenotypic criteria were used, those percentages were 60% and 80%, respectively. Implementing a more holistic index with REV of +3 for TW and -1 for PFEC would result in reasonable responses in both traits. However, producers will need to decide if reduced gains in TW is acceptable to improve parasite resistance in a hair sheep breeding program.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"dbc9182d4cbd7664f273346895b7948ddbb3f18c541510096e9779a87600a58d","category":"Environment"}
