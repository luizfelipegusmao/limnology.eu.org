{"title":"The Acceptability and Validity of AI-Generated Psycholinguistic Stimuli","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1074/v2","date":1713804142000,"content":"Sentence stimuli pervade psycholinguistics research. Yet limited attention has been paid to the automatic construction of sentence stimuli. Given their linguistic capabilities, this study investigated the efficacy of ChatGPT/AI tools in generating sentence stimuli. In three psycholinguistic experiments, this study examined the acceptability and validity of AI-formulated auditory sentences and written sentences in two languages: English and Arabic. Participants gave English AI-generated stimuli similar to or higher acceptability ratings than human-composed stimuli, but the opposite was observed for Arabic AI-generated stimuli. The validity of AI-developed stimuli relied on the study design, with only Experiment 2 demonstrating the target psycholinguistic effect (L1/L2 morphosyntactic prediction). These results highlight the promising role of AI as a stimuli developer which could facilitate psycholinguistic research and increase its diversity. Implications for psycholinguistic research were discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58fd5f6cb9a8ca332a888e1ae2e6c3ec25887e9fe2a83dcc717692f1d956bb43","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
