The pyrite particle size was controlled in 1–3, 3–5, or 5–8 mm in both the PAD and PPMD systems to investigate the effect of pyrite particle size on the denitrification performance of autotrophic or split-mixotrophic bioreactors. It was found that the PAD system achieved the best denitrification efficiency with an average removal rate of 98.98% in the treatment of 1- to 3-mm particle size, whereas it was only 19.24% in the treatment of 5- to 8-mm particle size. At different phases of the whole experiment, the nitrate removal rates of both the PHD and PPMD systems remained stable at a high level (&gt;94%). Compared with the PAD or PHD system, the PPMD system reduced the concentrations of sulfate and chemical oxygen demand in the final effluent efficiently. The interconnection network diagram explained the intrinsic metabolic pathways of nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon in the three denitrification systems at different phases. In addition, the microbial community analysis showed that the PPMD system was beneficial for the enrichment of <i>Firmicutes</i>. Finally, the impact mechanism of pyrite particle size on the performance of the PPMD system was proposed.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nThe reduction of pyrite particle size was beneficial for improving the efficiency of the PAD process.\nThe change in particle size had an effect on NO<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>−</sup>-N accumulation in the PAD system.\nThe accumulation of NH<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>+</sup>-N in the PPMD system increased with the decrease in particle size.\nThe reduction of pyrite particle size increased the production of SO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>2−</sup> in the PAD and PPMD systems.\nThe correlations among the effluent indicators of the PAD and PPMD systems could be well explained.\n</p>","author":"Xihui Guo, \nGang Peng, \nLin Tan, \nYan Zhang, \nJing Wang, \nWeibo Wang, \nShiyang Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"baec6c5dc39a03a7be4252c6fb795a123457379d3ae982244c4aa791ceec461e","category":"Environment"}
