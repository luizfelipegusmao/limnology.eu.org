{"title":"COVID-19 Recovery Time and Its Predictors among Hospitalized Patients to Designated Hospitals in the Madhesh Province of Nepal: A Multicentric Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0384/v1","date":1722940661000,"content":"This study aimed to determine the COVID-19 recovery time and identify predictors among hospitalized patients in the Dhanusha District of Madhesh Province, Nepal. This hospital-based longitudinal study involved 507 COVID-19 patients admitted to three distinct medical facilities for therapeutic intervention between April to October 2021. Data were collected for patient demography, symptoms, vital signs, oxygen saturation levels, temperatures, heart rates, respiratory rates, and blood pressure measurements and other health-related conditions. Kaplan–Meier Survival Curve estimated the recovery time from, and Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify the predictors of recovery time. Of the total participants, mean age was 51.1 (SD=14.9) years, 68.0% were males, 49.5% recovered, and 16.8% died. The median for patient recovery was 26 days (95% CI: 25.1–26.7). Patients with severe or critical conditions were less likely to recover compared to those with milder conditions (Hazard Ratio (HR)=0.34, 95% CI: 0.15-0.79; p=0.012). In addition, an increase in oxygen saturation was associated with an elevated likelihood of recovery (HR=1.09, 95% CI=1.01-1.17, p=0.018). This study underscores the need for early admission in hospital and emphasizing the targeted interventions in severe cases. Additionally, the results highlight the importance of optimizing oxygen levels in COVID-19 patient care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b1b8a0f3fe227934f7f27b6a10d897b4a81f7017878683ed8344cd3217ca02e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
