{"title":"Efficiency of Nitrogen Fertilization in Millet Irrigated with Brackish Water","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1123/v1","date":1710991727000,"content":"Nitrogen fertilization can provide greater nutritional support and mitigate salt stress in the millet crop. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological responses and agronomic performance of millet crops subjected to nitrogen fertilization and irrigation water salinity. The study was carried out in a greenhouse, using a completely randomized design in a 5 x 2 factorial scheme, with 4 rep-lications, with five doses of nitrogen (40; 60; 80; 100 and 120 kg ha-1 of N) and two levels of elec-trical conductivity of the irrigation water: 0.3 and 4.0 dS m-1. We concluded that salt stress in-creased leaf sodium levels and had a negative impact on stalk dry mass and panicle dry, leaf gas exchange, mineral element concentrations (K, P and Ca), and water use efficiency. The use of lower salinity water associated with increased nitrogen fertilization provides greater stalk dry mass and panicle dry, photosynthesis, water use efficiency, chlorophyll index, leaf potassium concentration, and biomass production. Salt stress negatively affected transpiration, stomatal conductance, leaf P and Ca levels, and increased leaf sodium levels as nitrogen fertilization increased in millet plants grown under pot conditions. These results can be used to create a strategy to reduce the negative impact of salt stress associated with the nutrition of millet plants, using nitrogen fertilization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d29f6a2d9e2e7c211373a283319de6b4392b2c24bc820b85a5e90f5d0c91419f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
