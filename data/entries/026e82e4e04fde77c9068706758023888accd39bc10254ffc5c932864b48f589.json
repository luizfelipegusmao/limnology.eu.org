{"title":"Are day-flying moths more specialized in larval dietary breadth?—a test of the “Salient Aroma Hypothesis” in a predominantly nocturnal clade","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/6/1174/7635924?rss=1","date":1711497600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Although diurnality is widespread across Lepidoptera and has evolved many times independently, its causes and ecological implications are yet poorly understood. The “Salient Aroma Hypothesis” (SAH) postulates that diurnal insect herbivores are overall more specialized in dietary breadth than species active at night. It is furthermore assumed that diurnality evolved more frequently in species that live in cooler environments. Using European geometrid moths as a model group, we tested whether diurnal activity in adults is associated with an increased larval dietary breadth as predicted by the SAH. We further investigated whether species that exclusively occur in colder regions or whose flight period is restricted to cool seasons are more likely to exhibit a diurnal flight activity. Contrary to expectation, we found no consistent differences in larval dietary breadth between diurnal and nocturnal species, and thus no support for the SAH. Diurnal activity occurred more frequently in species restricted to cold regions but not in species restricted to cool seasons. We conclude that diurnality could serve as an advantageous adaptation in cold environments, depending on further factors such as resource availability or predation pressure, but has no immediate consequences for larval dietary breadth.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"026e82e4e04fde77c9068706758023888accd39bc10254ffc5c932864b48f589","category":"Environment"}
