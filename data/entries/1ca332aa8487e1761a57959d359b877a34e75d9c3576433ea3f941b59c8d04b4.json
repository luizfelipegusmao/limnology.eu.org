{"title":"The photosynthetic performance and photoprotective role of carotenoids response to light stress in intertidal red algae Neoporphyra haitanensis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13480?af=R","date":1724695876000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Neoporphyra haitanensis</i>, a red alga harvested for food, thrives in the intertidal zone amid dynamic and harsh environments. High irradiance represents a major stressor in this habitat, posing a threat to the alga's photosynthetic apparatus. Interestingly, <i>N. haitanensis</i> has adapted to excessive light despite the absence of a crucial xanthophyll cycle-dependent photoprotection pathway. Thus, it is valuable to investigate the mechanisms by which <i>N. haitanensis</i> copes with excessive light and to understand the photoprotective roles of carotenoids. Under high light intensities and prolonged irradiation time, <i>N. haitanensis</i> displayed reduction in photosynthetic efficiency and phycobiliproteins levels, as well as different responses in carotenoids. The decreased carotene contents suggested their involvement in the synthesis of xanthophylls, as evidenced by the up-regulation of lycopene-β-cyclase (<i>lcyb</i>) and zeaxanthin epoxidase (<i>zep</i>) genes. Downstream xanthophylls such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and antheraxanthin increased proportionally to light stress, potentially participating in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). When accompanied by the enhanced activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), these factors resulted in a reduction in ROS production. The responses of intermediates α-cryptoxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin were felt somewhere between carotenes and zeaxanthin/lutein. Furthermore, these changes were ameliorated when the organism was placed in darkness. In summary, down-regulation of the organism's photosynthetic capacity, coupled with heightened xanthophylls and APX activity, activates photoinhibition quenching (qI) and antioxidant activity, helping <i>N. haitanensis</i> to protect the organism from the damaging effects of excessive light exposure. These findings provide insights into how red algae adapt to intertidal lifestyles.</p>","author":"Yongbo Huang, \nZiyu Weng, \nShuang Li, \nShuyu Zhang, \nHaimin Chen, \nQijun Luo, \nRui Yang, \nTao Liu, \nTiegan Wang, \nPeng Zhang, \nJuanjuan Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"1ca332aa8487e1761a57959d359b877a34e75d9c3576433ea3f941b59c8d04b4","category":"Environment"}
