{"title":"The integration of diel vertical migration and hydrodynamic process influences the transport of swimming crab zoea (Portunus trituberculatus)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fog.12695?af=R","date":1723612521000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Vertical migration and dispersal processes during the marine crab larval stage markedly affect transport, habitat selection, population connectivity, and resource replenishment success rates. However, not much is known of the reproductive ecology of swimming crabs in the nearshore waters of the northwest Pacific shelf. Here, we investigated the diel vertical migration (DVM) characteristics and transport patterns of the swimming crab zoea (<i>Portunus trituberculatus</i>) in this area. A Lagrangian particle-tracking algorithm coupled with a hydrodynamic model, incorporating a DVM pattern of zoeae based on observations from a field survey of the diurnal distribution of swimming crab zoea, was used to simulate the transport of zoeae, and the impact of zoeal transport on population connectivity was explored. The results revealed that particles were predominantly transported in a nearshore direction from the particle release point, with short dispersal distances during the zoeal stages. In nearshore waters on the continental shelf, the swimming crab zoeae are exposed to shoreward-moving currents with the aid of prolonged daytime locations in the lower water column, whereas larvae migrate upward to the middle and upper layers of the water column at night rather than the most superficial layer, potentially avoiding surface offshore-moving currents that may be responsible for the retention and shoreward transport of larvae. Most zoeae are transported to shallow waters, and the contribution of transport to population connectivity during the zoeal stages is relatively limited. The findings here have considerable implications for understanding the mechanisms governing the early recruitment dynamics of this species, as well as for fisheries management and conservation of marine biodiversity.</p>","author":"Huidong Jiang, \nZhenjiang Ye, \nYixiao Zhang, \nWenchao Zhang, \nYongjun Tian, \nJianchao Li, \nYang Liu, \nHaiqing Yu, \nXingui Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ddf10675d11d4e916ea2c59904318f6a27094a133dc6841be0937d77cc7558c9","entryHash":"31385840cf0a2f3bb24c3af2c73c21f19a696ce0ccdfde0d0f18a1d3e76b06eb","category":"Environment"}
