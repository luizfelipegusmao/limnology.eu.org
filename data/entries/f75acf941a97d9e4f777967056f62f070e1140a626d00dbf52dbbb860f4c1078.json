{"title":"456 Allocating distribution of pasture utilization across the grazing landscape in grazing steers equipped with virtual fencing collars","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/319/7757222?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Spatial utilization of pasture landscapes by grazing animals is often heterogeneous and driven by complex environmental and physiological interactions between plants and animals. Synergistic energy pathways can be modeled using mechanistic relationships describing resource distribution, animal behavior, metabolic energy rate, and pasture utilization using biometric sensors. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the ability to measure the energy landscape by mapping fine-scale contributions to animal energy expenditure, nutrient acquisition, growth, and overall economic profitability. We utilized animal trajectories and location fixes recorded by virtual fencing collars (Vence) daily body weight (BW) using precision livestock scales (Smartscale, C-Lock Inc.) and oxygen consumption (GreenFeeds, C-Lock Inc.) on steers (n = 127), managed as part of a broader project to evaluate environmental synergies in extensive grazing systems. Steers were allocated to one of six native grass pastures assigned to either rotational or continuous grazing strategies, and one of three stocking rates (low, moderate, high) in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement. Space utilization was quantified as the frequency of fixes located within each cell of a 5 x 5-meter Grid and the distance between grid cells and water was calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Movement behavior was quantified using Program R to calculate step length, the distance between two temporally continuous fix points utilizing the Pythagorean Theorem, and turn angles calculated as the cosine of the pre- and pro-ceeding step lengths where larger values indicated greater deviation from a straight trajectory. A mixed linear regression model was fitted using the lmer function in the lme4 package. Space utilization decreased with increased distance from water (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), with rotational grazing strategies increasing concentration around water sources (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). This indicates an opportunity to utilize precision livestock technology to facilitate pasture management and increase space utilization in grazing cattle.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"f75acf941a97d9e4f777967056f62f070e1140a626d00dbf52dbbb860f4c1078","category":"Environment"}
