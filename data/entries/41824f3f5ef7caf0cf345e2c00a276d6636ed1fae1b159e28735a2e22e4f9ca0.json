{"title":"Dryland Endolithic Chroococcidiopsis and Temperate Fresh Water Synechocystis Have Distinct Membrane Lipid and Photosynthesis Acclimation Strategies upon Desiccation and Temperature Increase","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/6/939/7379783?rss=1","date":1699315200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>An effect of climate change is the expansion of drylands in temperate regions, predicted to affect microbial biodiversity. Since photosynthetic organisms are at the base of ecosystem’s trophic networks, we compared an endolithic desiccation-tolerant <span>Chroococcidiopsis</span> cyanobacteria isolated from gypsum rocks in the Atacama Desert with a freshwater desiccation-sensitive <span>Synechocystis</span>. We sought whether some acclimation traits in response to desiccation and temperature variations were shared, to evaluate the potential of temperate species to possibly become resilient to future arid conditions. When temperature varies, <span>Synechocystis</span> tunes the acyl composition of its lipids, via a homeoviscous acclimation mechanism known to adjust membrane fluidity, whereas no such change occurs in <span>Chroococcidiopsis. Vice versa</span>, a combined study of photosynthesis and pigment content shows that <span>Chroococcidiopsis</span> remodels its photosynthesis components and keeps an optimal photosynthetic capacity at all temperatures, whereas <span>Synechocystis</span> is unable to such adjustment. Upon desiccation on a gypsum surface, <span>Synechocystis</span> is rapidly unable to revive, whereas <span>Chroococcidiopsis</span> is capable to recover after three weeks. Using X-ray diffraction, we found no evidence that <span>Chroococcidiopsis</span> could use water extracted from gypsum crystals in such conditions as a surrogate for missing water. The sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol becomes the prominent membrane lipid in both dehydrated cyanobacteria, highlighting an overlooked function for this lipid. <span>Chroococcidiopsis</span> keeps a minimal level of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, which may be essential for the recovery process. Results support that two independent adaptation strategies have evolved in these species to cope with temperature and desiccation increase and suggest some possible scenarios for microbial biodiversity change triggered by climate change.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"41824f3f5ef7caf0cf345e2c00a276d6636ed1fae1b159e28735a2e22e4f9ca0","category":"Environment"}
