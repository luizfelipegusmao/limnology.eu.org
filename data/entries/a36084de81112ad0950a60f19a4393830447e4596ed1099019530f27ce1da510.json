{"title":"Flammability Characterization of Particle Reinforced Carbon-Epoxy Composite","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0595/v1","date":1728399332000,"content":"In the aerospace industry, the performance of materials on extreme conditions is crucial. This study addresses the development of nanoparticle-reinforced composite materials to improve thermal properties and flame retardancy in aerospace applications. As first approach, Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were synthesized and incorporated into carbon fibers through the dip coating process. Subsequently, composite laminates were manufactured using the vacuum bag infusion method. The materials were subjected to flammability tests, following FAA regulations, to evaluate their performance against flame spread. The laminates reinforced with ZnO presented promise performances, suggesting a need for optimization in the incorporation of nanoparticles for safer and more efficient applications in the aerospace industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a36084de81112ad0950a60f19a4393830447e4596ed1099019530f27ce1da510","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
