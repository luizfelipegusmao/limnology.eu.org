{"title":"Evaluation of the Effects of Sedation and Anesthesia on Total Lung Volume and Attenuation in Rabbit Lung CT Exams","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1678/v1","date":1729578801000,"content":"Respiratory diseases are common in rabbits, but subclinical conditions can be challenging to diagnose and may cause respiratory problems during anesthesia. CT is the preferred method for diagnosing lung diseases, but anesthesia can alter lung volume and cause lung lobe collapse. In this study, seventeen healthy 5-month-old male New Zealand white rabbits underwent thoracic CT scans under different conditions. Rabbits were sedated with midazolam and butorphanol and scanned in a sphinx position they were then anesthetized with dexmedetomidine and ketamine and scanned again in sternal recumbency during spontaneous breathing. Lastly, apnea was induced using intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) for a final scan. Lung volume and density were measured using the 3D Slicer software, with thresholds set between -1050 and -100 Hounsfield Units (HU). Sedated animals had significantly higher total lung volume (69.39±10.04 cm³) than anesthetized (47.10±9.28 cm³) and anesthetized in apnea rabbits (48.60±7.40cm³). Mean lung attenuation during sedation was -611.26 HU (right) and -636.00 HU (left). After anesthesia induction, values increased to -552.75 HU (right) and -561.90 HU (left). Following apnea induction, attenuation slightly decreased to -569.40 HU (right) and -579.94 HU (left). The results indicate that sedation may be preferable for rabbit lung CT to minimize anesthesia-related changes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b8ee4b9b52ac9412bc847295b3009e000232b842f87ea9c98b9e381a5711cded","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
