{"title":"Reviewing the Trends of Social Value in Construction Research in the Last Decade: A Bibliometric Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0442/v1","date":1715157254000,"content":"This study explores the current landscape of social value (SV) research in the construction industry, analyzing global trends and identifying future research directions. Using bibliometric analysis, research published in Elsevier Scopus database from 2013 to 2023 was extracted using the keywords \"social value\" AND \"construction industry.\" Results indicate a focus on social value indicators, socioeconomic impacts, project management, innovative practices, and cross-sector collaborations. The study also reveals a lack of attention to SV in African countries' construction sectors. By highlighting research areas and identifying gaps, this study contributes to academic literature, suggesting the need for guidelines, particularly in developing countries, and advocating for further research on SV in the built environment and strategies for global social value creation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"189721181a208df0a462f67f6370caeb218a4ab169d38ee4f6dcafe9e2186abd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
