{"title":"A Distributed Computational Model for Estimating the Carbon Footprints of Companies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1468/v1","date":1716425768000,"content":"A new approach based on input-output (IO) analysis has emerged to estimate the carbon footprints of companies and their products from cradle to gate. While they rely on the same principles as the GHG Protocol, they use a distributed iterative framework to improve the footprint estimations and reduce their uncertainty. While optimal estimations would result if all the worldâ€™s companies would enter such a system, this paper shows how such a distributed system could apply to the real world where many enterprises would stay out of the system. We show how it would increase the quality of the estimations with respect the GHG Protocol by integrating scope 1 and scope 2 data of the value chains in the footprint estimations and reducing the part of remaining scope 3 data. To help analyzing uncertainty, we show how to use the scope 1/2/3 decomposition to estimate the biases and the standard deviations of the computed production intensities. We illustrate the model on macroeconomic data for 44 sectors and two regions (Europe and Rest of World), using the Inter-Country Input-Output database (ICIO). Such a system would necessarily rely on Information and Communication Technology since the companies would be permanently interconnected in a large-scale meshed network, using an application protocol for data exchange.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6a47d5c079539d440e10b69be33929949b3448ab250ff646ee5e6c3cd7e5e00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
