{"title":"Comprehensive Experimental Study of Insulating Aluminum Oxide (α-Al2O3) Using NUV- and EUV-Pulsed Atom Probe Tomography","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.051/7719479?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Atom probe tomography (APT) is an experimental technique that utilizes a cryogenically cooled nanoscale needle-shaped specimen and a high applied voltage with a short, pulsed voltage or laser trigger to induce field evaporation of single atoms from the sample tip. In the case of laser-pulsed APT, the laser incident on the tip apex triggers field ion evaporation, with the ions accelerated towards a 2D detector and analyzed via time-of-flight. Variations in the standing voltage (SV) applied between the local electrode and the sample tip, base temperature (T) of the sample, laser pulse energy (PE), and repetition rate of the laser trigger during acquisition may induce artifacts in APT data analysis, such as an incorrect chemical composition [<a href=\"#ozae044.051-B1\">1</a>]. Highly insulating materials are often difficult to run in traditional near-ultraviolet (NUV) APT but have shown promising results when examined in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) APT [<a href=\"#ozae044.051-B2\">2-4</a>]. Despite the limited NUV APT success in running these materials, the experimental parameters that lead to accurate analysis (APT results that agree with separately determined, trusted or known, composition) has not been thoroughly explored. Here, a high-<span>k</span> dielectric material, α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is used as a test material for the exploration of data analysis as several of the experimental parameters often used in APT are varied. The experimental variables used for both NUV (λ ≈355 nm) and EUV (λ ≈30 nm) atom probe systems are explored independently and then subsequently related to each other in terms of operating space and effect on chemical composition and peak shapes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9484b2d5e8d019f704ed5a1bf2ba2d409acac8bdeffc08ac3e09cfd261d7f7b2","category":"Environment"}
