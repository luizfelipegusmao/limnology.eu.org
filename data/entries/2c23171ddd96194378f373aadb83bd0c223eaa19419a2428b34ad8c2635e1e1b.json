{"title":"Impact of Left Diaphragmatic Dome Thickening on Selected Cardiovascular Parameters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0467/v1","date":1720099380000,"content":"Despite the diaphragm's direct connection with the heart through the phreno-pericardial ligament, little is still known about the role of this primary breathing muscle in the cardiovascular system. The purpose of the present study was to determine the relationship of diaphragm muscle thickness, thickening, and strength with selected cardiovascular parameters. Thirty participants who qualified for a three-week post-COVID physiotherapy program were examined. Diaphragm muscle thickness on the left and right sides was assessed using ultrasound. Blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated by an automatic oscillometric device, while the rest of the cardiovascular parameters were calculated using standardized formulas from the literature. We found a relationship between the left diaphragm dome thickening ratio and systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, stroke volume, cardiac index, ejection fraction, and saturation level measured after the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT). Patients with better left diaphragm dome strength were characterized by a lower difference in systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output, cardiac power output, ejection fraction, cardiac index, and pressure-heart rate product between pre- and post-6-MWT measurements. There was no correlation between right diaphragm dome function and cardiovascular parameters. There was no association of left and right hemidiaphragm function with resting cardiovascular parameters. In conclusion, the strength of the left hemidiaphragm plays an important role in the regulation and modulation of cardiovascular parameters during physical exertion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c23171ddd96194378f373aadb83bd0c223eaa19419a2428b34ad8c2635e1e1b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
