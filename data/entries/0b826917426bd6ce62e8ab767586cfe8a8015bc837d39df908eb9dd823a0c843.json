{"title":"An Improved Approach to Estimate Stocking Rate and Carrying Capacity Based on Remotely Sensed Phenology Timings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1365/v1","date":1713773860000,"content":"Accurate estimation of livestock carrying capacity (LCC) and implementing an appropriate actual stocking rate (ASR) is key to sustainable management of grazing adapted alpine grassland ecosystems. Reliable determination of aboveground biomass is fundamental to these determinations. Peak aboveground biomass (AGBP) captured from satellite data at the peak of the growing season (POS) is widely used as a proxy for annual aboveground biomass (AGBA) to estimate LCC of grasslands. Here we demonstrate limitations of this approach and highlight the ability of POS in the estimation of ASR. We develop and trail new approaches that incorporate remote sensing phenology timings of grassland response to grazing activity, considering relations between biomass growth and consumption dynamics, in efforts to support more accurate and reliable estimation of LCC and ASR. Results show that based on averaged values from large-scale studies of alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), differences between AGBP and AGBA underestimate LCC by about 31%. Findings from a smaller-scale study that incorporate phenology timings into estimation of annual aboveground biomass reveal that Haibei alpine meadows were overgrazed by 11.5% during the study period from 2000-2005. The methods proposed can be extended to map grassland grazing pressure by predicting LCC and tracking ASR, thereby improving sustainable resource use in alpine grasslands.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b826917426bd6ce62e8ab767586cfe8a8015bc837d39df908eb9dd823a0c843","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
