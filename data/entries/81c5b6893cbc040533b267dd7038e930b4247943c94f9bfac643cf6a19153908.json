{"title":"Sensorless Detection of Mechanical Unbalance in Servodrive with Elastic Coupling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0266/v1","date":1725399204000,"content":"The article focusses on detecting the unbalance of a mechanical component in the electric drive system of a two-mass servomechanism with a PMSM motor, which is connected to the load via a long, flexible shaft. In the example analysed, the degree of unbalance was determined using the reference current signal from the speed controller of the FOC control system. The authors pre-sented a two-mass model with an unbalanced mechanical system. The STFT transform was used to analyse the symptoms of unbalance and an artificial neural network MLP was used for system state inference. The effectiveness of the presented analysis, based on the reference current signal from the sensor embedded in the control system, was experimentally confirmed","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"81c5b6893cbc040533b267dd7038e930b4247943c94f9bfac643cf6a19153908","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
