{"title":"Multi-regulated GDP-l-galactose phosphorylase calls the tune in ascorbate biosynthesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/9/2631/7607105?rss=1","date":1707782400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Ascorbate is involved in numerous vital processes, in particular in response to abiotic but also biotic stresses whose frequency and amplitude increase with climate change. Ascorbate levels vary greatly depending on species, tissues, or stages of development, but also in response to stress. Since its discovery, the ascorbate biosynthetic pathway has been intensely studied and it appears that GDP-<span>l</span>-galactose phosphorylase (GGP) is the enzyme with the greatest role in the control of ascorbate biosynthesis. Like other enzymes of this pathway, its expression is induced by various environmental and also developmental factors. Although mRNAs encoding it are among the most abundant in the transcriptome, the protein is only present in very small quantities. In fact, GGP translation is repressed by a negative feedback mechanism involving a small open reading frame located upstream of the coding sequence (uORF). Moreover, its activity is inhibited by a PAS/LOV type photoreceptor, the action of which is counteracted by blue light. Consequently, this multi-level regulation of GGP would allow fine control of ascorbate synthesis. Indeed, experiments varying the expression of GGP have shown that it plays a central role in response to stress. This new understanding will be useful for developing varieties adapted to future environmental conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"94a07de0c2336210eb74638803a07db5a0405657987a1b3fd4640ebf95deceea","category":"Environment"}
