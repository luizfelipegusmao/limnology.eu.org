{"title":"Translation and Validation of the Greek Version of the Genomic Nursing Concept Inventory (GNCI): A Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0940/v1","date":1718281816000,"content":"This study aimed to translate and validate the Genomic Nursing Concept Inventory (GNCI) in Greek, analyze the genomic knowledge of nurses in Crete, Greece, and explore potential factors that could affect it. This cross-sectional study included 324 nurses from public hospitals and primary care units between July and December 2022. The GNCI is a 31-item questionnaire that evaluates genomic nursing concepts, but it has not been translated and validated in Greek. The translation process included independent forward translations, reconciliation, and back-translation. To evaluate internal consistency, Cronbach’s alpha was used, and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to determine the fit of the model. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the associations between the demographic variables and GNCI scores. The internal consistency of the GNCI was acceptable (Cronbach’s alpha= 0.622). The CFA indicated that the one-factor model had an adequate fit (SRMR = 0.076, CD = 0.677, CFI = 0.744). The mean GNCI score was moderate (0.35±0.14). Regression analysis suggested that only gender could affect GNCI scores, with female nurses scoring higher than male nurses (p&amp;gt;0.001). In conclusion, the Greek version of the GNCI is a reliable tool for assessing genomic knowledge among Greek nurses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"968a8bc84d575d5f0496eeb369351dbb8ac396ca2dea67312dfc8d7b1b2ec9c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
