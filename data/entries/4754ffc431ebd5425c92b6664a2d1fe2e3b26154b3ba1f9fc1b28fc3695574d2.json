{"title":"Which airways should we treat? Structure–function relationships and estimation of the singular input modes from the forward model alone","link":"https://academic.oup.com/imammb/article/40/4/291/7286684?rss=1","date":1695945600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Structure–function relationships occur throughout the sciences. Motivated by optimization of such systems, we develop a framework for estimating the input modes from the singular value decomposition from the action of the forward operator alone. These can then be used to determine the input (structure) changes, which induce the largest output (function) changes. The accuracy of the estimate is determined by reference to the method of snapshots. The proposed method is demonstrated on several example problems, and finally used to approximate the optimal airway treatment set for a problem in respiratory physiology.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Mathematical Medicine and Biology: A Journal of the IMA Current Issue","siteHash":"8e41cf2ed671fc83106bccd712981630d68940d521d41091ba0f730fc4a24554","entryHash":"4754ffc431ebd5425c92b6664a2d1fe2e3b26154b3ba1f9fc1b28fc3695574d2","category":"Environment"}
