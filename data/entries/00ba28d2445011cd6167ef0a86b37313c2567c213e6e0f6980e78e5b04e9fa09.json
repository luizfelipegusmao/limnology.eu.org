{"title":"Carcinogenesis of the Human Scalp. An Immunometabolic Centered View","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0450/v2","date":1727872184000,"content":"The human scalp is a common site of skin cancer in humans, with non-melanoma skin cancer being exceedingly common. In this review, two dermatologists with extensive experience in cutaneous oncology will discuss unique features of the epidemiology of cancer of the scalp. Clinical observations on these common skin cancers lead to insight into the pathogenesis and potential prevention and treatment of cutaneous scalp neoplasia. Our hypothesis is that the presence of hair protects against the development of skin cancer, but not by serving as a physical shield, but rather by providing a continuous IL-17 biased immunosurveillance. Loss of hair allow release from immunosurveillance, resulting in expansion of neoplastic cells towards skin cancer. Both hair follicles and metabolic changes in stroma allow permissiveness for tumor promotion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00ba28d2445011cd6167ef0a86b37313c2567c213e6e0f6980e78e5b04e9fa09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
