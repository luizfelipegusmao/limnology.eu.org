Contrary to widespread belief, pregnant women showed no decline in performance in memory tests. Moreover, pregnant women displayed better inhibitory control, reflected in lower error rate, and accompanied by greater P300 amplitude to “stop” signs, which may signify an enhanced neural efficiency. They also had significantly lower salivary cortisol levels.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A considerable proportion of women subjectively perceive a detriment to their cognitive capacity during pregnancy, with decreased memory functions being the most frequently self-reported concerns. However, objective investigation of these perceived cognitive deficits has yielded inconsistent results. This study focused on memory functions during late pregnancy using multiple tasks designed to assess various memory indices, for example, working memory, learning rate, immediate recall, proactive and retroactive interference, delayed recall, retrieval efficiency, visuospatial constructional ability, recognition, and executive function. Additionally, sustained attention and inhibitory control were examined using a combined recognition stop-signal task. Electrophysiological brain activity during this task was recorded using a 128-channel electroencephalographic-event-related potential system. Salivary cortisol levels were assessed both prior to and following the experimental session. In contrast to the widely held belief, results demonstrated that women in late pregnancy did not exhibit a decline in their performance across the various memory tests. In terms of accuracy, there was not a single task in which poorer performance was found for pregnant women. The quality of memory performance was comparable, and in some cases even superior, among women in the pregnancy group. On the stop-signal task, pregnant women exhibited significantly better performance, and their electrophysiological data revealed greater centrally distributed P300 amplitude to “stop” signs, which may signify an enhanced neural efficiency in the domains of inhibitory executive control. Endocrine results revealed that pregnant women exhibited significantly lower levels of salivary cortisol, suggesting an attenuation of hypothalamic−pituitary−adrenocortical axis activity, which may contribute to the optimization of fetal development and growth.</p>","author":"Sivan Raz","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences: Table of Contents","siteHash":"98c7119f6adff358c1cf3a15f5efdc68ead59681d375d3da00900b474221c3c5","entryHash":"b0d8db50fbd3af4e0364fb100944a4853150d4083c4306c977811fc0fa979454","category":"Environment"}
