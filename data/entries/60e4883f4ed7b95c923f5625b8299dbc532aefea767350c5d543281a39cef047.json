{"title":"Development of Sustainability Competencies in Secondary School Education. A Scoping Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0054/v1","date":1727780294000,"content":"This scoping review explores the development and application of sustainability competence frameworks in secondary education globally, identifying key trends and challenges within the field. An initial sample of 2,659 peer-reviewed publications from 2003 to 2023 was subjected to a rigorous multi-stage screening process, refining the selection for in-depth analysis. Through qualitative clustering, the review identifies two primary perspectives on sustainability competencies. The first emphasizes transversal competencies, relevant across diverse educational settings, including national policies, global educational guidelines, various subject domains, and innovative teaching-learning approaches. The second perspective focuses on specific frameworks that address the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of sustainability. The review highlights a global consensus on the importance of key competencies such as critical thinking, systems thinking, and action competence, which are essential for preparing secondary students to tackle sustainability challenges. Additionally, it stresses the need for a holistic approach to competence development that integrates cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects. Despite this consensus, the review reveals a research bias, with a predominance of studies from Europe, particularly Germany and Sweden, and calls for increased regional diversity and collaboration in future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60e4883f4ed7b95c923f5625b8299dbc532aefea767350c5d543281a39cef047","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
