{"title":"Association of VDR Polymorphisms with Muscle Mass Development in Elite Young Soccer Players: A Pilot Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1560/v1","date":1721379764000,"content":"Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is an important candidate gene in musculoskeletal phenotypes. Polymorphisms in VDR have been previously associated with several pathologies and muscular strength in athletes and elderly people, however literature reported contradictory results. The object of this research is to verify the association between the most studied VDR variants (rs2228570, rs7975232, and rs1544410) and the increase of muscle mass in elite young soccer players. A sample of 55 soccer players (15-18 years old) form a professional team was selected for this study. DNA was extracted by salting out method and polymorphisms were genotyped by PCR-RFLP, followed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. To test the effect of the three SNPs, logistic regression analysis was applied. Body composition was carried out through skinfold thickness method, and muscular area of arm and lower limb were calculated using Frisancho formulas. All three polymorphisms met Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p &amp;gt; 0.05) and their frequencies fell within the worldwide variability. A significant correlation between rs1544410 and increase of calf muscle mass was observed. Individuals carrying A allele showed higher calf muscular mass than those carrying the G allele (p = 0.034). Moreover, haplotype analysis applied to the two SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (rs7975232 and rs1544410), showed that AG haplotype resulted negatively correlated to calf muscle area. In conclusion, we confirm an association between VDR polymorphisms and muscular mass that could encourage the genetic screening of VDR gene to identify a potential risk of injury and for individual nutritional interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6afbd73556fee64f0c3c3caf6d3cb5f1a4a1f5ce1e5d3a367e696f9414a74566","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
