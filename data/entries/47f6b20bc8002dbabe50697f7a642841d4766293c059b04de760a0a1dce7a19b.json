{"title":"Mullus barbatus L. and Mullus surmuletus L. from western Mediterranean waters (SE Spain) are infected by Hysterothylacium fabri, but not by zoonotic nematodes. Possible impact on fish hosts#","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13989?af=R","date":1726037099000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In order to know whether there is a risk of anisakiasis (or anisakidosis) by consumption of fish of the genus <i>Mullus</i> from the western Mediterranean Sea, which are appreciated for their quality, an epidemiological survey was carried out to evaluate the occurrence of zoonotic or potentially zoonotic nematodes in <i>M. barbatus</i> and <i>M. surmuletus</i>. Although the presence of the third larval stage (L3) of anisakids (<i>Anisakis</i> and <i>Contracaecum</i>) has been previously described in these fish, the results showed the absence of anisakids and the presence, never in muscle, of L3 and L4 of raphidascaridids of the genus <i>Hysterothylacium</i>, molecularly identified as <i>H. fabri</i>. Phylogenetic analysis groups them into the Mediterranean Sea clade, far from individuals isolated in the Pacific Ocean. Prevalence was slightly higher, but not significant, in <i>M. barbatus</i> versus <i>M. surmuletus</i> (72.3% vs 60.0%), but mean intensity (MI) and mean abundance (MA) parameters were approximately twice as high in <i>M. barbatus</i> as in <i>M. surmuletus</i> (MI 5.8 vs 2.8, <i>p</i> = .001; MA 4.2 vs 1.7, <i>p</i> &lt; .001). The presence of the parasite seems to have different effects on these two sympatric species. In <i>M. barbatus</i> it seems to affect their growth, as it appreciably reduces the value of allometry coefficient in infected fish (2.78 vs. 2.18). On the other hand, in <i>M. surmuletus</i> the infection significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; .04) affects the Fulton's condition factor, an indicator of the health status of the fish. It can be concluded that the ingestion of these fish by the people poses negligible risk of anisakiasis, but the consumer should continue to be urged to follow the rules of prevention against this illness.</p>","author":"Manuel Morales‐Yuste, \nJesús López‐Valverde, \nNatalia Sánchez‐Fernández, \nJesús Veiga, \nMario Garrido, \nFrancisco Javier Adroher, \nRocío Benítez","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"47f6b20bc8002dbabe50697f7a642841d4766293c059b04de760a0a1dce7a19b","category":"Environment"}
