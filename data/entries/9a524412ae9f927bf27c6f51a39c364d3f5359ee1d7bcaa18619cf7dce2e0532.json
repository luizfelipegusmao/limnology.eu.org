{"title":"Computational Vision Algorithms on the Edge for Unpalleting System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0394/v1","date":1720069097000,"content":"This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of four different computational vision algorithms for implementing an unpalleting system in a factory environment, under typical edge computing constraints. The primary objective is to automate the process of detecting and locating specific variable-shaped objects on a pallet, enabling a robotic system to accurately unstack them. The four algorithms evaluated are Pattern Matching, Scale-Invariant Feature Transform, Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF, and Haar cascade classifiers. Each technique is described in detail in this paper, and their implementations are outlined. Experimental results are thoroughly analyzed, assessing the algorithmsâ€™ performance based on accuracy, robustness to variability, computational speed, detection sensitivity, and resource consumption. The findings reveal the strengths and limitations of each algorithm, providing valuable insights for selecting the most appropriate technique based on the specific requirements of the unpalleting system. This research contributes to the advancement of automated object detection and localization in industrial environments, paving the way for more efficient and reliable unpalleting systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a524412ae9f927bf27c6f51a39c364d3f5359ee1d7bcaa18619cf7dce2e0532","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
