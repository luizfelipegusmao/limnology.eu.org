{"title":"4D STEM and EELS Acquired Simultaneously with a Fast Pixelated Direct Detector with Center Hole","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.129/7719413?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>In four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D STEM) imaging, a focused beam of electrons scans the sample in a two-dimensional (2D) raster pattern, while a two-dimensional (2D) image is recorded at each scan position. This technique is meanwhile commonly used and is applied to a wide range of materials. We present an ultrafast and direct electron detection system, the pnCCD (S)TEM camera [<a href=\"#ozae044.129-B1\">1</a>] which is equipped with a novel chip with a center hole in the middle of the detector. The annular pnCCD sensor with a central hole (264x264, 48Âµm2, physical hole 2.5mm diameter) allows the central beam component to pass through the detector, thus becoming available to the EELS instrumentation, without losing the possibility to recontruct 4D data [<a href=\"#ozae044.129-B2\">2</a>]. The pnCCD (S)TEM camera is compatible with electron energies ranging from 10 keV to 300 keV and can be operated with up to 7500 frames per second. If long dwell times are used for the EELS measurement, online averaging over any number of frames is possible to reduce data while extending the dynamic range by reading out multiple times per scan pixel.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e31ebf48258172e76e34b1cf4437b29c848a7d2e731842703b9c3928b010b46a","category":"Environment"}
