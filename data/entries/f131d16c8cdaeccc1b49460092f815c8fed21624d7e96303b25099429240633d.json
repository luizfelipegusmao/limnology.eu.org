{"title":"Determining the phosphorus release curve for Sunphase HT phytase in nursery pig diets","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txad140/7477103?rss=1","date":1702857600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A total of 280 pigs (DNA 241 × 600, initially 10.4 ± 0.24 kg) were used in a 21-d study to determine the available P (<strong>aP</strong>) release curve for Sunphase HT phytase (Wuhan Sunhy Biology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, P.R. China) when fed diets with a high phytate concentration. On day 21 post-weaning, considered day 0 of the study, pigs were blocked by average pen body weight (<strong>BW</strong>) and randomly allotted to 1 of 7 dietary treatments with 5 pigs per pen and 8 pens per treatment. Dietary treatments were derived from a single basal diet, and ingredients including phytase, monocalcium P, limestone, and sand were added to create the treatment diets. Treatments included three diets with increasing (0.11%, 0.19%, and 0.27%) aP from monocalcium P, or four diets with increasing phytase (250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 phytase unit (<strong>FTU</strong>)/kg) added to the diet formulated to 0.11% aP. All diets were corn–soybean meal–canola meal-based and were formulated to contain 1.24% SID Lys, a 1.10:1 total calcium-to-phosphorus ratio, and a calculated 0.32% phytate P. Prior to the beginning of the study, all pigs were fed a diet containing 0.11% aP from days 18 to 21 post-weaning. At the conclusion of the study, 1 pig, closest to the mean weight of each pen, was euthanized, and the right fibula, 10th rib, and metacarpal were collected to determine bone ash and density. After cleaning, bones were submerged in ultra-purified water under a vacuum for 4 h and then weighed to calculate the density (Archimedes principle). For bone ash, bones were processed using the non-defatted method. From days 0 to 21, increasing aP from monocalcium P increased (linear, <span>P </span>≤ 0.014) average daily gain (<strong>ADG</strong>), gain-to-feed (<strong>G:F</strong>), and final BW. Pigs fed increasing phytase had increased (linear, <span>P</span> ≤ 0.045) ADG, final BW, and plasma inositol concentration as well as improved (quadratic, <span>P </span>= 0.023) G:F. For bone characteristics, pigs fed increasing aP from inorganic P had a linear improvement (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.019) in fibula bone ash weight and percentage bone ash, rib bone ash weight and bone density, and all metacarpal bone properties, with a quadratic response (<span>P </span>≤ 0.030) for fibula bone density and rib percentage ash. Additionally, pigs fed increasing phytase had increased (<span>P </span>&lt; 0.05) bone ash weight, percentage bone ash, and bone density in either a linear or quadratic fashion depending on the bone analyzed. The available P release curve generated for Sunphase HT phytase for percentage bone ash combining values from the right fibula, 10th rib, and metacarpal is aP release, % = (0.360 × FTU) ÷ (2,330.250 + FTU).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"f131d16c8cdaeccc1b49460092f815c8fed21624d7e96303b25099429240633d","category":"Environment"}
