{"title":"Organizational Resilience Opacity in the Prism of Circular Strategy &ndash; Metal Industry Manufacturing Practice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1435/v1","date":1726662590000,"content":"This study investigates the impact of circular economy (CE) strategies on organizational resilience (OR) within the metal industry, focusing on a case study of a forging department in a large man-ufacturing company. The idea of the paper is to link the macroeconomic topic of circular economy (CE) with microeconomic and practical activities in the organization, exploring how CE principles can improve resource efficiency, sustainability, and organizational resilience. A systematic literature review and case study methodology were used to assess the relationship between CE and OR. The findings reveal that companies with higher circularity demonstrate better resilience, both in normal operations and during crises. Specifically, in the case study, the closure of the forging department, following a detailed analysis using the Inputs-Mediators-Outputs (IMO) model, emerged as the most sustainable option, yielding financial, environmental, and operational benefits. This decision aligned with the companyâ€™s long-term goals of energy efficiency and carbon neutrality. The research highlights the significance of integrating CE strategies with business processes to not only achieve sustainability but also to build a more adaptable and resilient organization. Future research should explore broader applications of this framework across different industries to strengthen the links between circular economy practices and organizational resilience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b62db6a81d275abaf360faaeca7a8fd84066a1b6a5646df53209cc38f17b930","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
