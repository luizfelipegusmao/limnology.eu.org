However, continuously tracking food and fluid intake during daily activities can be complex. In this study, we present a machine-learning-powered smart neckband that features wireless connectivity and a comfortable, foldable design. Initially considered beneficial for managing conditions such as diabetes and obesity by facilitating dietary control, the device's utility extends beyond these applications. It has proved to be valuable for sports enthusiasts, individuals focused on diet control, and general health monitoring. Its wireless connectivity, ergonomic design, and advanced classification capabilities offer a promising solution for overcoming the limitations of traditional dietary tracking methods, highlighting its potential in personalized healthcare and wellness strategies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"df3fe5210b7ee9f9b39e56080c971fb0bfbf20951331865c67952bc9e5e08422","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
