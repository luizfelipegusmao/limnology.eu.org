{"title":"Observation and Numerical Simulation of Cross-Mountain Airflow at the Hong Kong International Airport from Range Height Indicator Scans of Radar and LIDAR","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2185/v1","date":1727414294000,"content":"Apart from headwind changes, crosswind changes may be hazardous to the aircraft operation. This paper presents two cases of recently observed crosswind changes from the range height indicator scans of ground-based remote-sensing meteorological equipment, namely, an X-band microwave radar and a short-range LIDAR. Rapidly evolving winds have been observed by the equipment in tropical cyclone situations, and they are found to have high level of turbulence and possibly to be associated with vertically propagating waves. In order to study the feasibility of predicting such disturbed airflow, mesoscale meteorological model and computational fluid dynamics model with high spatial resolution are used in this paper. It is found that the models could capture the rapidly evolving airflow features rather well, including the turbulence level, the waves, the rapidly changing wind speeds and the presence of reverse flow. This paper aims at providing a reference to the airports to consider the feasibility of performing high resolution numerical simulation of rapidly evolving airflow to alert the pilots in advance for airports in complex terrain and setup of buildings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f66205c56740b7df73e6b84f4bcf63bea354320b597d7d697a9c772d99cf6fef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
