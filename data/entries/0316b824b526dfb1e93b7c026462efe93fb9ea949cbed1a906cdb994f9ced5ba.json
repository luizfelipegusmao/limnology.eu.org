{"title":"Chromosome-Scale Genome Assembly and Characterization of Top-Quality Japanese Green Tea Cultivar ‘Seimei’","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/8/1271/7684337?rss=1","date":1716768000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Japanese green tea, an essential beverage in Japanese culture, is characterized by the initial steaming of freshly harvested leaves during production. This process efficiently inactivates endogenous enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, resulting in the production of sencha, gyokuro and matcha that preserves the vibrant green color of young leaves. Although genome sequences of several tea cultivars and germplasms have been published, no reference genome sequences are available for Japanese green tea cultivars. Here, we constructed a reference genome sequence of the cultivar ‘Seimei’, which is used to produce high-quality Japanese green tea. Using the PacBio HiFi and Hi-C technologies for chromosome-scale genome assembly, we obtained 15 chromosome sequences with a total genome size of 3.1 Gb and an N50 of 214.9 Mb. By analyzing the genomic diversity of 23 Japanese tea cultivars and lines, including the leading green tea cultivars ‘Yabukita’ and ‘Saemidori’, it was revealed that several candidate genes could be related to the characteristics of Japanese green tea. The reference genome of ‘Seimei’ and information on genomic diversity of Japanese green tea cultivars should provide crucial information for effective breeding of such cultivars in the future.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"0316b824b526dfb1e93b7c026462efe93fb9ea949cbed1a906cdb994f9ced5ba","category":"Environment"}
