{"title":"Lipid Oxidation Products and the Risk of Cardiovascular Diseases: Role of Lipoprotein Transport","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0781/v1","date":1710335477000,"content":"Abstract\n   Cholesterol has ruled the history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (CVD) for decades, and the transport of cholesterol by lipoproteins has become a cornerstone of our view of etiology of the disease. Discovery of the lipoprotein-specific transport of lipid oxidation products (LOP) has opened a new and exciting area in research of CVD by revealing strong connections between atherogenic LOP, lipoprotein transport functions and CVD. This review goes through the evidence in support of the lipoprotein-specific LOP transport and speculates of possible consequences of the proposed role of lipoprotein LOP transport as a risk factor. Association of lipoprotein LOP with known risk factors of CVD are largely parallel with those of cholesterol, and due to the common transport and cellular intake mechanisms the elucidation of independent effects of either cholesterol or LOP is difficult. Yet, unlike cholesterol, LOP can directly initiate and boost atherogenic processes. It therefore appears inevitable that increasing knowledge of the lipoprotein-specific LOP transport will affect the present view of the role of cholesterol in aetiology and as a risk factor of CVD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e4d72574c7cbba4c5fcfcd3c224f66086df36d5a339b12f4b8b9c57ee63fdfb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
