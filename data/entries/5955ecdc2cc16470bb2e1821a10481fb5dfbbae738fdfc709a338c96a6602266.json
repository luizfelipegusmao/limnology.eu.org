{"title":"Sudden Blurring of Vision and Micropsia Following Acute Hot Pepper Consumption: A Case Report and Hypothesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1177/v1","date":1726482655000,"content":"Background: Retinal hemorrhages are an important ophthalmic diagnostic sign of underlying systemic vascular disorder. Capsaicin is a bioactive component of chili peppers used in most countries. Capsaicin crosses the bloodâ€“brain barrier in an efficient manner. Human exposure to capsaicinoids through diet is frequent and often substantial. Presumed lack of capsaicin toxicity in diet does not preclude rare adverse effects related to actions on the central neural system. Particularly on the retina, due to the reasons outlined in this case report.  \nMethods: A case of a 34-year-old man, who reported sudden blurring of vision and micropsia in his left eye following ingestion of a considerable amount of red pepper. \nResults: The case study suggests that acute or chronic consumption of substantial amounts of hot red pepper in individuals with high reactivity towards TRPV1 agonists and/or higher expression of TRPV1 receptors in retinal ganglion cells causes retinal neovascularization. \nConclusion: Acute consumption of red pepper may harm vision. This hypothesis can be easily evaluated retrospectively in larger sets of data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5955ecdc2cc16470bb2e1821a10481fb5dfbbae738fdfc709a338c96a6602266","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
