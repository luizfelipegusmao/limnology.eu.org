{"title":"From Fossil Fuels to Renewables: Clustering European Primary Energy Production from 1990 to 2022","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1713/v1","date":1729590305000,"content":"The purpose of this research is to analyze the structural changes in primary energy production across European countries over the period from 1990 to 2022, with a focus on understanding the shifts in energy sources and their implications for energy security and sustainability. By applying clustering methods, the study categorizes European nations into distinct groups based on their primary energy production profiles, revealing significant transitions from fossil fuel-based systems to those increasingly dominated by renewable energy sources. The analysis demonstrates that while some countries have achieved substantial progress in integrating renewable energy, others remain heavily dependent on traditional energy sources such as coal and natural gas. Additionally, the study highlights the growing importance of natural gas as a transitional fuel and the relatively stable role of nuclear energy in certain regions. A key finding of this research is the disparity between energy production and consumption across Europe, with many large economies facing a persistent deficit in domestic energy production, leading to a high reliance on energy imports, particularly of natural gas and oil. This reliance poses significant challenges for energy security, especially in light of recent geopolitical disruptions and fluctuations in global energy markets. The paper also explores the environmental implications of these energy production trends, emphasizing the critical role of renewable energy in meeting the European Unionâ€™s decarbonization targets and combating climate change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"403ead240d6d3d6929cb1dd4b70d00f4e7848c82c51cb9c2d3de72afd728ae94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
