{"title":"Adaptive QP algorithm for depth range prediction and encoding output in virtual reality video encoding process","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310904","date":1727272800000,"content":"<p>by Hui Yang, Qiuming Liu, Chao Song</p>\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce the encoding complexity and stream size, improve the encoding performance and further improve the compression performance, the depth prediction partition encoding is studied in this paper. In terms of pattern selection strategy, optimization analysis is carried out based on fast strategic decision-making methods to ensure the comprehensiveness of data processing. In the design of adaptive strategies, different adaptive quantization parameter adjustment strategies are adopted for the equatorial and polar regions by considering the different levels of user attention in 360 degree virtual reality videos. The purpose is to achieve the optimal balance between distortion and stream size, thereby managing the output stream size while maintaining video quality. The results showed that this strategy achieved a maximum reduction of 2.92% in bit rate and an average reduction of 1.76%. The average coding time could be saved by 39.28%, and the average reconstruction quality was 0.043, with almost no quality loss detected by the audience. At the same time, the model demonstrated excellent performance in sequences of 4K, 6K, and 8K. The proposed deep partitioning adaptive strategy has significant improvements in video encoding quality and efficiency, which can improve encoding efficiency while ensuring video quality.","author":"Hui Yang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"66ae916157f94e8a07fb7b7d0250ad87fb16593b3a8a1cdb944a5f746192283a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
