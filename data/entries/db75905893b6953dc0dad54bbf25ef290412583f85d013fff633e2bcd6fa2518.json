TLRs are known to mediate both antitumor effects and tumorigenesis. TLRs are abundant in many cancers, but their expression in small bowel neuroendocrine tumors (SB-NETs) is unknown. We aimed to characterize the expression of TLRs 1–9 in SB-NETs and lymph node metastases and evaluate their prognostic relevance. The present study included 125 patients with SB-NETs, of whom 95 had lymph node metastases, from two Finnish hospitals. Tissue samples were stained immunohistochemically for TLR expression, assessed based on cytoplasmic and nucleic staining intensity and percentage of positively stained cells. Statistical methods for survival analysis included Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression adjusted for confounding factors. Disease-specific survival (DSS) was the primary outcome. TLRs 1–2 and 4–9 were expressed in SB-NETs and lymph node metastases. TLR3 showed no positive staining. In primary SB-NETs, TLRs 1–9 were not associated with survival. For lymph node metastases, high cytoplasmic TLR7 intensity associated with worse DSS compared to low cytoplasmic intensity (26.4% vs. 84.9%, p = 0.028). Adjusted mortality hazard (HR) was 3.90 (95% CI 1.07–14.3). The expression of TLRs 1–6 and 8–9 in lymph node metastases were not associated with survival. SB-NETs and their lymph node metastases express cytoplasmic TLR 1–2 and 4–9 and nucleic TLR5. High TLR7 expression in SB-NET lymph node metastases was associated with worse prognosis. The current research has future perspective, as it can help create base for clinical drug trials to target specific TLRs with agonists or antagonists to treat neuroendocrine tumors.","author":"Niko Hiltunen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"db75905893b6953dc0dad54bbf25ef290412583f85d013fff633e2bcd6fa2518","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
