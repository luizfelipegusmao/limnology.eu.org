{"title":"Enhancing Early Detection of Sepsis in Neonates through Multimodal Biosignal Integration: A Study of Pulse Oximetry, Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), and Skin Temperature Monitoring","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1828/v1","date":1716888377000,"content":"Sepsis still remains one of the most difficult conditions to diagnose as it presents unspecific clinical signs and symptoms, which makes early detection crucial. Our study aimed to enhance the accuracy of sepsis diagnosis by integrating multimodal monitoring technologies with traditional diagnostic methods. The research involved 121 newborns, comprising 39 cases of late-onset sepsis, 35 cases of early-onset sepsis, and 47 control subjects. Biosignals including pulse oximetry (PO), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and skin temperature (ST) were continuously monitored and an algorithm was developed using Python for identifying early signs of sepsis. The model demonstrated the ability to detect sepsis 6 to 48 hours in advance with an accuracy rate of 87.67% Â± 7.42%. Sensitivity and specificity were recorded at 76% and 90%, respectively, with NIRS and ST having the most significant impact on predictive accuracy. Despite the promising results, limitations such as sample size, data variability, and potential biases were noted. The findings highlight the critical role of non-invasive biosensing methods in conjunction with traditional biomarkers and cultures, offering a robust framework for early sepsis detection and improved neonatal care. Further studies are recommended to validate these results across diverse clinical settings","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e737f0bb8a51188e92407f4f076ab80e569d9e883f70830c4cf11ace7eef4482","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
