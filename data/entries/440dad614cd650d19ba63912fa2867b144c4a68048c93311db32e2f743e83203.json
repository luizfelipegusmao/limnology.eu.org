{"title":"Perceptions and Awareness of the Effectiveness of Nature-based Solutions in Selected Coastal Communities of Rivers State, Nigeria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1198/v1","date":1726542679000,"content":"Nature-based solutions (NbS) have gained global attention for addressing societal challenges, benefiting biodiversity, and promoting human well-being. NbS have been increasingly recognized for their role in mitigating climate change impacts, such as coastal flooding. However, despite their integration into policy frameworks in Europe and parts of Africa, there remains limited empirical evidence regarding their effectiveness. This study seeks to address this gap by exploring the factors influencing perceptions and awareness of the effectiveness of NbS in coastal communities. A structured survey questionnaire was administered in three coastal communities—Kula, Oyorokoto, and Bonny—examining how perception, knowledge, and socio-economic factors affect the effectiveness of NbS. Results show that socio-economic factors such as age, education, and occupation significantly influence the perceived effectiveness of NbS. Additionally, awareness was found to have a stronger impact on effectiveness than perception. The study concludes that awareness-raising initiatives, particularly those focused on the protective benefits of mangroves, are crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of NbS. Conservation, afforestation, and restoration of coastal ecosystems are recommended as key strategies for promoting NbS and their role in climate resilience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"440dad614cd650d19ba63912fa2867b144c4a68048c93311db32e2f743e83203","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
