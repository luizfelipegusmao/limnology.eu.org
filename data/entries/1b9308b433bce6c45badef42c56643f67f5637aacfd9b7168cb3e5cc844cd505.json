{"title":"Evaluating Synergistic Effects of Hyaluronic Acid, Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells, and Growth Hormones in Knee Osteoarthritis: A Multi-Arm Randomized Trials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1003/v1","date":1723599597000,"content":"Background: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) significantly affects quality of life and imposes economic burdens due to its prevalence and the disability it causes. The efficacy of current treatments is limited to alleviate the symptoms and not for regenerative purposes. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining hyaluronic acid (HA), human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs), and synthetic human growth hormone (somatotropin) in the treatment of knee OA, assessing pain relief, functional improvement, and cartilage regeneration. Methods: A four-arm, double-blind randomized trial was conducted with 51 knees from 28 subjects, aged â‰¥ 50 with primary knee OA. Treatments involved are HA alone, HA with hUC-MSCs, HA with somatotropin, and a combination of all three. Efficacy was measured through the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and visual analog score (VAS) along with MRI T2 mapping of cartilage were taken on pre-implantation, 6th and 12th month. Results: All treatment arms showed improvement in VAS and WOMAC scores over 12 months, suggesting some pain relief and functional improvement. However, MRI T2 mapping showed no significant cartilage regeneration across the groups. Conclusion: While combined use of HA, hUC-MSCs, and somatotropin improved symptoms of knee OA, it did not enhance cartilage regeneration significantly. The study highlights the potential of these combinations for symptom management but underscores the need for further research to optimize these therapies for regenerative outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b9308b433bce6c45badef42c56643f67f5637aacfd9b7168cb3e5cc844cd505","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
