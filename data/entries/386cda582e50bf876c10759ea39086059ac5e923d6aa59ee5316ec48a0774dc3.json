{"title":"Can venture capital shareholding improve M&A performance? An empirical study based on Chinese GEM-listed companies","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308932","date":1723730400000,"content":"<p>by Kun Chao, Meijia Wang, Yanyong Hu, Shixue Wang</p>\r\n\r\nExisting studies have explored the impact of venture capital shareholding on the GEM-listed companies before and after listing from multiple perspectives. However, there has been limited research on the influence of venture capital shareholding on these companies’ mergers and acquisitions(M&amp;A) activities and performance. Additionally, two conflicting research findings have been presented in limited relevant studies. In order to clarify the mechanism by which venture capital shareholding affects M&amp;A activities and performance of GEM-listed companies and verify existing research conclusions, this paper takes 468 M&amp;A events completed by the acquirer of China’s GEM-listed companies between 2014 and 2016 as samples to explore venture capital shareholding’s effects on the M&amp;A performance of GEM-listed enterprises. The empirical findings demonstrate that GEM-listed enterprises with venture capital shareholding perform significantly better in terms of short-term and long-term M&amp;A performance than those without; with the increase in venture capital shareholding ratio, the short-term M&amp;A performance of GEM-listed enterprises has remarkably improved, but the long-term M&amp;A performance does not show obvious correlation; joint investment of venture capital can significantly improve the short-term M&amp;A performance of GEM-listed enterprises, but it has no substantial influence on long-term M&amp;A performance. Based on further analysis of the empirical study, it is concluded that the common one-share ownership structure of GEM-listed enterprises is not conducive to the play of the monitoring function of venture capital, and the insufficient incentives and free-riding thinking also weaken the motivation and input of some venture capital shareholders to provide value-added services. This study systematically elucidates the mechanism and impact of venture capital shareholding on the M&amp;A performance of GEM-listed companies, addressing the shortcomings in existing research. It is conducive for GEM-listed companies to gain a rational understanding and effectively leverage the active role of venture capital shareholders in M&amp;A activities.","author":"Kun Chao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"386cda582e50bf876c10759ea39086059ac5e923d6aa59ee5316ec48a0774dc3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
