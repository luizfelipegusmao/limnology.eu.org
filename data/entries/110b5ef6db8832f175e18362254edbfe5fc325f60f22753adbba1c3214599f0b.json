We retrospectively reviewed the charts of the participants allocated to receive DIMS spectacles (Hoya® MiyoSmart®) or single vision spectacle lenses (control group). Cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE) and axial length (AL), were measured at baseline and at 36 month follow up. The results were stratified by age into four groups: patients that wore DIMS spectacles oldest or youngest than 10 years of age (respectively, group A, 20 patients mean age 13.6±2.2 and group C, 20 patients mean age 9.0±1.2) and age-matched control groups (group B, 18 patients mean age 13.2±2.5 and group D, 22 patients mean age 8.5±0.9).\nResults: At 36 months, SE and AL increase resulted significantly reduced in groups A and C, respectively compared to groups B and D (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"110b5ef6db8832f175e18362254edbfe5fc325f60f22753adbba1c3214599f0b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
