{"title":"Oral stimulation with glucose and fructose, but not sucrose, accelerates gastric emptying in humans","link":"https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjae028/7719353?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Postprandial regulation of the gastric emptying (GE) rate plays an important role in food intake. Although oral sweetening with glucose may accelerate GE, the effects of different sweetness intensities of glucose (10% and 20%, w/v) and other energy sweeteners (e.g. fructose and sucrose) remain uncertain. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of different glucose concentrations (Experiment 1) and different sugars with the same sweet taste intensity (Experiment 2) on postprandial GE. In both experiments, after ingesting a 200 kcal carbohydrate solution containing 50 g of maltodextrin, participants repeatedly sipped, but did not swallow, one of three (water, 10% and 20%, w/v glucose) or four (water and equally sweet 20%, w/v glucose, 12%, w/v fructose, and 14%, w/v sucrose) solutions for 1 min every 5 min over a 30 min period. GE was evaluated by measuring the temporal change in the cross-sectional area of the gastric antrum using ultrasound. In Experiment 1, oral stimulation with 20% (w/v) glucose resulted in greater GE than the control stimulus (i.e. water), but the effect of stimulation with 10% (w/v) glucose on GE was not different from that of the control stimulus. In Experiment 2, stimulation with 20% (w/v) glucose or 12% (w/v) fructose resulted in greater GE than the control stimulus. However, the effect of stimulation with 14% (w/v) sucrose on GE did not differ from that of the control stimulus. Consequently, oral stimulation with glucose or fructose solutions of moderate to high sweetness following a meal facilitates postprandial GE.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"5586730f9f393c6bf6e589f52c17b9ceb220e24fa0980d5d69e8977296625983","category":"Environment"}
