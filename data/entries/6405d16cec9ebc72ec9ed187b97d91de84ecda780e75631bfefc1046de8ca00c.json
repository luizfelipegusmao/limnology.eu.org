{"title":"Making mobile nanotechnology accessible: is the explicit preparation of Janus nanoparticle necessary to achieve mobility ?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0820/v1","date":1725969606000,"content":"This study investigates the necessity of particle asymmetry for self-propulsion in nanomotors. While conventional wisdom posits that asymmetric designs are crucial for generating phoretic forces or localized bubble propulsion, recent research suggests that symmetrical particles may also exhibit motility. To address this debate, we developed a robust workflow for synthesizing gold grafted silica nanoparticles with precise control over size and shape, enabling the direct comparison of their motile behavior by dynamic light scattering and particle tracking velocimetry. Our results indicate that the inherent asymmetry generated during isotropic gold nanoparticle deposition onto silica surfaces may enable particle motility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6405d16cec9ebc72ec9ed187b97d91de84ecda780e75631bfefc1046de8ca00c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
