Four different <i>N</i>. <i>lugens</i> biotypes have been identified worldwide, with biotype 4 being the most destructive and prevalent throughout Asia, particularly in India. Therefore, a rice variety with multiple resistance genes/alleles is required for effective management of <i>N</i>. <i>lugens</i>. Hence, 191 rice genotypes collected from various parts of India were evaluated for resistance to <i>N</i>. <i>lugens</i>. Further, SSR markers representing 23 different <i>N</i>. <i>lugens</i> resistant (R) genes were assayed to identify genomic regions associated with resistance. The results of the genetic analysis showed that the average genetic diversity value of all markers was 0.165 and polymorphic information content of 0.145 for all the markers used. The population structure and cluster analysis divided the studied genotypes into three distinct groups, with resistant genotypes grouped separately. These findings were confirmed by the principal coordinate analysis, which categorized resistant genotypes, moderately resistant genotypes, and susceptible genotypes into distinct components. Additionally, 90% of the genetic variation was between individuals of populations and 10% between the populations. Marker-trait association study through mixed linear model and generalized linear model identified six SSR markers such as RM6732 (<i>Bph15</i>), RM314 (<i>Bph6</i>), RM16999 (<i>Bph6</i>), RM7 (<i>QBph3</i>), RM401 (<i>bph4</i>), and RM7102 (<i>Bph1</i>), which were significantly associated with various phenotypic parameters, such as feeding mark, honeydew excretion, percent damage and nymphal survival. The resistant genes identified in these genotypes could help in the marker-assisted rice variety development with durable resistance against <i>N</i>. <i>lugens</i>.</p>","author":"Chanchala Meher, \nGovindharaj Guru‐Pirasanna‐Pandi, \nSoumya Bharati Babu, \nChidambaranathan Parameswaran, \nTribikram Samal, \nRameswar Prasad Sah, \nC.
