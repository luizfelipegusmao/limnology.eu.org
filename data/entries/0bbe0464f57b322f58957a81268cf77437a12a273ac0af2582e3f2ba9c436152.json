{"title":"Gigantism in Theropods: A Study of Giganotosaurus carolinii and Its Ecological Impact","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2089/v2","date":1723065223000,"content":"Gigantism in theropods represents one of the most intriguing phenomena in dinosaur evolution, showcasing extreme adaptations in body size and ecological roles. This literature review focuses on Giganotosaurus carolinii, one of the largest known theropods to have ever existed, to explore its unique aspects of gigantism and the subsequent ecological impacts. By analyzing features such as its skeletal morphology, comparative anatomy, and paleoenvironmental data, we assess the evolutionary pressures and biological constraints that shaped the gigantism observed in Giganotosaurus. We discover that the species exhibited a combination of physiological and ecological adaptations that allowed it to thrive as an apex predator in its Cretaceous environment. We will also further examine the implications of its size on prey dynamics, competition with other large theropods, and the overall ecosystem structure. Through a thorough, multidisciplinary approach, this research enhances our understanding of how gigantism influenced theropod behavior, interspecies interactions, and the broader paleoecological landscape.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0bbe0464f57b322f58957a81268cf77437a12a273ac0af2582e3f2ba9c436152","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
