It has both antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties, inducing macrophage polarization from M1 to M2. Macrophages, key mediators of the innate immune response, are divided into the M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) subtypes. In this study, we aimed to assess the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of SOD on nerve cells and its immunomodulatory effects on macrophages. We observed that SOD inhibited the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and enhanced the viability of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated nerve cells. Furthermore, SOD reduced the degree of necrosis in nerve cells treated with the conditioned medium from macrophages, which induced inflammation. In addition, SOD promoted the M1 to M2 transition of macrophages. Our findings suggest that SOD protects nerve cells and regulates immune responses.","author":"Moon-Beom Kim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"589a7cdc905bad07006ff7b667b227f39b21a0a3061a0fa540283be38c047f9f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
