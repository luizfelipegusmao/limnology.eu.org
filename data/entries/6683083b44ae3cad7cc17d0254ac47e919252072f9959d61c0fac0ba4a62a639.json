{"title":"Exploring the Impact of Consumer Trust and Perceived Risks on the Intentions to Purchase Overseas Travel Packages via Social Media in Thailand: an Application of the Fuzzy Set Delphi Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1531/v1","date":1716453663000,"content":"This study investigates the factors influencing consumers' intentions to purchase overseas travel packages via social media in Thailand, with a focus on consumer trust and perceived risks. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research techniques. In the qualitative phase, the Fuzzy Set Delphi Method was applied to gather expert consensus from 19 participants. For the quantitative phase, a survey was conducted among 600 individuals who had experience purchasing overseas travel packages on social media in Thailand. First-order and second-order confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine the relationships between eight identified factors: social media influencer, e-WOM, trust, perceived risk, brand image, rating review, personal attitude, and destination image. The results indicate that trust and perceived risk are the most significant factors affecting purchase intention. Trust plays a crucial role in customers' decision-making processes, while perceived risk influences their tendency to avoid purchasing packages if the risk is perceived as high. The insights gained from this study contribute to the understanding of factors influencing purchase intentions for overseas travel packages through social media in Thailand, providing valuable information for travel agencies to develop effective marketing strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6683083b44ae3cad7cc17d0254ac47e919252072f9959d61c0fac0ba4a62a639","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
