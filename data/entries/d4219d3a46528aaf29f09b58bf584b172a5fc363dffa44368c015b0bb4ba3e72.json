Fr√∂hlich et al. (2024) demonstrate that nocturnal birds evolved broader corneas and slightly longer axial lengths than their diurnal counterparts, increasing light capture efficiency. Nocturnal species also tended to maintain or reduce the size of brain regions responsible for vision, i.e., the optic tectum and the visual wulst. These results highlight adaptive trends in nocturnal species, where evolutionary improvement in low-light performance of eyes may be accompanied by compromised brain function.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"d4219d3a46528aaf29f09b58bf584b172a5fc363dffa44368c015b0bb4ba3e72","category":"Environment"}
