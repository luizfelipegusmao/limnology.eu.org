{"title":"Physiological carry-over effects of variable precipitation are mediated by reproductive status in a long-lived ungulate","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae045/7706515?rss=1","date":1720137600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In the age of global climate change, extreme climatic events are expected to increase in frequency and severity. Animals will be forced to cope with these novel stressors in their environment. Glucocorticoids (i.e. ‘stress’ hormones) facilitate an animal’s ability to cope with their environment. To date, most studies involving glucocorticoids focus on the immediate physiological effects of an environmental stressor on an individual, few studies have investigated the long-term physiological impacts of such stressors. Here, we tested the hypothesis that previous exposure to an environmental stressor will impart lasting consequences to an individual’s glucocorticoid levels. In semi-arid environments, variable rainfall drives forage availability for herbivores. Reduced seasonal precipitation can present an extreme environmental stressor potentially imparting long-term impacts on an individual’s glucocorticoid levels. We examined the effects of rainfall and environmental characteristics (i.e. soil and vegetation attributes) during fawn-rearing (i.e. summer) on subsequent glucocorticoid levels of female white-tailed deer (<span>Odocoileus virginianus</span>) in autumn. We captured 124 adult (≥2.5-year-old) female deer via aerial net-gunning during autumn of 2015, 2016 and 2021 across four populations spanning a gradient of environmental characteristics and rainfall in the semi-arid environment of South Texas, USA. We found for every 1 cm decrease in summer rainfall, faecal glucocorticoid levels in autumn increased 6.9%, but only in lactating females. Glucocorticoid levels in non-lactating, female deer were relatively insensitive to environmental conditions. Our study demonstrates the long-lasting effects of environmental stressors on an individual’s glucocorticoid levels. A better understanding of the long-term effects stressors impart on an individual’s glucocorticoid levels will help to evaluate the totality of the cost of a stressor to an individual’s welfare and predict the consequences of future climate scenarios.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"5fe498e4de0468b4b505caeed2a4cd4dfbc1c76f65922b718861d96bb3e408df","category":"Environment"}
