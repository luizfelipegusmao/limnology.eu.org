{"title":"The Impact of Forest Quality on Carbon Emission: A Study of China based on Environmental Kuznets Curve","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0806/v1","date":1725959610000,"content":"Forest quality has a significant impact on carbon emissions of the economic system. This paper, based on an analysis of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) of Forest quality and carbon emission of economic systems, explores effective carbon emission reduction paths from the perspective of symbiosis between Forest quality and economic growth system. This paper carries out empirical analysis based on the provincial-level regional data of China and EKC panel data analysis for several major geographic regions in China. The correlation statistical test shows that the model considering Forest quality is more consistent with the test requirements. It is found that the overall EKC curve of China as a whole shows an inverted U-shape. In light of geographic differences, the EKC curve in the northwest also shows an inverted U-shape; it shows a U-shaped curve in North, Northeast, and East China. Meanwhile, in South Central and Southwest China, there is an approximately linear increasing curve. The data simulation of the symbiotic system of Forest quality and economic growth suggests that simultaneously increasing the proportion of forestry output value and the systematic carbon inhibition coefficient is the most effective pathway for carbon emission reduction. Choosing an appropriate carbon reduction pathway can contribute to the sustainable development of Forest quality and economic growth. The main research highlight of this paper is the application of the symbiotic system model to the EKC analysis of carbon emissions from the economic system with Forest quality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"324cae352f01bcd7434047c0f0f725296649e2b13b8a6f24086bc31da865ff2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
