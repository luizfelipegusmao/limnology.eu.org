{"title":"Unlocking CBSD Resistance in Cassava: Insight From Genetic Variability and Combining Ability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2084/v1","date":1721967202000,"content":"Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) threatens cassava production in sub-Saharan Africa despite the availability of resistant varieties since extreme environmental factors weakens plant defenses hence reduce CBSD resistance. This study examined the inheritance of CBSD in cassava populations, assessed genetic variability and identified superior sources of resistance through F1, S1 and half-sib offspring of populations derived from resistant sources. The offsprings underwent field evaluation at two distinct sites from 2019 to 2021, and the symptoms free genotypes were analyzed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Resistance to CBSD was categorized as most resistant, resistant, most tolerant and tolerant based on symptoms and virus titer. The findings of the study indicate that the resistance to Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) is highly influenced by genotypes, F1/S1 types, and environmental conditions. The analysis of combining abilities revealed significant general combining abilities (GCA) for CBSD, cassava mosaic disease (CMD), and traits associated with yield. The heritability estimates for resistance to CBSD varied between 43.4% to 63.2% for foliar symptoms and 14.6% to 57.9% for root necrosis across locations. The inheritance pattern involved a combination of additive and recessive genes and selfed (S1) populations displayed stronger and effective resistance to the disease. There was a high prevalence of cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and a low prevalence of Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). Four genotypes were identified to be highly resistant to Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) that could be used as key sources of resistance to CBSD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10d80a1ae9c870b0386985f02061857f5d546b56fe7fe668762567b6cb190f28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
