Offering 180mm of rear-wheel travel, the Shore is a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-high-pivot-mountain-bike/\">high-pivot</a> enduro mountain bike with a Horst-link suspension design.</p>\n<p>Built around an aluminium frame, the Shore features an excellent and progressive geometry with a generous 480mm reach, 63-degree head tube angle and 445mm chainstays on our size large.</p>\n<p>Norco is one of the only brands to vary chainstay lengths across its range. Considering its weight, the Shore climbs well despite the MaxxGrip compound on the Maxxis DoubleDown casing tyres, which we swapped to a MaxxTerra.</p>\n<p>The Shore is a very comfortable bike to ride over rough terrain and is also incredibly predictable. Thanks to the ideal geometry, you can weight the front wheel confidently and it feels super-composed, both at speed and in technical sections.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/norco-shore-2-review/\">Read our full Norco Shore 2 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Canyon Strive CFR</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Strive enduro mountain bike\" title=\"Canyon Strive enduro mountain bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Canyon Strive is a race-bred enduro bike with stage-ready performance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£5,999 / $7,299 / €6,299</li>\n<li>Chassis provides stability at high speeds</li>\n<li>Race bike feel with high performance potential</li>\n<li>Suspension can feel harsh at low speeds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Strive CFR is Canyon’s race bike offering 170mm of travel and 29in wheels.</p>\n<p>The Strive is well-specced compared to its contemporaries, with a Shimano XTR drivetrain and brakes paired with a Race Face Next RS crankset.</p>\n<p>The Shapeshifter system allows for better on-the-fly adjustment to the bike’s geometry and presents a marked improvement on the previous model.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/canyon-strive-cfr-review/\">Read our full Canyon Strive CFR review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Cotic RocketMAX Gen4 Mullet Silver</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cotic RocketMAX Gen4 Mullet Silver full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Cotic RocketMAX Gen4 Mullet Silver - Cotic pack\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The latest RocketMAX Gen4 frame still uses a steel front triangle and 160mm of rear-wheel travel, but now comes in more sizes and is designed to work with a longer-travel fork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£4,949 as tested</li>\n<li>Stable and confident through turns</li>\n<li>Carries speed well</li>\n<li>Not as forgiving as other bikes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cotic’s RocketMAX shines when pointed downhill, carrying speed well, and is able to rail corners with ease.

The Spartan is sure-footed on tight and twisty trails, and it’s at home when ridden aggressively with intent. When pushed very hard, the Spartan can punish its rear wheel, though.

This, paired with the long front end, makes for a lively ride, but it does affect balance while cornering.</p>\n<p>Having said this, the Status feels like a solid bruiser from the off and is a seriously fun, exciting bike – especially given its lower price point.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/2021-specialized-status-160-review/\">Read our full Specialized Status 160 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Trek Slash 8</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Trek Slash 8 full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Trek Slash 8\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Trek Slash 8 packs a serious punch considering its price.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£3,450 / $4,200 / AU$6,300 / €3,699 as tested</li>\n<li>Our 2021 Enduro Bike of the Year</li>\n<li>Natural-feeling geometry and great finishing kit</li>\n<li>Seriously impressive suspension</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From a playing field that felt the most level it had ever been, the Trek Slash 8 was crowned our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/boty-2021-trail-enduro-winners/\">2021 Enduro Bike of the Year</a>, so we’ll happily recommend it to any rider looking for a new enduro bike.</p>\n<p>The Slash 8 hits the sweet spot between delivering a fun and lively ride and being calm and composed on the rowdiest terrain.

Its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">rear suspension</a> is damped by a RockShox Super Deluxe Select+ RT shock, like the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/whyte-g-180-rs-29-v1-review/\">2021 29er bike</a>, but the fork has been swapped out for a 190mm-travel ZEB Select+ fork. This capable pairing makes for a bike that can deal with rowdy trails, but it still has plenty of pop for mellower sections.</p>\n<p>While climbing, the comfortable seat position provides a roomy feel, and even with the rear shock left open the suspension remains relatively calm, finding traction on loose surfaces.</p>\n<p>The Whyte might not be the fastest bike in certain sections but it carries momentum well and is worth considering if you’re after a big hitter that climbs well.

It’s a striking-looking enduro bike, with its hidden shock designed to lower the centre of gravity and a great paintjob. It’s available as a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29er</a> only.</p>\n<p>The high-pivot suspension design incorporates Cannondale’s Ai asymmetric rear triangle to increase frame clearance. There’s an idler wheel in the chainline to help prevent the kickback that can come with high-pivot kinematics.</p>\n<p>Spec-wise, there’s Shimano Deore, which despite being low-spec for the Jekyll 2’s price, worked just fine. Cannondale specs 165mm cranks to reduce pedal strikes. Suspension is provided by a 170mm RockShox Zeb Select fork and a Fox Float DPX2 Performance shock with 165mm of travel. We had issues with wheel build quality though.</p>\n<p>We really liked the forward seated position and absence of bob when climbing. Head back down and the Jekyll’s balanced handling and geometry make it predictable and easy to guide through turns.</p>\n<p>We also rated the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/2022-cannondale-jekyll-1-review/\">Cannondale Jekyll 1</a> at 4 stars if you fancy a more decked-out spec.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/cannondale-jekyll-2-review-2/\">Read our full Cannondale Jekyll 2 </a><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/cannondale-jekyll-2-review-2/\">review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Canyon Strive CFR Underdog</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Strive CFR Underdog full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Canyon Strive CFR Underdog - Strive pack\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Canyon Strive CFR Underdog features a host of changes over the previous Strive.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£4,799 / $4,999 / €4,999 / AU$7,399 as tested</li>\n<li>Shapeshifter helps on the hills</li>\n<li>Ground-hugging suspension</li>\n<li>Great geometry</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Canyon’s Strive CFR Underdog is the German brand’s lowest-tier enduro race bike.

The SB165’s rear end is progressive and absorbs bumps quickly, while it provides a massive amount of grip, meaning even poor line choices don’t pose problems for the rider. The geometry, with its slack head angle, enhances the confidence-inspiring performance of the suspension, but longer chainstays might further improve its stability.</p>\n<p>Despite the Fox Factory DHX2 coil-sprung 165mm rear shock, ascending on the Yeti is easier than expected. The suspension on the bike does make it feel slower on the flat, but this is offset by the bike’s low weight.</p>\n<p>You can thank the fully carbon frame for that. Internal cable routing gives this Yeti a minimal-fuss aesthetic. This is a great look – and helps the bike look as fast as it rides – but one that can lead to extra hassle in the work stand.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/yeti-sb165-long-term-review/\">Read our long-term review of the Yeti SB165</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n\n<h2>What is an enduro bike?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rob Weaver riding a Nukeproof Giga mtb.

Some 27.5in-wheel enduro bikes may push travel a touch higher and there are a few with a little less at the rear – usually 29in bikes.</p>\n<p>Expect to see the burliest single-crown suspension forks a brand has to offer with stanchion diameters varying from 35mm to 38mm.

This, then, allows for better temperature management and more consistency on long descents (you’ll be surprised by how warm a shock can get in use).</p>\n<p>How the bikes use that suspension travel will vary too. Some bikes have incredibly plush suspension that totally insulates you from the trail, leading to an incredibly planted feel that’s fast on steep and rough terrain.</p>\n<p>But with all that smoothness comes more pedal-induced movement, so these bikes can often feel sluggish on climbs and flatter tracks – you’ll be reaching for a lockout lever much sooner.</p>\n<p>However, some bikes will have a more pedal-friendly suspension, which will make the uphills much easier and the flatter tracks more fun. You may lose some of that buttery feeling when you’re going flat-out over rocks and roots, though.</p>\n<h2>Enduro bike geometry – what’s that about?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pole Stamina 160 Remastered enduro mountain bike\" title=\"Pole Stamina 160 Remastered enduro mountain bike-34\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Long and slack geometry helps to boost confidence in tricky terrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The latest enduro bikes have <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/spoke-tension-is-long-slack-and-low-geometry-always-better-our-tech-experts-give-us-their-angle/\">long, low and slack geometry</a>. This means long front centres (and reach measurements), slack head angles and low bottom brackets. This makes them feel super-confident on steep hillsides because there’s less chance of you flipping over the handlebars, and it helps you better manage weight and grip between the tyres.</p>\n<p>Longer geometry can make the bikes a little slower to react to inputs, and sometimes you may find you need to re-address your riding technique to get the most agility out of them, but these bikes have descending speed at the forefront of their design.</p>","author":"Tom Marvin","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"2c12236333b917ed3d57742ac1059a40066d6fe400cdd44e9cbf1dce7dc5906a","category":"Cycling"}
