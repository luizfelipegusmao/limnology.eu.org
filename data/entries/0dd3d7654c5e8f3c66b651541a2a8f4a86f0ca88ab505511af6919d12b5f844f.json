Sand fly collections were carried out at ten sites, encompassing both canopy and ground strata, from October to December 2021. A total of 1,671 sand flies were collected, representing 42 species within 12 genera. <i>Nyssomyia</i> Antunesi (n = 384) and <i>Psychodopygus davisi</i> (n = 111) were the most abundant species. Molecular analyses targeting the V7V8 region (18S gene) unveiled the presence of sequences 100% identical to <i>Leishmania infantum</i> in females of <i>Bichromomyia flaviscutellata</i> (1), <i>Nyssomyia</i> Antunesi complex (6), <i>Nyssomyia umbratilis</i> (1), <i>Nyssomyia</i> sp. (1), <i>Psychodopygus ayrozai</i> (1), <i>Ps</i>. <i>davisi</i> (3), <i>Psychodopygus paraensis</i> (1), and <i>Sciopemyia sordellii</i> (1). Sequences 100% similar to <i>Trypanosoma minasense</i> were found in two samples of the <i>Nyssomyia</i> Antunesi complex, and two samples of <i>Sc</i>. <i>sordellii</i> presented 100% identity to a <i>Trypanosoma</i> sp. strain, previously identified in this same sand fly in Rondônia. Sequencing of <i>Cytb</i> fragment suggested <i>Homo sapiens</i>, <i>Dasypus novemcinctus</i> and <i>Tamandua tetradactyla</i> as the blood source for distinct sand flies. The identification of sequences similar to <i>L</i>. <i>infantum</i> in sand flies collected in urban forest fragments is noteworthy, correlating with the recent local and regional occurrence of autochthonous cases of human visceral leishmaniasis. However, further studies are imperative to ascertain the presence of hosts/reservoirs and evaluate the risk of <i>L</i>. <i>infantum</i> transmission to humans.","author":"Michelli Santos da Silva","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0dd3d7654c5e8f3c66b651541a2a8f4a86f0ca88ab505511af6919d12b5f844f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
