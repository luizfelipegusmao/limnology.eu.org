This study introduces a novel approach that leverages neural network models and high-throughput simulation to predict space groups from Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) or Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD) patterns. By employing advanced machine learning techniques and simulated datasets, this method may help overcome traditional limitations by offering a robust, high-throughput tool for automated crystallographic analysis without the prerequisite of prior material phase knowledge.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ac65160d4b29889ebd34fe74fef73c4da1bb2a08f62a9a5cfd78f8eb909e492a","category":"Environment"}
