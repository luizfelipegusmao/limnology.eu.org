{"title":"The Association Between Self-Reported Long COVID Symptoms and COVID-19 Conspiracy Theories in Jordan, Kuwait, among Other Arab Countries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0608/v1","date":1723131036000,"content":"Long COVID comprises persistent symptoms which extend beyond four weeks post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential association between long COVID and the endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories has not been explored, particularly in Arab countries where high endorsement of these theories has been reported. This study aimed to explore the association between endorsing COVID-19 conspiracy theories and the prevalence of self-reported long COVID symptoms among adults in Jordan and Kuwait in addition to other Arab countries. The study employed a cross-sectional design using an electronic self-administered survey in Arabic language. Recruitment utilized snowball sampling via social media and the survey was distributed in July 2024. The survey instrument included sections on demographic information, the history of COVID-19 infection, and vaccination status. Long COVID manifestations were assessed using a score reflecting the frequency and intensity of ten recognized long COVID symptoms with subsequent categorization into three categories: low, middle, and high. The beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories were measured via a 5-point Likert scale across five items. The final study sample comprised 756 respondents, the majority of whom self-reported a history of confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis at least once (n = 493, 65.2%). The results indicated a neutral average attitude towards COVID-19 conspiracy theories (mean score = 15.18±4.64 out of 30.00). Participants with high conspiracy theories scores were significantly more likely to report high (aOR = 6.85, 95% CI: 2.90–16.13, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and middle long COVID symptoms (aOR = 2.82, 95% CI: 1.32–6.06, p = 0.008) compared to those with lower scores. Additional predictors of higher long COVID reporting included female sex and lower self-reported household income. Frequent COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations were also associated with higher long COVID symptom reporting. The study results revealed a significant correlation between the endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories and the higher frequency and magnitude of long COVID symptom reporting. The findings also highlighted the influence of sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 infection history on long COVID reporting, which suggests that public health strategies should address these factors to mitigate long COVID challenges effectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e2d256553e55e80e2e0a40c51e938ec2ec957ef34eec3fc67947cbc275c9f4c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
