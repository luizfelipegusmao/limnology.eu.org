{"title":"Single-cell transcriptome atlas reveals somatic cell embryogenic differentiation features during regeneration","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1414/7613809?rss=1","date":1708732800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Understanding somatic cell totipotency remains a challenge facing scientific inquiry today. Plants display remarkable cell totipotency expression, illustrated by single-cell differentiation during somatic embryogenesis (SE) for plant regeneration. Determining cell identity and exploring gene regulation in such complex heterogeneous somatic cell differentiation have been major challenges. Here, we performed high-throughput single-cell sequencing assays to define the precise cellular landscape and revealed the modulation mode of marker genes during embryogenic differentiation in cotton (<span>Gossypium hirsutum</span> L.) as the crop for biotechnology application. We demonstrated that nonembryogenic calli (NEC) and primary embryogenic calli (PEC) tissues were composed of heterogeneous cells that could be partitioned into four broad populations with six distinct cell clusters. Enriched cell clusters and cell states were identified in NEC and PEC samples, respectively. Moreover, a broad repertoire of new cluster-specific genes and associated expression modules were identified. The energy metabolism, signal transduction, environmental adaptation, membrane transport pathways, and a series of transcription factors were preferentially enriched in cell embryogenic totipotency expression. Notably, the <span>SE-ASSOCIATED LIPID TRANSFER PROTEIN</span> (<span>SELTP</span>) gene dose-dependently marked cell types with distinct embryogenic states and exhibited a parabolic curve pattern along the somatic cell embryogenic differentiation trajectory, suggesting that <span>SELTP</span> could serve as a favorable quantitative cellular marker for detecting embryogenic expression at the single-cell level. In addition, RNA velocity and Scissor analysis confirmed the pseudo-temporal model and validated the accuracy of the scRNA-seq data, respectively. This work provides valuable marker-genes resources and defines precise cellular taxonomy and trajectory atlases for somatic cell embryogenic differentiation in plant regeneration.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"27ba8e82f98f2684228cb9eabd5806b37adbcc3826ff852e2d901ac673c744d8","category":"Environment"}
