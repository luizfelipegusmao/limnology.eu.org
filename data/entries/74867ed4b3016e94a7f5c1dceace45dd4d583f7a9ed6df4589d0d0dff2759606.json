In 2020, symptoms of a serious shoot and leaf rust disease were observed on black wattle (<span>Acacia mearnsii</span> De Wild.) trees across the three main wattle growing regions of Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to describe the disease and identify its causal agent based on morphological characteristics as well as DNA sequence data for the ITS and LSU regions of ribosomal DNA.
