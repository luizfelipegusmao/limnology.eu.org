{"title":"Functions of TAM Receptors and Their Ligands Protein S and Gas6 in Atherosclerosis and Cardiovascular Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0083/v1","date":1727848654000,"content":"Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease are associated with high morbidity and mortality in industrialized nations. The Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases is involved in amplification or resolution of atherosclerosis pathology and other cardiovascular pathology. The ligands of these receptors, Protein S (PS) and growth arrest specific protein 6 (Gas6), are essential for TAM receptor functions in amplification and resolution of atherosclerosis. The Axl-Gas6 interaction has various effects on cardiovascular disease. Mer and PS dampen inflammation, thereby protecting against atherosclerosis progression. Tyro3, the least studied TAM receptor in cardiovascular disease, appears to protect against fibrosis in post-myocardial infarction injury. Ultimately, PS, Gas6, and TAM receptors present an exciting avenue of potential therapeutic targets against inflammation associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94980010fcefcb11e3b21e8ba5ddb6e57f8cea2c9a84f85f14067e6fba01cbb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
