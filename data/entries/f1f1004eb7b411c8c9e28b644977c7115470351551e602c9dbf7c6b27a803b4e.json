{"title":"Impact of COVID-19 on psychological distress in subsequent stages of the pandemic: The role of received social support","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310734","date":1727272800000,"content":"<p>by Krzysztof Kaniasty, Erik van der Meulen</p>\r\n\r\nThis longitudinal study examined a sample of adult Poles (N = 1245), who were interviewed three times from July 2021 to August 2022, during the later stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study had two primary objectives. The first was to assess the impact of the pandemic on psychological distress, measured through symptoms of depression and anxiety. The pandemic’s effects were evaluated using three predictors: direct exposure to COVID-19, COVID-19 related stressors, and perceived threats from COVID-19. The second objective was to investigate the role of received social support in coping with the pandemic’s hardships. Receipt of social support was measured by both the quantity of help received and the perceived quality of that support. A Latent Growth Curve Model (LGCM) was employed to analyze psychological distress across three waves, controlling for sociodemographic variables, non-COVID life events, coping self-efficacy, and perceived social support. Findings indicated that COVID-19 stressors and COVID-19 threats were strongly and consistently associated with greater psychological distress throughout the study period. The impact of direct COVID-19 exposure was limited. The quantity of received support predicted higher distress, whereas higher quality of received support was linked to better mental health. Crucially, the relationship between the quantity of support and distress was moderated by the quality of support. Effective social support was associated with the lowest distress levels, regardless of the amount of help received. Conversely, receiving large amounts of low-quality support was detrimental to psychological health. In summary, the ongoing psychosocial challenges of COVID-19 significantly eroded mental health, highlighting the importance of support quality over quantity in coping with significant life adversities.","author":"Krzysztof Kaniasty","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f1f1004eb7b411c8c9e28b644977c7115470351551e602c9dbf7c6b27a803b4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
