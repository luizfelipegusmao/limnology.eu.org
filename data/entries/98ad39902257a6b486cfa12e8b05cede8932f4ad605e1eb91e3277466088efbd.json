One report estimates about 10<sup>31</sup> viruses are present on Earth, most of which are present in soil [<a href=\"#ozae044.351-B1\">1</a>]. Virus abundance in soil varies per soil type, moisture content, seasons, and depth of sampling, resulting in variations in the number and types of viruses observed from sample to sample [<a href=\"#ozae044.351-B2\">2</a>]. Scientific study is usually restricted to viruses or phages which are known to either positively or negatively impact human activities, livestock, or crops. Numerically, the number of viruses under scientific investigation are &lt;1% of the total which makes them some of the least studied forms on the planet.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"98ad39902257a6b486cfa12e8b05cede8932f4ad605e1eb91e3277466088efbd","category":"Environment"}
