Discharge computing has been the focus of research on this structure, thus developing generalized regression neural network (GRNN), genetic programming (GP), and extreme learning machine (ELM) are used to predict the discharge coefficient (<i>C</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>d</i>\n</sub>) of the triangular broad-crested weir. The comprehensive analysis shows that the ELM model has high stability, predictive ability, and computational speed. The coefficient of determination (R^2) is 0.99982, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 0.000261, the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE) is 0.99977, and the root means square error (RMSE) is 4.17E-05 in the testing phase. The apex angle <i>θ</i> is the most critical parameter affecting the <i>C</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>d</i>\n</sub>, and the contribution to the <i>C</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>d</i>\n</sub> is 52.45%. A new computational formula is proposed and compared with the accuracy of empirical formulas, showing that the intelligent method has higher accuracy and efficiency.</p>","author":"Guiying Shen, \nDingye Cao, \nAbbas Parsaie","siteTitle":"Wiley: River: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0b74d58d2572beb2996093d38ec1aeffad4d7646e8152f056f56cbe7cdd98b36","entryHash":"e760dd9e049b6184c5aad10d1b1d320be3d16f97d588cc10ac66ae1fd45e4a91","category":"Environment"}
