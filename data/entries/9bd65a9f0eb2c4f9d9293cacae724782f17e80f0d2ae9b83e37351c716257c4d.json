When quenched sufficiently rapidly from its high-temperature γ (bcc) phase, depleted U-6wt%Nb adopts a monoclinic, highly twinned martensite phase known as α’’. Material in this condition is regarded as belonging to the class of high-temperature shape-memory alloys (SMAs), and it can recover up to 7% tensile strain by heating into the γ phase [<a href=\"#ozae044.851-B2\">2</a>]. The as-transformed martensitic microstructure has previously been studied by conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. Crystal orientation mapping techniques like EBSD have yielded valuable information about the as-transformed microstructures in other SMAs (e.g., [<a href=\"#ozae044.851-B3\">3</a>], [<a href=\"#ozae044.851-B4\">4</a>]). However, the high density of nanoscale twins in as-quenched DU-6wt%Nb has posed challenges for these techniques.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9bd65a9f0eb2c4f9d9293cacae724782f17e80f0d2ae9b83e37351c716257c4d","category":"Environment"}
