{"title":"First report of the rare tintinnid genus Stelidiella Kofoid and Campbell 1929 in the Indian Ocean","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/2/224/7595368?rss=1","date":1706659200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study provides detailed information on the morphometry and distribution of some rare tintinnids species found in the Indian Ocean. The morphological features (scabbard-shaped with a fenestrated collar) reported here resemble those of the <span>g</span>enus <span>Stelidiella.</span> Here, lorica morphology (fenestra arrangement and oral margin (OM) pattern) was the sole criteria for <span>Stelidiella</span> species identification. The dimensions and morphology (presence of two layers of fenestrae rings with smooth OMs) resemble the original description of <span>Stelidiella fenestrata,</span> a warm-water species. We found both small (260 μm long) and large <span>S. fenestrata</span> (309 μm long) with smaller and larger bowls in the former and latter, respectively. In the Indian Ocean, <span>S. fenestrata</span> was more abundant (i) between 12<sup>o</sup>N and 18<sup>o</sup>S (particularly, central Indian Ocean) similar to that reported in the Pacific Ocean; (ii) in the mesopelagic zone (100–1000 m) than the epipelagic zone (0–100 m) and (iii) in the winter season of December 2021–January 2022 than in spring inter-monsoon of March–May 2021. The <span>S. fenestrata</span>, despite being in low abundance (2–26 individuals 10 m<sup>−3</sup>), is widespread in the region, and their role in the ecosystem merits further investigation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"e130e3f5604f0bccbd7250eb0ca3b2cf5a819f11edadff2c98058e0c87c52bdb","category":"Environment"}
