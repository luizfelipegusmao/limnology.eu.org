{"title":"Functional Feed with Bioactive Plant-Derived Compounds and Their Effects on Pig Performance, Chemical Composition, and Muscle Fatty Acid Profile in Finishing Pigs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2548/v1","date":1722583605000,"content":"This study evaluated the effect of pig diet supplementation with an Olea europaea L. extract on the muscle fatty acid composition. Ten commercial hybrid pigs (Large White x (Landrace x Duroc)) were randomly assigned to two experimental treatments and fed either a standard diet (C) or diet with olive leaves extract (OL). For 90 days, the OL group received the olive leaf extract (300 mg/head/day), which mainly comprises oleuropein diglucoside, luteolin-7-glucoside, and verbascoside. The phenolic content, antioxidant activity, bioactive moleculesâ€™ characterization, and the fatty acids profile of meat and diet were performed. The results indicated that while the OL supplementation did not significantly alter the overall chemical composition of the meat or the pigs' performance, it did modify the lipid profile of the meat. The OL diet results in a significant reduction in SFA and an increase in oleic acid in meat, which correspondingly elevates the total MUFA content. Dietary treatment reduced the sum of n-6 PUFA in the meat of the OL group, and resulted in a significantly lower n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio. Therefore, these findings suggest that incorporating olive leaf extract into the pig diet enhances the nutritional and functional quality of the meat by improving its fatty acid profile.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3c09a0d45dcd3014221b62e2f7d10e732e4b9e811f4f7fc1aafe84718e21843","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
