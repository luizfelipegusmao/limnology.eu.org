Egg rejection, in contrast, is a recently evolved adaptation by hosts of brood parasites in which an egg is removed from a nest. These conflicting behaviours are both adaptive because they prevent reproductive losses, but egg retrieval may benefit brood parasites if hosts retrieve parasitic eggs into their nests. We examined these conflicting cognitive processes in the prothonotary warbler (<i>Protonotaria citrea</i>), a cavity-nesting host of the brown-headed cowbird (<i>Molothrus ater</i>). Eggs and nestlings are occasionally found on the rims of warbler nest cavities. We determined how this happened using video cameras and tested whether warblers retrieved their own eggs more often than cowbird eggs. We also determined if shape affects retrieval and rejection by placing cylinders inside nest cups or onto nest rims. We found that eggs were displaced by rapidly departing warblers whose nests are constantly prospected by nest competitors and brood parasites. Warblers retrieved their eggs (29%) and cowbird eggs (19%) at similar rates, and never rejected cowbird eggs after retrieval. Warblers removed most cylinders from nest rims and cups (89% and 78%, respectively), and never retrieved them. Warblers have retained egg retrieval at a low level and its expression is costly because they only retrieve a low level of their own eggs and also retrieve cowbird eggs, which benefits the brood parasite.</p>","author":"Brian D.
