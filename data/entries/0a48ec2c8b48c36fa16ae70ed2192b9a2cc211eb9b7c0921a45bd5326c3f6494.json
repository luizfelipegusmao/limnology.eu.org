{"title":"An Optimized Method for LC-MS Based Quantification of Endogenous Organic Acids: Metabolic Perturbations in Pancreatic Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0528/v1","date":1712568724000,"content":"Metabolomics profiling for accurate and reliable quantification of organic acids that carry a carboxylic acid functional group in complex biological samples, remains a major analytical challenge in clinical chemistry research. Several procedural barriers associated with quantification of clinically important carboxylic containing metabolites (CCMs) including spontaneous decarboxylation during ionization, poor chromatographic resolution, and retention on a reverse-phase column, limit the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) based LC-MS assay development. We report a targeted metabolomics-based analytical method for the quantification of CCMs using phenylenediamine derivatization. Accurate and sensitive quantification of CCMs is successfully demonstrated in an array of biological matrices. Recovery of metabolites from different matrices (plasma, serum, urine, saliva, tissues, and cell extracts), ranged from 90% to 105%, with all the CVs ≤ 10%. The method showed linearity over a broad dynamic range from 0.1 ng/mL to 10 µg/mL with linear regression coefficients of 0.99 for most of the metabolites tested herein, that covers broad-based applicability with the analysis of biological samples. In most cases the LODs were as low as 0.01 ng/mL. The phenylenediamine-based derivatization of carboxyl acid library consisting of more than 70 endogenous metabolites was constructed for metabolite identification, which spanned more than 40 biological pathways. The library included a wide-variety of structurally variant CCMs such as amino acids/conjugates, short to medium chain organic acids, di/tri-carboxylic acids/conjugates, fatty acids and some ring-containing CCMs. We compared the CCMs profiles of pancreatic cancer cells with normal pancreatic epithelial cells to test and validate the biological utility of this method. The comparative profiling between cancerous and normal cells resulted in the identification of potential biomarkers in pancreatic cancer, and their correlation with several key metabolic pathways such as central carbon energy metabolism, protein metabolism, including TCA cycle, glycolysis, Gln-Glu pathway, and biosynthesis of amino acids and unsaturated fatty acids was established. The method, described herein, for the first time enables the sensitive and highly specific quantification of CCMs on small sample size with high reproducibility in a high throughput manner. Given the biological and functional significance of this class of metabolites, this mass spectrometry based targeted quantitative assay, fills an important gap and is likely to support a wide range of applications for basic, clinical, and translational research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a48ec2c8b48c36fa16ae70ed2192b9a2cc211eb9b7c0921a45bd5326c3f6494","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
