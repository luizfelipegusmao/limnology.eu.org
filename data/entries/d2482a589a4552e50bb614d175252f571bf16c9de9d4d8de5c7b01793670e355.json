{"title":"Strategies for Carbon Neutrality: Innovations in Construction Material Production and Usage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1352/v1","date":1718794261000,"content":"The imperative to achieve carbon neutrality has driven significant advancements in the construction sector, particularly in the production and utilization of building materials. This paper explores innovative strategies and practices designed to reduce the carbon footprint of construction materials, with a focus on both the production processes and the application of sustainable materials. Key innovations include the development of low-carbon and carbon-negative materials, the integration of renewable energy sources in production, and the implementation of advanced recycling technologies. Case studies of successful projects demonstrate how these strategies can be applied in real-world scenarios, highlighting both the benefits and challenges encountered. The analysis also delves into the technical and economic aspects of these innovations, addressing the barriers to their widespread adoption and proposing solutions to overcome these challenges. Through a comprehensive examination of current practices and future trends, this paper aims to provide a roadmap for the construction industry to achieve carbon neutrality, contributing to broader climate change mitigation efforts and fostering a more sustainable built environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d2482a589a4552e50bb614d175252f571bf16c9de9d4d8de5c7b01793670e355","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
