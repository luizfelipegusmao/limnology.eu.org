{"title":"Characterization of Tenacibaculum maritimum isolated from diseased salmonids farmed in Chile reveals high serological and genetic heterogeneity","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13965?af=R","date":1723123610000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The diversity of <i>Tenacibaculum maritimum</i> in Chile remains poorly understood, particularly in terms of antigenic and genetic diversity. This information is crucial for the future development of a vaccine against tenacibaculosis and would increase understanding of this important fish pathogen. With this aim, the biochemical, antigenic, and genetic characteristics were analysed for 14 <i>T. maritimum</i> isolates, recovered from diseased Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) and rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) farmed in Chile between 1998 and 2022. Biochemical analysis showed a homogeneity among all the Chilean <i>T. maritimum</i> isolates and all four other strains included for comparison purposes. Serological characterization using dot-blot assaying revealed antigenic heterogeneity with the use of unabsorbed antisera. The majority of isolates showed cross-reactions, identifying three main serological patterns. When the PCR-based serotyping scheme was performed, the existence of antigenic heterogeneity was confirmed. Four Atlantic salmon isolates were 4–0; and most isolates, including the rainbow trout isolate, were 3–1 (<i>n</i> = 9). A turbot (<i>Scophthalmus maximus</i>) isolate was 1–0. Using an existing Multilocus Sequence Typing system, two newly identified sequence types (ST193 and ST198) in the database were detected. ST193 encompassed nine isolates obtained from Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, while ST198 regrouped four isolates, all retrieved from diseased Atlantic salmon in 2022. These findings highlight significant antigenic and genetic diversity among the Chilean isolates. This information is useful for epizootiology and the selection of suitable candidate strain(s) for vaccine development against tenacibaculosis caused by <i>T. maritimum</i> in Chilean salmon farming.</p>","author":"Ruben Avendaño‐Herrera, \nPierre Lopez, \nMacarena Echeverría‐Bugueño, \nHenry Araya‐León, \nRute Irgang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"de988977b8d1cc15140b73cb0a9e726fb7ef8cdd4e931dcd1fce6f85c9b2d828","category":"Environment"}
