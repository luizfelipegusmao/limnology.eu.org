Avoiding a water deficit through a supply-side approach has been the default strategy in Kuwait, yet this approach is unsustainable, associated with declining groundwater levels, and reliance on desalination that results in major carbon emission and environmental impact and that takes a large and growing share of oil revenues. In this study, we forecast household water demand in Kuwait to 2050 under a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario and evaluate the economic and environmental impacts. A spatial microsimulation, constrained by the national population projection of the Kuwait Institute of Scientific Research (KISR), was developed to overcome data limitations in forecasting household demand. Results show a 45% increase in water demand by 2050, to 664.1 million cubic metres (MCM), relative to the 2019 base year. Annual production costs increase from 1.39 billion USD in 2019 to 1.99 billion USD by 2050, whilst carbon emissions increase from 10.85 to 15.54 million tonnes/year. These results should alert policymakers to the potential impacts of the growing water demand and provide further support for water conservation action to reduce demand.</p>","author":"Hamad J.
