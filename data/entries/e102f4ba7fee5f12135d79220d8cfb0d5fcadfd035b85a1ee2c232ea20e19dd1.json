{"title":"Corrosion Behaviour of Weld Metal of Ultra-High Strength Steels Weldments in a Sodium Chloride Aqueous Solution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0546/v1","date":1723113443000,"content":"As high strength and ultra-high strength steels are widely used in all kinds of modern welded constructions, a lot of research is carried out to investigate the mechanical properties of weldments of these steels but there is a scarce information on such important characteristic as their corrosion behaviour. This research focuses on the corrosion behaviour of weld metal of weldments of S906QL and S700MC steels. Weld metal was tested electrochemically in a 3,5% NaCl aqueous solution via potentiodynamic scan to determine corrosion rate and its dependence on welding gap. No influence of welding gap on corrosion rate was found but the experimental results suggested that corrosion rate depended on the chemical composition of filler material and the microstructure of weld metal.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e102f4ba7fee5f12135d79220d8cfb0d5fcadfd035b85a1ee2c232ea20e19dd1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
