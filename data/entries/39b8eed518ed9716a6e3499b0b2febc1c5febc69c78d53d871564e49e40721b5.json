At the same time, forest restoration is a nature-based solution that can be used to increase biodiversity, carbon stocks, and human well-being. Here we describe an experiment based on natural forest regeneration through the exclusion of anthropogenic fire. We show that it is easier to let nature do its work instead of channeling it into an artificial man-made ecosystem through human-induced burning or planting. We emphasize that nature-based solutions must be biome-appropriate and the choice between restoring forests or protecting savannas requires a thorough understanding of the local context.</p>\n<br />","author":"Brice Yannick Djiofack, \nHans Beeckman, \nNils Bourland, \nBasile Luse Belanganayi, \nFélix Laurent, \nBhely Angoboy Ilondea, \nLaurent Nsenga, \nAlain Huart, \nMenard Mbende Longwwango, \nVictor Deklerck, \nGeert Lejeune, \nWilliam W.
