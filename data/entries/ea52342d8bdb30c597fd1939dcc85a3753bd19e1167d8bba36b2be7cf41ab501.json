{"title":"Hybrid Euclidean-Lorentzian Universe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2013/v1","date":1717050531000,"content":"The limited velocity in a geometry of Lorentzian signature, seem to prevent the universe to reach thermodynamic equilibrium as suggested by the cosmic microwave background. Thus it was suggested that the universe which was initially minuscule has reached a more considerable radius in a short duration by a process known as cosmic inflation. However, to drive such a process have led to the suggestion of an ad-hoc scalar field the inflaton, which has no purpose in nature other than driving the cosmic inflation field and then stopping it once the universe reached the right size. In a recent paper it was shown that rapid expansion can occur without postulating an inflation by following Hawking's suggestion and assuming that primordially the metric of the universe had an Euclidean signature, in which case velocity is not limited and thermalization and rapid expansion are derived without the need to assume an ad-hoc field. However, while in the previous work emphasis was put on the dynamics and physical statistics of the particles in a Euclidean space vs. Lorentzian space in which both spaces were given. No mathematical model was given regarding the development of current Lorentzian space-time from the early Euclidean space-time, and how fundamental problems such as the space-time singularity and the homogeneity of the CMB can be solved in the hybrid Euclidean-Lorentzian picture. This lacuna is to be rectified in the current paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea52342d8bdb30c597fd1939dcc85a3753bd19e1167d8bba36b2be7cf41ab501","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
