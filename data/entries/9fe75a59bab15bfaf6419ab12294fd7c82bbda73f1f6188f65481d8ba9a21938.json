{"title":"Obesogenic Gut Microbiota as a Crucial Factor Defining the Depletion of Enzyme Representation for Vitamin B12 Synthesis in the Mouse Intestine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0075/v1","date":1712023838000,"content":"Currently, obesity is a critical global public health burden. Numerous studies have demonstrated the regulation of the pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic abnormalities by the gut microbiota and microbial factors; however, their involvement in the various degrees of obesity is not yet understood well. Previously, obesity has been shown to be associated with decreased levels of vitamin B12. Considering exclusive microbial production of vitamin B12, we hypothesised that a decrease in cobalamin levels in obese individuals may be at least partially caused by its depleted production in the intestinal tract by the commensal microbiota. In the present study, our aim was to estimate the abundance of enzymes and metabolic pathways for vitamin B12 synthesis in the gut microbiota of mouse models of alimentary and genetically determined obesity, to evaluate the contribution of the obesogenic microbiome to vitamin B12 synthesis in the gut. We have defined a significantly lower representation of enzymes and metabolic pathways for vitamin B12 biosynthesis in obese mice compared to non-obese mice, wherein enzyme depletion was more pronounced in lepr(-/-) (db/db) mice, which developed severe obesity. The representation of enzymes involved in cobalamin synthesis is strongly correlated with representation of several microbes in high-fat diet fed mice, whereas there were almost no correlations in db/db mice. Therefore, the degree of obesity and the composition of the correspondent microbiota are the main contributors to the representation of genes and pathways for cobalamin biosynthesis in the mouse gut.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9fe75a59bab15bfaf6419ab12294fd7c82bbda73f1f6188f65481d8ba9a21938","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
