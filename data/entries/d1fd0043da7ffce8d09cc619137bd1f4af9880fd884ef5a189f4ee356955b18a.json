{"title":"Evaluation of Printability of Pva-Based Tablets from Powder and Assessment of Critical Rheological Parameters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1541/v1","date":1711431738000,"content":"Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is a rather new technology in the production of personalized dosage forms. Melting and printing of polymer–active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) – mixtures can be used to produce oral dosage forms with different dosage as well as release behavior. This process is utilized to increase the bioavailability of pharmaceutically relevant active ingredients that are poorly soluble in physiological medium by transforming them into solid amorphous dispersions (ASD). Release from such ASDs is expected to be faster and higher compared to the raw materials and thus enhance bioavailability. Printing directly from powder while forming ASDs was realized. Different techniques to change release patterns as well as a non-destructive way for determination of API distribution were shown. By measuring the melt viscosities of mixtures printed a rheological model for the printer used is proposed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1fd0043da7ffce8d09cc619137bd1f4af9880fd884ef5a189f4ee356955b18a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
