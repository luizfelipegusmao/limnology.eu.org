{"title":"Developing Guidelines for Azolla microphylla Production as Compost for Sustainable Agriculture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2311/v1","date":1727602056000,"content":"Azolla is a substitute compost that has the potential to enhance nutrient cycling in agricultural systems for sustainable development. In this study, four experiments were conducted to compare the Department of Agriculture (DOA, Thailand)'s methodology for determining the suitable type and rate of animal manure and the optimal light intensity for the growth and yield of Azolla (Azolla microphylla). The results revealed that applying 100% pig manure gave the highest yield of Azolla compared to the other manure. However, there was no discernible difference in yield across the various doses (20.16, 30.16, and 40.16 gN m-2) of pig manure treatments, for which the minimal pig manure dosage of 20.16 gN m-2 was chosen. For further experimentation in the optimal light in-tensity, the 40% shading gave the highest yield of Azolla compared to no shading or 20 and 60% shading. When compared with the DOA Thailand methodology (1.27 kg m-2 of cow manure and covered with a size 32 mesh net), the findings indicated that the modified method (20.16 gN m-2 of pig manure + 40% shading) gave a 16% greater Azolla yield than that under the DOA Thailand methodology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9aaf39c0726e2c35ea3190defd560ab4617d16e7e87b838e7cf5e2db48d5a5e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
