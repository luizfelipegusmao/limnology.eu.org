{"title":"Unraveling the Immune Web: Advances in SMI Capsular Fibrosis from Molecular Insights to Preclinical Breakthroughs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0691/v1","date":1728471260000,"content":"Breast implant surgery has evolved significantly, yet challenges such as capsular contracture remain a persistent concern. This review presents an in-depth analysis of recent advancements in understanding the immune mechanisms and clinical implications associated with breast implants. The article systematically examines the complex interplay between immune responses and capsular fibrosis, emphasizing the pathophysiological mechanisms of inflammation in the etiology of this fibrotic response. It discusses innovations in biomaterial science, including the development of novel anti-biofilm coatings and immunomodulatory surfaces designed to enhance implant integration and minimize complications. Emphasis is placed on personalized risk assessment strategies, leveraging molecular insights to tailor interventions and improve patient outcomes. Emerging therapeutic targets, advancements in surgical techniques, and the refinement of post-operative care are also explored. Despite notable progress, challenges such as variability in immune responses, long-term efficacy of new interventions, and ethical considerations remain. Future research directions are identified, focusing on personalized medicine, advanced biomaterials, and bridging preclinical findings with clinical applications. As we advance from bench to bedside, this review illuminates the path forward, where interdisciplinary collaboration and continued inquiry weave together to enhance the art and science of breast implant surgery, transforming patient care into a realm of precision and excellence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b462f24a41db3ef92576c2ea85b07c9bf8355563b8e070aaeefd27d608a9bba5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
