{"title":"Aminotransferases as causal factors for metabolic syndrome: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302209","date":1714053600000,"content":"<p>by Meng Lingyu, Li Hongguang, Zhang Mingdong, Li Na, Liu Yahui</p>\r\nBackground <p>Circulating aminotransferases (ALT and AST) have been used as biomarkers for liver injury. The causal relationships between aminotransferases and metabolic syndrome remain ambiguous.</p> Methods <p>We conducted bidirectional and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses between aminotransferases and traits related to metabolic syndrome using genetic variants obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). MR-PRESSO tests were adopted to remove outliers and eliminate pleiotropy. MR steiger tests were conducted to ensure the correct direction of the causal effects.</p> Results <p>Both aminotransferases were risk factors for essential hypertension. ALT is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The bidirectional causal relationship between ALT and hyperglycemia, serum lipids, and obesity was demonstrated. The effect of fasting glucose on AST was demonstrated, while type 2 diabetes did not affect AST. The effect of HDL-C on ALT and the effect of triglycerides on AST were found in multivariable MR analyses.</p> Conclusions <p>Our bidirectional MR analyses suggest that ALT and AST are causally associated with several metabolic syndrome-related traits, especially hypertension and type 2 diabetes. These findings highlight the potential role of aminotransferases as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for metabolic syndrome.</p>","author":"Meng Lingyu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b544ecad894e6b955e2ed31d3479c9cd1538dd44f67d47977901891acf499bf2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
