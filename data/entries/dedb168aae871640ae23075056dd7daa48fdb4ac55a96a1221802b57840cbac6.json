{"title":"What Is Currently Understood and Remains Undiscovered regarding Lp(a) in the Context of Metabolic Syndrome?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0918/v1","date":1715662237000,"content":"Lipoprotein (a) is a highly atherogenic, lipid particle whose concentration is genetically determined, and represents an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, metabolic syndrome represents a cluster of interconnected cardiovascular risk factors (obesity, insulin resistance, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia) that are a direct consequence of an unhealthy lifestyle. Some evidence suggests a connection between each component of metabolic syndrome and high levels of lipoprotein (a). Still, the exact mechanisms are not fully understood and may involve complex interactions between various metabolic pathways. High levels of lp(a) are associated with insulin resistance, a key feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Although there is no significant association between lp(a) and other lipid levels (LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides), studies have shown a strong synergistic effect of genetically elevated LDL-C and Lp (a) on the development of cardiovascular events. Also, there is supporting evidence that hypertensive patients with high levels of lp(a) have higher cardiovascular risk, there is no direct association between hypertension and lp (a). Treatment of metabolic syndrome is often long-term and challenging but very important to reduce the overall cardiovascular risk, especially in individuals with higher levels of Lp (a), in whom the risk of developing cardiovascular disease is much higher.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dedb168aae871640ae23075056dd7daa48fdb4ac55a96a1221802b57840cbac6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
