Novel spatial data are of scientific interest as information on the distribution, population structure, and population size of this species is limited. Additionally, we present detailed photographs and morphological data on the collected specimens. The results are discussed in relation to the dispersal abilities and population structure in syngnathids.</p>","author":"Josefin Sundin, \nMarko Freese, \nLasse Marohn, \nTina Blancke, \nReinhold Hanel","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"95fb6920cf2a0732af4108781228ef8c6bd2866e08a4d2ce02d839ef92ae80b9","category":"Environment"}
