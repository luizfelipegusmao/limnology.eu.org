{"title":"Prediction for incremental damage on optics from final optics assembly in ICF high power laser facility","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0908/v1","date":1713196424000,"content":"High-power laser facilities necessitate predicting incremental damage to final optics to identify evolving damage trends. In this study, we propose a surface damage detection method utilizing image segmentation employing ResNet-18, and a damage area estimation network employing U-Net++. Paired sets of online and offline images of optics obtained from a large laser facility is used to train the network. The trends of varying damage could be identified by incorporating additional experimental parameters. A key advantage of the proposed method is that the network can be trained end-to-end on small samples, eliminating the need for manual labeling or feature extraction. The software developed based on these models can facilitate the daily inspection and maintenance of optics in large laser facilities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1ca91d06960a6bc2310fdf71839a38edc6284af8c4e092a556d1f4f9533e77d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
