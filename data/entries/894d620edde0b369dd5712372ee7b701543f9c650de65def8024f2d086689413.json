{"title":"Analyzing Thermal Environment Contribution and Driving Factors of Lst Heterogeneity Based on Urban Different Development Zones","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1022/v1","date":1718358449000,"content":"Analyzing the impacts of urban landscape patterns on the thermal environment has become one of the key research areas in addressing urban heat islands (UHI) and improving the living environment. A case study was carried out in Fuzhou, Fujian Province of China, to quantify the spatial patterns of urban landscape and land surface temperature (LST) in different development areas. The contribution of the thermal environment and the factors influencing the heterogeneity of LST were analyzed and discussed. In this study, bi-temporal Landsat imagery was selected to calculate LST, percent impervious surface area (ISA), and fractional vegetation cover (FVC). The urban area was further divided into three concentric urban zones, ranging from the city center to the urban periphery, based on urban development densities. The spatial pattern of LST and its variance were analyzed and compared between different zones and different dates. The thermal environment contribution of different zones was also quantified to indicate the change in urban landscape pattern resulting from urban expansion in different zones. Furthermore, Geodetector was used to explore the single factors and interaction factors controlling the spatial patterns of LST in each zone. The results showed that (ⅰ) Urban expansion primarily increased in zone 2 and zone 3, and the areal proportion of high and sub-high LST areas increased from 56.11% and 21.08% to 62.03% and 32.49% in zone 2 and zone 3, respectively, from 2004 to 2021; (ⅱ) The heat effect contribution of zones 2 and 3 reached from 75.16% in 2004 to 89.40% in 2021, indicating that the increase of ISA with &gt;LSTmean was more pronounced in zone 3 and zone 2 during the period; (ⅲ) The driving factors of LST spatial distribution were regionally different because of the different landscape patterns, and the explanatory power for the heterogeneity of LST in zone 1 was weaker than that in zone 2 and zone 3 in the study area; (ⅳ) The interaction of different factors had a higher explanatory power on the spatial distribution of LST than a single factor in each zone because the distributions of land cover types are heterogeneous in urban area. The results of the study can be used to improve urban planning for urban ecology and UHI mitigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"894d620edde0b369dd5712372ee7b701543f9c650de65def8024f2d086689413","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
