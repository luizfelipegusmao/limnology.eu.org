{"title":"Peer Ambassador Perspectives in a Culturally Tailored Self-Management Intervention for African Americans with Type 2 Diabetes: A Qualitative Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0514/v1","date":1712562275000,"content":"Objective: Diabetes disproportionately affects African Americans leading to higher morbidity and mortality. This study explores the experiences of African Americans adults who successfully self-manage their type 2 diabetes (called Peer Ambassadors) and provided phone-based peer support in a 6-month culturally tailored diabetes self-management program for African Americans guided by the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills model. \nDesign: A group discussion using a semi-structured discussion guide was conducted. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify the facilitators and barriers to completing the role of a Peer Ambassador, and to develop strategies for overcoming possible challenges in the future.\nSetting: Key informant discussions were conducted in a community location to gain insights into Ambassadorsâ€™ motivations and challenges in delivering peer support.\nParticipants: Three Peer Ambassadors completed ethics training, peer mentor training and received a phone call guide before providing support to their peers.\nResults: There were four core themes related to Peer Ambassador experiences: (1) Motivation to be a Peer Ambassador, (2) Program elements that supported Peer Ambassador role, (3) Key elements of achieving engagement, and (4) Challenges related to being a Peer Ambassador.\nConclusions: This study showed Peer Ambassadors in a culturally tailored peer-supported self-management program found fulfillment in sharing experiences and supporting peers.  They highly valued educational group sessions for knowledge updates and sustaining their health-related goals, suggesting the potential benefits of recognizing milestones or providing advanced training for future program sustainability. Findings suggest the importance of recruiting motivated patients and providing effective facilitation for peer support roles, including addressing barriers such as time commitment and lack of socialization opportunities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91f18f50c5db8f30f25a440995ae75bf9adc493ee16c9d909c03e7f74e99792d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
