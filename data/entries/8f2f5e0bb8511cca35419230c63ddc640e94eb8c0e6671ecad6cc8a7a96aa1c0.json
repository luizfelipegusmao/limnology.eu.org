However, few studies have examined AAD onset, weather conditions, and meteorological factors in Japan. This study aimed to identify meteorological factors associated with the onset of AAD in Japan. In this self-controlled study, patients diagnosed with AAD onset from May 1, 2012, to April 30, 2021, at Shizuoka City Shizuoka Hospital (Shizuoka, Japan) were included. Meteorological data from the Shizuoka District Meteorological Office were used. Control days were randomly selected from a 29-day period centered on the day of onset. Conditional logistic regression models were used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the onset of AAD relative to the control day due to changes in meteorological factors. In total, 538 patients were included. The meteorological factors associated with the onset of AAD were identified as the daily mean temperature (OR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.04–1.16), daily minimum temperature (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.03–1.14), daily maximum temperature (OR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.00–1.10), and the mean of the daily mean temperatures for the previous 7 days (OR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.07–1.28) with a 1°C decrease in the temperature. The results of this study are expected to help raise awareness in clinical practice and among the general public about the increased risk of AAD associated with a drop in temperature.","author":"Ayami Ishikawa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8f2f5e0bb8511cca35419230c63ddc640e94eb8c0e6671ecad6cc8a7a96aa1c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
