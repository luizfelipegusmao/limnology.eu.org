{"title":"Topic Analysis of the Literature Reveals Research Trends: The Case of Periodontics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1636/v1","date":1729518982000,"content":"Periodontics is a complex field characterized by a constantly growing body of research, posing a challenge for researchers and stakeholders striving to stay abreast of its evolving literature. Tradi-tional bibliometric surveys, while accurate, are labor-intensive and not scalable to meet the demands of such rapidly expanding domains. The aim of this study was to explore the uses of a top-ic-modeling algorithm to investigate the structure of the periodontics research field. To this purpose, we employed BERTopic to automatically sift through a substantial corpus of periodontics manu-scripts published in MEDLINE from 2009 to 2024 and identify topics using two sets of settings, to get a broader and high detailed view of the field, respectively. BERTopic identified and categorized 31 topics, unveiling the internal structure and the relations between publication macroareas. When we used the high granularity settings, we identified 2428 topics, which revealed hotspots within the field. Specific regression highlighted novel research areas such as artificial intelligence and exo-somes. In conclusion, BERTopic offers a flexible tool to provide insights into periodontics, its most recent trends, and serve as a useful instrument to approach the field and direct future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0ef01bcceee6517cb5c5c1824ddc4837b5fdc68ee179f8d91a6a72f2f9ebecee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
