{"title":"Cooperative Decay of an Ensemble of Atoms in a One-Dimensional Chain with a Single Excitation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0511/v1","date":1715176837000,"content":"We present an analytic calculation of the cooperative decay of a one-dimensional chain of N two-level atoms in the single-excitation configuration. Whereas the subradiant decay is zero for infinite lattices, we prove that for finite lattice the subradiant decay rate decreases as 1/N. We compare the results obtained using the scalar and the vectorial model. The calculations provide simple analytic expressions for the decay rate of the excitation, for arbitrary lattice spacing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e79cb7187574f918ff8ac8b5c123c75b200955abdcf1492134ae2b97d84b9b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
