{"title":"Networking 3 K Logic Gate Quantum Processors to Approach 1 Billion Logic Gate Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0784/v1","date":1725953798000,"content":"Outlined is a proposal designed to culminate in the foundry fabrication of arrays of singly addressable quantum dot sources deterministically emitting single pairs of energy-time entangled photons at C-band wavelengths; each pair having negligible spin-orbit fine structure splitting; each pair being channeled into single mode pig-tail optical fibers. Entangled photons carry quantum state information among distributed quantum servers via I/O ports having two functions; the unconditionally secure distribution of decryption keys to decrypt publicly distributed, encrypted classical bit streams as input to generate corresponding qubit excitations, and to convert a stream of quantum nondemolition measurements of qubit states into a classical bit stream. Outlined are key steps necessary to fabricate arrays of on-demand quantum dot sources of entangled photon pairs, principal among are 1) foundry fabrication of arrays of isolated quantum dots, 2) generation of localized sub-surface shear strain in a semiconductor stack, 3) a cryogenic anvil cell, 4) channeling entangled photons into single mode optical fibers, 5) unconditionally secure decryption key distribution over the fiber network, 6) resonant excitation of a Josephson tunnel junction qubits from classical bits, and 7) conversion of a quantum nondemolition measurements of a qubit states into a classical bit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91ecf30465a60c4226810eb5efae79ce01f23875f9042dfc59f947dec8d6cd34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
