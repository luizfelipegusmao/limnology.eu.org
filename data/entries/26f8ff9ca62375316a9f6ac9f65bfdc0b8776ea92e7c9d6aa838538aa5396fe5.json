We assessed dietary diversity, the prevalence, and predictors of undernutrition among pregnant adolescents and young women (PAYW) attending antenatal clinic (ANC) at two large teaching hospitals in northern Uganda.</p> Methods <p>Between 12<sup>th</sup> June 2023 to 27<sup>th</sup> October 2023, we conducted a facility-based, cross-sectional study at Gulu Regional Referral Hospital (GRRH) and St Mary’s Hospital Lacor (SMHL), both in Gulu district, Uganda. We recruited PAYW aged 15–24 years attending ANCs. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the study participants were collected using a pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaire. Undernutrition was defined as a mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of &lt; 23 cm. Modified Poisson regression analysis was performed to determine factors independently associated with undernutrition. Data analyses was performed using STATA version 17.0. A p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p> Results <p>A total of 324 participants, with a mean age of 21.2±2.2 years were enrolled. About 62.0% (n = 201) of the participants dewormed during pregnancy. The prevalence of undernutrition was 12.7% [n = 41]. Prevalence was higher among participants who maintained pre-pregnancy diet (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 2.27, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.26–4.05, p = 0.006), those who did not receive nutritional education (aPR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.21–4.20, p = 0.011) and consumption of non-green leafy vegetables (aPR = 4.62 95% CI: 1.64–13.01, p = 0.004). The prevalence of undernutrition was lower among participants who consumed milk and milk products (aPR = 0.44 95% CI: 0.24–0.81, p = 0.009) and among those who consumed fish and seafood compared to those who did not (aPR = 0.45 95% CI: 0.20–1.00, p = 0.050).</p> Conclusions <p>About 1 in 8 of PAYW attending GRRH or SMHL had undernutrition, particularly those who lacked education about feeding habits during pregnancy and limited access to milk and milk products, fish and seafoods. We recommend health workers to offer timely education of pregnant adolescent and young women mothers about good feeding habits during pregnancy, appropriate monitoring of weight gain and physiological changes during pregnancy.</p>","author":"Emmanuel Musinguzi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"26f8ff9ca62375316a9f6ac9f65bfdc0b8776ea92e7c9d6aa838538aa5396fe5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
