{"title":"The impact of management on the fecal microbiome of endangered greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in a zoo-based conservation program","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae052/7728823?rss=1","date":1722988800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Greater sage-grouse (<span>Centrocercus urophasianus</span>) are a critically endangered species in Canada with fewer than 140 individuals remaining on native habitats in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. In 2014, the Wilder Institute/Calgary Zoo initiated North Americaâ€™s only zoo-based conservation breeding program for this species to bolster declining wild populations through conservation reintroductions. Within the managed population of sage-grouse, morbidity and mortality have primarily been associated with intestinal bacterial infections. As a preliminary study to assess the gastrointestinal health of this species in managed care, the fecal bacterial microbiome of adult and juvenile captive sage-grouse was characterized with 16S rRNA sequencing. The composition of the microbiome at the phylum level in greater sage-grouse is consistent with previous studies of the avian microbiome, with <span>Bacillota</span> as the most abundant phyla, and <span>Actinomycetota</span>, <span>Bacteroidota</span> and <span>Pseudomonadota</span> also being highly abundant. Antibiotic use and sex did not have a significant impact on the diversity or composition of the microbiome, but the management of juvenile sage-grouse did influence the development of the microbiome. Juveniles that were raised outdoors under maternal care developed a microbiome much more similar to adults when compared to chicks that were incubated and hand-raised. The local environment and parental care appear to be important factors influencing the diversity and composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome in this species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"b66243cbd2cf5cb215357f06e175413907e8cfe589f2a1aff11e190418cfd5d4","category":"Environment"}
