{"title":"Digital Twins and Additive Manufacturing: Exploring the Integration of Digital Twin Technology with Additive Manufacturing to Enhance Design, Simulation, and Production Processes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2606/v1","date":1722431810000,"content":"The convergence of digital twin technology with additive manufacturing (AM) represents a transformative advancement in the fields of design, simulation, and production. Digital twins—virtual replicas of physical assets—enable real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization of manufacturing processes by mirroring their physical counterparts. When integrated with additive manufacturing, which allows for the creation of complex geometries and rapid prototyping, digital twins enhance the ability to design, test, and refine products with unprecedented precision and efficiency. This integration facilitates iterative design improvements, predictive maintenance, and real-time process adjustments, leading to more accurate simulations and optimized production workflows. By leveraging data from digital twins, manufacturers can anticipate issues, reduce material waste, and shorten development cycles. This abstract explores how the fusion of digital twin technology with AM not only refines traditional manufacturing paradigms but also paves the way for more innovative and adaptive manufacturing practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2fa94e40c283f2cf4e7cefa4b52d564d338e954fb7ce3b0530d48b57df2f47f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
