{"title":"In vitro and in vivo digestibility of prebiotic galactooligosacharides synthesized by β‐galactosidase from lactobacillus delbruecki subsp. bulgaricus CRL450","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13504?af=R","date":1712041200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>To date, the general belief that prebiotics reach the colon without any alterations is challenged. Some <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies have demonstrated that ‘non-digestible’ oligosaccharides are digested to different degrees depending on their structural composition. In this work, we compared different methods to assess the digestibility of oligosaccharides synthesized by β-galactosidase (β-gal) of <i>Lactobacillus delbruecki</i> subsp. <i>bulgaricus</i> CRL450 (CRL450-β-gal) from lactose, lactulose and lactitol.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>In simulated gastrointestinal fluid (SGIF) method no changes were observed. However, the oligosaccharides synthesized by CRL450-β-gal were partially hydrolyzed <i>in vitro</i>, depending on their structure and composition, with rat small intestinal extract (RSIE) and small intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from pig. Digestion of some oligosaccharides increased when mixtures were fed to C57BL/6 mice used as <i>in vivo</i> model, however, lactulose-oligosaccharides were the most resistant to the physiological conditions of mice. In general β(1 → 6) linked products showed higher resistance compared to β(1 → 3) oligosaccharides.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p><i>In vitro</i> digestion methods, without disaccharidases, may underestimate the importance of carbohydrates hydrolysis in the small intestine. Although BVMM and RSIE digestion assays are appropriate <i>in vitro</i> methods for these studies, <i>in vivo</i> studies remain the most reliable for understanding what actually happens in the digestion of oligosaccharides.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
