To improve OMIECs-based device efficiency and stability, a deeper understanding of their inherent structural characteristics and their evolution under diverse operational conditions is crucial. This requires acquisition of local information with high spatial resolution from extensive areas in the polymers films to be able to identify and map structural heterogeneities at the mesoscale.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"335fb79685c9c4a599cc63205d123c3edeb78d2b9721e027d286a062291b38bf","category":"Environment"}
