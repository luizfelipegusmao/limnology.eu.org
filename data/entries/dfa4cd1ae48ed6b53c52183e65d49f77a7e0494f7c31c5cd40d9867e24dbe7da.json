{"title":"CFD Based Process Simulation Models for the Turbulent Mixing of the Electrode Slurries Using Rotor-Stator Mixers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0666/v1","date":1725875580000,"content":"Nowadays, rotor-stator mixers are widely used in the chemical process industry to carry out the dispersion and de-agglomeration processes for manufacturing the homogenous electrode slurries. Development of the process simulation models for the turbulent mixing of these slurries helps to optimize the mixing parameters such as rotational speed and dispersion time. In this work, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach through ANSYS Fluent are explored to determine and analyze the flow patterns, velocity fields and viscosity distribution during the dispersion of anode slurries. It utilizes a non-homogeneous Eulerian multiphase approach and the typical k-Îµ model to create turbulence fields and compute the mixing rate. This work significantly improves our understanding of the relationship between rotor speed, dispersion time, viscosity distribution, and mixer geometry in rotor-stator mixers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dfa4cd1ae48ed6b53c52183e65d49f77a7e0494f7c31c5cd40d9867e24dbe7da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
