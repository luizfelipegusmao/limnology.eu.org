{"title":"A Systematic Review on Expert Systems for Improving Energy Efficiency in the Manufacturing Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1783/v2","date":1724830209000,"content":"Against the backdrop of the European Union's commitment to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, efforts to improve energy efficiency are being intensified. The manufacturing industry is a key focal point of these endeavors due to its high final electrical energy demand, while simultaneously facing a growing shortage of skilled workers crucial for meeting established goals. Expert systems (ESs) offer the chance to overcome this challenge by automatically identifying potential energy efficiency improvements and thereby playing a significant role in reducing electricity consumption. This paper systematically reviews state-of-the-art approaches of ESs aimed at improving energy efficiency in industry, with a focus on manufacturing. The literature search yields 1668 results, of which 62 articles published between 1987 and 2024 are analyzed in depth. These publications are classified according to the system boundary, manufacturing type, application perspective, application purpose, ES type, and industry. Furthermore, we examine the structure, implementation, utilization, and development of ESs in this context. Through this analysis, the review reveals research gaps, pointing toward promising topics for future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"918321c681e0fdf805a0c91988d345562dedb203e05799ec98ff732358358c63","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
