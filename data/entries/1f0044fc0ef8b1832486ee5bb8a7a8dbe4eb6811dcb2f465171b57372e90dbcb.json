{"title":"Metals Transfer in Mushroom Tricholoma matsutake from Regional High Geochemical Background Areas: Environmental Influences and Human Health Risk","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2402/v1","date":1722327667000,"content":"Wild-grown edible mushrooms are important in world diet, which are also efficient metal accumulators. Yunnan, southwest China is the main producing region with typically high geochemical metals. Environmental factors, bioaccumulation, distribution and human health risk of metals were examined in paired soil and Tricholoma matsutake (n=54). T. matsutake grows on acidified soils (pH=3.95–6.56) and metals showed strong heterogeneity with Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu ranged at 16–201, 0.046–8.58 g kg–1 and 22.6–215, 3.7–155 mg kg–1. High soil Fe content led to its great accumulation in T. matsutake (0.24–18.8 g kg–1). However, though soil Mn content was great higher than Zn and Cu, their concentrations in T. matsutake were comparable (21.1–487 vs. 38.7–329 and 24.9–217 mg kg–1). This suggested that T. matsutake prefers to accumulate Zn and Cu than Mn, and supported by bioaccumulation factor (BAF=0.32–17.1 vs. 0.006–1.69). Fe was mainly stored in stipe, while Mn, Zn and Cu were in cap, with translocation factor (TF) was 0.58 vs. 1.28–1.94. Therefore, stipe Fe showed the highest health risk index (HRI) at 1.28–26.9, followed by cap Cu (1.01–2.33), while 98–100% of Mn and Zn were risk-free. The higher concentration and greater risk of Fe was attributed to the significant effect of soil Fe content (R=0.34) and soil pH (R=–0.57). This study suggested that Fe as an essential mineral may exert toxic effects via T. matsutake consumption from geochemical high background areas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f0044fc0ef8b1832486ee5bb8a7a8dbe4eb6811dcb2f465171b57372e90dbcb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
