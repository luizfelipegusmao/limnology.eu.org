La Mattina, Marco Viceconti</p>\r\n\r\nFinite element models built from quantitative computed tomography images rely on element-wise mapping of material properties starting from Hounsfield Units (HU), which can be converted into mineral densities upon calibration. While calibration is preferably carried out by scanning a phantom with known-density components, conducting phantom-based calibration may not always be possible. In such cases, a phantomless procedure, where the scanned subject’s tissues are used as a phantom, is an interesting alternative. The aim of this study was to compare a phantom-based and a phantomless calibration method on 41 postmenopausal women. The proposed phantomless calibration utilized air, adipose, and muscle tissues, with reference equivalent mineral density values of -797, -95, and 38 mg/cm<sup>3</sup>, extracted from a previously performed phantom-based calibration. A 9-slice volume of interest (VOI) centred between the femoral head and knee rotation centres was chosen. Reference HU values for air, adipose, and muscle tissues were extracted by identifying HU distribution peaks within the VOI, and patient-specific calibration was performed using linear regression. Comparison of FE models calibrated with the two methods showed average relative differences of 1.99% for Young’s modulus1.30% for tensile and 1.34% for compressive principal strains. Excellent correlations (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.99) were identified for superficial maximum tensile and minimum compressive strains. Maximum normalised root mean square relative error (RMSRE) values settled at 4.02% for Young’s modulus, 2.99% for tensile, and 3.22% for compressive principal strains, respectively. The good agreement found between the two methods supports the adoption of the proposed methodology when phantomless calibration is needed.","author":"Julia A.
