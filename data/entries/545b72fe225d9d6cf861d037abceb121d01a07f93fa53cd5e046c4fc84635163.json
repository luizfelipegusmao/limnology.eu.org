{"title":"Nusinersen Treatment for Spinal Muscular Atrophy: Retrospective Multicenter Study of Pediatric and Adult Patients in Kuwait","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1315/v1","date":1713506723000,"content":"Spinal muscular atrophy is a neuromuscular genetic condition associated with progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide therapy approved for the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy in pediatric and adult patients. The objective of this clinical case series is to describe the efficacy and safety of nusinersen in treating spinal muscular atrophy in 20 pediatric and 18 adult patients across six treatment centers in Kuwait. Functional motor assessments (Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders, Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded, and Revised Upper Limb Module) were used to assess changes in motor function following nusinersen treatment. Safety assessment involved clinical monitoring of adverse events. The results demonstrate clinically meaningful or considerable improvement in motor performance for nearly all patients, lasting over 4 years in some cases. 70% of patients in the pediatric cohort and 72% of patients in the adult cohort achieved clinically meaningful improvement in motor function following nusinersen treatment. Additionally, nusinersen was well-tolerated in both cohorts. These findings add to the growing body of evidence relating to the clinical efficacy and safety of nusinersen.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"545b72fe225d9d6cf861d037abceb121d01a07f93fa53cd5e046c4fc84635163","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
