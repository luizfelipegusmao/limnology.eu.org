{"title":"On the Theoretical Intuition of Jungian Archetypes and its Logical Extensions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1869/v2","date":1724684038000,"content":"This article considers the status of Jungian archetypes as potentially divergent bodies. It possesses the initiative to consider the prerogative that they are situated on, and to develop that into discussing the conditions for a differing subjective reality that is derived from Jungian pretenses. This article operates within the boundaries of the conjecture, it serves simply to cover the potentiality for developments outside of the simple basis of the archetype rather than to provide a metaphysical or ontological contribution to psychology. Unlike Jung’s study, which serves  a multitude of ideas and draws upon evidential factors from - however generally expressed - ancient civilisations, this article instead seeks to apply that logic for the purpose of explicating the meaning and potential extensions of the “archetypal dogma”.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"26791472dd22e69309f8a651308b10d36a4d90efc37cb6b884039c91da6952f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
