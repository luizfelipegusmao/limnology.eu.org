{"title":"Phytochemical Screening and Antibacterial Activity of Commercially Available Essential Oils Combinations with Conventional Antibiotics against Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1441/v1","date":1713869552000,"content":"The present study aims to evaluate the antibacterial activity of five commercially available essential oils (EOs): Lavender (LEO), Clove (CEO), Oregano (OEO), Eucalyptus (EEO), and Peppermint (PEO) against the most-known MDR Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria - Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) - alone and in various combinations. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis established their complex composition. Then, the antibacterial activity was investigated in vitro by diffusimetric antibiogram method, using sterile cellulose discs with Ø 6 mm impregnated with 10 µl of sample and sterile borosilicate glass cylinders loaded with 100 µl of sample; MIC (µg/mL) for each EO was calculated from IZD values (mm) measured after 24 hours. The following EO combinations were evaluated: OEO+CEO, CEO+EEO, CEO+PEO, LEO+EEO, and EEO+PEO. Then, the influence of each dual combination on 3 conventional antibacterial drugs – Neomycin (NEO), Tetracycline (TET), and Bacitracin (BAC) - activity was investigated. The most active EOs against S. aureus and E. coli were LEO and OEO (IZD = 40 mm). They were followed by the CEO and EEO (IZD = 20-27 mm); PEO exhibited the lowest antibacterial activity (IZD = 15-20 mm). EEO alone showed the highest inhibitory activity on P. aeruginosa (IZD = 25-35 mm). It was followed by the CEO, LEO, and EEO (IZD = 7-11 mm), while PEO proved no antibacterial action against it (IZD = 0 mm). Only one synergic action was recorded (OEO+CEO against P. aeruginosa); EEO+PEO revealed partial synergism against S. aureus and CEO+PEO additive behavior against E. coli. Two triple associations with TET showed partial synergism against E. coli, and the other 2 ones (with NEO and TET) evidenced the same behavior against S. aureus; all contained EEO+PEO or CEO+PEO. Most combinations reported indifference. However, numerous cases were of antagonism between constituents included in double and triple combinations, and EOs with the strongest antibacterial activities belong to the highest antagonistic combinations. A consistent statistical analysis supports our results, showing that EOs with moderate antibacterial activities could generate combinations with higher inhibitory effects based on synergistic or additive interactions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a17617aa0b8bd4673917730cfcedd3ec54e7dd5081e74deb0be40af66adc734","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
