{"title":"Comprehensive evaluation of digital village development in the context of rural revitalization: A case study from Jiangxi Province of China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303847","date":1715868000000,"content":"<p>by Huixin Liu, Yuqian Zhang, Simeng Wang, Hui Zhao</p>\r\n\r\nDigital rural construction is a key strategic direction to promote Chinaâ€™s rural revitalization and alleviate global climate problems. In order to put forward feasible suggestions for the subsequent development and ensure the smooth development of digital village construction, how to reflect the development level of the digital village through scientific and reasonable comprehensive evaluation has become an urgent problem to be solved. This paper establishes a comprehensive evaluation index system through the Delphi method and principal component analysis method, then assigns weights to the evaluation indicators based on the improved CRITIC-G1 method, and then grades the development level of digital villages according to the extension matter element method. Finally, taking Jiangxi Province in China as an example, the overall development level of digital villages in Jiangxi Province is evaluated from the provincial level according to the proposed method. And put forward the corresponding countermeasures and suggestions. Results: Firstly, the development level of digital villages in Jiangxi Province is good, and there is a trend of excellent development level. Secondly, from different aspects of digital rural development, the digitalization of infrastructure, services, economy, and green production in Jiangxi Province is at a good level, and the digitalization of life has reached an excellent level. Thirdly, from the perspective of development trends, the digitization of infrastructure has a progressive trend towards an excellent level of development, while the digitization of services, economy and green production has signs of development regression. According to the analysis results, the relevant countermeasures and suggestions are put forward from four aspects: talent, capital, governance system and development planning. Other regions can evaluate the development level of the digital village according to the evaluation model proposed in this paper so as to analyze the existing problems and put forward targeted solutions to promote the construction of the digital village.","author":"Huixin Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"09b23efa41aa597819b9bc34234ce9520d2404ef8d96c608d0b07c4e70350339","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
