{"title":"The Effect of Follow-Up Period on the Relationship between Serum 25(OH)D Concentration and Risk of Stroke and Major Cardiovascular Event in Prospective Cohort Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0486/v1","date":1728350333000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Prospective cohort studies are useful for studying how biomolecular status affects risk of adverse health outcomes. Less well known is that the longer the follow-up time, the lower the apparent effect due to “regression dilution.” Here we evaluate how follow-up time affects the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration and incidence of stroke and major cardiovascular events (MCEs). Methods: Findings regarding the relative risk (RR) of stroke and MCEs with respect to serum 25(OH)D concentrations at baseline from prospective cohort studies were plotted against mean follow-up time. Fifteen studies from mainly European countries and the United States were used for stroke, with nine studies for MCEs. Linear regression analyses were performed for follow-up periods of up to 10 years. Results: For stroke, the linear regression fit for 1–10 years is RR = 0.34 + (0.065 × follow-up [years]), r = 0.84, adjusted r2 = 0.67, p 20 ng/mL should be recommended for everyone likely to be at risk for stroke or MCE and indeed in the general population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4bcecd0749ffbc21c71e6a1317d08808d1979ec5558be6f7e105b41f5f81deb8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
