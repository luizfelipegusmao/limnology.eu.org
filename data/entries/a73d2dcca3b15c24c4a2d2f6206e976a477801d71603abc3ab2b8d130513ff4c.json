{"title":"A Longitudinal Multi-Method Inquiry of Educational Workers Use of Interventions for Positive Mental Health and Wellbeing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0632/v1","date":1728469209000,"content":"Compassion fatigue and burnout are two distinct forms of mental health distress faced by educational workers. Researchers have shown a high level of both phenomena across the field of education,  however, a better understanding of what educational workers already do for positive mental and emotional health is needed. This research study examined three years of data, collected via survey, inquiring into the various interventions, namely supports and resources, that educational workers, specifically teachers, educational assistants, school leaders, and support administrators , use to support positive mental health. Quantitative data analysis via descriptive and inferential statistics revealed that educational workers relied heavily on their personal support network followed distantly by medical professionals and other interventions revealing a gap that needs to be addressed by employers. Qualitative thematic analysis revealed a trend towards increased use of environmental interventions to promote positive mental health. Suggestions for other interventions that might be helpful are provided.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a73d2dcca3b15c24c4a2d2f6206e976a477801d71603abc3ab2b8d130513ff4c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
