{"title":"Prevalence of Cancer Predisposition Syndromes (CPSs) in Children with a Neoplasm &ndash; a Cohort Study in a Central and Eastern European Population","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0017/v1","date":1722503053000,"content":"The causes of pediatric cancers often remain unknown; however, due to the development of medicine and technology, genetic disorders may play a crucial role in the genesis of neoplasms. Over time, the number of cancer predisposition syndromes (CPS) and awareness of them are increasing, providing the possibility of cancer prevention and early detection. In this study, we presented data concerning the number and type of oncological cases and their correlation with CPS occurrence in a cohort of Central and Eastern European pediatric population. The data were collected between 2000 and 2019 at the Karol Jonscher Clinical Hospital of Poznan University of Medical Sciences, resulting in a cohort of 2,190 cases in total, of which 193 children (8.81%) were confirmed to have CPS. CPS occurred most frequently in infancy (22.90% of all children suffering from any diagnosed cancer during the first year of life, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), accounting for more than a quarter of all CPS cases in our cohort. CPS were least likely to be observed in patients aged 14 and 15 years (2.17% and 2.44% of children diagnosed with any of the listed cancers at the exact age, respectively, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Among CPS, the most common were neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), and Down syndrome (DS). To conclude, it is important to emphasize the need for personalized treatment for each patient affected by both CPS and subsequent cancer in order to reduce the toxicity of therapy and improve quality of life by reducing the risk of side effect.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d4272e7da94676680104559ac3e5d3c232435bfbc8d0ac10d186d8be8acb324","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
