{"title":"Psychometric Evaluation of the Women´s Knowledge of Obstetric Healthcare Rights and Perception of Resource Scarcity Tools","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0183/v1","date":1725341379000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Resources to cope for maternity and women’s participation are essential modulators of maternal well-being. Therefore, it is relevant that the psychosocial factors of woman will be monitored during maternity to promote adequately healthcare. This study consisted in the design and the validation of two new tools that identify women's knowledge of obstetric healthcare rights (MatCODE) and perception of resource scarcity (MatER) during pregnancy, labor and early postpartum; Methods: The content validity was carried out using the Aiken's V coefficient and the content validity index (CVI-i) based on 5 experts. In addition, for the face validity of the pilot cohort was considered the INFLESZ scale. Finally, the questionnaires were applied to 185 women, which allowed to assess the construct validation by factorial and Rasch analysis. The divergent validity was also studied with validated psychological questionnaires; Results: MatCODE and MatER questionnaires received CVI-i and Aiken's V&amp;gt;0.80 values, also the INFLESZ demonstrates acceptable semantic understanding. The analysis confirms the unidimensional of the questionnaires with fit values for MatCODE of RMSEA=0.113 [0.105; 0.122] and MatER of RMSEA=0.067 [0.063; 0.072]. The divergent validity showed significative and consistent correlations with the constructs assessed. In MatCODE was =0.95 and =0.94 and in MatER was =0.79 and =0.78; Conclusions: MatCODE and MatER are new useful tools monitoring maternal healthcare, with adequate psychometric characteristics in Spanish context.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10bff17274f6c91373fa576e04174ab3901a50a091e3c9e15c625087d6bed909","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
