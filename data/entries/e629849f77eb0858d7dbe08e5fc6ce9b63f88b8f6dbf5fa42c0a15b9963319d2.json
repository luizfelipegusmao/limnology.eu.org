{"title":"Tocopherol and phylloquinone biosynthesis in chloroplasts requires the phytol kinase VITAMIN E PATHWAY GENE5 (VTE5) and the farnesol kinase (FOLK)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/4/1140/7485692?rss=1","date":1703030400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Chlorophyll degradation causes the release of phytol, which is converted into phytyl diphosphate (phytyl-PP) by phytol kinase (VITAMIN E PATHWAY GENE5 [VTE5]) and phytyl phosphate (phytyl-P) kinase (VTE6). The kinase pathway is important for tocopherol synthesis, as the <span>Arabidopsis</span> (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) <span>vte5</span> mutant contains reduced levels of tocopherol. <span>Arabidopsis</span> harbors one paralog of VTE5, farnesol kinase (FOLK) involved in farnesol phosphorylation. Here, we demonstrate that VTE5 and FOLK harbor kinase activities for phytol, geranylgeraniol, and farnesol with different specificities. While the tocopherol content of the <span>folk</span> mutant is unchanged, <span>vte5-2 folk</span> plants completely lack tocopherol. Tocopherol deficiency in <span>vte5-2</span> plants can be complemented by overexpression of <span>FOLK</span>, indicating that <span>FOLK</span> is an authentic gene of tocopherol synthesis. The <span>vte5-2 folk</span> plants contain only âˆ¼40% of wild-type amounts of phylloquinone, demonstrating that VTE5 and FOLK both contribute in part to phylloquinone synthesis. Tocotrienol and menaquinone-4 were produced in <span>vte5-2 folk</span> plants after supplementation with homogentisate or 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, respectively, indicating that their synthesis is independent of the VTE5/FOLK pathway. These results show that phytyl moieties for tocopherol synthesis are completely but, for phylloquinone production, only partially derived from geranylgeranyl-chlorophyll and phytol phosphorylation by VTE5 and FOLK.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"e629849f77eb0858d7dbe08e5fc6ce9b63f88b8f6dbf5fa42c0a15b9963319d2","category":"Environment"}
