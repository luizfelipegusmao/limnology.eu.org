A systematic review was conducted using a peer-reviewed search strategy to assess the current evidence regarding the validity of STBBI testing using DBS specimens. Eligibility criteria included studies reporting use of DBS specimens for STBBI testing with either commercially available or “in-house” tests in populations 15 years of age or older. Studies reporting a measure of validity such as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were eligible for inclusion. Quality of studies and risk of bias were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. A total of 7,132 records were identified. Of these, 174 met the criteria for inclusion. Among the studies that reported validity measures, a substantial proportion demonstrated high sensitivity (≥90%) in 62.5% of cases (<i>N</i> = 334/534 sensitivity measurements), and high specificity (≥90%) was observed in 84.9% of instances (<i>N</i> = 383/451 specificity measurements). However, the quality of the studies varied greatly. Our findings support the validity of the use of DBS specimens in STBBI testing where sufficient evidence was available, but validity is highly dependent on thorough method development and validation.","author":"François Cholette","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"ddaa86fa3d3a6ccb7406b3d25666f6395f496027dcdb79aef7713692a4675e1f","category":"Environment"}
