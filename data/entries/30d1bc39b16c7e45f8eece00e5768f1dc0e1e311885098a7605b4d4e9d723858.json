{"title":"Circular Economy Implementation in an Organization: A Case Study of Taiwan Sugar Company","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0294/v1","date":1720016844000,"content":"The implementation of circular economy principles is increasingly seen as a viable way to promote sustainable development and reduce environmental impact. This case study examines the implementation of circular economy principles at Taiwan Sugar Company (TSC), a leading sugar manufacturer in Taiwan. The study analyses the company's efforts to redesign its production processes, develop closed-loop systems, and promote resource efficiency. It also explores the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing circular economy principles in the sugar industry, such as the complexity of supply chains, the need for stakeholder engagement, and the availability of sustainable technologies. This study follows the principle of British standard 8001:2017 to implement the concept of circular economy in the organization. The study finds that the Taiwan Sugar Company has made significant progress in implementing circular economy principles, including adopting renewable energy sources, using byproducts as raw materials, developing sustainable packaging solutions, and using the output products of the company to make another useful product for industrial or agricultural use. These initiatives will result in the reduction of waste, an increase in resource efficiency, and enhanced environmental performance. However, the study also identifies several challenges that the company faces in implementing circular economy principles, such as the lack of standardized regulations and guidelines, the need for investment in sustainable technologies, and the need for stakeholder collaboration. Overall, the case study provides valuable insights into the implementation of circular economy principles in the sugar industry and offers practical recommendations for other organizations seeking to adopt circular economy principles. The study highlights the importance of stakeholder engagement, technological innovation, and regulatory support in promoting the transition toward a more sustainable and circular economy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30d1bc39b16c7e45f8eece00e5768f1dc0e1e311885098a7605b4d4e9d723858","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
