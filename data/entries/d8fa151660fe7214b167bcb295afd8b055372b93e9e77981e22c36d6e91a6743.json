In Indonesia, Business Incubators, overseen by Universities and Provincial/City Governments, are pivotal. However, understanding the determinants of Business Incubator Performance remains limited. This study investigates 24 statement items aiming to uncover the factors influencing Technology Business Incubators in Indonesia, with a focus on knowledge management as a mediating variable derived from a knowledge-based perspective. Employing a quantitative approach, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is utilized to scrutinize these factors' impact on Business Incubator Performance. The findings reveal that knowledge management fully and partially mediates between funding support, government assistance, incubator governance, and Business Incubator Technology Performance. This research offers valuable insights for entrepreneurs and stakeholders, emphasizing the significance of funding, governmental backing, incubator governance, and knowledge management in enhancing Incubator Business Technology Performance in Indonesia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d8fa151660fe7214b167bcb295afd8b055372b93e9e77981e22c36d6e91a6743","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
