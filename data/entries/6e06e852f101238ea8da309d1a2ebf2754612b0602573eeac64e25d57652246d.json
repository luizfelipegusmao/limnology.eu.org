{"title":"The Road Ahead in Pancreatic Cancer: Emerging Trends and Therapeutic Prospects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0206/v1","date":1722610402000,"content":"This review explores the challenges and emerging trends in pancreatic cancer therapy. In particular, we focus on the tumor microenvironment and the potential of immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer. We discuss novel strategies targeting the desmoplastic barrier and immunosuppressive cells to enhance immune cell infiltration and activation. Recent clinical trials, particularly those involving novel immunotherapeutic agents and tumor vaccines, are examined to understand their efficacy and limitations. This review aims to highlight the ongoing efforts to refine immunotherapy approaches for better patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e06e852f101238ea8da309d1a2ebf2754612b0602573eeac64e25d57652246d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
