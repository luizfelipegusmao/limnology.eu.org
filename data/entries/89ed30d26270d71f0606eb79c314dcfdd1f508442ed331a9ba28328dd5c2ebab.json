{"title":"Th Hyperboloidal Universe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202201.0301/v9","date":1658219536000,"content":"This paper proposes a relativistic model of the Universe in which the geometry describes a 4D version of the 2-sheeted hyperboloid that is isotropic, homogeneous in space at a given time and inhomogeneous in time.  The radius of this metric is temporal as opposed to spatial.  It predicts both a Universe and Anti-Universe moving in opposite directions of time undergoing an expansion phase, followed by a collapsing phase.  Using only the current age of the Universe and transition redshift, it predicts the accelerated expansion and it is shown that its Hubble diagram fits currently available supernova and quasar data as well as predicting a Hubble constant $H_0\\approx71.6km/s/Mpc$.  The angular term of the metric describes time dilation caused by the relativistic kinematic precession effect known as Thomas Precession which can be interpreted as spin about the time dimension.  The model also makes two novel predictions:  that the early Universe should have structures older than expected due to an increased amount of proper time relative to coordinate time in that era and that the background Universe should appear brighter than current models predict.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"89ed30d26270d71f0606eb79c314dcfdd1f508442ed331a9ba28328dd5c2ebab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
