{"title":"Fatigue Crack Propagation of 51CrV4 Steels for Leaf Springs Suspensions of Railway Freight Wagons","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0662/v1","date":1712658524000,"content":"Leaf springs are critical components for the railway vehicle safety in which they are installed. Although these components are produced in high-strength alloyed steel and designed to operate under cyclic loading conditions in the high-cyclic fatigue region, their failure is still possible to occur and hence lead to economic and human catastrophes. The aim of this document is precisely to characterise the mechanical crack growth behaviour of the 51CrV4 spring steel representative of leaf springs under cyclic conditions, that is, crack propagation in mode I. The common fatigue crack growth prediction models (Paris and Walker) considering the effect of stress ratio and parameters such as propagation threshold, critical stress intensity factor and crack closure ratio are also determined using statistical methods, which resulted in good approximations with respect to the experimental results. Lastly, the fracture surfaces under the different test conditions were analysed using SEM, with no significant differences to declare. As a result of this research work, it is expected that the developed properties and fatigue crack growth prediction models can assist design and maintenance engineers in understanding fatigue behaviour in the initiation and propagation phase of cracks in leaf springs for railway freight wagons.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60628413c6deb9133ea6b3247f35fa25421f4f3824334a09f1e3e142e8f0f240","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
