{"title":"Leaf litter breakdown phenology in headwater stream networks is modulated by groundwater thermal regimes and litter type","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10423?af=R","date":1726662711000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Leaf litter dominates particulate organic carbon inputs to forest streams. Using data-informed simulations, we explored how litter type (slow- vs. fast-decomposing species), pulsed autumn litter inputs, groundwater-mediated temperature regimes, and climate warming affect litter breakdown in a 3<sup>rd</sup>-order stream network. We found that the time-dependent interactions of these variables govern network-scale litter breakdown phenology, with greater thermal sensitivity of slow-decomposing litter for both current and future scenarios. Groundwater thermal inputs modified litter breakdown phenology by reducing spring and summer and elevating winter litter breakdown fluxes. Under future warming scenarios, the source depth of contributing groundwater influenced summer detrital resources; shallow groundwater-fed streams had reduced summer resources compared to deep groundwater-fed streams. Our results demonstrate that predicting in-stream carbon cycling requires explicit consideration of the phenology of resource inputs and the seasonal timing of environmental factors, notably stream thermal regimes.</p>","author":"Danielle K.
