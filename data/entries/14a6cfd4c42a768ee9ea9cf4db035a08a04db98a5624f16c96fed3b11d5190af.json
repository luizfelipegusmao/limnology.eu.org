{"title":"Fish Consumption Frequency in the Adult Population in Poland","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2159/v1","date":1724943824000,"content":"The aim of the study was to assess the frequency of fish consumption in Poland including sea and freshwater fish species referring to some socio-economic determinants. The frequency of consumption was assessed using Food Propensity Questionnaire data from 1489 adults (722 males, 767 females) in 2019â€“2020. The fish consumption frequency in Polish adults was too rare compared to the recommendations (at least twice a week). About 80% of respondents consumed fish less frequently than recommended. Sea fish were mostly consumed less than once a month (31.8%) or 1-3 times a month (30.9%). The most of subjects (44.8%) consumed freshwater fish less than once a month. It was also depended on: educational level, economic status, place of residence, declared health status, and on BMI value or BMI status. However, taking into account sex, the occurrence of these relationships was different in men and women. It seems that educational activities and dissemination of proper nutrition principles is necessary in order to increase the consumption of fish in Poland. It should be important to emphasize health benefits of fish consumption in relation to possible adverse effects of their contamination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"14a6cfd4c42a768ee9ea9cf4db035a08a04db98a5624f16c96fed3b11d5190af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
