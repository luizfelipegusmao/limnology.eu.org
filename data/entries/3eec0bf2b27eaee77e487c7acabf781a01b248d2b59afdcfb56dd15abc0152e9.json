Statoliths of <i>Illex coindetii</i> (Verany, 1839) and <i>Loligo forbesii</i> (Steenstrup, 1856) were studied from multiple areas of the North East Atlantic and Northern Mediterranean Sea during 2021–2022. <i>I. coindetii</i> and <i>L. forbesii</i> individuals were categorized into multiple stocks across the areas studied. Stocks migrating between fishing areas as well as multiple stocks in the same area, as identified for <i>L. forbesii</i> in this study, need to be considered for sustainable fisheries management.</p>","author":"Bianca T.
