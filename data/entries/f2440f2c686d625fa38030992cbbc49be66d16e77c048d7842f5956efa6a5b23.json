{"title":"Responsiveness of respiratory function in Parkinson’s Disease to an integrative exercise programme: A prospective cohort study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301433","date":1711720800000,"content":"<p>by Laura McMahon, Denise McGrath, Catherine Blake, Olive Lennon</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Respiratory disorders are the most common cause of death in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Conflicting data exist on the aetiology of respiratory dysfunction in PD and few studies examine the effects of exercise-based interventions on respiratory measures. This study was conducted to better understand respiratory dysfunction in PD and to identify measures of dysfunction responsive to an integrative exercise programme.</p> Objectives <p>The objectives were to compare baseline respiratory measures with matched, published population norms and to examine immediate and longer-term effects of a 12-week integrated exercise programme on these measures.</p> Design <p>Twenty-three people with mild PD (median Hoehn &amp; Yahr = 2) self-selected to participate in this exploratory prospective cohort study. Evaluation of participants occurred at three time points: at baseline; following the 12-week exercise programme and at 4-month follow-up.</p> Outcome measures <p>Outcome measures included: Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), Inspiratory Muscle Strength (MIP), Expiratory Muscle Strength (MEP), Peak Cough Flow (PCF), and Cardiovascular Fitness measures of estimated VO2 max and 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT).</p> Results <p>Compared to published norms, participants had impaired cough, reduced respiratory muscle strength, FEV, FVC, PEF and cardiovascular fitness. Post exercise intervention, statistically significant improvements were noted in MEP, cardiovascular fitness, and PEF. However only gains in PEF were maintained at 4-month follow-up.</p> Conclusions <p>Significant respiratory dysfunction exists, even in the early stages of PD. Metrics of respiratory muscle strength, peak expiratory flow and cardiovascular fitness appear responsive to an integrative exercise programme.</p>","author":"Laura McMahon","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f2440f2c686d625fa38030992cbbc49be66d16e77c048d7842f5956efa6a5b23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
