{"title":"Sediment and phosphorus contributions from eroding banks in a large intensively managed watershed in western Iowa, United States","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.13164?af=R","date":1708274038000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In this study, a new remote sensing tool was used in conjunction with sampling of river bank sediments to map channel migration patterns and estimate the net contribution of bank erosion to the sediment and phosphorus (P) budget of the Nishnabotna River in southwestern Iowa. Between the years 2009 and 2018, we found that at least 1.81 ± 0.57 × 10<sup>7</sup> Mg of sediment and 8.26 ± 2.5 × 10<sup>3</sup> Mg of P entered the Nishnabotna River due to channel migration. This equates to 0.87 Mg of sediment per meter of channel per year and 0.40 kg of P per meter of channel per year. Barring additional deposition elsewhere in the river corridor, these values represent as much as 77% of annual suspended sediment and 46% of the annual P export from the watershed. Our results also indicate that the contribution of net sediment and P volume loss by stream order increases sharply from third to sixth order, even though the total channel length is much smaller in the higher orders. These results suggest that bank erosion is an important source of sediment and P within the watershed and that future attempts to decrease riparian exports of sediment and P should focus on high-order reaches.</p>","author":"Forrest F.
