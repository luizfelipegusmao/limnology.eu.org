{"title":"The Interplay Between Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, Interleukin 6, Microbiome, and Gut Barrier Integrity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1588/v1","date":1719220918000,"content":"A severe consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifests as systemic inflammation and multi-organ involvement is called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). This review examines the possible relationship between gut barrier integrity, the microbiome, dysregulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling, and MIS-C. Clinical and biochemical features of MIS-C are similar to those of other hyperinflammatory syndromes, suggesting a dysregulated immune response. One possible explanation for the systemic inflammation seen in MIS-C patients is SARS-CoV-2-induced dysregulation of the IL-6 signaling pathway. In addition, new data suggest a reciprocal link between gut barrier integrity and IL-6. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits bacteriophage-like behavior, highlighting the role of bacteria as a reservoir for the virus and emphasizing the importance of understanding the bacteriophagic mechanism of the virus in fecal-oral transmission. Increased translocation of viral products and bacterial toxins may result from disrupting the intestinal barrier and cause systemic inflammation. On the other hand, systemic inflammation can weaken the integrity of the intestinal barrier, which feeds back into the loop of immunological dysregulation. In the context of MIS-C, understanding the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection, IL-6, and gut barrier integrity may shed light on the etiology of the disease and guide treatment options.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7502f40e44261875cb0f707b8b7c1942c7743f2e3cb2ce148e43079c2572f84a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
