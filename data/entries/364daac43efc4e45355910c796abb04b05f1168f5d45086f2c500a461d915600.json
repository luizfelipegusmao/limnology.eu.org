{"title":"PECTIN ACETYLESTERASE12 regulates shoot branching via acetic acid and auxin accumulation in alfalfa shoots","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/518/7607896?rss=1","date":1707868800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Shoot branching is an important biological trait affecting alfalfa (<span>Medicago sativa</span> L.) production, but its development is complicated and the mechanism is not fully clear. In the present study, <span>pectin acetylesterase 12</span> (<span>MsPAE12</span>) and <span>NAM/ATAF/CUC-domain transcription factor gene</span> (<span>MsNAC73</span>) were isolated from alfalfa. <span>MsPAE12</span> was highly expressed in shoot apexes, and MsNAC73 was found to be a key transcriptional repressor of <span>MsPAE12</span> by directly binding to salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) elements in the <span>MsPAE12</span> promoter. The biological functions of MsPAE12 and MsNAC73 were studied through overexpression (OE) and down-expression (RNAi) of the 2 genes in alfalfa. The numbers of shoot branches increased in <span>MsPAE12</span>-OE lines but decreased in <span>MsPAE12</span>-RNAi and <span>MsNAC73</span>-OE plants, which was negatively related to their indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) accumulation in shoot apexes. Furthermore, the contents of acetic acid (AA) in shoot apexes decreased in <span>MsPAE12</span>-OE plants but increased in <span>MsPAE12</span>-RNAi and <span>MsNAC73</span>-OE plants. The changes of AA contents were positively related to the expression of <span>TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE 1</span> (<span>MsTAA1</span>), <span>TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE-RELATED 2</span> (<span>MsTAR2</span>), and <span>YUCCA flavin monooxygenase</span> (<span>MsYUCC4</span>) and the contents of tryptophan (Trp), indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA), and IAA in shoot apexes of <span>MsPAE12</span>-OE, <span>MsPAE12</span>-RNAi, and <span>MsNAC73</span>-OE plants. Exogenous application of AA to wild type (WT) and <span>MsPAE12</span>-OE plants increased Trp, IPA, and IAA contents and decreased branch number. Exogenous IAA suppressed shoot branching in <span>MsPAE12</span>-OE plants, but exogenous IAA inhibitors increased shoot branching in <span>MsPAE12</span>-RNAi plants. These results indicate that the MsNAC73-MsPAE12 module regulates auxin-modulated shoot branching via affecting AA accumulation in shoot apexes of alfalfa.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"364daac43efc4e45355910c796abb04b05f1168f5d45086f2c500a461d915600","category":"Environment"}
