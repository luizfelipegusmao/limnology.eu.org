To detect and categorize a range of common hazardous gasses, we propose an attention-based Long Short term memory Full Convolutional network (ALSTM-FCN) in this paper. We adjust the network parameters of ALSTM-FCN using the Sparrow search algorithm (SSA) based on this, by comparison, SSA outperforms Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) Algorithm, Cuckoo Search (CS) Algorithm and other traditional optimization algorithms. We evaluate the model using University of California-Irvine (UCI) datasets and compare it with LSTM and FCN. The findings indicate that the ALSTM-FCN hybrid model has a better reliability test accuracy of 99.461% than both LSTM (89.471%) and FCN (96.083%). Furthermore, AdaBoost, logistic regression (LR), extra tree (ET), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and other models were trained. The suggested approach outperforms the conventional machine learning model in terms of gas categorization accuracy, according to experimental data. The findings indicate a potential for a broad range of polluting gas detection using the suggested ALSTM-FCN model, which is based on SSA optimization.","author":"Xueying Kou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f45519a9488124987d4db0e2bcf9d8f12f9eecd0b25a363e553415b5b8f3df0c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
