{"title":"Physical Activity Behaviour and Motivation During and Following Pulmonary and Cardiac Rehabilitation: A Repeated Measures Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0358/v1","date":1725455703000,"content":"Background: Exercise rehabilitation programs are important for long-term health and wellbeing among people with cardiac and pulmonary disease. De-spite this, many people struggle to maintain their physical activity once reha-bilitation ends. This repeated measures study tracked changes in physical ac-tivity behaviour and motivation during and after completing a communi-ty-based exercise rehabilitation program. \nMethods: Cardiac and pulmonary exercise rehabilitation patients (N=31), com-pleted six once-monthly measures of physical activity (MET·min), self-determined motivation, intention, and habit strength for rehabilitation ex-ercise (within rehabilitation sessions) and lifestyle physical activity (outside of rehabilitation sessions). Linear regression and random effects models with es-timated marginal means were used to test for associations between physical activity motivation and behaviour and change during and post-rehabilitation.\nResults: Overall physical activity decreased after rehabilitation (823 MET·min) despite patients becoming more self-determined for lifestyle physical activity during rehabilitation. More self-determined motivation, stronger intentions, and stronger habits were associated with more lifestyle physical activity be-haviour. However, none of these motivation variables were significantly asso-ciated with rehabilitation exercise behaviour.\nConclusions: Among community-based cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation patients, physical activity levels decreased following exercise rehabilitation programs. The findings revealed clear distinctions in the motivation of reha-bilitation exercise compared to lifestyle physical activity. Exercise rehabilitation programs might improve the longevity of outcomes by integrating approaches to enhance lifestyle physical activity beyond the clinic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d446182995ed72899ef99990167f6cc456c43fc5ec46a276b49a7024158e2232","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
