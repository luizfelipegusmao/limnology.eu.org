{"title":"DNA Gene's Basic Structure as a Nonperturbative Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics: Is RNA Polymerase II the Quantum Bus of Transcription?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1016/v2","date":1727257834000,"content":"Previously, we described that Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine nucleobases were superconductors in a quantum superposition of phases on each side of the central Hydrogen bond acting as a Josephson Junction. Genomic DNA has two strands wrapped helically around one another, but during transcription, they are separated by the RNA polymerase II to form a molecular condensate called the transcription bubble. Successive steps involve the bubble translocation along the gene body. This work discusses how quantum information transfer and entanglement can be achieved by modeling DNA as a combination of","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a67121c6c65035161e7e0efa93f35defe2a7b760fbbfafe91661578c9941ff71","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
