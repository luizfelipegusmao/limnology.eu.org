{"title":"Future Climate Change Impacts on Rice in Uttar Pradesh, India's Most Populous Agrarian State","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF004009?af=R","date":1714794233000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Uttar Pradesh, with a population of 237 million, is the largest agrarian state in India, located in the Indo-Gangetic plains. Rice cultivation is widespread across all districts of Uttar Pradesh, which have varying climate regimes, irrigation infrastructures, crop management practices, and farm sizes. The state is characterized by different agroecological zones (AEZs) with semi-arid to sub-humid climates with significant variability in monsoon rainfall. In this study, the impact of climate change on Kharif-season rice is estimated using crop-climate scenarios in Uttar Pradesh. A process-based Crop Simulation Model, Crop Estimation through Resource and Environment Synthesis-Rice, was simulated with bias-corrected and downscaled climate data for historical (1995â€“2014) and three future periods (the 2030s, 2050s, and 2090s) for two mitigation pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6. Phenology, irrigation amount, crop evapotranspiration, yield, and water use efficiency were evaluated and assessed for all AEZs. Based on the ensemble of 16 climate models, rainfed rice yield increased in the AEZs of western Uttar Pradesh due to increased rainfall, while in eastern Uttar Pradesh yield decreased, under both shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). Irrigated rice yield decreased in all AEZs under both SSPs due to an increase in temperature and a decrease in the length of the growing period, with reductions of up to 20% by the 2090s. Irrigation requirements decreased from the 2030s to the 2090s due to increased rainfall and decreased crop evapotranspiration. Despite the projected increase in rainfed yield, the overall rice yield is expected to decrease in the future under both SSPs.</p>","author":"Jyoti Singh, \nSandeep Sahany, \nK. K.
