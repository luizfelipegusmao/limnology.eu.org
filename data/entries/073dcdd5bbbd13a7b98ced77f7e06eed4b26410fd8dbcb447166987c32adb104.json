In this study, the gut microbiota modulation effect of an NTU 101 product, Vigiis 101-LAB, on healthy human was investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Vigiis 101-LAB significantly modulated human gut microbiota at fourth and sixth weeks of trial (anosim analysis, <i>P</i> = 0.001). It also significantly improved peristalsis (<i>P</i> = 0.003) and shortened defecation interval of subjects. The shift of gut microbiota is significantly fit with defecation interval (<i>P</i> = 0.009) and stool shape (<i>P</i> = 0.001) of subjects.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Our results suggest that Vigiis 101-LAB promotes human intestinal health with improvement of peristalsis and fecal quality. The gut modulation effects of Vigiis 101-LAB subsequently raised the abundance of vitamin B7, vitamin K, pyrimidine and purine biosynthesis pathways. Vigiis 101-LAB may promote peristalsis via purinergic pathway and possibly conferring prophylactic benefits against irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Tzu‐Hsing Lin, \nTsung‐Wei Shih, \nChih‐Hui Lin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"073dcdd5bbbd13a7b98ced77f7e06eed4b26410fd8dbcb447166987c32adb104","category":"Environment"}
