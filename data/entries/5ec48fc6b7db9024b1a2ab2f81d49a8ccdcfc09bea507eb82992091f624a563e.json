{"title":"Sustainable Synthesis and Photocatalytic Activity of Translucent ZnO Nanowires Using Moringa Seed Extract","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2042/v1","date":1721912637000,"content":"Background: The study demonstrates the sustainable synthesis of translucent zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires using Moringa seed extract, highlighting eco-friendly and sustainable approaches. Methods: Characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the formation of ZnO nanostructures with diverse morphologies, including nanowires and spherical clusters. Results: The synthesized ZnO nanowires exhibited remarkable photocatalytic activity, achieving over 89% degradation efficiency of methylene blue (MB) under UV light within 80 minutes, demonstrating their potential for wastewater treatment applications. Conclusions: The research findings support Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to clean water, climate action, and life below water and on land, highlighting the role of eco-friendly nanostructures in environmental remediation. The dual advantage of Moringa seed extract, providing both a sustainable synthesis route and health benefits due to its rich content of vitamins and phytochemicals, underscores the potential of integrating natural resources in nanotechnology for environmental and health applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ec48fc6b7db9024b1a2ab2f81d49a8ccdcfc09bea507eb82992091f624a563e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
