{"title":"The Influence of a High-Cholesterol Diet and Forced Training on Lipid Metabolism and Intestinal Microbiota in Male Wistar Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0509/v1","date":1712552485000,"content":"The aim of our study was a comprehensive comparative assessment of the effect of consumption of 1 and 2% cholesterol as part of a standard diet with and without regular moderate physical activity on the main biomarkers of lipid and cholesterol metabolism, as well as the intestinal microbiota of male Wistar rats. The animals were randomly divided into 5 groups according to body weight and Open Field test results: Control (n=10), 1% Chol (n=10), 2% Chol (n=10), 1% Chol + RUN (n=10) and 2% Chol + RUN. The cholesterol was additionally added in the amount of 1g or 2g/100g, respectively, to the diet of animals. The rats of experimental groups 1% Chol + RUN and 2% Chol + RUN were subjected to regular (2 days a week) physical activity on a Treadmill. In rats of four experimental groups, when compared to the Control, a response of 39 indicators was revealed. The largest number of changes in biomarkers - 29 (statistically significant, p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"260403c0d5ef9fe15d5d02a1e1e460ecc004251a65cbffd47bc4051655bbca8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
