We combined a zig-zag line transect survey of buoys, a fisheries enforcement survey and a drone survey to estimate recreational effort in the open-access trap fishery for signal crayfish (<i>Pacifastacus leniusculus</i>) in the sixth largest lake in Europe, Lake Vättern, Sweden. Using supporting variables such as size of nearby ports and bathymetry, our model-assisted estimate of total effort was 6400 (±4300 CI) buoys during the three-weekend season. Using the frequency of buoys to traps as a constant, the total number of crayfish traps was estimated to be 25,500 (±17,000 CI). The sampling design and methods presented are useful for ecologists and resource managers to design future multi-source surveys of recreational trap fishing effort.</p>","author":"Göran Sundblad, \nAnnica de Groote, \nPeter Lundquist, \nMattias Larsson, \nRasmus Linderfalk, \nFredrik Larson","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"d9090b6480ce7c67d4e26d96ec537958da03a4bbae1d3655230bf85ff6c85643","category":"Environment"}
