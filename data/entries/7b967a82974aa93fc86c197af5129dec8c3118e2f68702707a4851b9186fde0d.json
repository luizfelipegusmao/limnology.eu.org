{"title":"Hermite Quartic Splines for Smoothing and Sampling a Roughing Curvilinear Spiral Toolpath","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1455/v1","date":1716381299000,"content":"From an industrial point of view, the milling of 2.5D cavities is a frequent operation, 1\nconsuming time and presenting optimization potential, especially through a judicious choice of 2\nthe tool trajectory. Among the different types of trajectories, some have a general spiral-like aspect 3\nand can potentially offer a reduced machining time. They are called curvilinear trajectories and are 4\nobtained by interpolation between structure curves which are the numerical solutions of a partial 5\ndifferential equation. In this case, the machine tool will connect points and the trajectory will be made 6\nup of small segments. Even if, macroscopically, these trajectories have all the qualities to allow the 7\ntool to move quickly, on a small scale, the discontinuities in tangency, inherent in the discretization, 8\nsignificantly increase machining time. This article suggests to enhancing the continuity level of the 9\ntoolpath by rebuilding structure curves with a set of Hermite quartic spline patches connected in 10\ntangency and curvature. Thanks to this, the tool will machine at an average feedrate closer to the 11\nprogrammed one and will, de facto, reduce traveling time. 12\nThis article shows that the proposed method increases, on the two tested cavities, toolpath quality 13\nindicators, reduces milling time from 10% to 18% for a curvilinear method without a filter and make 14\nit possible to generalize the Bieterman and Sandstr√∂m method for all non convex pockets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b967a82974aa93fc86c197af5129dec8c3118e2f68702707a4851b9186fde0d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
