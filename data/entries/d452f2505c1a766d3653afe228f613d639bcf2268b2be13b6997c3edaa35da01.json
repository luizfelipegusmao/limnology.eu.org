{"title":"Microscopy Analysis and Mechanical Properties of PETG-CF","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.272/7719978?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>3D printing is constantly evolving for different engineering fields for the purpose or opportunity to obtain a variety of mechanical properties [<a href=\"#ozae044.272-B1\">1</a>]. This technique allows the deposition of layers and/or structures on top of each other, which have been shown to have potential in industrial applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.272-B2\">2</a>]. Studies in the literature show that the mechanical properties are related to the type of layer and/or structures obtained by additive manufacturing [<a href=\"#ozae044.272-B3\">3</a>]. On the other hand, the types of layers and/or structures obtained by PETG-FC currently has an innovative field due to its attributes, therefore generating research on these printed materials is of great interest for the aeronautical, aerospace and automotive industry [<a href=\"#ozae044.272-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.272-B5\">5</a>]. Also, the type of deposition of PETG-FC composite layers and/or structures by fused deposition modeling can have excellent mechanical property attributes for engineering use and biomedical area [<a href=\"#ozae044.272-B6\">6</a>]. However, research on PETG-FC has not yet been fully completed [<a href=\"#ozae044.272-B7\">7</a>]. Therefore, this study shows the effect of the type of structure of the material obtained with PETG-FC on the effect of the mechanical properties. In the present study, a PETG filament (85-90%) with carbon fiber (10-15%) with a diameter of 1.75 mm, purchased on the Internet, was used. The production of tensile, flexural and compression specimens with 10%, 70% and 100% infill percentages with a rectilinear internal infill pattern with a 45Â° print angle were modeled on a FlashForge Creator 3 pro printer. Table 1 describes the printing parameters for each specimen. ASTM D638-02 for tension, ASTM D695-02a for compression specimens and ASTM D790-03 for 3-point bending were used. The characterization of the specimens was carried out using a SHIMADZU universal testing machine with a capacity of 100 kN. Figure 1 shows the tensile, compression and flexural specimens fabricated with PETG/carbon fiber and the infill patterns used in each. The specimens were observed under a Mitutoyo microscope model TM-505B.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d452f2505c1a766d3653afe228f613d639bcf2268b2be13b6997c3edaa35da01","category":"Environment"}
