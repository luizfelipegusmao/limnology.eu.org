In order to investigate the deformation response of pile induced by the construction of three-hole small spacing tunnel, the DEM-FDM (discrete element method and finite difference method) coupling numerical simulation method were used to simulate the deformation process of pile during tunnel excavation. This paper probed into the deformation response of pile by three factors: the length of pile, the pile-tunnel spacing, and the three-hole tunnel construction. The results showed that, as the pile-tunnel spacing decreases, the incremental horizontal displacement of the pile top became more significant when the three-hole tunnel was excavated. The excavation resulting in four zones of horizontal displacement concentration. The prominent locations were mainly concentrated on both sides of the tunnel and the ground directly above the tunnel. The research findings of this study can provide insights and references for the design and construction of shield tunneling under passing piles.","author":"Zhenchu Zhao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d25a2a765cdc90ba01587cdd0728447aae5727ca3b084412daa0ea85d67aa252","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
