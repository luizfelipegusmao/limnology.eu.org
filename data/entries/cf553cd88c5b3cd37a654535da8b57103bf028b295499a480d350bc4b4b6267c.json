{"title":"Smart Governance Tool&#039;s Design to Monitor the Commitments of Bio-Business Licensing in Indonesia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0802/v1","date":1720578339000,"content":"Some business license commitments in online single submission (OSS) currently only consist of an independent statement from the business actor, and there is no time limit for fulfilling the license, especially for low-risk bio-business licenses. Therefore, a system design is needed to monitor the fulfillment of business license commitments and to provide confidence to the public regarding the business provided. The system design started with discussing the importance of smart governance tools, defining the requirements for monitoring the commitment of bio-business licenses, selecting documents, determining important words and document types, and proposing a design. This research produces a prototype of a business license monitoring system. This smart governance tool checks the validity of business license documents. The proposed smart governance tool will overcome the complexity of the integration process for fulfilling business licenses from the Indonesian government units or agency systems with the OSS system. Apart from that, it is also very effective by looking at the thousands of government applications that currently exist and the desire to become one application solution that contains many functions that can fulfill the many needs of business actors for simple and transparent business licenses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf553cd88c5b3cd37a654535da8b57103bf028b295499a480d350bc4b4b6267c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
