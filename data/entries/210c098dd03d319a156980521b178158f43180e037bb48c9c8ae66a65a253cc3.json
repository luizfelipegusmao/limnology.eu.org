{"title":"Urine Nephrin and Podocalyxin Reï¬‚ecting Podocyte Damage and Severity of Kidney Disease in Various Glomerulonephritis. A Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0073/v1","date":1714548938000,"content":"Introduction: Glomerulopathy is a term used to describe a broad spectrum of renal diseases, character-ized by dysfunction of glomerular filtration barrier, especially of podocytes. Several podocyte-associated proteins have been found and proved their usefulness as urine markers of podocyte dysfunction. Two of them are nephrin (NEP) and prodocalyxin (PDC). \nPurpose: This study aims to evaluate the association of podocyte damage, as it is demonstrated via the concentrations of urinary proteins, with clinical and histological data from patients with several types of glomerulonephritis. \nMethods: We measured urine levels of two podocyte-specific markers, NEP and PDC (corrected for urine creatinine levels), in patients with a wide range of glomerulopathies. Serum and urine parameters as well as histological parameters from renal biopsy were recorded. \nResults: In total, data from 37 patients with glomerulonephritis and 5 healthy controls were analyzed. PDC and NEP concentrations correlated between them and with serum creatinine levels (p=0.001 and p=0.013 respectively), and with histological lesions associated with chronicity index of renal cortex, such as severe interstitial fibrosis, severe tubular atrophy and hyalinosis (for PDC/NEP, all p3gr/24h with diffuse fusion of podocyte foot processes (p=0.016) was identified.\nConclusions: Podocalyxin and nephrin concentrations in urine represent markers of podocyte dysfunction and in our study they were associated both with serum creatinine and histological chronicity indices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"210c098dd03d319a156980521b178158f43180e037bb48c9c8ae66a65a253cc3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
