{"title":"Noncanonical and reversible cysteine ubiquitination prevents the overubiquitination of PEX5 at the peroxisomal membrane","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002567","date":1710252000000,"content":"<p>by Tânia Francisco, Ana G.

Azevedo</p>\r\n\r\nPEX5, the peroxisomal protein shuttling receptor, binds newly synthesized proteins in the cytosol and transports them to the organelle. During its stay at the peroxisomal protein translocon, PEX5 is monoubiquitinated at its cysteine 11 residue, a mandatory modification for its subsequent ATP-dependent extraction back into the cytosol. The reason why a cysteine and not a lysine residue is the ubiquitin acceptor is unknown. Using an established rat liver-based cell-free in vitro system, we found that, in contrast to wild-type PEX5, a PEX5 protein possessing a lysine at position 11 is polyubiquitinated at the peroxisomal membrane, a modification that negatively interferes with the extraction process. Wild-type PEX5 cannot retain a polyubiquitin chain because ubiquitination at cysteine 11 is a reversible reaction, with the E2-mediated deubiquitination step presenting faster kinetics than PEX5 polyubiquitination. We propose that the reversible nonconventional ubiquitination of PEX5 ensures that neither the peroxisomal protein translocon becomes obstructed with polyubiquitinated PEX5 nor is PEX5 targeted for proteasomal degradation.","author":"Tânia Francisco","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"8ecdea482411e438951178822da3a23b8a5a8ec0036f7ac2076fdf2b0e1a7390","category":"Environment"}
