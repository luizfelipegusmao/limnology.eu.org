{"title":"SquamBaseâ€”A database of squamate (Reptilia: Squamata) traits","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13812?af=R","date":1710729699000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Motivation</h2>\n<p>I present a database that contains information on multiple key traits for all 11,744 recognised species of squamates worldwide. The database encompasses key traits and a reasonably comprehensive picture of available public knowledge. I present comprehensive description of the sources and rationale leading to the assignment of each particular trait state for each species. I hope the dataset can serve the scientific community, promote research and understanding of the group, comparisons with other taxa, and assessment of conservation needs. Furthermore, gaps in our knowledge of squamate traits become readily apparent and will hopefully lead to further study and even better knowledge.</p>\n<h2>Main types of variables contained</h2>\n<p>Morphological, ecological, life history, geographical and conservation-related traits.</p>\n<h2>Spatial location</h2>\n<p>Global.</p>\n<h2>Time period</h2>\n<p>Late Holocene to recent.</p>\n<h2>Major taxa and level of measurement</h2>\n<p>Squamata, species.</p>\n<h2>Software format</h2>\n<p>xlsx.</p>","author":"Shai Meiri","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Ecology and Biogeography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3c0e5aaffe8fee3c8550c0a05a71fc802d704add877621e55c59b91462c01050","entryHash":"700aae061ca9757ce2fb6b6dd5e7a086f6aa8242e0e3b562885b7ce8b4a559f3","category":"Environment"}
