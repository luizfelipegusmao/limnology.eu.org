{"title":"Molecular evaluation and phenotypic screening of brown and orange rust in <i>Saccharum</i> germplasm","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307935","date":1722348000000,"content":"<p>by Gleicy Kelly Oliveira, Fernanda Zatti Barreto, Thiago Willian Almeida Balsalobre, Roberto Giacomini Chapola, Hermann Paulo Hoffmann, Monalisa Sampaio Carneiro</p>\r\n\r\nBrazil is the largest global producer of sugarcane and plays a significant roleâ€”supplier of sugar and bioethanol. However, diseases such as brown and orange rust cause substantial yield reductions and economic losses, due decrease photosynthesis and biomass in susceptible cultivars. Molecular markers associated with resistance genes, such as <i>Bru1</i> (brown rust) and <i>G1</i> (orange rust), could aid in predicting resistant genotypes. In this study, we sought to associate the phenotypic response of 300 sugarcane accessions with the genotypic response of <i>Bru1</i> and <i>G1</i> markers. The field trials were conducted in a randomized block design, and five six-month-old plants per plot were evaluated under natural disease conditions. Genotypic information about the presence or absence of <i>Bru1</i> (haplotype 1) and <i>G1</i> gene was obtained after extraction of genomic DNA and conventional PCR. Of the total accessions evaluated, 60.3% (181) showed resistance to brown rust in the field, and of these, 70.7% (128) had the <i>Bru1</i> gene present. Considering the field-resistant accessions obtained from Brazilian breeding programs (116), the <i>Bru1</i> was present in 77,6% of these accessions. While alternative resistance sources may exist, <i>Bru1</i> likely confers enduring genetic resistance in current Brazilian cultivars. Regarding the phenotypic reaction to orange rust, the majority of accessions, 96.3% (288), were field resistant, and of these, 52.7% (152) carried the <i>G1</i> marker. Although less efficient for predicting resistance when compared to <i>Bru1</i>, the <i>G1</i> marker could be part of a quantitative approach when new orange rust resistance genes are described. Therefore, these findings showed the importance of <i>Bru1</i> molecular markers for the early selection of resistant genotypes to brown rust by genetic breeding programs.","author":"Gleicy Kelly Oliveira","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"576928adadc6e31c69d88e3d678ffd6370eeca01758d3909d28863bbfff32d1f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
