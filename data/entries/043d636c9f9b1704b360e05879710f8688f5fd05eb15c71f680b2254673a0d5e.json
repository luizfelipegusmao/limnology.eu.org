{"title":"Scope and adaptive value of modulating aggression over breeding stages in a competitive female bird","link":"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/doi/10.1093/beheco/arae042/7680098?rss=1","date":1716422400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In seasonally breeding animals, the costs and benefits of territorial aggression should vary over time; however, little work thus far has directly examined the scope and adaptive value of individual-level plasticity in aggression across breeding stages. We explore these issues using the tree swallow (<span>Tachycineta bicolor</span>), a single-brooded bird species in which females compete for limited nesting sites. We measured aggressiveness in nearly 100 females within 3 different stages: (1) shortly after territory-establishment, (2) during incubation, and (3) while caring for young chicks. Based on the timing, direction, and magnitude of behavioral changes between stages, we used k-means clustering to categorize each female’s behavior into a “plasticity type.” We then tested whether plasticity type and stage-specific aggression varied with key performance metrics. About 40% of females decreased aggressiveness across consecutive breeding stages to some degree, consistent with population-level patterns. 33% of females exhibited comparatively little plasticity, with moderate to low levels of aggression in all stages. Finally, 27% of females displayed steep decreases and then increases in aggression between stages; females exhibiting this pattern had significantly lower body mass while parenting, they tended to hatch fewer eggs, and they had the lowest observed overwinter survival rates. Other patterns of among-stage changes in aggressiveness were not associated with performance. These results reveal substantial among-individual variation in behavioral plasticity, which may reflect diverse solutions to trade-offs between current reproduction and future survival.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Behavioral Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"1db0533e04d0549951ccffff4320904ff6ab62ef3f2aa22718600b7dc255e125","entryHash":"043d636c9f9b1704b360e05879710f8688f5fd05eb15c71f680b2254673a0d5e","category":"Environment"}
