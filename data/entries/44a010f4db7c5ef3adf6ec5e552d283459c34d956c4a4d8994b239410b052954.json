The essence of the SEM is to induce the emission of various electron products from the specimen, among which backscattered electrons (BSEs) play a pivotal role. These BSEs emerging from the specimen carry information of composition and structure and play an important role in material and life science. Therefore, while most SEMs are equipped with a standard BSE detector, optimizing the measurement process of BSEs becomes crucial when considering the wide range of measurements into account and pushing the limits for aiming the maximum performance. In addition to the detection efficiency of the detector, the geometry of the set-up also plays a decisive role. We therefore address the question of how the layout of the detector affects the specific geometries present in SEM setups [<a href=\"#ozae044.1092-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"44a010f4db7c5ef3adf6ec5e552d283459c34d956c4a4d8994b239410b052954","category":"Environment"}
