{"title":"Volumetric Assessment of the Maxillary Sinus After Maxillary Advancement and Impaction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1370/v1","date":1729169304000,"content":"Background: Orthognathic surgery is a surgical procedure that consists of osteotomies and maxillary movements aimed at facial harmony and occlusal repositioning. Methods: The present study aimed to perform a retrospective study using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to evaluate the air volume of the maxillary sinus and its attached structures, detection and diagnosis of anatomical defects, induced or not by maxillary advancement surgery - mandibular and/or maxillary impaction in two stages: preoperative (T0) and postoperative of at least 6 months (T1). Results: Of the 31 patients selected, it was found that the volume of the maxillary sinus had no statistically significant change, descriptively there were 6.45% for retention cyst and 32.25% for mucosal thickening, reduction in 6 cases of septal deviation in T1 that were present in T0 in patients undergoing maxillary advancement and impaction. Furthermore, it was possible to observe a decrease in postoperative cases of obstructed ostium and an increase in cases of patent ostium. Conclusion: That orthognathic surgery for maxillary advancement and/or impaction does not pose a risk to the health of the maxillary sinuses during the period analyzed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d374d9839db1c4dbb6d0d610ffcbb9444b8192dae06c611652eedd8b1017d68","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
