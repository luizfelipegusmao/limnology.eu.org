{"title":"Could the Spike Protein Derived from mRNA Vaccines Negatively Impact Beneficial Bacteria in the Gut?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1505/v1","date":1721306876000,"content":"The emergence of mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 has opened a new page in vaccine development; nevertheless, concerns of the experts have been expressed about unintentional side effects on the gut microbiota (GM). Previous studies showed that this virus acts as a bacteriophage, which infects and destroys specific bacterial strains in the GM. The present manuscript hypothesizes that the synthetic spike protein could create changes in the composition and the functioning of the GM by entering the intestinal cells after vaccination and impairing the symbiotic relationship between intestinal cells and the GM. An experimental protocol to test the hypothesis is suggested.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ab2a18faf16fa8246e520e8f0f4216b10bd01ac05c55e27036e2ee9205ee015","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
