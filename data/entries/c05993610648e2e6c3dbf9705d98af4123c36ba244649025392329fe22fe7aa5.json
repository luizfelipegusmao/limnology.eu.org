{"title":"Microscopic Coherent Sources of Gravitational Radiation with Application to Forming a Stable Warp Field","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2370/v1","date":1727693407000,"content":"Recent US Congressional hearings on UAPs have made the study of exotic propulsion systems a matter of serious academic study and indeed, military necessity. This speculative paper looks at the possibility that microscopic sources could produce gravitational radiation with minimal energy requirements, whilst trapping the electromagnetic radiation stress-energy from being emitted. It may be possible to form an array of these micro-emitters of sufficient strength, acting with collective phenomenon, to allow non-linearities and the formation of soliton waves suitable for a putative warp field. Interestingly we find no need for exotic matter or negative energy. Moving onto the Alcubierre metric we ponder if the field could actually be made to travel superluminally by a repetitive stepped process of, expanding space just ahead of the craft initially to speed-up the propagation of the field, via the Shapiro Delay, so that a second field propagates that contracts space aggressively; the net effect being space contracting ahead of the craft faster than light.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c05993610648e2e6c3dbf9705d98af4123c36ba244649025392329fe22fe7aa5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
