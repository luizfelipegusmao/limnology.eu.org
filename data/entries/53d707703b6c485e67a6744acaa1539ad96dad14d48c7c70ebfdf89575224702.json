{"title":"Polymer-Modified Fertilizers for Mitigating Strawberry Root Burn","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0733/v1","date":1725973692000,"content":"Polymer-modified fertilizers (PMFs) with prolonged nutrient release present a promising solution to address the challenges associated with conventional fertilization practices, particularly for sensitive crops such as strawberries. This study investigates the effectiveness of biodegradable PMFs in maintaining nutrient availability at optimal levels while minimizing root burn and nutrient losses. A factorial field experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of varying concentrations of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on the nutrient release rates from complex NPK fertilizer and monoammonium phosphate, as well as their subsequent effects on strawberry yield and soil properties. Results indicate that polymer modifications significantly slow down nutrient release, leading to prolonged nutrient retention in the soil at salt levels that are optimal for maximizing yield while remaining low enough to prevent the risk of root burn. Consequently, the application of PMFs not only enhances strawberry yield but also promotes healthier plant growth by ensuring a steady supply of nutrients throughout the growing season without inducing stress. The findings underscore the potential of biodegradable polymers to optimize fertilizer efficiency, reduce environmental impacts, and support sustainable agricultural practices. This research provides valuable insights into the development of more effective fertilization strategies for strawberry cultivation and other sensitive crops using PMFs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53d707703b6c485e67a6744acaa1539ad96dad14d48c7c70ebfdf89575224702","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
