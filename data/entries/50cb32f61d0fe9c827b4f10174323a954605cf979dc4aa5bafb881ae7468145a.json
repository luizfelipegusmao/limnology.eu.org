{"title":"Factors influencing the utilisation of anti-HBs titre testing services among nursing students in Northwest Ghana: A cross-sectional study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003160","date":1714053600000,"content":"<p>by Augustine Ngmenemandel Balegha</p>\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the impact of hepatitis B testing, vaccination, the number of vaccine doses, and socio-demographics on post-vaccination anti-HBs titre testing, is essential for hepatitis B prevention. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B testing, hepatitis B vaccination, number of vaccine doses received, socio-demographic characteristics, and their impact on anti-HBs titre testing among nursing students in Northwest Ghana. A stratified sample of 402 nursing students from Wa and Lawra nursing colleges in Ghana’s Upper West Region was surveyed in November 2020 using an online cross-sectional design. STATA 13 was used to analyse the data, which described socio-demographics, hepatitis B testing, hepatitis B vaccination, and post-vaccination anti-HBs titre testing with frequencies and percentages. Hierarchical binary logistic regression models were used to investigate the relationships between post-vaccination anti-HBs titre testing and hepatitis B testing, vaccination, the number of vaccine doses, and their socio-demographics. The study discovered that while hepatitis B testing was high (89.0%), rates for hepatitis B vaccination (72.1%), obtaining the recommended vaccine doses (59.5%), and post-vaccination anti-HBs titre testing (19.4%) were lower. Nursing students who accepted hepatitis B vaccination were significantly more likely to undergo anti-HBs titre testing [aOR = 12.34; 95% CI = 1.80–84.54; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05]. Those who received ≥ 3 vaccine doses were over 8 times more likely to utilise anti-HBs titre testing [aOR = 8.31; 95% CI = 2.73–25.34; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001]. Wa NTC students were 74% less likely to access anti-HBs titre testing [aOR = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.15–0.47; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001]. Students with parents who had tertiary education were significantly more likely to undergo anti-HBs titre testing [aOR = 2.50; 95% CI = 1.42–4.42; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01]. The study reveals high hepatitis B testing but low vaccination rates, emphasizing the need for required vaccine doses and post-vaccination anti-HBs testing. Key predictors include hepatitis B vaccination, ≥3 doses, Wa NTC enrollment, and parental education. The study advocates mandatory testing, vaccination, and affordable access to anti-HBs titre testing. Unvaccinated students, those with &lt;3 doses, Wa NTC attendees, and those with lower parental education for nursing school admission should be prioritised.","author":"Augustine Ngmenemandel Balegha","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"50cb32f61d0fe9c827b4f10174323a954605cf979dc4aa5bafb881ae7468145a","category":"Environment"}
