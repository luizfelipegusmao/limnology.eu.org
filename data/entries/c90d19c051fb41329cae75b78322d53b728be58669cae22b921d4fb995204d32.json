{"title":"Cellulose, Rice Husk and Polyvinyl Acetate-Based Composite: Flame Retardancy and Fungi Growth Experimental Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1208/v1","date":1713419498000,"content":"Within the context of sustainable material development for the construction sector, this study explores the viability of panels composed of recycled newspaper-derived cellulose (9%), rice husk (14%), borax (15%), and polyvinyl acetate-based glue (62%). The methods employed involve water absorption and density tests, following ASTM C-1763 and C-303 standards. The fire resistance test conforming to the European standard UNE 23-725-90, and a mold growth test using AOAC 2002.11. The composite is prone to absorbing a significant amount of water when exposed to humid conditions. However, the incorporation of rice husk and borax can provide benefits such as improved moisture resistance compared to other cellulitic insulators, which may be advantageous in specific climates. Also, the developed composite has an intermediate density compared to other polymeric materials. This characteristic presents advantages in applications that demand a balance between strength and lightness. During the fire resistance tests, the samples with borax presented less fire propagation, and superficial damage compared with the specimens without borax. This is important, considering the fireproofing property, required in building materials. The presence of borax in the composite has an inhibitory effect on the growth of fungi and yeasts. These findings are consistent with previous research. Nevertheless, further research and testing are imperative to assess its viability and performance for commercial applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c90d19c051fb41329cae75b78322d53b728be58669cae22b921d4fb995204d32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
