The liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and RNA into “membrane-less organelles,” also known as biomolecular condensates, is dynamic and reversible, depending on factors such as salt concentration, temperature, and protein levels. While much of the seminal work on biomolecular condensates has been conducted in animal systems, plant biologists too are starting to realize that plant cellular components form condensates (<a href=\"#koae157-B3\">Field et al. 2023</a>; and see other articles in <span>The Plant Cell</span> July 2023 focus issue on biomolecular condensates, introduced by <a href=\"#koae157-B4\">Gutierrez-Beltran et al. 2023</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"9ebcad690b9289558f71ddb5c398e3ee34e6f494605754d7d8c3400095a1b518","category":"Environment"}
