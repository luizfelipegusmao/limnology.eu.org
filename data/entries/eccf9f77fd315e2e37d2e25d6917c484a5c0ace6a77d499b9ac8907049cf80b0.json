{"title":"Larger yellow‐phase Japanese eels show short‐range homing in a freshwater river","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15815?af=R","date":1716957886000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The homing behavior and site fidelity to habitats in various fishes, including anguillid eels (genus <i>Anguilla</i>), are fascinating. However, little is known about how yellow-phase eels exhibit homing behavior and the sensory mechanisms involved. Using acoustic telemetry, we investigated the homing behavior of 18 Japanese eels, <i>A</i>. <i>japonica</i>, with total lengths ranging from 204 to 570 mm, in a narrow freshwater river in inland central Japan, where salinity gradient, tidal current, and magnetic sense cannot be used for their homing, but where olfaction could play a role. The tagged eels captured upstream and downstream were released downstream and upstream, respectively. The results showed that large eels, over approximately 400 mm in total length, exhibited homing behavior to their original sampling locations (likely to shelters and foraging sites, where they probably spent a longer time than in other locations and grew successfully) from outside their home ranges, predominantly during the dark period. Homing success was not affected by the two capture locations, indicating that eels did not use olfactory cues for short-range homing in freshwater rivers.</p>","author":"Hiromichi Mitamura, \nJunichi Takagi, \nYoshimi Itaya, \nShun Watanabe, \nManabu Kume","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"eccf9f77fd315e2e37d2e25d6917c484a5c0ace6a77d499b9ac8907049cf80b0","category":"Environment"}
