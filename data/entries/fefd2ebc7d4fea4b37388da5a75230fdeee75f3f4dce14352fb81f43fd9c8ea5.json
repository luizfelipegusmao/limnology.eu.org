{"title":"Modelling and Simulation of Pico- and Nano-Grids for Renewable Energy Integration in a Campus Microgrid","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0980/v1","date":1723621552000,"content":"Research in renewable energy sources and micro-grid systems is critical for the evolving power industry. Micro-grids can supply diverse loads while reducing dependency on the utility grid. This paper models both pico-grids and nano-grids in the Singapore Institute of Technology Punggol campus, incorporating solar PV, energy storage systems (ESS), power electronics converters, and both DC and AC loads, along with utility grid connections. The pico-grid includes a battery storage system, a single-phase inverter linked to a single-phase grid, and DC and AC loads. The nano-grid comprises solar PV panels, a boost converter, a battery storage system, a three-phase inverter connected to a three-phase grid, and AC loads. Both the pico-grid and nano-grid are configurable in standalone or grid-connected modes. This configuration flexibility allows for detailed operational analysis under various conditions. The study conducts subsystem-level modeling before integrating all components into the simulation environment. MATLAB/Simulink is utilized to model, simulate, and analyze the power flow in both the pico-grid and nano-grid under different operating conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fefd2ebc7d4fea4b37388da5a75230fdeee75f3f4dce14352fb81f43fd9c8ea5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
