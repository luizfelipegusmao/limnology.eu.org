{"title":"Racial Disparities in Fall-Related Injuries Among Breast Cancer Survivors Who Received Chemotherapy: A Retrospective Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1306/v1","date":1729085443000,"content":"Purpose: The study aims to investigate racial disparities in fall-related injuries among Black and White breast cancer survivors who received chemotherapy, focusing on the risks associated with different chemotherapy regimens.\nMethods: This retrospective cohort study involved 11,400 breast cancer survivors (Stage 1-3) treated with chemotherapy between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2023. Chemotherapy types studied include Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, Paclitaxel, Docetaxel, and Carboplatin. Logistic regression and descriptive analyses were used to assess fall risk associated with each chemotherapy type, stratified by race.\nResults: The overall fall-related injury rate was higher among Black survivors (14.7%) compared to White survivors (10.0%), with a significant difference in fall risk between the two groups (p &lt; 0.001). Fall risk was notably elevated for Black patients treated with Cyclophosphamide, Docetaxel, and Carboplatin.\nConclusions: The findings highlight significant racial disparities in fall-related injuries among breast cancer survivors receiving chemotherapy. These disparities may be influenced by socioeconomic factors and healthcare access.\nImplications for Cancer Survivors: Interventions targeting fall prevention and equitable healthcare access are critical to reducing these disparities among Black breast cancer survivors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb2fd52eb7d69d5ad32eb8909f377e9dc12c4bc895d61216446f125cb0ae0308","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
