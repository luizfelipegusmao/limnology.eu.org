{"title":"A Novel Robust Hybrid Control Strategy for a Quadrotor Trajectory Tracking Aided with Bioinspired Neural Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2173/v1","date":1725008579000,"content":"This paper proposes a novel hybrid control strategy for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on bio-inspired neural dynamics. This strategy addresses the velocity jump issue prevalent in traditional backstepping control and the control signal chattering problem common in traditional sliding mode control. The control system comprises an outer-loop bio-inspired backstepping controller and an inner-loop bio-inspired sliding mode controller, ensuring smooth trajectory tracking even in the presence of external disturbances. The stability of the quadrotor UAV control system is rigorously analyzed using Lyapunov stability theory. Extensive comparative simulation experiments are conducted to assess the robustness and effectiveness of the control system. Results demonstrate superior trajectory tracking performance of the proposed control system compared to other control systems for quadrotor UAVs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ed5d0d118e796b5730e1b6493be842ee66ada750ee9d685bac986c0097e5c34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
