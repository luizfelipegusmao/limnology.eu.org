{"title":"Factors Associated with Exclusive Breastfeeding during Admission to a BFHI Hospital A Cross‐ Sectional Study in Spain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1768/v1","date":1714154924000,"content":"Background: breastfeeding is the optimal nourishment for infants and recommends that children commence breastfeeding within the first hour of birth and be exclusively breastfed for the initial 6 months of life. Our objective was to determine which factors related to mothers could influence the degree of exclusive breastfeeding during hospitalization, as well as to assess breastfeeding mothers' attitudes towards breastfeeding. Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional study was undertaken in the healthcare area of Santiago de Compostela, Spain. The reduced Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS-s) was employed to gauge maternal attitudes toward feeding their baby. Results: 64 women were studied. The overall score of IIFAS-s (mean ± standard deviation) was 36.95 ± 5.17. No use of pacifier by the newborn was associated with a positive attitude for breastfeeding. Having previous children (ORa=6,40; IC95% 1,26 – 32,51) and previous experience with breastfeeding (ORa=6,70; IC95% 1,31 – 34,27) increase the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding during admission. Conclusions: It is important to identify the factors that contribute to increasing the probability that mothers choose exclusive breastfeeding. We must guide our training efforts to these factors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7df63fb1622aaabf417be088d2b8d5af1ead01959f2fdaf6566185f8bb7bf143","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
