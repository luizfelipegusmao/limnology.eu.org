{"title":"Assessing Asymmetry in Soccer: Implications for Muscular Power, Balance, and Injury Prevention","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0409/v1","date":1728280294000,"content":"This review explores the prevalence and implications of muscular power and dynamic balance asymmetry among soccer players, focusing on its impact on performance and injury risk. Asymmetry is common in soccer due to the sport's specific demands, such as the frequent use of one leg for kicking and passing. While some asymmetry may allow for functional specialization and may not impair performance, significant imbalances are often linked to an increased risk of injuries, particularly to the lower extremities. Dynamic balance asymmetry is also associated with a higher risk of non-contact injuries, highlighting the importance of joint stability in preventing such injuries. However, the direct impact of balance asymmetry on performance metrics like sprint speed and agility is less definitive, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms or training adaptations might mitigate potential negative effects. Advancements in assessment technologies, such as motion capture systems and wearable devices, have enhanced the precision of asymmetry evaluations, enabling more targeted interventions. Despite these technological advancements, further research is needed to understand the long-term effects of asymmetry across different player demographics, including youth and female athletes, and to evaluate the effectiveness of specific training interventions. This review recommends a multidisciplinary approach, integrating biomechanics, sports medicine, and coaching insights, to develop comprehensive strategies for managing asymmetry in soccer. Such strategies will be crucial for optimizing player performance, minimizing injury risk, and improving training and rehabilitation programs tailored to the diverse needs of soccer players.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d54d0776bb6f7b26d692165aad8a0bc8e118064d433d0e63d88a2507b923a4f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
