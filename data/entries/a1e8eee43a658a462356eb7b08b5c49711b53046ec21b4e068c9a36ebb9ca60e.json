{"title":"Effectiveness of Integrated Vestibular Rehabilitation in Improving Balance and Motor Function in Patients with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0562/v1","date":1725634537000,"content":"This study evaluates the effectiveness of an integrated vestibular rehabilitation program in improving balance, motor control, and proprioceptive function in patients diagnosed with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). The prospective observational study involved 107 participants who underwent a tailored rehabilitation regimen, including the Epley maneuver, Brandt-Daroff exercises, and balance and proprioceptive training. The program was designed to address the vestibular and proprioceptive deficits caused by BPPV, with the goal of restoring normal function and reducing the risk of symptom recurrence. Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) and Balance Beam Test were used to assess progress, showing significant improvements in balance stability and dynamic motor function. The findings support the integration of vestibular rehabilitation into standard care for BPPV patients, highlighting the program's potential to enhance patient outcomes and reduce recovery time. However, the study also notes limitations such as the lack of a control group and the need for further research to explore the long-term effects of such interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1e8eee43a658a462356eb7b08b5c49711b53046ec21b4e068c9a36ebb9ca60e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
