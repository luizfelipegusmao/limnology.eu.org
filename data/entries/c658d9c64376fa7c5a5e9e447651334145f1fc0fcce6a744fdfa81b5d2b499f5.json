{"title":"Highly Reinforced Ti-TiC Metal-Matrix Composites Manufactured by Laser Powder Bed Fusion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0490/v1","date":1723045885000,"content":"Titanium-based metal-matrix composites manufactured by additive manufacturing offer tremendous lightweighting opportunities. However, processing high reinforcement content remains challenging. This study reports an improved manufacturing process for Ti-TiC enabling high reinforcement content and significant fracture strain concurrently: mechanical blending, followed by laser powder bed fusion and a single heat treatment. As-built microstructure shows both un-melted TiC particles and sub-stoichiometric TiC dendrites resulting from a partial dissolution of TiC particles. The heat treatment is shown to fully convert TiC dendrites into equiaxed TiC grains. Reduction of the C/Ti ratio in TiC during the process results in an increase in the reinforcement content, from a nominal 12 vol% to an effective 21.5 vol%. Ti-TiC tensile samples reached fracture strains of up to 1.7%, Youngâ€™s moduli of up to 149 GPa and ultimate tensile strengths of up to 827 MPa. Lower TiC initial powder size distributions displayed the best mechanical performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c658d9c64376fa7c5a5e9e447651334145f1fc0fcce6a744fdfa81b5d2b499f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
