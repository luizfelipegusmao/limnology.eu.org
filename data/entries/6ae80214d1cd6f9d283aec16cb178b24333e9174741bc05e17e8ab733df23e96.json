{"title":"Selecting Optimal Printing Parameters for 3D Printed Parts in Haptic Machine Interface Prototyping","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1871/v1","date":1727174290000,"content":"Additive Manufacturing (AM) plays a vital role in rapid prototyping. Polylactic acid (PLA), a biomass thermoplastic monomer made from corn starch is the most used filament material in AM. Due to the strength requirement of haptic device prototypes, there is a need to carefully explore all parameters that could enhance the performance of printed parts. This study considered three printing parameters: printing speed, infill density, and layer thickness on three levels each. A tensile test according to ASTM D638 was performed on each. Statistical analysis was done to investigate the influence of each of the parameters on maximum tensile stress, load at maximum tensile stress, and Modulus respectively for each sample. Subsequently, a regression analysis was performed. The sample with an Infill density of 15%, printing speed of 70mm/s, and 0.1mm layer thickness exhibited the highest tensile strength. However, it was discovered further that the infill density has the highest influence on the mechanical properties of the 3D printed PLA material in tensile testing. The chart of the mechanical properties and the parameter configurations were also presented to assist in selecting printing parameters for desired mechanical properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ae80214d1cd6f9d283aec16cb178b24333e9174741bc05e17e8ab733df23e96","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
