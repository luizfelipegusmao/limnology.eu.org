{"title":"Ganoderma lucidum spore powder after oil extraction alleviates microbiota dysbiosis to improve the intestinal barrier function in mice","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13852?af=R","date":1725699594000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>There are few studies about the differences in the composition of moisture, ash, crude protein, crude fat, crude polysaccharide and ergothioneine in <i>Ganoderma lucidum</i> spore powder (GLSP) from different origins. As for GLSP after oil extraction (OE-GLSP), there are still lots of bioactive substance in it. It can be seen that OE-GLSP has certain biological activity. The effect of OE-GLSP on the improvement of intestinal barrier function has been less studied.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The results showed that there were significant differences for GLSP from five different origins (Anhui, Jilin, Jiangxi, Shandong and Zhejiang) in moisture (0.065–0.113%), ash (0.603–0.955%), crude fat (42.444–44.773%), crude polysaccharide (2.977–4.127%), crude protein (14.761–17.639%) and ergothioneine (0.552–1.816 mg g<sup>−1</sup>) (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The monosaccharides of GLSP polysaccharide mainly consist of glucose, galactose, mannose, rhamnose, etc. Moreover, the effects of OE-GLSP supplementation on the regulation of organ index, colonic tissue and intestinal microbiota in C57BL/6J mice were investigated. The supplement of OE-GLSP could restore the organ index and weight loss of antibiotic-treated mice. Moreover, OE-GLSP led to the improvement of intestinal dysbiosis by enriching Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Roseburia</i>, and increasing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. In addition, OE-GLSP intervention repaired intestinal barrier dysfunction by increasing the expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin, Claudin-1 and E-cadherin).</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Different GLSP from five origins exhibited significant differences in microstructure and contents of crude polysaccharide, crude protein, crude fat, water, ash and ergothioneine. Moreover, it was found that OE-GLSP could improve the intestinal barrier function and induce potentially beneficial changes in intestinal flora. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Shun Zhong, \nYao Yao Qi, \nYuan Yuan, \nLi Lian, \nZeyuan Deng, \nFeng Pan, \nJunfu Zhou, \nZhiyu Wang, \nHongyan Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"4a657ff27dad9ef2f673a150d2bbe95a2ea02aac8348490cf4d6820f53b4e5e4","category":"Environment"}
