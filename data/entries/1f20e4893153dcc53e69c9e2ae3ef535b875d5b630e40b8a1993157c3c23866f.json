{"title":"Facile Fabrication of Co&ndash;Doped Porous Carbon from Coal Hydrogasification Semi-Coke for Efficient Microwave Absorption","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0566/v1","date":1725858465000,"content":"A Co–doped porous carbon was successfully fabricated by a facile carbonizing procedure using coal hydrogasification semi-coke (SC) as the carbon and cobalt nitrate as the magnetic precursors, respectively. The microwave absorption (MA) performances were regulated by adjusting the mass ratio of the precursors. The dielectric loss from the carbon framework, the magnetic loss from nano–sized Co particles coupled with multiple scattering from the residual pores synergistically contribute to the favorable MA capabilities. When the initial mass ratio of cobalt nitrate and SC was 1:1, the Co/C composite showed the lowest reflection loss of -33.45 dB at the thickness of 4.0 mm. The effective absorbing bandwidth (EAB) could achieve 3.5 GHz at 2 mm in thickness. This work not only exploits a new avenue for the structural design and facile fabrication of dielectric and magnetic loss combinations, but also opens up another way for the high value–added utilization of SC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f20e4893153dcc53e69c9e2ae3ef535b875d5b630e40b8a1993157c3c23866f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
