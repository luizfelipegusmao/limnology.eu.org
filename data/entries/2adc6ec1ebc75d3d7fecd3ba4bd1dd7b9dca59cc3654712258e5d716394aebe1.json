For obligately asexual lineages that evolve from facultatively asexual ancestors, there exists another possibility, namely altered regulation of preexisting asexual reproductive processes to produce obligate asexuality. These different pathways leave different signatures in properties of meiosis and recombination that could provide insights into the origin of asexuality. A new study by Molinier et al.
