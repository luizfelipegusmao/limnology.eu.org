{"title":"Identification of Plant Compounds from Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1731/v1","date":1719300262000,"content":"The presence and localization of plant metabolites are indicative of physiological processes, e.g., under biotic and abiotic stress conditions. Further, the chemical composition of plant parts is related to their quality as food or for medicinal applications. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has become a popular analytical technique for exploring and visualizing the spatial distribution of plant molecules within a tissue. This review provides a summary of mass spectrometry methods used for mapping and identifying\nmetabolites in plant tissues. We present the benefits and the disadvantages of both vacuum and ambient ionization methods, considering direct and indirect approaches.\nFinally, we discuss the current limitations in annotating and identifying molecules and perspectives for future investigations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a3c289fbddc380c9aa77e8b8215deab66d3bf94b85749b21f63b353ac4fe3cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
