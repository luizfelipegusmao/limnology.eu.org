{"title":"Wide-Field Optical Coherence Tomography in Patients with Diabetic Macular Edema","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0847/v1","date":1720648318000,"content":"Background: The goal of the study was to analyze variations in central, perifoveal, and peripheral retinal thickness (RT) and choroidal thickness (CT) in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) measured with ultra-wide-field optical coherence tomography (UWF-OCT). Additionally, correlations between RT and CT in the central, perifoveal, and peripheral sectors and the presence of selected systemic factors were evaluated. Methods: A total of 74 consecutive adult diabetic patients with DME and 75 healthy controls were included. Study participants were divided into three groups: DME patients without panretinal photocoagulation (PRP; 84 eyes), DME patients after PRP (56 eyes), and healthy controls (125 eyes). RT and CT were analyzed in three zones: a central circle of 3 mm diameter (Central), a ring contained between a centered 9 mm circle and the central 3 mm circle (Perifoveal), and a second, more peripheral ring between centered 18 mm and 9 mm circles (Peripheral). Additionally, DME subgroups were analyzed according to the correlation of RT and CT with age, axial length, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), diabetes duration, insulin therapy duration, body mass index (BMI), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values, intravitreal injection (IVI) count, and the advancement of retinopathy assessed by the simplified diabetic retinopathy severity scale (DRSS). Results The increase in RT in the far peripheral sectors in DME patients was not significant. The increase in central and perifoveal RT and CT in PRP-na√Øve DME patients was strongly associated with poorer BCVA. Patients with DME after PRP presented with BCVA improvements significantly related to the number of IVIs. The amount of DME and RT in peripheral sectors were both independent of systemic factors such as BMI, duration of diabetes, duration of insulin intake, retinopathy severity, and HbA1c levels. Conclusion Peripheral retinal sectors in DME patients are less affected in terms of increase in their thickness compared to central ones. UWF-OCT provides valuable information on retinal and choroidal involvement in diabetic retinopathy complicated by DME.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab2f6a6e15ca179fa410af05923a2dba9dc0c4d11ee59ad90f2848940677f94d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
