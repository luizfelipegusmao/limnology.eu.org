{"title":"Cross-linguistic influence and the Working Memory on the acquisition of vocabulary","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0472/v1","date":1720131245000,"content":"The purpose of this study was to analyze the cross-linguistic influence of previously learned languages and working memory capacities on the vocabulary performance of two different typological languages. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare the working memory capacities of bilingual adults in relation to the vocabulary performance of two different languages never learned by the participants, and (2) to analyze to what extent the typology of previously learned languages influences working memory capaci-ties in relation to the vocabulary performance of French and Nahuatl. A group of 43 Mexican-Spanish college students participated in this experimental study. The participants completed a series of working memory tasks in Nahuatl and French. The results showed that working memory capacities were lower in Nahuatl than in French. Thus, a correlation was found between their first and second language and vo-cabulary performance in French. We can consider the influence of previously learned languages as a significant factor in vocabulary acquisition in accordance with the participants' working memory capacities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2e74f1cc81a2ee916ab237a21515cd44292ed4227799d2cf9541cf455d9602e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
