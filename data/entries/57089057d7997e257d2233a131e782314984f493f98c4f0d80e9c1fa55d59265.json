However, there is no clear information regarding the common molecules between animals and plants. In this study, we found that heat, and cold tolerance of the nematode <span>Caenorhabditis elegans</span> is oppositely regulated by the RNA-binding protein EMB-4, whose plant homolog contains polymorphism causing heat tolerance diversity. <span>Caenorhabditis elegans</span> alters its cold and heat tolerance depending on the previous cultivation temperature, wherein EMB-4 respectively acts as a positive and negative controller of heat and cold tolerance by altering gene expression. Among the genes whose expression is regulated by EMB-4, a phospholipid scramblase, and an acid sphingomyelinase, which are involved in membrane lipid metabolism, were found to play essential roles in the negative regulation of heat tolerance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"57089057d7997e257d2233a131e782314984f493f98c4f0d80e9c1fa55d59265","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
