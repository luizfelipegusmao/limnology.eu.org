{"title":"INVSID 1.0: An Inverse System Identification Toolbox for MATLAB","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0681/v1","date":1718096810000,"content":"The inverse system identification toolbox named INVSID 1.0 for MATLAB, which is used to identify the inversion of single-input single-output systems, is developed. The complete process of developing the toolbox is demonstrated. Afterwards, a numerical example is illustrated to describe how the toolbox can be used to solve inverse identification problems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the toolbox.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70caf07c38e2d1777352ab12a6d0a5b57e4ea37702b4822f74c34a30cdc2cc28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
