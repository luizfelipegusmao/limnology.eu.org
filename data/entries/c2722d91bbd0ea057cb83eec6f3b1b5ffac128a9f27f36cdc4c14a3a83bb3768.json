{"title":"Peopleâ€™s Perception towards Environmental Conflict over Hydropower Development: A\nCase Study of Chamera Stage I in Himachal Pradesh","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1158/v1","date":1721092638000,"content":"The sustainable development of the country, particularly in hilly regions, encounters formidable challenges attributed to the gradual degradation of environmental conditions in these areas. Over time, disputes have arisen concerning forests, water sources, and other natural assets. The present analysis focuses on the environmental conflicts surrounding the Chamera Stage-I hydroelectric project in the Chamba region of Himachal Pradesh. This analysis is based on perception surveys conducted within local communities and field studies examining ecological and environmental parameters. These parameters include the loss of green cover, decline in biodiversity, depletion of natural resources, disruption of access to common property, disturbances in the ecological cycle, alterations in microclimate, changes in land use patterns, and the loss of ethnobotanical and wild edible fruit plants. Local communities overwhelmingly assert that these conflicts have arisen due to the construction of the dam. They firmly hold the view that higher authorities disregard the environmental and ecological impact as a crucial consideration in any project. Consequently, as communities grapple with survival challenges, conflicts with authorities emerge over environmental issues. The analysis also highlights measures to mitigate these adverse impacts and proposes an enhanced collaborative approach in handling such projects to address conflicts more effectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c2722d91bbd0ea057cb83eec6f3b1b5ffac128a9f27f36cdc4c14a3a83bb3768","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
