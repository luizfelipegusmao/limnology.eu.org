{"title":"Molecular and genetic regulation of petal number variation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/11/3233/7636640?rss=1","date":1711584000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Floral forms with an increased number of petals, also known as double-flower phenotypes, have been selected and conserved in many domesticated plants, particularly in ornamentals, because of their great economic value. The molecular and genetic mechanisms that control this trait are therefore of great interest, not only for scientists, but also for breeders. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the gene regulatory networks of flower initiation and development and known mutations that lead to variation of petal number in many species. In addition to the well-accepted <span>miR172/AP2-like</span> module, for which many questions remain unanswered, we also discuss other pathways in which mutations also lead to the formation of extra petals, such as those involved in meristem maintenance, hormone signalling, epigenetic regulation, and responses to environmental signals. We discuss how the concept of ‘natural mutants’ and recent advances in genomics and genome editing make it possible to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying double-flower formation, and how such knowledge could contribute to the future breeding and selection of this trait in more crops.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"1abf5a4df4f50ea1892fb9d3865e28031d13046d1cbfaeb0047aed4088c895a5","category":"Environment"}
