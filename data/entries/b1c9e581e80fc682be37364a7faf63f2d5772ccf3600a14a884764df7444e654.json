{"title":"Copper Based Graphite Composites and Their Usage as Current Collectors for High Voltage Electric Motors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0022/v1","date":1727935100000,"content":"Current paper is aiming to show the obtained results in manufacturing and characterization of graphite-based and metal composite materials suitable to be used in high voltage application of automotive field. Thus, 4 types of materials have been processed and tested in order to assess their suitability to be used as current collector material for trolleybus. The novelty of this work is the new innovative technological process for obtaining the carbon/metal composite material used in the manufacture of sliding contacts for electrical current collector heads, as well as the character-istics obtained for this material. All 4 obtained materials have been characterized from structural (by optical microscopy), mechanical (density, electrical resistivity, hardness) and functional point of view (wear after 1000 working hours, electric discharge and electric load) and it was determined that the material which uses chemically copper covered graphite is the most suitable of them and has been chosen to be further developed by the end beneficiary.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b1c9e581e80fc682be37364a7faf63f2d5772ccf3600a14a884764df7444e654","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
