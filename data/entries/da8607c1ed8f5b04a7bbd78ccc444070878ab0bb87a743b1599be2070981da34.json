{"title":"Defining morphologically and genetically distinct GABAergic/cholinergic amacrine cell subtypes in the vertebrate retina","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002506","date":1708092000000,"content":"<p>by Yan Li, Shuguang Yu, Xinling Jia, Xiaoying Qiu, Jie He</p>\r\n\r\nIn mammals, retinal direction selectivity originates from GABAergic<i>/</i>cholinergic amacrine cells (ACs) specifically expressing the <i>sox2</i> gene. However, the cellular diversity of GABAergic<i>/</i>cholinergic ACs of other vertebrate species remains largely unexplored. Here, we identified 2 morphologically and genetically distinct GABAergic/cholinergic AC types in zebrafish, a previously undescribed <i>bhlhe22</i>+ type and a mammalian counterpart <i>sox2+</i> type. Notably, while sole <i>sox2</i> disruption removed <i>sox2+</i> type, the codisruption of <i>bhlhe22</i> and <i>bhlhe23</i> was required to remove <i>bhlhe22</i>+ type. Also, both types significantly differed in dendritic arbors, lamination, and soma position. Furthermore, <i>in vivo</i> two-photon calcium imaging and the behavior assay suggested the direction selectivity of both AC types. Nevertheless, the 2 types showed preferential responses to moving bars of different sizes. Thus, our findings provide new cellular diversity and functional characteristics of GABAergic/cholinergic ACs in the vertebrate retina.","author":"Yan Li","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"da8607c1ed8f5b04a7bbd78ccc444070878ab0bb87a743b1599be2070981da34","category":"Environment"}
