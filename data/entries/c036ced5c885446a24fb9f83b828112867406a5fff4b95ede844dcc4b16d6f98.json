{"title":"Adult Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection: Defining Incidence, Risk Factors for Hospitalization and Poor Outcomes, A Regional Cohort Study, 2016-2022","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0629/v1","date":1723191385000,"content":"Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of illness in adults, especially older adults and those with underlying conditions. This study aimed to assess the incidence of RSV hospitalizations in adults and identify risk factors for hospitalization and poor outcomes.\nMethods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from two hospitals in southern Israel from 2016-2022. We calculated incidence rates of RSV and influenza hospitalizations. Risk factors for hospitalization were analyzed using Poisson regression. We evaluated poor outcomes (death, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation) among RSV-hospitalized patients.\nResults: The median annual incidence of RSV hospitalization was 28.2/100,000 population, increasing with age to 199/100,000 in those â‰¥75 years. Significant risk factors for RSV hospitalization included pulmonary diseases (RR 4.2, 95% CI 3.4-5.2), cardiovascular diseases (RR 3.3, 95% CI 2.6-4.2), and chronic renal failure (RR 2.9, 95% CI 2.3-3.7). Among hospitalized RSV patients, 13.9% had poor outcomes. Renal failure (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.23-2.66), neutropenia (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.19-5.35), neutrophilia (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.81-2.34), and lymphopenia (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.37-3.0) were associated with poor outcomes.\nConclusions: RSV causes a substantial burden of hospitalizations in adults, particularly among older adults and those with comorbidities. Identifying high-risk groups can help target prevention and treatment strategies, including vaccination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c036ced5c885446a24fb9f83b828112867406a5fff4b95ede844dcc4b16d6f98","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
