{"title":"Overview on Theory, Simulation and Experiment of Water Exit Problem","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1659/v1","date":1724322307000,"content":"The water exit problem, which is ubiquitous in ocean engineering, is one of the significant research topics in the interaction between navigators and water. The study of the water exit problem can help to improve the structure design for marine ships and underwater weapons for better strength and movement status. However, the water exit problem involves complex processes such as gas-liquid-solid three-phase coupling, cavitation, water separation, liquid surface deformation and fragmentation, making it challenging to study. According to the works carried out by many researchers towards this issue, we summarize the recent developments from three aspects, i.e. theoretical research, numerical simulation and experimental results. In theoretical research, the improved von Kaman model and linearized water exit model are introduced. Several classical experimental devices, data acquisition means and cavitation are introduced in experimental development. Three methods, namely, BEM(boundary element method), FVM(finite volume method) and LES(large eddy simulation) are concluded for numerical simulation. The limitations and shortcomings of these three aspects are then analyzed. Finally, an outlook on the future research improvements and developments of the water exit problem is provided.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0be6b667947fe943b3487ff9872bda51097cd1f462d14d1574db9e8a03a1136d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
