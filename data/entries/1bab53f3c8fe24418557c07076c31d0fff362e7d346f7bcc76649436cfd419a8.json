Shams</p>\r\nBackground <p>Obesity and COVID-19 are at the top of nowadays health concerns with significant crosstalk between each other. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected healthy lifestyles and increased obesity prevalence. Thus, there was a surge in anti-obesity products (AOPs) intake. Herein, we evaluated how the pandemic has affected slimming products’ efficacy and safety in patients seeking weight reduction at an urban, weight management centre in Alexandria, Egypt. In addition, the effect of AOPs on COVID-19 infection severity was also appraised to detect whether AOPs can alter COVID-19 host cell entry and infective mechanisms, and thus, affect infection severity.</p> Methods <p>Patients were invited to complete an anonymous survey. The survey assessed self-reported changes in weight, the use of AOPs during the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 infection severity, AOPs efficacy, and incidence of side effects. Inclusion criteria were obese patients above 18 years old who got infected by COVID-19 while receiving a single-ingredient AOP.</p> Results <p>A total of 462 participants completed our anonymous validated questionnaire. Most of the participants were females (450; 98.4%) with BMI ranging from 24.98–58.46. Eligible participants were only 234 and the top-administered products were orlistat, liraglutide, metformin, green tea, cinnamon, <i>Garcinia cambogia</i>, and <i>Gymnema Sylvestre</i>. In most cases, AOPs intake was beneficial for COVID-19 infection, and most patients experienced mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 significantly interferes with AOPs’ mechanisms of action which positively or negatively influences their efficacy and side effects incidence due to predictable pharmacological link.</p> Conclusion <p>Concurrent AOPs intake with COVID-19 infection is a two-sided weapon; AOPs attenuate COVID-19 infection, while SARS-CoV-2 interferes with efficacy and side effects incidence of AOPs.</p>","author":"Nesrine S.
