{"title":"Waste Symbiosis through the Synthesis of Highly Crystalline LTA and SOD Zeolites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0742/v1","date":1723432389000,"content":"In recent years, the demand for natural and synthetic zeolites has surged due to their distinctive properties and myriad industrial applications. This research aims to synthesise crystalline zeolites by co-recycling two industrial wastes: salt slag (SS) and rice husk ash (RHA). Salt slag, a problem-atic by-product of secondary aluminium smelting, is classified as hazardous waste due to its reac-tive and leachable nature, though it is rich in aluminium. Conversely, RHA, an abundant and cost-effective by-product of the agro-food sector, boasts a high silicon content. These wastes were utilised as aluminium and silicon sources for synthesising various zeolites. The study examined the effects of temperature, ageing time, and sodium concentration on the formation of different zeolite phases and their crystallinity. Results indicated that increased Na+ concentration favoured SOD zeolite formation, whereas LTA-type zeolite formation was promoted at higher temperatures and extended ageing times. The formation range of the different zeolites was defined and supported by a crystallographic, microstructural, and morphological analysis. Additionally, the thermal be-haviour of the zeolites was investigated. This work underscores the potential to transform indus-trial waste, including hazardous materials like salt slag, into sustainable, high-value materials, fostering efficient waste co-recycling and promoting clean, sustainable industrial production through cross-sectoral industrial symbiosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d709e867ac60ec453ab632a542389cd7d00ad8b4615866990540b039d8bd805c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
