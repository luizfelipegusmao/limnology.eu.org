{"title":"Eudermic Properties and Chemical-Physical Characterization of Honeys of Different Botanical Origin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1127/v1","date":1726378361000,"content":"Honey is a natural product that, thanks to its composition, particularly the high sugar content, is highly appreciated as an energy nourishment. In addition to sugars, it contains many other substances (carbohydrates, free amino acids, enzymatic proteins, organic acids, polyphenols) from which the therapeutic properties of honey arise: hydrating and osmotic activity, antimicrobial action, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory power. The present work aims to deepen the activity of skin protection exerted by honey, as a synergic result of its multiple therapeutic effects.Moreover, the study want to find possible correlations between biological properties and chemical-physical traits of honey.\nTo carry out this research, five varieties of citrus honey, one of acacia honey, one of chestnut honey and, finally, one of multifloral honey were used. The honeys were first characterized by chemical-physical analysis (determination of water content, sugars, amino acids, polyphenols) and then subjected to qualitative melissopalynological analysis. Tests were also carried out to evaluate both their antioxidant power and the effect on collagenase, an enzyme involved in the degradation of collagen present in the extracellular matrix and, therefore, in the processes of skin aging.  Finally, they were used in in vitro experiments to assess their action in stimulating cell viability and proliferation on human keratinocytes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b70be5bd7283df1e25ab8c291504e5883a3741d55828fd26f0f4694174cc4692","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
