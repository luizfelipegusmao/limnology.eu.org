{"title":"Low Frequency Raman Spectroscopy on Amorphous Poly(Ether Ether Ketone) (PEEK)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0875/v1","date":1718242577000,"content":"Low-frequency peaks in the Raman spectra of amorphous poly (ether ketone) (PEEK) are investigated. An amorphous sample with zero crystallinity, as confirmed by WAXRD, was used in this study. In a previous study, two peaks were observed in the low-frequency Raman spectra of crystallized samples. One of the peaks at 135 cm-1, disappeared for the amorphous sample. Furthermore, the peak at 50 cm-1 was observed for the first time in the crystallized sample. The peak at 50 cm-1, similar to the peak at 135 cm-1, disappeared in the amorphous state, and its intensity increased with increasing crystallinity. The origins of the two peaks were both associated with the Ph-CO-Ph-type intermolecular vibrational modes in the simulation. It was suggested that the Ph-CO-Ph vibrational mode observed in the low-frequency region of PEEK was strongly in-fluenced by the intermolecular order.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"41050f90363f19788dc2c067c377228f01fdb2380c107078f096c4228fbf2f9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
