{"title":"Human-in-the-Loop: The Future of Machine Learning in Automated Electron Microscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mt/article/32/1/35/7604518?rss=1","date":1707436800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Machine learning (ML) methods are progressively gaining acceptance in the electron microscopy community for de-noising, semantic segmentation, and dimensionality reduction of data post-acquisition. The introduction of the application programming interfaces (APIs) by major instrument manufacturers now allows the deployment of ML workflows in microscopes, not only for data analytics but also for real-time decision-making and feedback for microscope operation. However, the number of use cases for real-time ML remains remarkably small. Here, we discuss some considerations in designing ML-based active experiments and pose that the likely strategy for the next several years will be human-in-the-loop automated experiments (hAE). In this paradigm, the ML learning agent directly controls beam position and image and spectroscopy acquisition functions, and a human operator monitors experiment progression in real and feature space of the system and tunes the policies of the ML agent to steer the experiment toward specific objectives.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"5b5f34522d9973008b088415e208bb84a9fd3b5015cc3ed27bc835d8d4f099d1","category":"Environment"}
