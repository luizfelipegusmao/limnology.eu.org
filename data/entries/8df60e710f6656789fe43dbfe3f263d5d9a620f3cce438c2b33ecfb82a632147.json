{"title":"Effect of Copper Doping on the Structural, Electrical, and Magnetic Properties of Mg-Co Ferrites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1642/v2","date":1711605400000,"content":"This research paper focuses on the synthesis and characterization of Cu-doped Mg-Co ferrites with varying compositions (Mg0.6-xCo0.4CuxFe2O4, where x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) using a solid-state reaction method. This paper also investigates the structural, morphological, magnetic, and electrical characteristics of synthesized Mg0.6-xCo0.4CuxFe2O4, where x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique confirms the ferrites spinel structure in the Fd-3m space group, with average crystallite sizes ranging from 57.29 to 48.57 nm. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy verifies chemical and structural changes, while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals cubic crystal growth with an average grain size of 1 to 1.5 μm. DC electrical resistivity decreases with increasing temperature and Cu2+ substitution, ranging from 1.4 x 106 Ω-cm to 6.7 x 105 Ω-cm. The study suggests a correlation between resistivity and Cu2+ concentration. Magnetic behaviour, studied using a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), shows dependence on dopant concentration, with coercivity ranging from 157 Oe to 256 Oe. The results indicate potential applications in magnetic storage devices, antennas, transformers, and high-frequency electronics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8df60e710f6656789fe43dbfe3f263d5d9a620f3cce438c2b33ecfb82a632147","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
