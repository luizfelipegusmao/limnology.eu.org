{"title":"Predicting Seasonal Deformation Using InSAR and Machine Learning in the Permafrost Regions of the Yangtze River Source Region","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036700?af=R","date":1727106298000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Quantifying seasonal deformation is essential for accurately determining the thickness of the active layer and the distribution of water content within it, providing insights into the freeze-thaw dynamics of permafrost environments and their sensitivity to climate change. Due to the limited hydraulic conductivity of the underlying permafrost, the freeze-thaw processes are largely confined to the active layer, allowing for predictable seasonal deformations. This study employed Independent Component Analysis to isolate large-scale seasonal deformation from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements taken from 2016 to 2020 in the Yangtze River Source Region (YRSR) of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), covering 18,500 km<sup>2</sup>. We developed dedicated machine learning (ML) models that integrate these InSAR-derived measurements with various environmental proxies. By applying these models to the YRSR, we generated a comprehensive, full-coverage deformation map for permafrost terrains, achieving an <i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> value of 0.91 and an Root Mean Squared Error of approximately 0.5 cm, thus confirming the model's strong predictability of seasonal deformation in permafrost regions. Deformation magnitude varied from less than 1 cm to over 10 cm. Our analysis suggests that terrain attributes, influenced by climate and soil conditions, are the primary factors driving these deformations. This research provides valuable insights into quantifying permafrost-related seasonal deformation across expansive and rural landscapes. It also aids in assessing subsurface hydrological processes and the resilience and vulnerability of permafrost. The developed ML algorithm, with access to precise environmental data, is capable of forecasting seasonal deformations across the entire QTP and potentially throughout the Arctic.</p>","author":"Jie Chen, \nXingchen Lin, \nTonghua Wu, \nJunming Hao, \nXiaodong Wu, \nDefu Zou, \nXiaofan Zhu, \nGuojie Hu, \nYongping Qiao, \nDong Wang, \nSizhong Yang, \nLina Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"6f0805a5533b0b617445cc97e9ef3c14aab67807230b1fdfb0b9125914d751b3","category":"Environment"}
