{"title":"Vertical Structure and Microphysics Analysis from Events of Heavy Rainfall in Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0970/v1","date":1713184236000,"content":"Intense rainfall events frequently occur in Brazil, often leading to rapid flooding. Despite their recurrence, there is a notable lack of sub-daily studies in the country. This research aims to assess patterns related to the structure and microphysics of clouds driving intense rainfall in Brazil, resulting in high accumulations within 1 hour. Employing a 40 mm/h threshold and validation criteria, 83 events were selected for study, observed by both single and dual-polarization radars. Contoured Frequency by Altitude Diagrams (CFADs) of reflectivity, Vertical Integrated Liquid (VIL), and Vertical Integrated Ice (VII) are employed to scrutinize the vertical cloud characteristics in each region. To address limitations arising from the absence of polarimetric coverage in some events, three case studies focusing on polarimetric variables are included. A fourth case study enhances the overall understanding of these events, emphasizing the underexplored nature of short-term intense rainfall studies in Brazil. Results reveal that the generating system significantly influences the rainfall pattern, especially in the Southern, Southeastern, and Central-Western regions. Regional CFADs unveil primary convective columns with 40-50 dBZ reflectivity, extending to approximately 6 km. The microphysical analysis highlights the rapid structural intensification, challenging the event predictability and the issuance of timely specific warnings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a27a4a8cbdb5ea4115302b81395a2c8faa24128c790d750ae8467e737880c965","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
