{"title":"TLR Agonists Modify NK Cell Activation and Increase Its Cytotoxicity in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1527/v1","date":1713885336000,"content":"Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in innate immunity, particularly in combating infections and tumors. However, in hematological cancers, NK cells often exhibit impaired functions. Therefore, it is very important to activate its endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs) as a potential strategy to restore its antitumor activity. We stimulate NK cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and NK cells isolated, the NK cells were stimulated with specific TLR ligands (Poly I:C, Imiquimod, R848, and ODN2006) and evaluated changes in IFN-γ, CD107a, NKG2D, NKp44 expression, Granzyme B secretion, cytokine/chemokine release, and cytotoxic activity. Results revealed that Poly I:C and Imiquimod enhanced activation of both immunoregulatory and cytotoxic NK cells, increasing IFN-γ, CD107a, NKG2D, and NKp44 expression. R848 activated immunoregulatory NK cells, while ODN2006 boosted CD107a, NKp44, NKG2D, and IFN-γ secretion in cytotoxic NK cells. R848 also increased secretion of various cytokines/chemokines. Importantly, R848 and ODN 2006 significantly improved cytotoxicity against leukemic cells. Overall, TLR stimulation enhances NK cell activation, suggesting TLR8 (R848) and TLR9 (ODN 2006) ligands as promising candidates for antitumor immunotherapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44a317e0ca2a54bf231175d49e072a41f1ad76d2c7a3004e523b818cb288b2b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
