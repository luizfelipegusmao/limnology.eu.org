{"title":"Beyond digital interfaces: The human element in online teaching and its influence on student experiences","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307262","date":1722434400000,"content":"<p>by Soo See Chai, Su-Hie Ting, Kok Luong Goh, Yee Hui Robin Chang, Bui Lin Wee, Dila Novita, J. Karthikeyan</p>\r\n\r\nAmidst the digital transformation of education, the essence of the human touch in online teaching remains pivotal. Despite growing literature, there remains a significant gap in understanding how the human element in online teaching directly influences student engagement and learning outcomes, especially in diverse educational contexts. This study develops a quantifiable index capturing the essence of humanized online teaching and investigates the determinants influencing this humanization. Additionally, an index encapsulating students’ online learning experiences, as perceived by their instructors, has been constructed. Bridging these indices, the research unravels the intricate relationship between the humanization of online teaching and the resulting student experiences in the virtual realm. Sourced from a self-constructed questionnaire and encompassing responses from 152 instructors across 22 Malaysian institutions, the data revealed an average incorporation of 81.38% humanized online teaching elements. Key determinants, such as subject matter, teaching experience, Internet quality, and platform choices, emerged as significant influences. A regression model showed approximately 31.7% (R-squared = 0.317, p&lt;0.001) of the variation in the dependent variable. A significant moderate positive correlation (r = 0.423, p&lt;0.001) between the Humanized Online Teaching Index and the Students’ Online Learning Experiences Index highlights the intertwined nature of humanized instructional methodologies and enhanced student engagement in online settings. Though contextualised during the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic, the study’s implications transcend the immediate circumstances, offering transformative insights for future online teaching methodologies and enhancing student experiences in the evolving digital age.","author":"Soo See Chai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f130233c91f5782aa72e3dc0da19b992a5e7eeb62a892298bdf43165cd08f1e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
