{"title":"Protein Estimation and Toxicity Determination of Two Fractions of Pakistani Origin Naja oxiana Venom and Its Anti-inflammatory Assay by ROS, TNF-&alpha; and IL-&beta;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0691/v1","date":1710234242000,"content":"Inflammation is a cause of number of disorders. Many anti-inflammatory drugs are available to cure and prevent inflammation and its related disorders. Some of the drugs are from plant and animal origin. Among animals snake venom is also utilized as treatment option of certain disorders. In the current study the venom of N. oxiana from Northern areas of Pakistan is assayed to determine its anti-inflammatory activity. The Naja oxiana is also called central Asian cobra is endemic to Central Asia. Naja oxiana belong to family Elapidae and it is highly venomous snake. The venom has many enzymatic proteins as well as nonenzymatic proteins that is neurotoxins. The venom is lethal having very high mortality rate and the death may occur due to respiratory failure in 45 minutes to 24 hrs depending upon the nature and amount of venom. As the venom is highly toxic so initially after venom milking its protein estimation was done and toxicity profile and LD50 was determined to find out its therapeutic dose at which anti-inflammatory activity was observed. The toxicity and anti-inflammatory activity was determined on mice model. Inflammation was induced by carrageenan induced peritonitis method. The inflammatory markers ROS, TNF-α and IL-β were determined by ELIZA in peritoneal fluid. The LD50 of crude venom, fraction 1 and fraction 2 was found as 34 µg/kg, 7.4 µg/kg and 416 µg/kg respectively. Anti-inflammatory activity crude venom, fraction 1 and fraction 2 was found at dose 19 µg/kg, 1.8 µg/kg and 267 µg/kg respectively. The levels of inflammatory markers reduced after therapeutic dose administration of venom and its fractions that indicates that it can be utilized as anti-inflammatory agent and so can be effective in various disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"202ef1135ffc5f6cd44efc5cae0ce09fa3af533782b619845a01b0be67551f3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
