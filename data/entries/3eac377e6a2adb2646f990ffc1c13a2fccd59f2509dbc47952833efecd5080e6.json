{"title":"Differences in the Impact of Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction on Intraventricular Pressure Gradient in Feline Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0794/v1","date":1728557770000,"content":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common form of cardiomyopathy in cats, and heart failure occurs as diastolic dysfunction progresses.\n HCM in cats is broadly classified as non-obstructive and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, depending on the presence or absence of outflow tract obstruction. Measurement of the intraventricular pressure differences (IVPD) using Color M-mode (CMM) has attracted attention as a reliable diastolic index as it correlates with catheterization, the gold standard for assessment of diastolic performance. Since, IVPD is affected by the size of the heart, the intraventricular pressure gradient (IVPG) index, which is unaffected by heart size, is used by dividing IVPD be LV length.   In the present study, CMM IVPG was used to non-invasively assess diastolic impairment in cats with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This study was conducted on ten control cats and 18 cats in the HCM group. Although no severe left atrial enlargement was observed in the HCM group, the Basal IVPG was significantly increased in the HOCM group compared to the control group. While IVPD typically suggests impaired diastolic function and reduced ventricular compliance, the significant increase observed in the HOCM group compared to controls may suggest an indirect elevation in left atrial pressure, likely secondary to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The increase in IVPG in HOCM, as shown in this study, is a pathological effect of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction that cannot be detected by conventional echocardiographic indices, and evaluating IVPG is useful for evaluating cardiac function from a different perspective than conventional methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3eac377e6a2adb2646f990ffc1c13a2fccd59f2509dbc47952833efecd5080e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
