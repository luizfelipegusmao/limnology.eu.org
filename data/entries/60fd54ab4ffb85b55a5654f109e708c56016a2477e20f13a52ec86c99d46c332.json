The structures of many alphaviruses have been studied using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions, which impose icosahedral symmetry on the viral particles. Using cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET), we revealed a polarized symmetry defect in the icosahedral lattice of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in situ, similar to the late budding particles, suggesting the inherent imperfect symmetry originates from the final pinch-off of assembled virions. We further demonstrated this imperfect symmetry is also present in in vitro purified CHIKV and Mayaro virus, another arthritogenic alphavirus. We employed a subparticle-based single-particle analysis protocol to circumvent the icosahedral imperfection and boosted the resolution of the structure of the CHIKV to ∼3 Å resolution, which revealed detailed molecular interactions between glycoprotein E1–E2 heterodimers in the transmembrane region and multiple lipid-like pocket factors located in a highly conserved hydrophobic pocket. This complementary use of in situ cryo-ET and single-particle cryo-EM approaches provides a more precise structural description of near-icosahedral viruses and valuable insights to guide the development of structure-based antiviral therapies against alphaviruses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"60fd54ab4ffb85b55a5654f109e708c56016a2477e20f13a52ec86c99d46c332","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
