{"title":"Prolonged Lifespan of Superhydrophobic Thin Films and Coatings Using Recycled Polyethylene","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1237/v1","date":1716213781000,"content":"High-density polyethylene (HDPE) waste poses a significant environmental challenge due to its non-biodegradable nature and the vast quantities generated annually. However, conventional recycling methods are energy-intensive and often yield low-quality products. Herein, HDPE waste is upcycled into anti-aging superhydrophobic thin films suitable for outdoor applications. A two-layer spin-casting method combined with heating-induced crosslinking is utilized to produce an exceptionally rough superhydrophobic surface, featuring a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 50 nm, an average crest height of 222 nm, an average trough depth of –264 nm, and a contact angle (CA) of 148°. To assess durability, weathering tests were conducted, revealing the films' susceptibility to degradation under harsh conditions. The films' resistance to environmental factors is improved by incorporating a UV absorber, maintaining their hydrophobic properties and mechanical strength. Our research demonstrates a sustainable method for upcycling waste into high-performance, weather-resistant superhydrophobic films.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c57a3774c60b3c27c87cf1197094397582e6b519a09ecbfe8849962e060f97da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
