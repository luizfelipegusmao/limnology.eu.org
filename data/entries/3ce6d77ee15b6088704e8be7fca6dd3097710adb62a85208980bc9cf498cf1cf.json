{"title":"Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Reynolds Equation with Transient Cavitation Modeling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1000/v1","date":1728898214000,"content":"Gaining insight into tribological systems is crucial for optimizing efficiency and prolonging operational lifespans in technical systems. Experimental investigations are time-consuming and costly, especially for reciprocating seals in fluid power systems. Elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) simulations offer an alternative but demand significant computational resources. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a promising solution using physics-based approaches to solve partial differential equations. While PINNs have successfully modeled hydrodynamics with stationary cavitation, they have yet to address transient cavitation with dynamic geometry changes. This contribution applies a PINN framework to predict pressure build-up and transient cavitation in sealing contacts with dynamic geometry changes. The results demonstrate the potential of PINNs for modeling tribological systems and highlight their significance in enhancing computational efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ce6d77ee15b6088704e8be7fca6dd3097710adb62a85208980bc9cf498cf1cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
