{"title":"The Paradigms of P53: From Viral Manipulation to Immunomodulation of the Tumor Immune Microenvironment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1319/v1","date":1721123076000,"content":"Protein 53 (P53) shows different functions either to support or to contrast malignant growth. P53 history tells that discoveries of molecular features have contributed to the emergence of P53 functions. Conversely, the shift of paradigms demonstrates that P53 functions coexist even if are in conflict with one another. \nSince 1979, five paradigms have been assembled then deconstructed by taking into account P53 functions of viral protein, oncogene, tumor suppressor gene, transcription factor, apoptotic factor. \nBy summarizing the past five disassembled P53 paradigms, in this investigation the current paradigm involving P53 in the modulation of a composite bio-morphological entity namely, tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is analyzed. \nThe aims of this investigation were to provide an overview of solid and validated knowledge occurring in all P53 paradigms and to determine P53 abilities to modify TIME through manipulation of viruses.\nAs a result, definitive P53 evidence concerns its genetic localization, amino acids composition, its isoforms and subcellular expression in organelles. P53 “mutome” assembles all mutations affecting this complex protein. Lastly, both categories of tumor promoting and non-oncogenic viruses related to P53 were scrutinized. \nIn conclusion, paradigms teach that P53 is undruggable because its drugs inevitably target all P53 functions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"993c3279cfcc7f4a9441b06d0c9d3b454778978d6a6eb5eb5b5dcf5d1f5e5f75","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
