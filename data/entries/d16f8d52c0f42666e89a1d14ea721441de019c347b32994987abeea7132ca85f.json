Triterpenes are a diverse group of such specialized metabolites that help plants to protect themselves. Organisms produce thousands of distinct triterpenoids, with structures ranging from simple to complex (<a href=\"#kiae003-B7\">Thimmappa et al. 2014</a>). The first committed step of triterpene biosynthesis in plants involves the cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene, which is catalyzed by enzymes called oxidosqualene synthases (OSCs; <a href=\"#kiae003-B5\">Noushahi et al. 2022</a>). The majority of OSCs characterized from plants produce a single class of triterpenoid, although there are reports of OSCs being less product specific (<a href=\"#kiae003-B1\">Andre et al. 2016</a>; <a href=\"#kiae003-B6\">Srisawat et al. 2019</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"d16f8d52c0f42666e89a1d14ea721441de019c347b32994987abeea7132ca85f","category":"Environment"}
