Most meristems are shaped like a dome with a precise spatial arrangement of functional domains, and, within and between these domains, cells interact through a network of interconnected signaling pathways. Intercellular communication in meristems is mediated by mobile transcription factors, small RNAs, hormones, and secreted peptides that are perceived by membrane-localized receptors. In recent years, we have gained deeper insight into the underlying molecular processes of the shoot meristem, and we discuss here how plants integrate internal and external inputs to control shoot meristem activities.</p></div>","author":"Edgar Demesa-Arevalo, Madhumitha Narasimhan and RÃ¼diger Simon","siteTitle":"Annual Reviews: Annual Review of Plant Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"f9af7703a9e08f35edcf21995cc07f36402e9892411dd5042fb57fa6c1c4e57d","entryHash":"f8e5a5cf0b32e0092b67b85c7f8eee14d8299c99e5237c241cef37b52c74bb2f","category":"Environment"}
