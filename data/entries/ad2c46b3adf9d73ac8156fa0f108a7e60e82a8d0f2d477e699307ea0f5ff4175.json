{"title":"Pore Characteristics of Hydrate-Bearing Sediments from Krishna-Godavari Basin, Offshore India","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1366/v1","date":1724117986000,"content":"Interpore hydrates are the main occurrence forms of marine gas hydrates. Pore characteristics are a vital factor affecting the thermodynamic properties of hydrates and their distribution in sediments. Currently, the characterization of the pore system for hydrate-bearing reservoirs are little reported. Therefore this paper focus on the Krishna-Godavari Basin, via varies methods to characterize the hydrate-bearing sediments in the region. The results showed that X-ray Diffraction(XRD) combined with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)and Cast Thin Section (CTS) can better characterize the mineral composition in the reservoir, High Pressure Mercury Injection (HPMI) focused on the contribution of pore size to permeability, Constant Rate Mercury Injection(CRMI) had the advantage of distinguishing between pore space and pore throat, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Cryoporometry (NMRC) technique can not only obtain the pore size distribution of nanopores with a characterization range greater than Nitrogen Gas Adsorption (N2GA), but also quantitatively describe the trend of fluids in the pore system with temperature. As for pore system, Samples 58 and 68 all developed nanopores, the mineral distribution was relatively scattered, and they were rich in paleontological shells such as foraminifera, among which Sample 68 had more pyrite content, and abundant pyrite framboid was observed, which made the intergranular pore develop and provide more nanopores. Sample 58 has a high concentration of pore and throat, high pore connectivity, low pore curvature, and pores with a diameter of 10μm contributing to the main permeability, with an average pore radius of 2.495μm, whereas Sample 68 has poor pore connectivity, high curvature, and pores with a diameter of 1μm contributing to the main permeability, with an average pore diameter of 60 nm, which explains the obvious difference in permeability between the two samples.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad2c46b3adf9d73ac8156fa0f108a7e60e82a8d0f2d477e699307ea0f5ff4175","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
