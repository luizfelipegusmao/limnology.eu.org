{"title":"Exploring the use of fatty acid ethyl esters as a potential natural solution for the treatment of fish parasitic diseases","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13991?af=R","date":1719649729000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Alternatives to conventional chemical treatments for parasitic diseases in fish are needed. Microalgal-sourced fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) have shown an antiparasitic effect against <i>Gyrodactylus turnbulli</i> infection in guppies. Here, we tested a range of commercial FAEEs of various carbon chain lengths and unsaturation levels against two fish parasites. Guppies and barramundi infected with <i>G. turnbulli</i> and <i>Trichodina</i> sp., respectively, were used. The most effective FAEE, after excluding those toxic to fish, was ethyl laurate (12:0). For both parasites, the LD50 was 18.75 μM within 250 min of incubation. Ethyl eicosapentaenoate (20:5<i>n</i>3) was the next most effective FAEE against <i>G. turnbulli</i>, and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid ethyl ester (20:3<i>n</i>6) and ethyl α-linolenate (18:3<i>n</i>3) were the next most effective against <i>Trichodina</i> sp. In addition, FAEEs prepared from the microalga <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> residue, after fucoxanthin extraction, were examined against <i>Trichodina</i> sp. infection in barramundi for the first time. LD85 and LD100 was achieved at 2.5 and 5 μL mL<sup>−1</sup> of the FAEE preparation, respectively. In vivo, immersion of infected barramundi in 1.25 μL mL<sup>−1</sup> of this preparation for 24 h reduced infection prevalence from 100% to 53% and was non-toxic to fish.</p>","author":"Arunjyothi Jawaji, \nInna Khozin Goldberg, \nDina Zilberg","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"88d4234750637adfbc771ff50a36d49162b28c6ff6ccdcf5ce6d6b12ec05f724","category":"Environment"}
