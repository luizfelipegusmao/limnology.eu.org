{"title":"Tackling Infectious Diseases in the Caribbean and South America: Epidemiological Insights, Antibiotic Resistance, and Immunological Advances","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1298/v1","date":1726565502000,"content":"This paper explores various aspects of microbiology and immunology, focusing on the epidemiology and molecular characterisation of infectious diseases in the Caribbean and South America. Key areas of investigation include tuberculosis (TB), nosocomial infections, Salmonella infections, and bloodborne pathogens. A retrospective study in Jamaica underscores the high mortality rates in HIV-positive TB patients and the need for early HIV diagnosis and integrated care. Research in Trinidad and Tobago reveals the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, highlighting high HIV-TB co-infection rates. The paper also examines the challenges posed by nosocomial infections, particularly those caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and emphasises the importance of infection control. In addition, the study investigates Salmonella prevalence in poultry in Jamaica and the risks associated with foodborne infections. The paper further explores transfusion-transmitted infections and the development of IgM antibodies in egg whites for bacterial antigen detection. Lastly, it addresses immune responses in patients with immunodeficiency disorders, such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), highlighting their susceptibility to a wide range of infections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cdd473842c68e7e644812313c4d87efb2bc65772627f4141d03d89e0a76acb21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
