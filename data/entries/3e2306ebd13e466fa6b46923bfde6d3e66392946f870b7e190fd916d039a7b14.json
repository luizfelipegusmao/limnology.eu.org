{"title":"Magnetogenetics as a Promising Tool for Controlling Cellular Signaling Pathways","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0786/v1","date":1715581337000,"content":"Magnetogenetics emerges as a transformative approach for modulating cellular signaling pathways through the strategic application of magnetic fields and nanoparticles. This technique leverages the unique properties of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to induce mechanical or thermal stimuli within cells, facilitating the activation of mechano- and thermosensitive proteins without the need for traditional ligand-receptor interactions. Unlike traditional modalities that often require invasive interventions and lack precision in targeting specific cellular functions, magnetogenetics offers a non-invasive alternative with the capacity for deep tissue penetration and the potential for targeting a broad spectrum of cellular processes. This review underscores magnetogenetics' broad applicability, from steering stem cell differentiation to manipulating neuronal activity and immune responses, highlighting its potential in regenerative medicine, neuroscience, and cancer therapy. Furthermore, the review explores the challenges and future directions of magnetogenetics, including the development of genetically programmed magnetic nanoparticles and the integration of magnetic field-sensitive cells for in vivo applications. Magnetogenetics stands at the forefront of cellular manipulation technologies, offering novel insights into cellular signaling and opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e2306ebd13e466fa6b46923bfde6d3e66392946f870b7e190fd916d039a7b14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
