{"title":"Fatty Acids Composition of Grass, Yak Milk and Yak Ghee from the Four Altitudes of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: A Predictive Modelling Approach to Evaluate the Correlation among Altitude, Grass, Yak Milk and Yak Ghee","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0164/v1","date":1725342750000,"content":"This study investigates the effect of altitude on the fatty acid composition of grass, yak milk, and yak ghee on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, aiming to understand how environmental factors influence the nutritional quality of these products. Samples were collected from four different altitudes and analyzed for fatty acid profiles using gas chromatography. The findings reveal significant differences in fatty acid profiles, with notably higher concentrations of lauric acid (C12:0) and myristic acid (C14:0) at altitude A2 compared to others (pï¼œ 0.001). Furthermore, the fatty acid composition in yak milk and ghee is influenced by the grass consumed and the metabolism of rumen microorganisms. The results indicate that yaks adapt their lipid biosynthesis to high-altitude conditions, as evidenced by a significant increase in stearic acid (C18:0) levels at higher altitudes, which subsequently affects the nutritional value of their milk and ghee. These insights are crucial for improving yak breeding and dairy production practices, ultimately enhancing food security and nutritional health for local communities residing in high-altitude areas. The study underscores the necessity for further research on optimizing these natural resources for better health outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37fc645b960977d93efcb00c08fa65bed7a0b1ef0bab96b113c3cfe89d3980bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
