{"title":"Long‐term (29‐year) spatiotemporal patterns of sea turtle deaths in the southern Gulf of Mexico","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4201?af=R","date":1717045184000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nSea turtles are key imperilled species that interact with numerous threats in their critical in-water and inland habitats, which they occupy along their complex life cycle. Therefore, analysing these interactions is essential for adapting ongoing conservation and management actions.\nThe long-term recording of stranded sea turtle individuals and the potential causes of death in their breeding habitats is crucial for defining and adapting conservation actions.\nTwenty-nine years of sea turtle stranding and mortality data (1992–2019) at nesting beaches in Campeche, Mexico, were analysed to describe their spatiotemporal patterns per species and possible causes of death.\nThe most impacted species was the hawksbill turtle, followed by green and Kemp's ridley individuals. The most frequent probable causes of death in this region were bycatch, seismic surveys, vehicle strikes and slaughter at nesting beaches. Both immature and breeding individuals were stranded, mostly the former, and the most frequent months were in the summer (June–August).\nThis study establishes a historic reference baseline for the spatiotemporal mortality patterns of imperilled sea turtle species in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. It shows their interactions with anthropogenic activities and the circumstances jeopardizing their population recovery. It also points out management and conservation actions to implement to improve their long-term viability in the context of the operationalization of their key attributes and interactions with their seascapes.\n</p>","author":"Vicente Guzmán‐Hernández, \nGerardo A.
