{"title":"BERT4FCA: A method for bipartite link prediction using formal concept analysis and BERT","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304858","date":1717596000000,"content":"<p>by Siqi Peng, Hongyuan Yang, Akihiro Yamamoto</p>\r\n\r\nLink prediction in bipartite networks finds practical applications in various domains, including friend recommendation in social networks and chemical reaction prediction in metabolic networks. Recent studies have highlighted the potential for link prediction by maximal bi-cliques, which is a structural feature within bipartite networks that can be extracted using formal concept analysis (FCA). Although previous FCA-based methods for bipartite link prediction have achieved good performance, they still have the problem that they cannot fully capture the information of maximal bi-cliques. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method for link prediction in bipartite networks, utilizing a BERT-like transformer encoder network to enhance the contribution of FCA to link prediction. Our method facilitates bipartite link prediction by learning more information from the maximal bi-cliques and their order relations extracted by FCA. Experimental results on five real-world bipartite networks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous FCA-based methods, a state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network(GNN)-based method, and classic methods such as matrix-factorization and node2vec.","author":"Siqi Peng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0afe3767a67e71e6fde103cfd85c90bd2c687a6e27e7e68e5a239c690f2346e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
