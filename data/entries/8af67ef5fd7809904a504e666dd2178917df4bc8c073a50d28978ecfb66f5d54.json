{"title":"Comfort-Promoting Interventions for the Elderly in Hospital Settings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1789/v1","date":1724765225000,"content":"The comfort of the elderly in hospital settings requires a special attention from the involved health care professionals, particularly nurses, since hospitalization often generates suffering and discomfort. In such contexts, it is essential to take into account the specific characteristics of the elderly, considering their life experiences and their needs, to promote the health, well-being, and comfort of this population. Hence, the present work aimed to explore the nursing interventions that promote comfort among the elderly in hospital settings. A mixed descriptive exploratory study was conducted, through the application of a questionnaire, using intentional non-probabilistic sampling. The study encompassed 55 elderly individuals hospitalized in a medical service of a public hospital located in Lisbon. The results show that the participants perceived a reasonable level of comfort (5.65 ± 6.46). The following categories emerged from the content analysis: 1) Physical interventions; 2) Psycho-spiritual interventions; 3) Socio-cultural interventions; and 4) Environmental interventions. These findings help to understand comfort-promoting nursing interventions in the studied population. It was concluded that, to improve care quality, comforting interventions should focus on the elderly patient’s individuality, through support activities, empowerment, and the preservation/correction of the surrounding environment. Additionally, the provided care should be based on the real needs, expectations, preferences, and values of the elderly individual.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8af67ef5fd7809904a504e666dd2178917df4bc8c073a50d28978ecfb66f5d54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
