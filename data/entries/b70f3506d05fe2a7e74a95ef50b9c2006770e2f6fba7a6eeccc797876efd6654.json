{"title":"Chaotic Interaction between Thermodynamic Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0257/v1","date":1712135201000,"content":"In the previous work in Ref.[1], we presented a new interaction scheme that describes the interaction of thermodynamic systems. Using this interaction scheme, we showed that the interactions of dark matter and dark energy are chaotic. We also predicted that the results could be generalized to all particle and thermodynamic systems. In addition, we gave physical definitions of the concepts of chaos and self-organization. More importantly, we proposed a new law of physics based on interacting systems. In this study, we will consider two thermodynamic systems interacting under different conditions to prove the universality of the physical law we propose. We will show that these systems also have chaotic interaction dynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b70f3506d05fe2a7e74a95ef50b9c2006770e2f6fba7a6eeccc797876efd6654","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
