Cu-Ni binary alloys, despite their wide applications in marine engineering and catalysts, also serve as valuable model materials for studying binary alloy oxidation. This is attributed to the unique characteristics of Cu-Ni alloys, including the mutual solubility of Cu and Ni, both Cu and Ni oxidizes, and the non-mutual solubility of the formed oxides (Cu<sub>2</sub>O and NiO). In this study, we used in situ Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy (ETEM) with advanced data quantification to investigate the initial oxidation processes of CuNi alloys and compared it with that of pure Cu [<a href=\"#ozae044.795-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.795-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2a23f58766e82bd7dbc5fdbfc2eef45745c9c2746d62e759e8c1cefedd705726","category":"Environment"}
