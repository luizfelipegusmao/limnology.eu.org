{"title":"Control of root nodule formation ensures sufficient shoot water availability in Lotus japonicus","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2542/7619002?rss=1","date":1709510400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Leguminous plants provide carbon to symbiotic rhizobia in root nodules to fuel the energy-consuming process of nitrogen fixation. The carbon investment pattern from the acquired sources is crucial for shaping the growth regime of the host plants. The autoregulation of nodulation (AON) signaling pathway tightly regulates the number of nodules that form. AON disruption leads to excessive nodule formation and stunted shoot growth. However, the physiological role of AON in adjusting the carbon investment pattern is unknown. Here, we show that AON plays an important role in sustaining shoot water availability, which is essential for promoting carbon investment in shoot growth in <span>Lotus japonicus</span>. We found that AON-defective mutants exhibit substantial accumulation of nonstructural carbohydrates, such as sucrose. Consistent with this metabolic signature, resilience against water-deficit stress was enhanced in the shoots of the AON-defective mutants. Furthermore, the water uptake ability was attenuated in the AON-defective mutants, likely due to the increased ratio of nodulation zone, which is covered with hydrophobic surfaces, on the roots. These results increase our physiological understanding of legumeâ€“rhizobia symbiosis by revealing a trade-off between root nodule formation and shoot water availability.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"a4ba90096e95f200a79705f7271a224c6c96244073f16549c424aa90895cc338","category":"Environment"}
