{"title":"How to Regress or Reverse Coronary Artery Diseas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0878/v1","date":1713147154000,"content":"A significant portion of fatalities stemming from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occur suddenly and without warning. This can be prevented through early detection of coronary stenosis. In recent years, coronary artery calcium (CAC) and computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) have been utilized. For instance, a 55-year-old interventional cardiologist had a CAC of 58 with 50% stenosis involving his left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Despite possibly having vulnerable plaque, which carries significant future cardiovascular events, the patient followed a plant-based diet (PBD), took supplements, and continued optimal medical therapy (OMT). After three years, there was a significant regression in both CAC and stenosis. During our discussion, we emphasized the importance of food selection, quantification, and how food is processed (raw) to achieve maximal benefit in regressing atherosclerosis. Additionally, we highlighted the importance of identifying the possibility of vulnerable plaque and the mechanism stabilizing it. The case supported the guidelines set by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) for managing chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) by emphasizing OMT and lifestyle changes. We hope that in the future, more doctors and patients will take responsibility for implementing lifestyle changes rather than solely relying on medications and sophisticated medical technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d5b5189fa73def85ce754ef5e8fca06d2e1fc8e91bc4cb9d655bff83e53405ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
