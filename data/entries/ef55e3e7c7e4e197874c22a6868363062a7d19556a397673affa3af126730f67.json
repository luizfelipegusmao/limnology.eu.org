{"title":"Selective State DOT Lane Width Standards and Guidelines to Reduce Speeds and Improve Safety","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1659/v1","date":1719229798000,"content":"This research investigates the lane width standards and guidelines implemented by various State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) to reduce vehicle speeds and enhance road safety. Lane width reduction is often perceived as a strategy to mitigate speed and improve safety. Still, its effectiveness and implications vary across different contexts, including regions, urban/rural settings, or other geometric design features. Drawing from interviews with five State DOTs and a review of their road design manuals, this study aims to identify suggested lane widths depending on the contexts, design exception process when narrowing or widening lane widths, and introduce representative before/after studies. The findings indicate that State DOTs tend to have lower recommended lane widths in urban areas than in rural areas. Moreover, lane width standards among these states vary due to several factors, including the geographical location of roadways (urban or rural areas), design or posted speeds, traffic volume, road classification, and geometric road design features. Design exceptions are required if the existing or proposed design element is incompatible with both AASHTO and department governing criteria. In conclusion, the findings will provide valuable insights and recommendations for policymakers, transportation planners, and road engineers to inform optimal lane width and decision-making processes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef55e3e7c7e4e197874c22a6868363062a7d19556a397673affa3af126730f67","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
