{"title":"Genetically manipulated chloroplast stromal phosphate levels alter photosynthetic efficiency","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/385/7664310?rss=1","date":1714694400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The concentration of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in the chloroplast stroma must be maintained within narrow limits to sustain photosynthesis and to direct the partitioning of fixed carbon. However, it is unknown if these limits or the underlying contributions of different chloroplastic Pi transporters vary throughout the photoperiod or between chloroplasts in different leaf tissues. To address these questions, we applied live Pi imaging to Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) wild-type plants and 2 loss-of-function transporter mutants: triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (<span>tpt</span>), phosphate transporter 2;1 (<span>pht2;1</span>), and <span>tpt pht2;1</span>. Our analyses revealed that stromal Pi varies spatially and temporally, and that TPT and PHT2;1 contribute to Pi import with overlapping tissue specificities. Further, the series of progressively diminished steady-state stromal Pi levels in these mutants provided the means to examine the effects of Pi on photosynthetic efficiency without imposing nutritional deprivation. Φ<sub>PSII</sub> and nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) correlated with stromal Pi levels. However, the proton efflux activity of the ATP synthase (g<sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup>) and the thylakoid proton motive force (pmf) were unaltered under growth conditions, but were suppressed transiently after a dark to light transition with return to wild-type levels within 2 min. These results argue against a simple substrate-level limitation of ATP synthase by depletion of stromal Pi, favoring more integrated regulatory models, which include rapid acclimation of thylakoid ATP synthase activity to reduced Pi levels.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"25ef031eacd9f07db7e08a2e2b67476b55e6eee15ea86340dbf133035af54738","category":"Environment"}
