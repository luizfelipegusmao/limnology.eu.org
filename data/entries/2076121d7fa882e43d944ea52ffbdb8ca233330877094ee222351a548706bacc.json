To address the challenges of aligning fluorescence and electron microscopy images and aligning serial sections of irregularly shaped biological specimens, we developed a diamond notch knife, a new tool for puncturing holes using a diamond needle. The diamond needle featured a triangular and right-angled tip, enabling the drilling of deep holes upon insertion into the polished block face. This study describes the application of the diamond notch knife in correlative array tomography.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"2076121d7fa882e43d944ea52ffbdb8ca233330877094ee222351a548706bacc","category":"Environment"}
