{"title":"Sex-specific Impact of Lifestyle Factors on Sick Leave in Serbian Working Population: Findings from the National Health Survey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0845/v1","date":1726044398000,"content":"Sick leave is influenced by various modifiable lifestyle factors and sex differences. This study examines the impact of body mass index, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption on sick leave among Serbia's working population, focusing on sex differences. Data from the 2019 National Health Survey of Serbia were analyzed, focusing on a representative sample of 4,652 individuals aged 18-65. Chi-square tests and logistic regression models assessed the relationships between lifestyle factors and sick leave, adjusting for sociodemographic, work-related, and health-related variables. Among respondents, 15.8% reported sick leave in the past 12 months, with higher rates among women in both, short-term (13.9% vs. 10.6%) and long-term sick leave (3.4% vs. 2.2%). For men, obesity (OR = 2.6), poor dietary habits (fruit OR = 2.1; vegetables OR = 2.8), smoking (OR = 1.9), and risky alcohol consumption (OR = 4.1) significantly increase the likelihood of sick leave. In women, smoking (OR = 1.8) and risky alcohol consumption (OR = 3.1) are major predictors, while BMI and physical activity show less impact. Fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity have inconsistent effects on sick leave, indicating the need for further research. This study identifies obesity, poor dietary habits, smoking, and alcohol consumption as key predictors of sick leave in men. In women, smoking and risky alcohol consumption are major predictors. Smoking is a risk factor for both sexes, while risky alcohol consumption emerges as a prominent predictor and is a significant predictor overall. These findings highlight the need for targeted public health interventions to address these lifestyle factors and reduce sick leave rates. Further research is needed to clarify the roles of dietary habits and physical activity in influencing sick leave.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0de842721fffc92660079f77d4134c19c306816bf5b59ffec81f4778415d2994","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
