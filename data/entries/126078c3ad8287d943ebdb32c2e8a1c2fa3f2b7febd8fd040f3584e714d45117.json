The effectiveness of post-FIB concentrated Ar ion milling [NanoMill<sup>®</sup> and PicoMill<sup>®</sup> TEM specimen preparation systems, Fischione Instruments] as a final thinning step is attributed to ultra-low ion beam energies of less than 2 kV and a concentrated Ar ion beam that is less than 1 µm diameter [<a href=\"#ozae044.1091-B1\">1-3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1091-B5\">5</a>]. Final thinning of the specimen following FIB or pFIB milling is typically performed in the NanoMill and PicoMill systems with specimen tilts of +12°/-10° [<a href=\"#ozae044.1091-B5\">5</a>]. We present a novel approach to post-FIB Ar ion milling that:</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"126078c3ad8287d943ebdb32c2e8a1c2fa3f2b7febd8fd040f3584e714d45117","category":"Environment"}
