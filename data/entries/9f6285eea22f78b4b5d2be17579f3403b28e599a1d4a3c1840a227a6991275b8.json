{"title":"Controlled Quantum Communication Using Quantum Random Walk","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2035/v1","date":1717067820000,"content":"In this paper, we introduce a novel controlled quantum communication protocol utilizing a quantum random walk involving one sender, one receiver, and multiple controllers. Inspired by classical random walk theory, quantum random walk serves as the foundation of our proposed protocol. With this protocol, we demonstrate the ability to transfer any n- dimensional quantum state to any party facilitated by any m number of controllers. Furthermore, any of the (m+1) individuals has the freedom to accept the role of the receiver. Rigorous testing of the protocol’s performance is conducted through quantum state tomography. We have run different variations of the circuits in IBMQ QASM simulator. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of a weak measurement-based protocol designed to mitigate amplitude-damping noise’s detrimental effects on quantum states. By analyzing fidelity versus amplitude damping noise-strength plots for scenarios with and without the weak measurement protocol, we provide valuable insights into its protective capabilities across various levels of noise. These find- ings illuminate the protocol’s potential applications in quantum information processing","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f6285eea22f78b4b5d2be17579f3403b28e599a1d4a3c1840a227a6991275b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
