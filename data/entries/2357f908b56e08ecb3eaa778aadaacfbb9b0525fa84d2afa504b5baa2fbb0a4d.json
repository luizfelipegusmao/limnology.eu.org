{"title":"Postprocessing Workflow for Laboratory Diffraction Contrast Tomography: A Case Study on Chromite Geomaterials","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/3/440/7664333?rss=1","date":1714694400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Texture stands as a fundamental descriptor in the realms of geology and earth and planetary science. Beyond offering insights into the geological processes underlying mineral formation, its characterization plays a pivotal role in advancing engineering applications, notably in mining, mineral processing, and metal extraction, by providing quantitative data for predictive modeling. Laboratory diffraction contrast tomography (LabDCT), a recently developed 3D characterization technique, offers nondestructive measurement of grain phases including their morphology, distribution, and crystal orientation. It has recently shown its potential to assess 3D textures in complex natural rock samples. This study looks at improving on previous work by examining the artifacts and presents a novel postprocessing workflow designed to correct them. The workflow is developed to rectify inaccurate grain boundaries and interpolate partially reconstructed grains to provide more accurate results and is illustrated using multi-scan examples on chromite sands and natural chromitite from the Upper Group 2 Reef layer in South Africa. The postcorrected LabDCT results were validated through qualitative and quantitative assessment using 2D electron back-scattered diffraction on polished sample surfaces. The successful implementation of this postprocessing workflow underscores its substantial potential in achieving precise textural characterization and will provide valuable insights for both earth science and engineering applications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2357f908b56e08ecb3eaa778aadaacfbb9b0525fa84d2afa504b5baa2fbb0a4d","category":"Environment"}
