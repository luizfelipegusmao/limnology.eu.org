{"title":"Effectiveness of fishways on the Pinka Stream and the Rába River, Central Europe: An evaluation with species from the order Cypriniformes","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4285?af=R","date":1714211691000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study assessed the functional effectiveness in terms of passage proportion of three fishways, one nature-like bypass, one partly nature-like bypass and partly technical pool-type and one completely technical, on the Pinka Stream and Rába River in Western Hungary. Radio frequency identification with passive integrated transponder tagging was used to collect data on the upstream passage. A total of 2976 tagged individuals were included in the study; 2863 individuals were either barbel (<i>Barbus barbus</i>), nase (<i>Chondrostoma nasus</i>) or chub (<i>Squalius cephalus</i>), which were chosen as model species, and 113 individuals belonged to four other species. There were 540 individuals of the model species and 18 individuals of the other species detected while successfully ascending one of the fishways. The time-to-event (survival) analysis of the data of the model species revealed significant species-specific differences in passage probability between the fishways. The passage probabilities of the barbel were the highest, and those of the nase were the lowest at all three fishways. The findings demonstrate that single-species evaluations can lead to incorrect conclusions on fishway effectiveness. Technical fishways can be as effective as nature-like ones, and hybrid solutions (technical fishways combined with nature-like bypasses) can function as well. The limitations of the study and recommendations for further evaluations are also discussed.</p>","author":"Péter Sály, \nMárton Sallai, \nZoltán Sallai","siteTitle":"Wiley: River Research and Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"dd8f8dcb48cf1db6f6edba43098839a842d88bad9f088e9d186fa05ae3366ba7","entryHash":"6b726e19568302fe2613a5c60516ef6e040c8da5dfda6f425b763d7769aaa76c","category":"Environment"}
