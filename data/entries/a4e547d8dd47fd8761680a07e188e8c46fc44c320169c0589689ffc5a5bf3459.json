{"title":"Redefining Roles: A Paradigm Shift in Tryptophan-Kynurenine Metabolism for Innovative Clinical Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1193/v1","date":1729042952000,"content":"The tryptophan-kynurenine (KYN) pathway has long been recognized for its essential role in gen-erating metabolites that influence various physiological processes. Traditionally, these metabolites have been categorized into distinct, often opposing groups, such as pro-oxidant versus antioxidant, excitotoxic versus neuroprotective, or neurotoxic versus neuroprotective. This dichotomous framework has shaped much of the research on conditions like neurodegenerative and neuropsy-chiatric disorders, as well as cancer, where metabolic imbalances are a key feature. The effects are significantly influenced by various factors, including the concentration of metabolites and the par-ticular cellular milieu in which they are generated. A molecule that acts as neuroprotective at low concentrations may exhibit neurotoxic effects at elevated levels. The oxidative equilibrium of the surrounding environment can alter the function of KYN from an antioxidant to a pro-oxidant. This narrative review offers a comprehensive examination and analysis of the contemporary under-standing of KYN metabolites, emphasizing their multifaceted biological functions and their rele-vance in numerous physiological and pathological processes. This underscores the pressing ne-cessity for a paradigm shift in the comprehension of KYN metabolism. Understanding the intricate, context-dependent functions of these metabolites is crucial for establishing novel therapeutic tar-gets, especially in conditions such as neurodegeneration, immunological disorders, and cancer, where metabolic dysregulation serves as a primary catalyst of pathogenesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4e547d8dd47fd8761680a07e188e8c46fc44c320169c0589689ffc5a5bf3459","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
