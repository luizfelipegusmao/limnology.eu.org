{"title":"Transmissible cancers, the genomes that do not melt down","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/7/1205/7657665?rss=1","date":1713916800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Evolutionary theory predicts that the accumulation of deleterious mutations in asexually reproducing organisms should lead to genomic decay. Clonally reproducing cell lines, i.e., transmissible cancers, when cells are transmitted as allografts/xenografts, break these rules and survive for centuries and millennia. The currently known 11 transmissible cancer lineages occur in dogs (canine venereal tumour disease), in Tasmanian devils (devil facial tumor diseases, DFT1 and DFT2), and in bivalves (bivalve transmissible neoplasia). Despite the mutation loads of these cell lines being much higher than observed in human cancers, they have not been eliminated in space and time. Here, we provide potential explanations for how these fascinating cell lines may have overcome the fitness decline due to the progressive accumulation of deleterious mutations and propose that the high mutation load may carry an indirect positive fitness outcome. We offer ideas on how these hostâ€“pathogen systems could be used to answer outstanding questions in evolutionary biology. The recent studies on the evolution of these clonal pathogens reveal key mechanistic insight into transmissible cancer genomes, information that is essential for future studies investigating how these contagious cancer cell lines can repeatedly evade immune recognition, evolve, and survive in the landscape of highly diverse hosts.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"b25d1d5c354356bc287a183fabca4c06c9d4acd62c8aaa4574275d7a240359bd","category":"Environment"}
