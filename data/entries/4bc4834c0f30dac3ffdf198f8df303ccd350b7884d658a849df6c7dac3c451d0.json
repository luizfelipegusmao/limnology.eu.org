{"title":"Biomacromolecules As Immunomodulators: Utilizing Nature&rsquo;s Tools for Immune Regulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0699/v1","date":1720504629000,"content":"Although there are numerous available immunomodulators, those of natural origin would be preferable based on their safety profile and effectiveness. The research and clinical interest in immunomodulators have increased in the last decades, especially in the immunomodulatory properties of plant-based therapies. Innovative technologies and extensive study on immunomodulatory natural products, botanicals, extracts, and active moieties with immunomodulatory potential could provide us with valuable entities to develop as novel immunomodulatory medicines to enhance current chemotherapies. This review focuses on plant-based immunomodulatory drugs that are currently in clinical studies. However, further studies in this area are of utmost importance to obtain complete information about the positive effects of medicinal plants and their chemical components and molecules as an alternative to combatting various diseases and/or prevention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4bc4834c0f30dac3ffdf198f8df303ccd350b7884d658a849df6c7dac3c451d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
