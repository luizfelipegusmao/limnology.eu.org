{"title":"A Feasibility Study of a Music Enrichment Program on Relative Reinforcing Value of Food and Home Environmental Enrichment among Families of Low Socioeconomic Status","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1672/v1","date":1724394788000,"content":"Emerging evidence suggests that low socioeconomic status (SES) home environments may play a role by promoting excess energy intake through a lack of access to non-food reinforcers. Because of the deleterious effects of SES related disparities on child health and development, feasible and culturally acceptable interventions are urgently needed. Community-based music enrichment programs may be an ideal intervention strategy. In collaboration with a local non-profit organization and music studio, we conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a music enrichment program versus playdate control in a group of 9-24-month-old healthy infants (N = 16). Overall, we found some intervention effects on relative reinforcing value of food (RRVfood) and the home environmental enrichment measures (i.e., increased music use at home and home language environment). Our intervention demonstrated large effects on an increased use of music at home. We did not find significant group differences on the RRVfood and home language environment, but some of the effect sizes were medium-to-large. Results also suggest that our intervention is feasible and acceptable. Parent feedback indicated the intervention was well-liked and steps we took to help reduce barriers worked. Music enrichment programs maybe a high-impact, low-cost strategy to address socioeconomic disparities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92158a373ee3cc5b410270afad180ee3a349b8e56b2119e1bf9c8e38e4e0a409","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
