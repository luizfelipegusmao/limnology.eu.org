{"title":"Spiny dogfish, Squalus suckleyi, shows a good tolerance for hypoxia but need long recovery times","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae054/7732131?rss=1","date":1723507200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pacific spiny dogfish, <span>Squalus suckleyi</span>, move to shallow coastal waters during critical reproductive life stages and are thus at risk of encountering hypoxic events which occur more frequently in these areas. For effective conservation management, we need to fully understand the consequences of hypoxia on marine key species such as elasmobranchs. Because of their benthic life style, we hypothesized that <span>S. suckleyi</span> are hypoxia tolerant and able to efficiently regulate oxygen consumption, and that anaerobic metabolism is supported by a broad range of metabolites including ketones, fatty acids and amino acids. Therefore, we studied oxygen consumption rates, ventilation frequency and amplitude, blood gasses, acid–base regulation, and changes in plasma and tissue metabolites during progressive hypoxia. Our results show that critical oxygen levels (<span>P</span><sub>crit</sub>) where oxyregulation is lost were indeed low (18.1% air saturation or 28.5 Torr at 13°C). However, many dogfish behaved as oxyconformers rather than oxyregulators. Arterial blood PO<sub>2</sub> levels mostly decreased linearly with decreasing environmental PO<sub>2</sub>. Blood gases and acid–base status were dependent on open versus closed respirometry but in both set-ups ventilation frequency increased. Hypoxia below P<sub>crit</sub> resulted in an up-regulation of anaerobic glycolysis, as evidenced by increased lactate levels in all tissues except brain. Elasmobranchs typically rely on ketone bodies as oxidative substrates, and decreased concentrations of acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate were observed in white muscle of hypoxic and/or recovering fish. Furthermore, reductions in isoleucine, glutamate, glutamine and other amino acids were observed. After 6 hours of normoxic recovery, changes persisted and only lactate returned to normal in most tissues. This emphasizes the importance of using suitable bioindicators adjusted to preferred metabolic pathways of the target species in conservation physiology. We conclude that Pacific spiny dogfish can tolerate severe transient hypoxic events, but recovery is slow and negative impacts can be expected when hypoxia persists.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"13c258430057754436f64278cba2f34ad481f471ef502fb3587395981c5aee04","category":"Environment"}
