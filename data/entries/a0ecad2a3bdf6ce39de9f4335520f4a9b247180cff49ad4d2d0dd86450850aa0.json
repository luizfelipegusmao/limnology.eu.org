{"title":"The Evolving Theme of Health-Promoting Urban Form: Applying the Macrolot Concept for Easy Access to Open Public Green Spaces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1752/v1","date":1719303057000,"content":"Making cities health-promoting places is an evolving theme. Numerous research confirm the health-promoting qualities of contact with nature and problems resulting from the deprivation of access to public green spaces. Easy access to safe and inclusive open public green spaces is still one of the long-lasting problems of urbanized areas around the globe. It is one of the sustainable development goals - SDGs proposed by the UN, 11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Point 11.7 By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities.\nThe major question is how to implement this goal in practice and design cities to provide easy access to safe and inclusive open public green spaces. \nOne of the important concepts for sustainable urban development is the urban block - Macrolot coined by Christian de Portzamparc, which led to the new urban morphology of eco-neighborhoods in France. It is a combination of the traditional, walkable urban grid with the Le Corbusier vision for a healthy modernist city offering daylight, fresh air, and greenery for everyone. Among the advantages of this particular urban morphology are the increased presence of green spaces which form public parks, and possibilities for placemaking. Studying the effects of the urban form of the Macrolot is of great significance for sustainable urban development.\nIn this study, five neighborhoods: three eco-neighborhoods from France designed according to the open urban block – Macrolot urban morphology – ZAC Massena, ZAC Trapeze, and ZAC Clichy-Batignolles and two award-winning developments from Po-land – Riverview and Ostoja Wilanów were chosen as case studies. \nThe application of the Macrolot concept to sustainable urban planning &amp; design and possibilities for operationalization of the SDGs: 11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable are discussed. This study offers valuable evidence to inform urban planning and design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a0ecad2a3bdf6ce39de9f4335520f4a9b247180cff49ad4d2d0dd86450850aa0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
