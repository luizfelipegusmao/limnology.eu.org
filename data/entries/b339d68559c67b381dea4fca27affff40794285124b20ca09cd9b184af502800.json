{"title":"Modeling of Electrochemical Impedance of Fuel Cell Based on the Novel Nanocomposite Membrane","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1871/v1","date":1714379649000,"content":"The new hybrid composite materials for PEM fuel cell were synthesized by UV-polymerization of acrylic monomers (acrylonitrile (AN), acrylic acid (AA), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA)) and sulfo aromatic monomer â€“ sodium styrene sulfonate (SSS), and tetraethoxysilane/3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (TEOS/MAPTMS)-based sol-gel system. By means of X-ray spectroscopy fractal structure of the obtained materials was characterized. Proton conductivity and viscoelastic properties of the materials were investigated depending on the content of inorganic component in nanocomposites. On the basis of impedance studies, an equivalent scheme is proposed that successfully describes the proton conductivity in the synthesized composite electrolyte membranes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b339d68559c67b381dea4fca27affff40794285124b20ca09cd9b184af502800","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
