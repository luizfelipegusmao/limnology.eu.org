{"title":"Classification Of Student Leadership Profiles In Diverse Governance Settings: Insights From PISA 2022","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0632/v1","date":1720438367000,"content":"Student leadership prepares students for responsibilities such as taking on specific tasks, assuming leadership roles in their future personal and professional lives. Developing students' leadership profiles is among the important goals of educational systems aiming for future generations to take responsibility and advance their countries. With this perspective in mind, the PISA assessment includes items to measure students' leadership behaviors. This study aims to extract student leadership profiles from the leadership-related items in the PISA 2022 application, using data from Cambodia, Peru, Paraguay, and Guatemala, which have different governance systems and cultural characteristics. The second purpose of the research is to determine the distribution of the identified leadership profiles in these countries and explain them in the context of governance and cultural characteristics. Latent class analysis was used to determine student leadership profiles. Accordingly, 2-class and 3-class latent models were found to be the most suitable models to explain student profiles. While the distinction between student profiles is more pronounced in the 2-class model, the 3-class model provides more detailed information about student profiles. In this respect, 2-class and 3-class latent models are reported comparatively. In the 2-class latent model, students are labeled as the \"Shy or Lack of Self-Confidence Group\" and the \"Active Leader or Influential Group.\" In the 3-class latent model, students are labeled as the \"Moderate or Passive Leader Group,\" the \"Strong Leader or Influential Group,\" and the \"Avoidant or Leadership-Uncomfortable Group.\" In both models, it is one of the striking findings that Cambodian students are in the low leadership profile, and Peruvian students are in the high leadership profile.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61609ced99e25aabd1d33f6ef184f08bf83de4a27ff90748a6ea473de7355f00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
