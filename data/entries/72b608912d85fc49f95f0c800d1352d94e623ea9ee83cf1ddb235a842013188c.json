Thus, our work aims to define the long-term effects of thinning in sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) sub-mountainous thermophilic low coppices in the Croatian Dinarides. The experiment includes two localities with thinning plots and control plots. Thinning was done in 2002 with 17.71% of wood volume removed in the European beech coppice and 26.09% in the sessile oak coppice. 1276 trees were marked, measured (DBH, tree height, number of stems per stump) and assessed for vitality, origin and six silvicultural features revealing tree quality. Descriptive statistics for all variables, RMANOVA for DBH and height and for continuous variables mean+-+ standard deviation for categorical frequency and relative frequency variables were carried out. The results show a statistically significant positive long-term effect of thinning on tree growth, stem and crown features and support findings that thinning, by increasing growth and quality, is a necessary intervention in European beech and sessile oak low coppices. The recent economic crisis, the sudden increase in energy prices, and the increased demand for assorted wood products have initiated higher interest in coppices in Croatia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72b608912d85fc49f95f0c800d1352d94e623ea9ee83cf1ddb235a842013188c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
