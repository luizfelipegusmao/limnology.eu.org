These enterprises face a growing problem in accessing IT resources due to financial and lack of qualified IT personnel in their regions. This led to a growing interest in database and data warehouse technologies, which serve as foundational tools for organizing, storing, and analyzing vast amounts of data. This systematic review proposes to evaluate the impact of database and data warehouse technologies on organizational performance by employing the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, this review thoroughly synthesizes existing literature to identify the key benefits and challenges associated with the adoption of these technologies in SMEs. The proposed inclusion criteria were bounded by (1) publication date between 2014 and 2024, (2) research written in English, (3) research work focusing on evaluating the impact of database and data warehouse technologies on organizational performance, (4) research with a clear evaluation analysis of database and data warehouse technologies research framework. Following these guidelines, 150 eligible research studies were included. The analysis reveals a wide range of findings concerning the impact of database and data warehouse technologies. Key results include the identification of cost-efficiency trends, improvements in decision-making processes, enhancements in customer relationship management, and gains in operational efficiency. The findings provide actionable guidance for SMEs, policymakers, and IT professionals seeking to leverage these technologies to enhance organizational performance. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic review offers a comprehensive analysis that fills a gap in the existing literature on the impact of these technologies on organizational outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bcf07d544f859156f2a04aba528ac2588032db655726c2cb026242d695192908","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
