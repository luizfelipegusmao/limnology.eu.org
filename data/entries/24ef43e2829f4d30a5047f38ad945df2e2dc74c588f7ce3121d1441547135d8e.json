{"title":"Chloroplast DNA methylation in the kelp Saccharina latissima is determined by origin and possibly influenced by cultivation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.13744?af=R","date":1719985254000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>DNA cytosine methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism in genomic DNA. In most land plants, it is absent in the chloroplast DNA. We detected methylation in the chloroplast DNA of the kelp <i>Saccharina latissima</i>, a non-model macroalgal species of high ecological and economic importance. Since the functional role of the chloroplast methylome is yet largely unknown, this fundamental research assessed the chloroplast DNA cytosine methylation in wild and laboratory raised kelp from different climatic origins (High-Arctic at 79° N, and temperate at 54° N), and in laboratory samples from these origins raised at different temperatures (5, 10 and 15°C). Results suggest genome-wide differences in methylated sites and methylation level between the origins, while rearing temperature had only weak effects on the chloroplast methylome. Our findings point at the importance of matching conditions to origin in restoration and cultivation processes to be valid even on plastid level.</p>","author":"Lydia Scheschonk, \nAnne M. L.
