{"title":"Can new urbanization pilot policies promote green technology innovation in cities: Empirical evidence from China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303404","date":1715090400000,"content":"<p>by Jing Cheng, Jiarui Chen</p>\r\n\r\nThe development of urbanization has brought new challenges to the ecological environment, and the promotion of green technology innovation and development is widely recognized as an essential method to achieve cities’ economic benefits and environmental protection. This paper examines whether the new urbanization pilot policies (NUP) increase green technology innovation (GTI) from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. This paper examines the impact of new urbanization on GTI by analyzing data from 285 cities in China between 2010 and 2021, using the multi-period DID model with the implementation of NUP as an exogenous policy shock. The study results indicate that NUP significantly affects GTI, and the conclusion still holds after the parallel trend test, placebo test, and other robustness tests. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the NUP significantly enhances GTI in low environmental pollution, non-resource-based, Medium-sized, and Central Region cities. The test of moderating effect shows that NUP has a \"linkage effect\" with the government’s environmental attention, financial investment in innovation, and regional talent pooling. The findings of this paper provide empirical evidence and decision-making reference for promoting NUP and sustainable development of cities.","author":"Jing Cheng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ac4d281985ec3f9ffbbbadf9325483597105ae268d63d2435884c6480de56920","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
