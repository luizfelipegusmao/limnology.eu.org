{"title":"Immunologic, virologic and drug resistance outcomes in an HIV-infected prospective cohort on treatment in South Africa","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307519","date":1724680800000,"content":"<p>by Bixa Ogola, Nontokozo D. Matume, Denis M. Tebit, Lufuno G. Mavhandu-Ramarumo, Pascal Obong Bessong</p>\r\nBackground <p>In September 2016, South Africa introduced the Universal Test and Treat (UTT) programme to manage HIV infection. However, the development of drug resistance and sustaining viral suppression are challenges to the success of treatment programmes. This prospective observational study describes virologic, immunologic, and drug resistance profiles in a test and treat cohort in north-eastern South Africa.</p> Methods <p>Five hundred and thirty-four HIV-1 positive antiretroviral na√Øve adults entering treatment programmes were enrolled between January 2016 and February 2018. Trends in CD4+ cell count, viral load, and drug resistance by examination of deep sequences were assessed at baseline and every three months, for 24 months.</p> Results <p>Seventy-five percent were late initiators into ART (that is baseline CD4+ cell counts &lt; 500 cells/microliter) and 16% were early initiators into ART and baseline CD4 was not available for 9%. Eleven percent (12/104) achieved immunological response after 6 months, 39.4% (41 /104) after 12 months, and 97.5% (101/104) after 24 months. Seventy-one percent (381/534) had baseline viral loads &gt;1000 RNA copies/ml. Nine percent (22/246) achieved viral suppression after 3 months, 50% (122/246) after 6 months and 73.6% (181/246) after 12 months. A slower viral suppression was observed for males than females (p value = 0.012). A total of 45.6% (52/114) individuals had at least one drug resistance mutation (DRM) detected at &gt;20% threshold in any of the time points, and the number increased to 55% (63/114) when minor variants were accounted for. Forty-eight percent (14/29) had drug resistance mutations at &gt;5% threshold as early as 3 months into treatment.</p> Conclusion <p>The UNAIDS target of 95% viral suppression in individuals under treatment was not observed after 12 months of treatment, and this was less successful for males. Adherence and drug resistance monitoring could be beneficial for individuals harbouring resistant viruses early into treatment.</p>","author":"Bixa Ogola","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8314daeb31d3f6685657a221b1e686dc93fd525258483f61cd91a1f18955682b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
