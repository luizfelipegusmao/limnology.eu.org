{"title":"Molecular recognition between volatile molecules and odorant binding proteins 7 by homology modeling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13595?af=R","date":1716211692000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) in insects are key to detection and recognition of external chemical signals associated with survival. OBP7 in <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i>'s larval stage (SfruOBP7) may search for host plants by sensing plant volatiles, which are important sources of pest attractants and repellents. However, the atomic-level basis of binding modes remains elusive.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>SfruOBP7 structure was constructed through homology modeling, and complex models of six plant volatiles ((<i>E</i>)-2-hexenol, <i>α</i>-pinene, (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenyl acetate, lauric acid, <i>O</i>-cymene and 1-octanol) and SfruOBP7 were obtained through molecular docking. To study the detailed interactions between the six plant volatile molecules and SfruOBP7, we conducted three 300 ns molecular dynamics simulations for each study object. The correlation coefficients between binding free energy obtained by molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area together with solvated interaction energy methods and experimental values are 0.90 and 0.88, respectively, showing a good correlation. By comparing binding free energy along with interaction patterns between SfruOBP7 and the six volatile molecules, hotspot residues of SfruOBP7 when binding with different volatile molecules were determined. Hydrophobic interactions stemming from van der Waals interactions play a significant role in SfruOBP7 and these plant volatile systems.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The optimized three-dimensional structure of SfruOBP7 and its binding modes with six plant volatiles revealed their interactions, thus providing a means for estimating the binding energies of other plant volatiles. Our study will help to guide the rational design of effective and selective insect attractants. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ruige Wang, \nLixin Duan, \nBing Zhao, \nYongjie Zheng, \nLin Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"2a976b4b784519a3c0d89736e41362f15bbe9d58f177b4c81cef7cfa1fb74452","category":"Environment"}
