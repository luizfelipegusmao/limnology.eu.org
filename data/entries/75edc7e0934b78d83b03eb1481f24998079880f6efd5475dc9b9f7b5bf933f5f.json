{"title":"Efficacy and Safety in Dogs Following Administration of an Alphavirus RNA Particle Canine Influenza H3N2 Vaccine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1505/v1","date":1724222707000,"content":"Canine influenza virus (CIV) H3N2 causes a highly contagious respiratory disease in dogs and has been the source of outbreaks across North America since 2015. An injectable RNA Particle (RP)-CIV H3N2 vaccine has been developed to protect dogs against this disease. To demonstrate efficacy, dogs were randomized into two treatment groups, then vaccinated subcutaneously twice, 21 days apart, with a placebo vaccine (n = 20) or a RP-CIV H3N2 vaccine (n = 20). Three weeks later, dogs were challenged intranasally with virulent CIV H3N2 and observed daily for 10 days for clinical signs of disease. Nasal swabs were also collected daily to evaluate shedding of the challenge virus. Ten days post-challenge, dogs were euthanized, and the lungs were examined for consolidation. RP-CIV H3N2 vaccination demonstrated a significant reduction in duration of clinical signs, duration and amount of virus shed, lung consolidation, and the incidence of suppurative pneumonia. To evaluate safety, dogs from multiple geographic regions were vaccinated subcutaneously, 3-4 weeks apart, with a RP-CIV H3N2 vaccine and observed for adverse events for 14 days after each administration. The RP-CIV H3N2 vaccine was deemed safe, with lethargy being the most reported adverse event at a rate of 1.6%.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75edc7e0934b78d83b03eb1481f24998079880f6efd5475dc9b9f7b5bf933f5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
