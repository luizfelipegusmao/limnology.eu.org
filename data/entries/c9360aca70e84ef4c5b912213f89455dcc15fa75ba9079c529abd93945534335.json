We have demonstrated that VTA<sup>dopamine</sup> neurons (expressing tyrosine hydroxylase) are intermixed with neurons that transmit glutamate without GABA (VTA<sup>glutamate-only</sup>, expressing vesicular glutamate transporter type 2, VGluT2), GABA without glutamate (VTA<sup>GABA-only</sup>, expressing the synthesis enzyme glutamate decarboxylase, GAD, and the vesicular GABA transporter, VGaT) [<a href=\"#ozae044.481-B2\">2</a>], or co-transmit glutamate and GABA (VTA<sup>glutamate-GABA</sup>) [<a href=\"#ozae044.481-B3\">3</a>]. By selective targeting of VTA subpopulations of neurons, we recently found that activation of VTA<sup>glutamate-only</sup> neurons is rewarding and decreased feeding behavior, but activation of VTA<sup>GABA-only</sup> neurons is aversive. To characterize the nature of the synapses established among VTA neurons, we drove expression of eYFP in different VTA neurons by VTA-injection of INTRSECT viral vectors in different cohorts of <span>vglut2-Cre/vgat-Flp</span> mice: Con/Fon-ChR2-eYFP injection for eYFP expression in VTA<sup>VGluT2-VGaT</sup> neurons, Con/Foff-ChR2-eYFP for eYFP expression in VTA<sup>VGluT2-only</sup> neurons and Coff/Fon-ChR2-eYFP injection for eYFP expression in VTA<sup>VGaT-only</sup> neurons. By confocal microscopy analysis, we frequently detected eYFP-VGluT2 puncta in VTA of mice expressing eYFP in VTA<sup>VGluT2-only</sup> neurons, and eYFP-VGaT puncta in VTA of mice expressing eYFP in VTA<sup>VGaT-only</sup> neurons, indicating that both VTA<sup>VGluT2-only</sup> and VTA<sup>VGaT-only</sup> neurons, not VTA<sup>VGluT2-VGaT</sup> neurons, establish local synapses. Next, by triple immuno-electron microscopy, we detected monosynaptic connections between axon terminals from VTA<sup>VGluT2-only</sup> and VTA<sup>VGaT-only</sup> neurons with different classes of postsynaptic VTA neurons. To have a better understanding of the ultrastructural features of the VTA microcircuitry, we conducted 3-D ultrastructural analysis of synapses between axon terminals from VTA<sup>VGluT2-only</sup> neurons or VTA<sup>VGaT-only</sup> neurons and postsynaptic neurons. For the implementation of the 3-D ultrastructural synaptic analysis we developed a correlative light and electron microcopy (CLEM) protocol in combination with injection of a cocktail of INTRSECT viral vectors in the VTA of <span>vglut2-Cre/vgat-Flp</span> mice. We did intra-VTA injections of AAV-Con/Foff-ChR2-eYFP for the expression of eYFP in VTA<sup>VGluT2-only</sup> neurons, and for the simultaneous VTA expression of mCherry in VTA<sup>VGaT-only</sup> neurons. To characterize the ultrastructural features for VTA immunofluorescent puncta, we used the brain tissue sections imaged by confocal microscopy and processed them for electron microscopy analysis to obtain scanning electron microscopic images. The CLEM application allowed us to determine at the ultrastructural level synapses, presynaptic (axon terminal) and postsynaptic neuronal compartments (soma and dendrites) and establishing the molecular nature of the presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments. Collectively, results obtained by immuno-transmission electron microscopy and CLEM indicate that VTA<sup>glutamate-only</sup> neurons synapse with same frequency on VTA<sup>dopamine</sup> and VTA<sup>glutamate-only</sup> neurons, and while it appears that VTA<sup>glutamate-only</sup> neurons do not establish synapses on dual VTA<sup>dopamine-glutamate</sup> neurons they appear to provide a major input to dual VTA<sup>glutamate-GABA</sup> neurons. In contrast, VTA<sup>GABA-only</sup> neurons synapse mostly on VTA<sup>dopamine</sup> neurons and with lower frequency some VTA<sup>glutamate-only</sup> and VTA<sup>glutamate-GABA</sup> neurons [<a href=\"#ozae044.481-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c9360aca70e84ef4c5b912213f89455dcc15fa75ba9079c529abd93945534335","category":"Environment"}
