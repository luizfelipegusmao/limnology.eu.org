{"title":"Acute Methotrexate Toxicity under Low Dose Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.0658/v3","date":1711965195000,"content":"Objective: We report a case of acute pancytopenia and liver injury after concomitant administration of low-dose methotrexate (MTX), and high-dose esomeprazole and metamizole. Case summary: A 71-year-old patient with chronic systemic idiopathic erosive arthritis was admitted after a pelvic ring fracture. After hospital admission, she received MTX in addition to esomeprazole and metamizole. Subsequent laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. The follow-up clinical examinations were unremarkable, with the exception of sub-febrile temperatures. Further investigations did not detect a definitive etiology. Due to the suspicion of methotrexate-induced hematotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, antagonizing therapy with calcium folinate was administered, after which the blood counts and liver parameters normalized. Discussion: Due to the administration of high-dose metamizole immediately before the administration of low-dose MTX, the pre-existing hematotoxic pharmacodynamic effect of MTX was acutely enhanced by that of metamizole, although folic acid was administered preemptively. In addition, the concomitant administration of high-dose esomeprazole and normal dose torasemide resulted in a pharmacokinetic interaction with MTX by decreasing its renal secretion and elimination, further enhancing the concentration-dependent hematotoxic and hepatotoxic side effects of MTX. Conclusions: The relatively high demand for analgesics in patients with chronic rheumatic diseases already being treated with MTX and proton pump inhibitors necessitates that clinicians consider drug-drug interactions as potential causes of adverse drug reactions after the administration of metamizole or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In this category of patients, it is strongly recommended to switch to analgesics of other classes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"441f61df86b256ea3a67f310f0003b512e57e26b838ab6acccdaab23d8d4c7a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
