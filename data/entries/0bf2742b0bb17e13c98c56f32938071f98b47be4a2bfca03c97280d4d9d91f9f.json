But the role of the combined sCEA and tCEA was scarcely described by now. Methods: 1757 cases of 0~ⅣCRC from January 2006 to January 2016 in our institution were involved. Clinicopathological features and follow up data were collected. 0 stage was combined into 0&amp;Ⅰ stages. SCEA was classified to normal and high(&gt;10ng/ml) and tCEA were classified into three grades (+,++,+++). So combined groups were six (2ⅹ3). ANOVA and Crosstab were used to analyze continuous and counting data, Univariate and multivariate were analyzed by Cox regression. All data were analyzed by SPSS27 and survival curves with number at risk were visualized by R 4.3.1. Results: Gender, age, tumor location, tumor size, blood loss, T stage, differentiation, harvested lymph nodes, positive lymph nodes, chemotherapy, TNM stage and complication have difference between the combined CEA test (all P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0bf2742b0bb17e13c98c56f32938071f98b47be4a2bfca03c97280d4d9d91f9f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
