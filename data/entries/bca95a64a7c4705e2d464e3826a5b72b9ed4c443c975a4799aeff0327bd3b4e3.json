{"title":"m6A Methylation in Regulation of Antiviral Innate Immunity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0853/v1","date":1710410530000,"content":"The epitranscriptomic modification m6A is a prevalent RNA modification that plays a crucial role in the regulation of various aspects of RNA metabolism. It has been found to be involved in a wide range of physiological processes and disease states. Of particular interest is the role of m6A machinery and modifications in viral infections, serving as an evolutionary marker for distinguishing between self and non-self entities. In this review article, we present a comprehensive overview of the epitranscriptomic modification m6A and its implications in the interplay between viruses and their host, focusing on immune responses and viral replication. We outline future research directions that highlight the role of m6A in viral nucleic acid recognition, initiation of antiviral immune responses, and modulation of antiviral signaling pathways. Additionally, we discuss the potential of m6A as a prognostic biomarker and a target for therapeutic interventions in viral infections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bca95a64a7c4705e2d464e3826a5b72b9ed4c443c975a4799aeff0327bd3b4e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
