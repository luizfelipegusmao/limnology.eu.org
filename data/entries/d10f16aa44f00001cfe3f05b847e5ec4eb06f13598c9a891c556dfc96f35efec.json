{"title":"Experimental investigation of 4‐cylinder compression–ignition engine parameters fueled by newly formulated hydrous ethanol–diesel‐emulsified fuel infused with nano‐sized γ‐Al2O3 particles","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14353?af=R","date":1715141849000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The present study tested newly formulated hydrous ethanol–diesel-emulsified fuel infused with nano-sized γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particles on a turbocharged CRDI 4-cylinder stationary diesel engine. W5H5, W5H10, and W10H5 test fuels were inducted into engine cylinders at a fixed engine speed of 2000 rpm. These test fuels significantly improved their physicochemical properties, with an 8.80% increase in gross calorific value and a 6.52% growth in cetane index. W5H10 exhibited a 16.01% increment in brake thermal efficiency and a 22.22% decrement in brake-specific fuel consumption. Also, this fuel reported an 8.64% higher in-cylinder pressure and a 40.71% higher heat release rate. W5H10 test fuel noted a 50% dip in carbon monoxide emissions and an 84.56% lower smoke opacity than diesel. W5H5 fuel reported 33.33% lower unburnt hydrocarbons than diesel at full load. W10H5 fuel observed an 88.46% drop in nitrogen oxide emissions compared with diesel at 10% engine load. The author found W5H10 the most suitable fuel for diesel engines with no modification costs.</p>","author":"Vishal Vasistha","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"d10f16aa44f00001cfe3f05b847e5ec4eb06f13598c9a891c556dfc96f35efec","category":"Environment"}
