{"title":"Development of new edible biodegradable films containing camu-camu and agro-industry residue","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1277/v1","date":1716198727000,"content":"The use of edible films has become a topic of great interest in the food and environmental sectors, due to their potential to prevent food deterioration and their biodegradability. In this context, this study aimed to develop and characterize edible films based on camu-camu residue, gelatin and glycerol, evaluating their solubility, thermal, degradability, antioxidant and water vapor permeability properties of the gelatin matrix. This is the first study incorporating camu-camu into a gelatin and glycerol matrix. The films produced with the incorporation of camu-camu residue proved to be manageable and soluble, with the presence of some non-soluble residues, providing a shine and a well-presented appearance. In the biodegradation results the samples 03 and 04 appeared to degrade the most, being two of the three most affected samples in the triplicate. The films showed degradation modifications from the third day of the experiment. In the germination and plant growth analysis, Sample 04 showed satisfactory development compared to other samples, making it the sample with the best overall result in the analyses. These results demonstrate that the produced materials have potential for food packaging applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a83809891cc9998fa174ce27353c7cefc64f8699afe6800a662034cee761ded","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
