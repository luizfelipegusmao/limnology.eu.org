{"title":"Emerging Gene Therapy Strategies for Type 1 Diabetes: A Review of Potential Treatments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0034/v1","date":1725260037000,"content":"Several studies have shown promising treatments for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) using developing gene therapy methods. This review article focuses on summarizing possible new treatment options and outlining their pros and cons, since there is no cure for T1DM as of yet. New treatments involve islet and stem cell transplantation, genetic vaccination, and immunological precursor cell-mediated therapy. Since most of these methods are still in their early stages, efficacy in human trials of this type of treatment is still largely unknown, however, researchers are hopeful after numerous successes in trials with non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aba14404a98fc5aefacd7fb45b08004e3b7307e9d93424cf9951ec0070a2945e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
