{"title":"396 Effects of allocation timing on cattle performance and forage utilization when swath grazing a sorghum-sudangrass hybrid in eastern Nebraska","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/190/7757193?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Swath, or windrow, grazing is the process of cutting hay, leaving it in windrows, and allowing cattle to graze these windrows in the winter. This grazing system reduces winter feeding costs by mitigating the need to bale and transport hay, while having the potential for increased utilization compared with grazing the forage standing. This study aimed to determine the effect of varying allocation timing on cattle performance and forage utilization. A sorghum-sudangrass hybrid (Sorghum× drummondii) was planted in June 2023, cut in early November, and grazed from mid-November 2023 to mid-January 2024. A 16-ha field was divided based on seeding rate with one-half seeded at the recommended rate of 39.2 kg/ha (REC) and one-half with a double rate of 78.4 kg/ha (DOU). The field was subdivided into a total of 8 paddocks (4 per seeding rate) with either 10 (n = 4) or 11 (n = 4) windrows. Forage was cut and windrows were gathered from a 4.57 m width in the field. Prior to grazing, a 0.30 m length of three swaths in each paddock was sampled to determine initial forage mass. A total of 60 steers [initial body weight (BW) = 240 ± 8.3 kg] were stratified by BW and assigned to one of 8 paddocks (n = 7 or 8 calves) to result in equal BW per swathed area. Allocations were offered in full once-per week (1X) or, one-half of the total forage was allocated twice weekly (2X). Post-graze samples were collected to estimate utilization and allocation amount was adjusted as needed based on visual appraisal of post grazing biomass. Cattle were pulled from the field due to snow cover after a 64-d grazing period. The area grazed was used to calculate the animal unit months/ha (AUM) achieved for each paddock. Pre-grazing forage mass did not differ between allocation timing (<span>P</span> = 0.89) or among seeding rates (<span>P</span> = 0.10; REC = 6,720 ± 545 kg/ha, DOU = 8,534.0 ± 545 kg/ha). There was an allocation timing by seeding rate interaction (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) for forage offered with 1X (10.62 kgּ steer<sup>-1</sup>ּ d<sup>-1</sup>) being offered more (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) than 2X (8.43 kg/steer/d) within REC, but no difference (<span>P</span> = 0.31) in forage offered due to allocation within DOU (8.31 kgּ steer<sup>-1</sup>ּ d<sup>-1</sup>). However, post grazing biomass (<span>P</span> = 0.35) and utilization (59 ± 8%) were not affected by allocation timing (<span>P</span> = 0.48). Average daily gain (ADG) also did not differ (<span>P</span> = 0.93) due to allocation timing (0.20 ± 0.07 kg). Most notably, there was a significant allocation effect (<span>P</span> = 0.05) on AUM/ha with 1X (14.51 ± 1.00) being lesser than 2X (16.82 ± 1.00). However, there was no significant difference (<span>P</span> = 0.30) in forage disappearance (291 ± 61 kg/AUM) due to allocation timing. This indicates that more frequent allocations can lead to increased carrying capacity. Increasing the frequency of allocation is a simple management practice producers can implement when swath grazing sorghum-sudangrass to increase carrying capacity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"1e21f97235ac717812a513e2a9910ebdf34f5b22189edf7616b5a10fa1b47cf8","category":"Environment"}
