{"title":"The effects of nano- and microplastic ingestion on the survivorship and reproduction of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/4/594/7668411?rss=1","date":1715299200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) are pervasive environmental pollutants that are commonly ingested by organisms at different trophic levels. While the effects of MPs on aquatic organisms have been extensively studied, the impacts of MP ingestion on the host fitness of terrestrial organisms, mainly insects, have been relatively unexplored. This study investigates the effects of MP and NP ingestion on the survivorship and reproduction of 2 medically important mosquito species, <span>Aedes aegypti</span> Linnaeus (Diptera: Culicidae) and <span>Aedes albopictus</span> Skuse (Diptera: Culicidae). Larval and pupal survivorship of <span>Ae. albopictus</span> were not significantly affected by particle size or concentration, but there was a reduction of <span>Ae. aegypti</span> pupal survivorship associated with the ingestion of 0.03 µm NPs. In addition, there was little observed impact of 0.03 µm NP and 1.0 µm MP ingestion on adult survivorship, fecundity, and longevity. To further investigate the effects of MP ingestion on mosquito fitness, we also examined the effects of MPs of varying shape, size, and plastic polymer type on <span>Ae. aegypti</span> immature and adult survivorship. The data suggest that the polymer type and shape did not impact <span>Ae. aegypti</span> immature or adult survivorship. These findings highlight that understanding the effects of microplastic ingestion by mosquitoes may be complicated by the size, composition, and amount ingested.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"a1ac349ee631819aafd035648e601edda68b23b7ff1ed5659080c7054d4f05ec","category":"Environment"}
