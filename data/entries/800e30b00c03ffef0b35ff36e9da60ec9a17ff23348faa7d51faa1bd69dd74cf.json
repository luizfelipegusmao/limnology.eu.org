The use of electrons provides certain advantages over the more conventional x-ray diffraction (XRD)-based techniques. Chief among these is the requirement in XRD that the crystals being probed are large, even at synchrotron facilities which provide very small and bright X-ray beams but are rather difficult to access for most research [<a href=\"#ozae044.897-B4\">4</a>]. Electron crystallography carried out in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), on the other hand, can easily extract structural information from nanometer-sized crystals, and the availability of TEMs is higher.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"800e30b00c03ffef0b35ff36e9da60ec9a17ff23348faa7d51faa1bd69dd74cf","category":"Environment"}
