{"title":"Pre-Detection and Pre-Registration Averaging of Full Wave Signals in Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0770/v1","date":1725983864000,"content":"A well known technique to enhance the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of repetitive signals is to average them. The coherent parts of the signal add up constructively while the incoherent parts are averaged out. The prerequisite is that the signals are acquired  under conditions of high repeatability, i.e.\\ the signals must be sufficiently similar. In the present technical note we describe an efficient method for maintaining signal similarity by ensuring spatial and temporal proximity of laser waveform signals obtained by a sensor operated from an airborne platform. The method makes use of a few auxiliary parameters such as laser pulse repetition rate, mirror rotation rate, platform altitude, and flight speed. The method can be extended to be operated in real time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d175c138bfc83c0f3d71b3bb841db82e0d93d3771ed194558b640819458c188a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
