The development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with onboard sensors offers an alternative strategy for crop HI research. In this study, we explored the potential of using low-cost, UAV-based multimodal data for HI estimation using red–green–blue (RGB), multispectral (MS), and thermal infrared (TIR) sensors at 4 growth stages to estimate faba bean (<span>Vicia faba</span> L.) and pea (<span>Pisum sativum</span> L.) HI values within the framework of ensemble learning. The average estimates of RGB (faba bean: coefficient of determination [<span>R</span><sup>2</sup>] = 0.49, normalized root-mean-square error [NRMSE] = 15.78%; pea: <span>R</span><sup>2</sup> = 0.46, NRMSE = 20.08%) and MS (faba bean: <span>R</span><sup>2</sup> = 0.50, NRMSE = 15.16%; pea: <span>R</span><sup>2</sup> = 0.46, NRMSE = 19.43%) were superior to those of TIR (faba bean: <span>R</span><sup>2</sup> = 0.37, NRMSE = 16.47%; pea: <span>R</span><sup>2</sup> = 0.38, NRMSE = 19.71%), and the fusion of multisensor data exhibited a higher estimation accuracy than those obtained using each sensor individually. Ensemble Bayesian model averaging provided the most accurate estimations (faba bean: <span>R</span><sup>2</sup> = 0.64, NRMSE = 13.76%; pea: <span>R</span><sup>2</sup> = 0.74, NRMSE = 15.20%) for whole growth stage, and the estimation accuracy improved with advancing growth stage. These results indicate that the combination of low-cost, UAV-based multimodal data and machine learning algorithms can be used to estimate crop HI reliably, therefore highlighting a promising strategy and providing valuable insights for high spatial precision in agriculture, which can help breeders make early and efficient decisions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"da4444567b5d63a40d1c7fe7082aec92c24c331feefc00a8a4ef7d341a4da576","category":"Environment"}
