{"title":"The Metameric Echinoderm","link":"https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/doi/10.1093/iob/obae005/7617695?rss=1","date":1709251200000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>Animal phyla are distinguished by their body plans, the ways in which their bodies are organized. A distinction is made, for example, among phyla with bodies of many segments (metameric; e.g., annelids, arthropods, and chordates), others with completely unsegmented bodies (americ; e.g., flatworms and mollusks), and a few phyla with bodies of 2 or 3 regions (oligomeric; e.g., echinoderms and hemichordates). The conventional view of echinoderms as oligomeric coelomates adequately considers early development, but it fails to recognize the metameric body plan that develops in the juvenile rudiment and progresses during indeterminate adult growth. As in the 3 phyla traditionally viewed to be metameric (annelids, arthropods, and chordates), metamery, or metamerism, in echinoderms occurs by (1) subterminal budding of (2) serially repeated components of (3) mesodermal origin. A major difference in most echinoderms is that metamery is expressed along multiple body axes, usually 5. The view of a metameric echinoderm might invite new discussions of metazoan body plans and new approaches to the study of morphogenesis, particularly in comparative treatments with annelids, arthropods, and chordates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Organismal Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ad96bcf7a80ab7e3a1a88c34298d761f9695964c0badbbef4e1166baa6580fcc","entryHash":"183846d319459c3dd3e7183b31dd6c5e74fbd3069a97eaf5627c2cf0de19ee88","category":"Environment"}
