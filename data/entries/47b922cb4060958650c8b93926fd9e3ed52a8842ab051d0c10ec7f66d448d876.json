However, the majority of older adults are not sufficiently physically active and interventions are needed to change their behaviors. Familial or intergenerational contact has been positively linked to health and well-being in older adults. Therefore, this study aimed to i) establish acceptability and test the functionality and useability of a novel technology-driven intergenerational intervention targeting physical activity and age stereotypes, and ii) identify any potential issues with recruitment and retention. Four familial dyads (adult ≥ 65 and child 7–11 years) engaged with the intervention. Working collaboratively during a four-week trial, they combined daily step-counts (acquired via any activity of their choice, using PA trackers) to complete a virtual walk route using online platform <i>World Walking</i>. Thematic analysis of three post-intervention focus groups (one older adult; one child; one additional parental cohort) identified eight subthemes: Engagement; Provision of a Positive Experience; Participant Stimuli; Generated Outcomes; Operationality; Limitations; Mediators; Facilitators, and Perceptions. Participants enjoyed and successfully engaged with the intervention; when designing behaviour change interventions for older adults, flexibility within pre-established routines, individual choice, and avoiding rigidly imposed structures, is important. Strategies to challenge negative perceptions of older adults’ engagement with technology and PA should be integrated into recruitment processes.","author":"Rachel L.
