{"title":"Series Production Data Set for 5-Axis CNC Milling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1425/v1","date":1711350015000,"content":"The described data set contains features from the machine control of a five-axis milling machine. The features were recorded during thirteen series productions. Each series production includes a changeover process in which the machine was set up for the production of a different product. In addition to the timestamps and the twenty recorded features derived from Numerical Control (NC) control variables, the data set also contains labels for the different production phases. For this purpose, up to 23 phases were assigned, which are based on a generalized milling process. The data set consists of thirteen .csv files, each representing a series production. The data set was recorded in a production company in the contract manufacturing sector for components with real series orders in ongoing industrial production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1062a82a2ebdb15bfda092a4e3ece7c01c81ebbbd0d9e30fd7e169a21d399be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
