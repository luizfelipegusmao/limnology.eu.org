{"title":"The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Personalized Medicine through Advanced Imaging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1168/v2","date":1724321815000,"content":"This paper discusses the application of artificial intelligence in imaging omics, especially in cancer research. Imaging omics enables detailed analysis of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of tumours through high-throughput extraction of quantitative features from medical images such as MRI, PET, and CT. This paper focuses on applying PARKS systems to automate the recognition, segmentation, and extraction of image features, significantly enhancing the capabilities of clinical decision support systems (CDSS). The future direction is to establish a robust network infrastructure for radiology Medication-led Health care (RLHC) to facilitate the development and application of personalised treatment protocols, and to improve diagnostic accuracy, prognosis assessment, and treatment recommendations by uploading quantitative image features to a shared database and comparing them with historical images.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1c21f105763944c5171fd42e3e34a08b2dbb507322c62b62d7f97a212fbf8d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
