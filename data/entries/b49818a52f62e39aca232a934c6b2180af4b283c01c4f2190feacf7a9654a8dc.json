{"title":"Antimicrobial resistance and AmpC production in ESBL-producing <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> and <i>Klebsiella quasipneumoniae</i>: A retrospective study in Japanese clinical isolates","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303353","date":1715695200000,"content":"<p>by Naoki Watanabe, Tomohisa Watari, Yoshihito Otsuka, Masahiko Ito, Kazufumi Yamagata, Miyuki Fujioka</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>The study of <i>Klebsiella quasipneumoniae</i>, <i>Klebsiella variicola</i>, and AmpC production in extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase (ESBL)-producing <i>Klebsiella</i> in Japan is limited, and existing data are insufficient. This study aims to characterize <i>Klebsiella</i> species, determine AmpC production rates, and analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns in ESBL-producing <i>Klebsiella</i> isolates in Japan.</p> Methods <p>A total of 139 clinical isolates of ESBL-producing <i>Klebsiella</i> were collected in Japan, along with their corresponding antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. The isolates were identified using a web-based tool. ESBL genes within the isolates were identified using multiplex PCR. Screening for AmpC-producing isolates was performed using cefoxitin disks, followed by multiplex PCR to detect the presence of AmpC genes. Antimicrobial resistance patterns were analyzed across the predominant ESBL genotypes.</p> Results <p>The web-based tool identified 135 isolates (97.1%) as <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> and 4 (2.9%) as <i>K</i>. <i>quasipneumoniae</i> subsp. <i>similipneumoniae</i>, with no instances of <i>K</i>. <i>variicola</i> detected. Among <i>K</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i>, the CTX-M-1 group emerged as the predominant genotype (83/135, 61.5%), followed by <i>K</i>. <i>quasipneumoniae</i> subsp. <i>similipneumoniae</i> (3/4, 75.0%). The CTX-M-9 group was the second most prevalent genotype in <i>K</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i> (45/135, 33.3%). The high resistance rates were observed for quinolones (ranging from 46.7% to 63.0%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (78.5%). The CTX-M-1 group exhibited higher resistance to ciprofloxacin (66/83, 79.5%) compared to the CTX-M-9 group (18/45, 40.0%), a trend also observed for levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Among the 16 isolates that tested positive during AmpC screening, only one <i>K</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i> isolates (0.7%) were confirmed to carry the AmpC gene.</p> Conclusion <p><i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> with the CTX-M-1 group is the most common ESBL-producing <i>Klebsiella</i> in Japan and showed a low proportion of AmpC production. These isolates are resistant to quinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, highlighting the challenge of managing this pathogen. The findings underscore the importance of broader research and continuous monitoring to address the resistance patterns of ESBL-producing <i>Klebsiella</i>.</p>","author":"Naoki Watanabe","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b49818a52f62e39aca232a934c6b2180af4b283c01c4f2190feacf7a9654a8dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
