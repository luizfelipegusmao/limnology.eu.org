{"title":"The Role of Pulmonary Collectins, Surfactant Protein A (SP-A) and Surfactant Protein D (SP-D) in Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2179/v1","date":1722057589000,"content":"Surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D) belong to the collectin subfamily of C-type oligomeric lectins. They are pattern-recognition molecules (PRM), able to recognise pathogen- or dan-ger-associated molecular patterns (PAMP, DAMP) in the presence of Ca2+ cations. That property enables opsonisation or agglutination of non-self or altered/abnormal self-cells, and contributes to their clearance.  Like other collectins, SP-A and SP-D are characterised by the presence of four distinct domains: a cysteine-rich domain (at N-terminus), a collagen-like region, an α-helical neck domain and a globular carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) (at C-terminus). Pulmonary sur-factant is a lipoprotein complex, preventing alveolar collapse by reducing surface tension at the air-liquid interface. SP-A and SP-D, produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells, and Clara cells, are not only pattern-recognition molecules but also contribute to the surfactant structure and homeo-stasis. Moreover, they are expressed in a variety of extrapulmonary sites where they are involved in local immunity. The term “cancer” includes a variety of diseases: tumours start from uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in any tissue which may further spread to other sites of the body. Many cancers are incurable, difficult to diagnose and often fatal. This short review summarises anti- and pro-tumourigenic associations of SP-A and SP-D as well as perspectives of their usefulness in cancer diagnosis and therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30a97d5104fce36b112c82e752d1273b366f3ffdf0e6976f5ee0bd6005ebe395","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
