{"title":"Okra extract alleviates lipopolysaccharide‐induced inflammation response through the regulation of bile acids, the receptor‐mediated pathway, and gut microbiota","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13571?af=R","date":1715947152000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Okra contains flavonoids and vitamin C as antioxidants and it contains polysaccharides as immunomodulators. Flavonoids regulate the inflammatory response in mice and may be related to gut microbiota. This study therefore aimed to investigate the impact of okra extract (OE) on inflammation in mice and to elucidate its underlying mechanism.</p>\n<h2>METHOD</h2>\n<p>Forty male Kunming (KM) mice were categorized into four groups: the control (CON) group, the lipopolysaccharide stimulation (LPS) group, the 5 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> OE intervention (LPS + OE) group, and the 5 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> OE supplementation plus mixed antibiotics (LPS + OE + ABX) group.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that, compared with the OE group, the expression of inflammatory signaling pathway genes was upregulated and gut barrier genes were inhibited in the OE + ABX group. The <i>Fxr</i> receptor was activated and the abundance of <i>Akkermansia</i> was increased after OE supplementation, whereas the effect was reversed in the OE + ABX group. Meanwhile, <i>Fxr</i> was correlated positively with <i>Akkermansia</i>.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The OE supplementation alleviated the inflammatory response in mice under LPS stimulation, accompanied by changes in gut microbiota and bile acid receptors, whereas the addition of antibiotics caused a disturbance to the gut microbiota in the OE group, thus reducing the effect of OE in alleviating the inflammatory response. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Shanshan Zhou, \nLi Yang, \nXia Qiu, \nBohui Li, \nLiang Hu, \nZizhong Tang, \nHua Li, \nShanshan Li, \nZhengfeng Fang, \nHong Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"fa4212c23f31df504c21fcdf2df2f0ccaa092ad76eaef2569485b841277598d3","category":"Environment"}
