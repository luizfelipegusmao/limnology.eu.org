Recent advancements in precision livestock management, utilizing computer vision and machine learning technologies, have paved the way for automated and precise solutions in these areas. The objective of this study is to investigate the application of computer vision and machine learning for animal identification and behavioral estrus detection in dairy cows housed in freestall settings, employing a two-layered algorithmic approach. The research was conducted at the Joe Bearden Dairy Research Center, where a total of 10 lactating Holstein-Friesian cows were assessed across a 7-d trial period. For synchronization efforts, cows were provided a single injection of Prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub> at trial initiation with expected estrus behaviors to be exhibited within the following 56 h. Continuous video was captured in 4k resolution using a five-camera closed caption media recording system strategically placed in the pen corners and over the feed bunk alleyway to capture multiple perspectives. Video data extrapolated into frames and manual annotation was utilized to generate the machine learning algorithm’s training data. Frames were randomly selected from a scattering of 56 h of video across all five camera viewpoints and down sampled to 384 x 640 p for both layers. A two-layer approach was employed utilizing an algorithm for each aspect of the study with the first model detecting the behavior, and the second model using the detected region of interest to identify specific cows. The first layer was trained on 682 frames and validated against 123 manually annotated frames. The second layer was trained on 102 frames and validated against 16 frames manually annotated for individual animals. Results demonstrated that the model used for mounting behavior identification has high precision (0.819) and recall (0.89), achieving a 0.926 mAP at an IoU of 0.5. This model achieved an F1 score of 0.86 at a confidence threshold of 0.268. The results demonstrated that the model used for individual animal identification across different classes achieved high precision (0.861) and recall (0.842), with a mAP of 0.897 at an IoU of 0.5. The F1 score for all classes was 0.89 at a confidence threshold of 0.788. In conclusion, these promising findings underscore the potential of computer vision and machine learning technologies to revolutionize dairy cow management practices. This innovative approach not only has potential to enhance operational efficiency, but also contributes significantly to improved reproductive management, thereby advancing precision and productivity in dairy operations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"b161264103c0d24390d68e024db7bd4ab1644fb7893fa7bb4bdc9466077dfc96","category":"Environment"}
