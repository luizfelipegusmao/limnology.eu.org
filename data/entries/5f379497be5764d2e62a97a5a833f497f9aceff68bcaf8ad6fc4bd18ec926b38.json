{"title":"On the Conflagrations of Marxist Thought and a Generalised View of Ideology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1150/v1","date":1715917203000,"content":"This article is an early draft on a proposed alternative to the current Marxist mode of thought; one that seeks to reject the generally ill-conceived and dogmatic proposals formulated by Marx in favour of another predicated on the more unwavering emotional ideals of the philosophy that preceded it.   It eliminates that dogmatic mode in favour of a wholly social society, one that is founded upon the Marxist superstructure and intends hence to capture that humanity and re-form particularly economic principles that are used to construct the utopia into what is instead an entirely socially idealised frame of living.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f379497be5764d2e62a97a5a833f497f9aceff68bcaf8ad6fc4bd18ec926b38","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
