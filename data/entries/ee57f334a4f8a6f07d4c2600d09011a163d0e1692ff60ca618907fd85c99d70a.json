{"title":"Colors of Transcultural Nursing. Management of Problems Experienced by Nurses in the Care of Foreign Persons in Italy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0141/v1","date":1717496517000,"content":"The complexity of the current social context leads healthcare professionals to deal daily with users who are increasingly varied in terms of culture, language and religion. Transcultural nursing is a practical discipline that aims to respond to the patient's need for assistance, but must not ignore the study and knowledge of the patient, with his history, his culture, but also with his expectations, in order to respond to his care needs with effectiveness, efficiency, adequacy and respect. This work originates from the desire to investigate the \"state of health\" of the relationship between nurses/health workers and migrant patients, researching the variables that improve or worsen it. It aims to investigate how diversity affects the care provided to migrant people, highlighting the difficulties felt by nurses and define the areas of possible care improvements. It seems possible to affirm that the nurses and health workers interviewed still respond to the problem of migrant patients with a strong spirit of participation and availability, without, however, this motivational charge being accompanied by a widespread \"nursing\" awareness of the problem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee57f334a4f8a6f07d4c2600d09011a163d0e1692ff60ca618907fd85c99d70a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
