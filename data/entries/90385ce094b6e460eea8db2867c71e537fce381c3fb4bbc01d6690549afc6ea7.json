{"title":"Finding a Research Paper Which Meaningfully Averages Unbounded Sets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0361/v1","date":1725441969000,"content":"Suppose n ∈ N. We wish to meaningfully average ‘sophisticated’ unbounded sets (i.e., sets with positive n-d Hausdorff measure, in any n-d box of the n-d plane, where the measures don’t equal the area of the boxes). We do this by taking the most generalized, satisfying extension of the expected value, w.r.t the Hausdorff measure in its dimension, on bounded sets which takes finite values only. As of now, I’m unable to solve this due to limited knowledge of advanced math and most people are too busy to help. Therefore, I’m wondering if anyone knows a research paper which solves my doubts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90385ce094b6e460eea8db2867c71e537fce381c3fb4bbc01d6690549afc6ea7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
