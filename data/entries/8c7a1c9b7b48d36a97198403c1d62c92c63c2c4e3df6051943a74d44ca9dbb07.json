{"title":"Effect of buffer pH on methane production and fermentation characteristics of three forages tested in vitro","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13610?af=R","date":1725860041000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Low rumen pH is proposed to be a major mechanism for low methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions from sheep fed forage rape. However, it is difficult to separate this from other <i>in vivo</i> factors, such as rumen passage rate. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of pH alone on CH<sub>4</sub> production <i>in vitro</i> using different pH buffers. Ryegrass, white clover and forage rape were incubated <i>in vitro</i> using three different incubation buffers with starting pH values of 5.5, 6.2 and 6.8.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Decreasing pH reduced overall <i>in vitro</i> CH<sub>4</sub> emission relative to fermented hexoses (CH<sub>4</sub>/FHex) by up to 54% and overall fermentation by 40%. pH also changed fermentation profiles where the acetate + butyrate to propionate + valerate ratio decreased when pH decreased. Within the three forages, forage rape led to the lowest CH<sub>4</sub>/FHex, but only in pH 5.5 and 6.2 buffer, and this was enhanced when the pH fell below 6.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Reducing pH <i>in vitro</i> decreased CH<sub>4</sub> production and overall fermentation across all forages. The lower pH reached by forage rape compared to ryegrass and white clover appears to drive the lower CH<sub>4</sub> production relative to the extent of fermentation from forage rape compared to the other forages. © 2024 The Author(s).
