{"title":"Dynamics of Cellulose Degradation by Soil Microorganisms from Two Contrasting Soil Types","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1308/v1","date":1721112072000,"content":"The search for active cellulolytic consortia among soil microorganisms is of significant applied interest, while the dynamics of the formation of such communities remain insufficiently studied. To gain insight into the formation of an active cellulolytic community, the experiment was designed to study the colonization of a sterile substrate (cellulose) by microorganisms from two soil types: sod-podzolic and chernozem. To achieve this, the substrate was placed in the soil and incubated for six months. To assess microbiome dynamics, the experiment employed sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS2 amplicon libraries at four-time points. It was demonstrated that from the second month of the experiment, the prokaryotic component of the communities reached a state of stability, with a community composition that was specific to each soil type. The results demonstrated that there was no relationship between changes in community diversity and soil respiration. There also was no significant shift in community diversity throughout the chronosequence. Furthermore, the taxonomic composition of the community shifted towards a decrease in the proportion of Proteobacteria and an increase in representatives of the Bacteroidota, Bacillota, and Verrucomicrobiota phyla. The network analysis of the community demonstrated that, in contrast to sod-podzolic soil, chernozem is distinguished by a higher modularity, with the formation of taxon-specific groups of microorganisms at each stage of the chronoseries. These differences are attributed to alterations in the eukaryotic component of the community, particularly in the prevalence of nematodes and predatory fungi, which in turn influenced the cellulolytic community.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b62bcd2bb179c7917ea115aff707557c8a3f6111b9b5a83a6c8fc5cd7b66e887","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
