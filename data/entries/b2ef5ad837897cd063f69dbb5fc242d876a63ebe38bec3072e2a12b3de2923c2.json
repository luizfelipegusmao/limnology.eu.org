{"title":"ROS and RNS production, subcellular localization, and signaling triggered by immunogenic danger signals","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/15/4512/7394976?rss=1","date":1699488000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants continuously monitor the environment to detect changing conditions and to properly respond, avoiding deleterious effects on their fitness and survival. An enormous number of cell surface and intracellular immune receptors are deployed to perceive danger signals associated with microbial infections. Ligand binding by cognate receptors represents the first essential event in triggering plant immunity and determining the outcome of the tissue invasion attempt. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) are secondary messengers rapidly produced in different subcellular localizations upon the perception of immunogenic signals. Danger signal transduction inside the plant cells involves cytoskeletal rearrangements as well as several organelles and interactions between them to activate key immune signaling modules. Such immune processes depend on ROS and RNS accumulation, highlighting their role as key regulators in the execution of the immune cellular program. In fact, ROS and RNS are synergic and interdependent intracellular signals required for decoding danger signals and for the modulation of defense-related responses. Here we summarize current knowledge on ROS/RNS production, compartmentalization, and signaling in plant cells that have perceived immunogenic danger signals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"b2ef5ad837897cd063f69dbb5fc242d876a63ebe38bec3072e2a12b3de2923c2","category":"Environment"}
