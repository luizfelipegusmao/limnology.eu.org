{"title":"Methotrexate and Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors Independently Decrease Neutralizing Antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination: Updated Results from the SUCCEED Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1998/v1","date":1724834369000,"content":"Objective: SARS-CoV-2 remains the third most common cause of death in North America. We studied methotrexate and tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) effects on neutralization responses post-COVID vaccination, in immune-mediated inflammatory disease(IMID).\nMethods: Prospective data and sera on adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and systemic lupus (SLE) were collected at 6 academic centres in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec between 2022-2023. Sera from two time points were evaluated for each subject. Neutralization studies were divided between 5 laboratories, and each labâ€™s results analyzed separately using multivariate generalized logit models (ordinal outcomes: absent, low, medium, and high neutralization). Odds ratios (ORs) for methotrexate and TNFi effects were adjusted for demographics, IMID, other biologics and immunosuppressives, prednisone, COVID vaccinations (number/type), and infections in the 6 months prior to sample. Adjusted ORs for methotrexate and TNFi were then pooled in random-effects meta-analyses (separately for ancestral, and Omicron BA1 and BA5 strains).\nResults: Of 479 individuals (958 samples), 292 (61%) were IBD, 141 (29.4%) RA, and the remainder PsA, SpA and SLE. Mean age was 57 (62.2 % female). For both individual labs and the meta-analyses, adjusted ORs suggested independent negative effects of TNFi and methotrexate on neutralization. The meta-analysis adjusted ORs for TNFi were 0.56 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.39, 0.81) for the ancestral strain and 0.56 (95% CI 0.39, 0.81) for BA5. The meta-analysis adjusted OR for methotrexate was 0.39 (95% CI 0.19, 0.76) for BA1.\nConclusions: SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in vaccinated IMID was diminished independently by TNFi and methotrexate. As SARS-CoV-2 circulation continues, ongoing vigilance regarding optimized vaccination is required.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"985aa1afd485649db334ece6fdbddcfa65d38ed099900856d0e0d7d2e70b26c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
