{"title":"Co-production of research derived actionable resources for the delivery of Individual Service Funds (EQUALD study): Protocol","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306522","date":1720015200000,"content":"<p>by Alice Dunning, Clare Tarling, Liz Croot</p>\r\n\r\nAdults with a learning disability who receive social care are legally entitled to a personal budget. Personal budgets were introduced to promote choice and control in support. Individual Service Funds were introduced as a flexible way that personal budgets can be managed by a provider while maintaining choice and control for the individual. Individual Service Funds have been shown to improve quality of life for individuals and efficiency in support. Despite this, only 20% of local authorities offer them to adults with a learning disability, demonstrating the need for resources to be developed to support their delivery. This protocol described a co-production study with key stakeholders to develop and refine Individual Service Fund resources. Our primary aim is to co-produce two actionable resources: to support development, delivery, consistency, and sustained provision of ISFs; and to support uptake and optimal use of ISFs by recipients. We also aim to user-test and evaluate these resources with three Local Authorities. The result of this study will be two resources that will support the uptake of Individual Service Funds for adults with a learning disability that will be freely available online.","author":"Alice Dunning","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"21468a7c24acfd6e60434d8927395b50cca7f7474ff7b1a0c43331d7c3088392","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
