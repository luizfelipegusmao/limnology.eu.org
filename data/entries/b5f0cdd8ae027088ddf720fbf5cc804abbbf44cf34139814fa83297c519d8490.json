Five diets were prepared and supplemented with 0 mg/kg (V0), 3 mg/kg (V1), 5 mg/kg (V2), 10 mg/kg (V3) and 15 mg/kg (V4) folic acid. The final body weight, weight gain rate and specific growth rate in the V1, V2 and V3 groups were significantly higher than in the V0 group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), while the feed conversion rate in these groups was significantly lower than in the V0 group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and optimal dietary folic acid supplemented amount was estimated to be 7 mg/kg. The <i>c-myc</i>, <i>MAPK</i>-7 and <i>FGFR</i>-1 gene expression levels in the V1, V2 and V3 groups were significantly higher than in the V0 group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In addition, the body wall folate content in the folic acid supplemented group was significantly higher than in the V0 group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the activities of lipase, pepsin and α-amylase in the V2 and/or V3 groups were significantly higher than in other groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The activities of alkaline phosphatase and lysozyme in the V2 group were significantly higher than in the V0 group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and the activity of acid phosphatase in the folic acid supplemented group was significantly higher than the V0 group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). With dietary folic acid increasing, the total superoxide dismutase, catalase and total superoxide dismutase activities in V2 and/or V3 groups were significantly higher than in the V0 group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the current results demonstrated the significant progress of dietary supplementation with folic acid on the growth and physiological response of juvenile sea cucumbers.</p>","author":"Lidong Shi, \nHaojie Zhai, \nLibo Wei, \nFanshuang Zeng, \nTongjun Ren, \nYuzhe Han","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"b5f0cdd8ae027088ddf720fbf5cc804abbbf44cf34139814fa83297c519d8490","category":"Environment"}
