In this study, an evaluation system of rural domestic sewage treatment was established based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model and a county in Zhejiang Province was selected as an example for empirical analysis. According to the results, planning issues have the greatest impact on rural sewage treatment, accounting for 56.8%, while equipment issues, personnel issues and management issues account for 27.3%, 9.7% and 6.2%, respectively. Also, the results demonstrated that terminal planning, location selection, treatment process selection and construction design should be paid attention to among the 11 secondary indicators. The establishment of the evaluation system clarifies the different influencing factors and weights during the operation of the completed facilities, which is conducive to the scientific and effective management of sewage treatment.</p>","author":"Peng Chen, \nZhiyuan Yu, \nYouhua Deng, \nShanghui Li, \nDongfeng Zhu, \nTao Zhang, \nDong Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"ac8943647e682874656007bf9c26c1ad58f33215a1dfedd82ae9d42b79c71df3","category":"Environment"}
