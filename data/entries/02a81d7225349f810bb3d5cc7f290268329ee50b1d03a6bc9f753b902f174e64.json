{"title":"Nuclear Phospholipids and Signaling: An Update of the Story","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1779/v1","date":1711632555000,"content":"In the last three decades the presence of phospholipids in the nucleus has been shown and thoroughly investigated. A great interest raised about nuclear inositol lipids mainly because of their role in signalling acting. Here we review the main issues of nuclear phospholipid localization and the role of nuclear inositol lipids and their related enzymes in cellular signaling both in physiological and pathological conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02a81d7225349f810bb3d5cc7f290268329ee50b1d03a6bc9f753b902f174e64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
