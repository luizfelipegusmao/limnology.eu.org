In particular, untangling the pathophysiology of multifactorial health conditions such as the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) could benefit from simultaneous consideration of several omics levels. However, taking full advantage of multi-omics data requires the adoption of suitable new tools. Multi-view learning, a machine learning technique that natively joins together heterogeneous data, is a natural source for such methods. Here we present a new approach to variable selection in unsupervised multi-view learning by applying stability selection to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We apply our method, StabilityCCA, to simulated and real multi-omics data, and demonstrate its ability to find relevant variables and improve the stability of variable selection. In a case study on an IBD microbiome data set, we link together metagenomics and metabolomics, revealing a connection between their joint structure and the disease, and identifying potential biomarkers. Our results showcase the usefulness of multi-view learning in multi-omics analysis and demonstrate StabilityCCA as a powerful tool for biomarker discovery.","author":"Taneli Pusa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3de76cbde96f4030bcee56d57894c4fd66af0a56b748a524a06d4b55f31a6a89","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
