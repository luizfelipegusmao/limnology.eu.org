{"title":"Practical Cyber Threat and OSINT Analysis based on Implementation of CTI Sharing Platform","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0277/v1","date":1714980899000,"content":"Cybercrime Threat Intelligence (CTI) allows us to change our actions from reactive to proactive in the fight against threat actors, and to make more informed, data-driven security decisions. Thus this study proposes the practical implementation of CTI in the Arab world. This study focuses on strengthening CTI by integrating Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and collecting realistic security alerts from honeypot systems and open source intelligence. The collected data is stored in the Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP), an open source platform that allows users to create and share IoCs with other organizations while staying informed about new threats. It features an intuitive interface for data analysis and threat identification, facilitating sharing, storage, and correlation of IoCs. Therefore, we leveraged MISP to generate IoCs based on the collected data and analyzed the results to identify potential cyber threats. The implemented platform aims to provide organizations with actionable information to prevent, detect and respond to cybercrime. This study presents a practical approach to strengthening CTI in the Arab world and provides an opportunity to strengthen the regionâ€™s security posture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ddc5880e1d0a1d641be112cbc91c08e828077258cb21042d558ab0626dc0d16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
