{"title":"Complexity, Artificial Life, and Artificial Intelligence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1826/v1","date":1714281113000,"content":"The scientific fields of complexity, artificial life (ALife), and artificial intelligence (A.I.) share several commonalities: historic, conceptual, methodological, and philosophical. It was possible to develop them only because of information technology, while their origins can be traced back to cybernetics. In this perspective, I'll revise the expectations and limitations of these fields, some of which have their roots in the limits of formal systems. I will use interactions, self-organization, emergence, and balance to compare different aspects of complexity, ALife, and A.I. The paper poses more questions than answers, but hopefully it will be useful to align efforts in these fields towards overcoming --- or accepting --- their limits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"358103a9cf7842ee0f1bf03cd481e91fa9f3ccd5f47711ee662aed70ac0a78c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
