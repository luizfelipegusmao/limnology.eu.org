{"title":"Machine Learning Discoveries of Interleukin-X Synergy in ETC-1922159 Treated Colorectal Cancer Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1353/v1","date":1726636399000,"content":"Often, in biology, we are faced with the problem of exploring relevant unknown biological hypotheses in the form of myriads of combinations of factors/genes/proteins that might be affecting the pathway under certain conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells treated with ETC-1922159, many genes were found up and down regu- lated, individually. A recently developed search engine ranked combinations of Inter- leukin (IL)-X (X, a particular gene/protein) at 2nd order level after drug administration. These rankings reveal which IL-X combinations might be working synergistically in CRC. If found true, oncologists can further test the combination of interest in wet lab and determine the mechanism of functioning between the IL and X. In this research work, we cover combinations of IL with nuclear factor κ B (NFκB), Potassium ion channel sub- family members (KCN), mucin (MUC), TP53, STAT, TNF receptor as- sociated factor (TRAF), STEAP4 metalloreductase, STEAP3 metalloreductase, ATP- binding cassette (ABC) transporters and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b69335e5c486fdea00e8e39e0d9a46f9e743d804d9f1304065e4d64c74030ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
