Recently, the importance of reducing and breaking up sedentary behaviour has become recognized. This review aimed to summarize and synthesize the effectiveness of interventions in reducing and/or breaking up sedentary behaviour and cardiometabolic biomarkers in adults with T2D. A study protocol was preregistered on PROSPERO (CRD42022357281) and a database search (PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library) was conducted on 16/09/2022 and updated on 03/01/2024. This review followed PRISMA guidelines and study quality was assessed with the Cochrane risk of Bias Tools. Twenty-eight articles were included in the review. The meta-analysis of short-term (Range: 3 hours– 4 days) sedentary behaviour interventions found significant improvement in continuous interstitial glucose measured for 24 hours after the sedentary behaviour intervention compared to control (SMD:-0.819,95%CI:-1.255,-0.383,p&lt;0.001). Similarly, there was a significant improvement in postprandial interstitial glucose after the sedentary behaviour intervention compared to control (SMD:-0.347,95%CI:-0.584,-0.110,p = 0.004). Ten out of eleven longer-term (Range: 5 weeks– 3 years) sedentary behaviour interventions improved at least one measure of sedentary behaviour compared to control. Eight out of eight longer-term sedentary behaviour interventions improved at least one cardiometabolic biomarker compared to control. Reducing sedentary behaviour, independent of physical activity, can improve glycemic control in adults with T2D. Further, sedentary behaviour may be a feasible/ sustainable behaviour change.","author":"Siobhan Smith","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ee0a685cb5c9a542f300e02ef82d53b8c843f4757841cc48dff7f718bfd364ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
