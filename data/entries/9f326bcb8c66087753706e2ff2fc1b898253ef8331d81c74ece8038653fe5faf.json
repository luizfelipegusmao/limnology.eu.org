{"title":"Evaluation of the Moisturizing Power of Coconut Water (Cocos nucifera L.) on Physical Persons","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0862/v1","date":1728869442000,"content":"Coconut water, the clear liquid extracted from coconuts (Cocos nucifera L.), is a refreshing tropical drink with a booming market. However, despite its success, its moisturising properties remain controversial. The aim of this research is to inform consumers about the hydrating power of coconut water sold on the streets of Abidjan. To achieve this objective, a survey of coconut water consumption was carried out followed by in-vitro experiments using biochemical, physicochemical and functional analyses. The survey revealed that coconut water was well known to consumers (100%) for its fortifying (33.33%), digestive (29.33%) and refreshing (28.34%) properties. Coconut water contained carbohydrates (4.5±0.0%), dry matter (5.2±0.0070%), energy (19.92±0.0%) and ash (0.44±0.0%). Coconut water also contained minerals, notably sodium (220.45±0.4949 mg), potassium (1591.02±6.10 mg) and phosphorus (276.1±10.18 mg). In other hand, the volume of urine after consumption of coconut water was lower than that after consumption of mineral water, with values falling from 138.5 mL (T1) to 66.67 mL (T4) and then from 41.67 mL (T1) to 36.33 mL (T4) for coconut water. Coconut water is diuretic and therefore cleanses the bladder. Coconut water seems to have greater hydrating power than mineral water.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f326bcb8c66087753706e2ff2fc1b898253ef8331d81c74ece8038653fe5faf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
