{"title":"Contribution of gas concentration and transfer velocity to CO2 flux variability in northern lakes","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12528?af=R","date":1713603156000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> flux (FCO2) from lakes to the atmosphere is a large component of the global carbon cycle and depends on the air–water CO<sub>2</sub> concentration gradient (ΔCO<sub>2</sub>) and the gas transfer velocity (<i>k</i>). Both ΔCO<sub>2</sub> and <i>k</i> can vary on multiple timescales and understanding their contributions to FCO2 is important for explaining variability in fluxes and developing optimal sampling designs. We measured FCO2 and ΔCO<sub>2</sub> and derived <i>k</i> for one full ice-free period in 18 lakes using floating chambers and estimated the contributions of ΔCO<sub>2</sub> and <i>k</i> to FCO2 variability. Generally, <i>k</i> contributed more than ΔCO<sub>2</sub> to short-term (1–9 d) FCO2 variability. With increased temporal period, the contribution of <i>k</i> to FCO2 variability decreased, and in some lakes resulted in ΔCO<sub>2</sub> contributing more than <i>k</i> to FCO2 variability over the full ice-free period. Increased contribution of ΔCO<sub>2</sub> to FCO2 variability over time occurred across all lakes but was most apparent in large-volume southern-boreal lakes and in deeper (&gt; 2 m) parts of lakes, whereas <i>k</i> was linked to FCO2 variability in shallow waters. Accordingly, knowing the variability of both <i>k</i> and ΔCO<sub>2</sub> over time and space is needed for accurate modeling of FCO2 from these variables. We conclude that priority in FCO2 assessments should be given to direct measurements of FCO2 at multiple sites when possible, or otherwise from spatially distributed measurements of ΔCO<sub>2</sub> combined with <i>k</i>-models that incorporate spatial variability of lake thermal structure and meteorology.</p>","author":"David Rudberg, \nJonathan Schenk, \nGustav Pajala, \nHenrique Sawakuchi, \nAnna Sieczko, \nIngrid Sundgren, \nNguyen Thanh Duc, \nJan Karlsson, \nSally MacIntyre, \nJohn Melack, \nDavid Bastviken","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"483837404a651916bc0fc2a986656bb768431b5eda97cb95890947a6f32d3b51","entryHash":"b9f53cc8af289a37b0a24be28f90332b5fa419c857806742977d32de3ab74382","category":"Environment"}
