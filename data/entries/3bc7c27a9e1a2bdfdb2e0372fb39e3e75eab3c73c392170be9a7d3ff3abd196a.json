{"title":"On the Importance of Solar Radiation and Shading for the AAR Prediction of Concrete Arch Dams","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1775/v1","date":1719321225000,"content":"The environmental conditions to which dams are exposed play a major role in dictating the progression and manifestation of the alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR). However, in the numerical thermal-mechanical simulation of AAR affected dams, the solar radiation and its associated shadow effects have received little attention. The spatiotemporal distribution of the solar radiation incidence on the dam surfaces has often been addressed in a simplified way or has just been neglected. Yet, far less attention has been given to shadows cast by the damâ€™s own geometry or the slopes. To illustrate the influence of the nonuniform temperature distribution on dam surfaces due to solar radiation and shading, the analysis of an AAR affected arch dam is presented in this paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3bc7c27a9e1a2bdfdb2e0372fb39e3e75eab3c73c392170be9a7d3ff3abd196a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
