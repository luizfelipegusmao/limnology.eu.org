{"title":"Daratumumab Post Maintenance after Relapse in Multiple Myeloma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1349/v1","date":1718790941000,"content":"We present 4 cases of patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma initially treated without monoclonal antibodies. It was decided to provide the benefit of the drug after maintenance with lenalidomide was initiated to consolidate the post-maintenance response followed by monitoring without any kind of treatment.\nIn this series of 4 cases 100% of the patients achieved a strict complete response with undetectable Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) for flow cytometry after post-maintenance consolidation with daratumumab regardless of the scheme used as induction/consolidation, as well as whether they had received HSCT. Until the last follow-up the patients are under surveillance with no evidence of progression. It should be noted that 3 of 4 of these patients debuted with high-risk disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da6e98c8d610e0a8812694cedce0fdf57a624ac9fa4338019095fc31e05ac7e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
