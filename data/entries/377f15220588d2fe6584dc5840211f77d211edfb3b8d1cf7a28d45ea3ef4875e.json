{"title":"Development and Experimental Study of an Experimental Setup for Online Vibrating Tube Liquid Densitometer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1581/v1","date":1714004773000,"content":"Density is a crucial parameter for quantitatively describing the physical properties of liquids. It serves as an important indicator for scientific research, production process control, pipeline transportation, and other aspects. In oil pipeline transportation and raw material processing, real-time online measurement of liquid density is of great significance. This paper analyzes the working principle of an on-line vibrating tube densitometer and derives the fitting equation for temperature, pressure, and density；it also conducts experiments with an on-line vibrating tube liquid densitometer and establishes a traceability chain for the experimental device. The experimental setup includes a desktop densitometer system, a multi-temperature field constant temperature stirring system, a walk-in constant temperature box, an automatic blowing system, and a frequency acquisition and calculation system. The uncertainty of the device's evaluation is U= 0.08kg/m3, k=2.The experimental research on the on-line vibrating tube liquid densitometer can be carried out within the range of (650~1400) kg/m3, (10~70)℃, (0~50)bar the metrological performance of the vibrating tube densitometer can be researched by utilizing the straight tube type and the elbow type on-line vibrating tube densitometer. A preliminary study was conducted on the effects of different densities, temperatures, and pressures on the vibrating tube system's vibration cycle. The fit coefficient and error were calculated, and the experimental results were compared to the theoretical analysis to confirm the device's conformity. The study verified the device's scientific and reasonable design, and demonstrated that it is feasible to use the device for follow-up research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"377f15220588d2fe6584dc5840211f77d211edfb3b8d1cf7a28d45ea3ef4875e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
