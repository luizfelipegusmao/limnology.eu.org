{"title":"The Evolution and Impact of Glacier Avalanches in Tibet Based on the Sentinel-2 Time-Series Images","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1653/v1","date":1714032906000,"content":"Catastrophic mass flows originating from the high mountain cryosphere often cause hazard cascades. With increasing human activities in the alpine region and the sensitivity of glaciers, snow and permafrost to climate warming, the cryospheric hazard risks tend to be more active in the Tibetan Plateau(TP). The remoteness and inaccessibility of high mountain regions make the remote sensing technology the most effective approach for monitoring and investigating the cryospheric hazards. Exploring the evolution process and impact of ice avalanches and subsequent hazards are crucial to understand drivers and nature of mass flow process chain in order to prevent and mitigate potential hazard consequences. In this study, the glacier and ice-rock avalanches occurred in Arutso and Sedongpu basins in Tibet were investigated on the basis of Sentinel-2 time-series images and in-situ investigation, the evolution process of these events were reconstructed, and impacts and driving factors were analyzed. The massive Chamoli rock-ice avalanche occurred in February 2021 in the western Himalayas was also reviewed using using same methods. The study shows that Arutso glacier No. 53 (Arutso-53) avalanche completely melted away in July 2018 after two years from occurrence to final disappearance, while Arutso glacier No. 50 (Arutso-50) avalanche completely melted by the end of August 2023 after lasting for seven years. Four large-scale ice-rock avalanche and debris flow events in the Sedongpu basin in 2017 and 2018 not only had significant impacts on the river flow, landscape and geomorphologic shape in the basin, but also caused serious disasters in the basin and downstream. In March 2021, a small-scale ice-rock avalanche and debris flow event occurred again in the Sedongpu basin. The glacier and ice-rock avalanches occurred in Tibet area were mainly induced by climate warming, heavy precipitation and seismic activity, which acting on specific topographic and geomorphic structure of glacier properties in the high mountain regions. Catastrophic hazard events originating from the high-elevation glacier and ice-rock collapses in the mountain cryosphere and subsequent hazard cascades in the TP and Himalayas highlight the importance of mountain hazard monitoring, early warning systems and sustainable mountain development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d3cc4815650cc0499db4d42be03111396b632dadc619346c004ce4b15fa4ffb6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
