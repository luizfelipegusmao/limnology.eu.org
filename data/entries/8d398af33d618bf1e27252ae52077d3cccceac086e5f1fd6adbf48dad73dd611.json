{"title":"Resveratrol alleviates imidacloprid‐induced mitochondrial apoptosis, necroptosis, and immune dysfunction in chicken lymphocyte lines by inhibiting the ROS/MAPK signaling pathway","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24097?af=R","date":1709898124000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Imidacloprid (IMI) is a neonicotinoid insecticide with the highest global market share, and IMI exposure in the environment can negatively affect many nontarget organisms (a general term for organisms affected by drugs other than target organisms). Resveratrol (RSV), a non-flavonoid polyphenolic organic compound derived from peanuts, grapes, and other plants, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. It is currently unclear how RSV protects against cell damage caused by IMI. Therefore, we established an experimental model of chicken lymphocyte lines exposed to 110 μg/mL IMI and/or 0.5 μM RSV for 24 h. According to the experimental results, IMI markedly raised intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and diminished the activity of the cellular antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, and GPx), leading to MDA accumulation and decreased T-AOC. <b>JNK</b>, <b>ERK</b>, and <b>P38</b>, the essential components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, were also expressed more when IMI was present. Additionally, IMI resulted in upregulation of mitochondrial apoptosis (<b>Caspase 3</b>, <b>Caspase 9</b>, <b>Bax</b>, and <b>Cyt-c</b>) and necroptosis (<b>Caspase 8</b>, <b>RIPK1</b>, <b>RIPK3</b>, and <b>MLKL</b>) related factors expression, downregulation of <b>Bcl-2</b> expression, induction of upregulation of cytokine <b>IL-6</b> and <b>TNF-α</b> expression, and downregulation of <b>IFN-γ</b> expression. The combined treatment of RSV and IMI significantly reduced cellular oxidative stress levels, inhibited the MAPK signaling pathway, and alleviated IMI-induced mitochondrial apoptosis, necroptosis, and immune dysfunction. To summarize, RSV antagonized IMI-induced mitochondrial apoptosis, necroptosis, and immune dysfunction in chicken lymphocyte lines by inhibiting the ROS/MAPK signaling pathway.</p>","author":"Xiaodan Wang, \nJiatong Sun, \nTong Xu, \nYutian Lei, \nMeichen Gao, \nHongjin Lin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"8d398af33d618bf1e27252ae52077d3cccceac086e5f1fd6adbf48dad73dd611","category":"Environment"}
