{"title":"Acute Kidney Disease following Acute Kidney Injury in Children&mdash;A Retrospective Observational Cohort Study on Risk Factors and Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0882/v1","date":1713149175000,"content":"Background: Acute kidney disease (AKD) is a known risk factor for increased mortality and evolution towards chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults. The data regarding children are scarce. The purpose of our study is to explore the risk factor for AKD and impact of AKD following an acute kidney injury (AKI) episode in children on mortality and new-onset CKD.\nMethods: We retrospectively evaluated 736 children with ages between 2 and 18 years old with AKI admitted in a tertiary care hospital from the west Romania over a 9 years period. \nResults: AKD incidence following AKI was 17%. Patients that developed AKD were older, with higher baseline serum creatinine values, urea, C reactive protein and lower proteins, haemoglobin and sodium. They were more often exposed to sepsis, critical illness and nephrotoxic medications and presented certain susceptibilities like CKD, neoplasia, anemia, heart failure, arterial hypertension, stem cell transplant and female gender. AKI causes that increased the risk of AKD were intrinsic ones. AKD increased the overall mortality by three times. The factors that independently increased the risk of evolution towards CKD were AKD, acute tubular necrosis and higher baseline serum creatinine values.\n Conclusions: AKD is an independent risk factor for mortality and new-onset CKD in children.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"590672384070207cbc074ff6b3d680a9630cae4e7fc953f889a32c676f906cd2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
