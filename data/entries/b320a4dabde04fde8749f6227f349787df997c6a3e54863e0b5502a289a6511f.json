{"title":"The Proliferation of Artificial Intelligence in the Forklift Industry &ndash; an Analysis for the Case of Romania","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0395/v1","date":1728293396000,"content":"This paper delves into the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in the forklift industry, particularly focusing on logistics and procurement within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the field of industrial machinery. The study highlights the growing influence of AI in automating and improving the forklift industry. Using the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) balanced scorecard (BSC), benchmarking, and activity-based management (ABM) models, the paper analyses the risks and the implications of AI integration in the industry in the actual turbulent context. The research highlights the significant shifts in logistics and procurement processes due to AI, projecting a future where forklift operations are deep automatized, leading to a possible loss of forklift operator jobs. A case study of the most relevant Romanian SME in the forklift industry is also presented, examining the company's financial strategies using McKinseyâ€™s 7S framework. The paper concludes with a perspective that, in the future, machines will predominantly operate in roles currently held by humans, significantly altering the industry landscape.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b320a4dabde04fde8749f6227f349787df997c6a3e54863e0b5502a289a6511f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
