{"title":"AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance in Modern Maritime Transport. Enhancing Operational Efficiency and Reliability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0930/v1","date":1726104404000,"content":"Maritime transport has adapted to recent political and economic shifts by addressing stringent pollution reduction requirements, redrawing transport routes for safety, reducing onboard technical incidents, managing data security risks and transitioning to autonomous vessels. The integration of AI-based technologies for fault diagnosis and decision-making, coupled with proper personnel training, has become essential for optimal ship operation, with AI-assisted predictive maintenance emerging as the key strategy to ensure onboard systems function within desired parameters and enhance equipment availability. This study proposes a machine-learning algorithm for evaluating onboard systems performance by analyzing sensor data and mapping it to fault patterns to estimate functional states, validated through tests on a seawater cooling system from an oil tanker, demonstrating operational efficiency and reliability. The immediate advantage is reduced time for fault diagnosis by rapidly assessing the system using operational data, the algorithm enabling real-time monitoring and fault data management to minimize efforts as part of predictive maintenance assisted by machine learning tools.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"27269eb04311ac0d70f6b728b04eaf6c8f12e4e22f86a745222e5d5552a8a0d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
