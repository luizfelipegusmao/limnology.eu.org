{"title":"Tumor Microenvironment-Responsive Magnetotactic Bacteria-Based Multi-drug Delivery Platform for MRI-Visualized Tumor Photothermalâˆ’ Chemodynamic Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0458/v1","date":1723084075000,"content":"Cancer cells display elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and altered redox status, Here based on these characteristics, we develop a multi-drug delivery platform AMB@PDAP-Fe (APPF), from magnetotactic bacterium AMB-1 and realize MRI-visualized tumor microenvironment-responsive photothermal-chemodynamic therapy. The Fe3+ in PDAP-Fe is reduced by the GSH at tumor site and is released in the form of highly active Fe2+, which catalyzes the generation of ROS through Fenton reaction and inhibits tumor growth. At the same time, the significant absorption of the mineralized magnetosomes in AMB-1 cells in the NIR region enable them to efficiently convert near-infrared light into heat energy for photothermal therapy (PTT), to which PDAP also contributes. The heat generated in the PTT process accelerates the process of Fe2+ release, thereby achieving an enhanced Fenton reaction in tumor microenvironment. In addition, the magnetosomes in AMB-1 are used as MRI contrast agent, and the curing process is visualized. This tumor microenvironment-responsive MTB-based multi-drug delivery platform displays a potency to combat tumor and demonstrates the utility and practicality of understanding the cooperative molecular mechanism when designing multi-drug combination therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c9e366fcaaf487dccd9ebbf90780ca2604eb53521bc443044fb8b9ef80cc6a3a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
