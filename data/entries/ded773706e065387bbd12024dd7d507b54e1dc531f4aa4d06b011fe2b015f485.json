{"title":"Mitigating Toxic Metal Exposure Through Leafy Greens: A Comprehensive Review Contrasting Cadmium and Lead in Spinach","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GH001081?af=R","date":1718607600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Metals and metalloids (hereafter, metal(loid)s) in plant-based foods are a source of exposure to humans, but not all metal(loid)-food interactions are the same. Differences exist between metal(loid)s in terms of their behavior in soils and in how they are taken up by plants and stored in the edible plant tissue/food. Thus, there cannot be one consistent solution to reducing toxic metal(loid)s exposure to humans from foods. In addition, how metal(loid)s are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted by the human body differs based on both the metal(loid), other elements and nutrients in the food, and the nutritional status of the human. Initiatives like the United States Food and Drug Administration's Closer to Zero initiative to reduce the exposure of young children to the toxic elements cadmium, lead, arsenic, and mercury from foods warrant careful consideration of each metal(loid) and plant interaction. This review explores such plant-metal(loid) interactions using the example of spinach and the metals cadmium and lead. This review highlights differences in the magnitude of exposure, bioavailability, and the practicality of mitigation strategies while outlining research gaps and future needs. A focus on feasibility and producer needs, informed via stakeholder interviews, emphasizes the need for better analytical testing facilities and grower and consumer education. More research should focus on minimization of chloride inputs for leafy greens to lessen plant-availability of Cd and the role of oxalate in reducing Cd bioavailability from spinach. These findings are applicable to other leafy greens (e.g., kale, lettuce), but not for other plants or metal(loid)s.</p>","author":"Angelia L. Seyfferth, \nMatt A. Limmer, \nBenjamin R. K.
