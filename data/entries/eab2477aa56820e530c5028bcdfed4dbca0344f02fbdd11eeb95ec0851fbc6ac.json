{"title":"Inhibition of long non-coding RNA NEAT1 suppressed the epithelial mesenchymal transition through the miR-204-5p/Six1 axis in asthma","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312020","date":1729260000000,"content":"<p>by Lei Li, Guoju Li, Renzheng Guan, Hui Ma, Quansheng Xing</p>\r\nBackground <p>Asthma, a prevalent chronic respiratory condition, is characterized by airway remodeling. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1 has been demonstrated to participate in airway fibrosis. Furthermore, the miR-204-5p/Six1 axis significantly influences epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the function of NEAT1/miR-204-5p/Six1 in asthmatic EMT remains unclear.</p> Purpose <p>This study intends to elucidate the function of NEAT1/miR-204-5p/Six1 axis in asthmatic EMT.</p> Methods <p>TGF-β1 was used to induce the EMT model in BEAS-2B cells. Immunofluorescence and western blot were executed to verify the establishment of the EMT model. NEAT1, miR-204-5p, and Six1 expression levels were evaluated using RT-qPCR. The role of NEAT1 in EMT <i>in vitro</i> was explored by CCK8 assays and flow cytometry. The luciferase reporter assay was performed to validate the interaction between NEAT1 and miR-204-5p/Six1.</p> Results <p>NEAT1 expression was increased during EMT. Functional experiments showed that the knockdown of NEAT1 suppressed cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, inhibition of NEAT1 decreased the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and α-SMA and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Mechanistically, NEAT1 was identified as a sponge for miR-204-5p, and Six1 was found to be a direct target of miR-204-5p.</p> Conclusion <p>Down-regulation of NEAT1 reduced the Six1 expression via targeting miR-204-5p to inhibit the process of EMT in asthma. This study may provide new insight to reveal the underlying mechanisms of asthma.</p>","author":"Lei Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"eab2477aa56820e530c5028bcdfed4dbca0344f02fbdd11eeb95ec0851fbc6ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
