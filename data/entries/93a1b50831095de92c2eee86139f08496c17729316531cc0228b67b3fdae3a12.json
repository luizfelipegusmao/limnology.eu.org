Key examples of prior work in this area includes heating, cooling, electric and magnetic fields, liquids, gases, and applied strain [<a href=\"#ozae044.710-B1\">1</a>]. For high-speed time-resolved imaging, the stimulus must also be extremely fast, or applied at high frequency, and prior examples include heating with a laser, or applied electric fields [<a href=\"#ozae044.710-B2\">2</a>]. Here, we report on a new type of <span>in situ</span> stimulus technique involving a time-varying strain that arrives at the specimen in the form of an acoustic wave. This is achieved by employing interdigitated transducers (IDTs) to convert an electrical input signal to acoustic wave stimuli on a 128° Y-X LiNbO<sub>3</sub> single crystal.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"93a1b50831095de92c2eee86139f08496c17729316531cc0228b67b3fdae3a12","category":"Environment"}
