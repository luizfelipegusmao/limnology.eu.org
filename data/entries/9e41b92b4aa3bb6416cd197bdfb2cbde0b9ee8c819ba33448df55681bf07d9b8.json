{"title":"Spectral sensitivity of click beetles (Coleoptera: Elateridae) and their responses to light stimuli in laboratory and field experiments","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/2/199/7591106?rss=1","date":1706486400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>With increasingly fewer insecticides registered to control the larvae of pest click beetles (Coleoptera: Elateridae), integrative beetle management, including pheromone- and light-based trapping of adult beetles, must be explored as an alternative strategy. Here, we analyzed the spectral sensitivity and color preference of 9 elaterids across 6 genera in electrophysiological recordings and in behavioral bioassays. In electroretinogram recordings (ERGs), dark-adapted beetles were exposed to narrow wavebands of light in 10-nm increments from 330 to 650 nm. All beetles proved most sensitive to green (515â€“538 nm) and ultraviolet (UV) light (~360 nm). In 4-choice bioassay arenas with 3 light emitting diodes (LEDs; green [525 nm], blue [470 nm], red [655 nm]) and a dark control as test stimuli, beetles discriminated between test stimuli, being preferentially attracted to green and blue LEDs. In field experiments, Vernon pitfall traps fitted with a green, blue or white LED captured significantly more male and female <span>Agriotes lineatus</span> and <span>A. obscurus</span> than dark control traps. When traps were baited with green or blue LEDs at light intensities that differed by 10-fold, the traps baited with higher light intensity lures captured numerically more beetles but trap catch data in accordance with light intensity did not differ statistically. Light-based trapping may be a viable tool for monitoring elaterid species known not to have pheromones.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"9e41b92b4aa3bb6416cd197bdfb2cbde0b9ee8c819ba33448df55681bf07d9b8","category":"Environment"}
