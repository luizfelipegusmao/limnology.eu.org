They produce toxins that can make people sick, but around 2.4 billion years ago (Giga annum or Ga) they played a key role in the oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans, a period known as the Great Oxidation Event, and they are still important as primary producers of oxygen. Cyanobacteria are also the precursor of chloroplasts, organelles where oxygen-producing photosynthesis can take place within many living organisms, specifically those organisms that became plants. Although the production of oxygen is essential for most life as we know it, there has been no unambiguous evidence for thylakoids in the early fossil record until now. An elegant study by Catherine Demoulin, Yannick Lara, Alexandre Lambion, and Emmanuelle Javaux has provided such evidence and has moved the dawn of photosynthesis back 1.2 Ga!</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"51feab8b40eb77068782262eb21f1469d7ffdca79d856ed9cfb4fc07e64d6df2","category":"Environment"}
