{"title":"Gibbs Free Energy and Enthalpy-Entropy Compensation in Protein-Ligand Interactions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0060/v1","date":1714542322000,"content":"Thermodynamics of protein-ligand interactions seems to be associated to a narrow range of Gibbs Free Energy. As a consequence, a linear enthalpy-entropy relationship showing an apparent Enthalpy-Entropy compensation (EEC) is frequently observed associated to the study of protein-ligand interactions. This EEC affects negatively the design and discovery of new and more efficient drugs capable of binding protein-targets with a higher affinity. Originally attributed to experimental errors, compensation between H and TS values is a real observable fact, although its molecular origin has remained obscure and controversial. Herein we show the results of a data search of G values of 2558 protein-ligand interactions and 3025 “in vivo” ligand concentrations from the Protein Data Bank bind Database and the Metabolome Data Base (2020). These results, together with the mechano-statistical interpretation of the thermodynamic properties leads to the conclusion that the EEC has no basis in statistical thermodynamics. It can be plausibly explained as a consequence of the narrow range of G associated to protein-ligand interactions. The Gaussian distribution of the G values matches very well with that of ligands. These results suggest the hypothesis that the set of G values for the protein-ligand interactions is the result of the evolution of proteins. The conformation versatility of present proteins and the exchange of thousands (even millions) of minute amounts of energy with the environment may have functioned as a homeostatic mechanism to make G of proteins adaptive to changes in availability of ligands, and therefore achieve the maximum regulatory capacity of the protein function. Finally, a plausible strategy to avoid the EEC is suggested.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a79fd7c4d6ccbb226e53846d11444d42a2947dd445ba6b057b1f72731a74556","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
