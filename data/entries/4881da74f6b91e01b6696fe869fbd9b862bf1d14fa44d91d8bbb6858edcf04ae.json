{"title":"Animal source food consumption practice and factors associated among infant and young children from selected rural districts in Ethiopia: A cross-sectional study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306648","date":1720188000000,"content":"<p>by Alemneh Kabeta Daba, Mary Murimi, Kebede Abegaz, Dejene Hailu</p>\r\nBackground <p>Children are recommended to consume animal source foods (ASF) as part of diversified diets. However, ASF consumption practice of infant and young children (IYC) is less studied and contributing factors are not exhaustively identified. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess consumption of ASF and identify associated factors among 6–23 months old IYC from selected rural districts in Ethiopia.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional study was conducted in a total of 606 IYC from selected rural districts of Oromia and Sidama regional states in Ethiopia. A two-stage sampling technique was used to select participants. Data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire. Frequencies, percentages and mean scores with standard deviations were generated to describe participants and report univariate outcomes. Consumption of ASF was assessed using a 24-hour dietary recall. Logistic regression analysis was applied to identify contributing factors contributed to IYC’s ASF consumption practice.</p> Results <p>Dairy, eggs and meat were consumed by 41.2%, 16.4% and 2.3% of IYC, respectively. Household food security increased odds of dairy [AOR = 1.66 (95%CI: 1.16 2.38), P = 0.006], eggs [AOR = 2.15 (95%CI: 1.33, 3.49), P = 0.002] and meat [AOR = 5.08 (95%CI: 1.09, 23.71), P = 0.039] consumption. Cow [AOR = 1.86 (95%CI: 1.28, 2.70), P = 0.001], donkey [AOR = 1.83 (95%CI: 1.08, 3.11), P = 0.024] and chicken [AOR = 1.53 (95%CI: 1.05, 2.22), P = 0.027] ownership increased the odds of dairy consumption. Grades 5–8 [AOR = 1.74 (95%CI: 1.06, 2.86), P = 0.028] or ≥9 [AOR = 2.96 (95%CI: 1.62, 5.42), P &lt;0.001] maternal educational achievements were also associated with better dairy consumption. Children from households that owned chicken [AOR = 3.20 (95%CI: 1.97, 5.19), P &lt;0.001] or produce root crops [AOR = 1.67 (95%CI: 1.05, 2.66), P = 0.031] were with increased odds to consume eggs.</p> Conclusions <p>Low proportion of children consumed ASF. Household food security, livestock ownership, household income, root crop production and maternal education contributed to ASF consumption. Nutrition sensitive agricultural extension activities aided by nutrition education should be considered and evaluated for their effect on IYC’s ASF consumption practice.</p>","author":"Alemneh Kabeta Daba","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4881da74f6b91e01b6696fe869fbd9b862bf1d14fa44d91d8bbb6858edcf04ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
