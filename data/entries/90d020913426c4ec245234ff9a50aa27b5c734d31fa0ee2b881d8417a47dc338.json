Retrospective chart review was performed on 58 infants and data was collected at baseline, 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours of iloprost initiation. Primary outcomes were change in heart rate (HR), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), mean airway pressures (MAP), blood pressure (BP) and oxygenation index (OI). Secondary outcomes were need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and death. 51 patients treated for &gt; 6 hours were analyzed in 2 age groups, neonate (â‰¤28 days: n=32) and infant (29-365 days: n=19).
