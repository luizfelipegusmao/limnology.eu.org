{"title":"Finite-Time Control Design for the Discrete-Time Chaotic Logistic Equation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0459/v1","date":1720140600000,"content":"Finite-time control theory has been widely used as a mathematical tool to design robust controllers. By manipulating the finite-time convergence proof of this theory, we developed a new control design appropriately tuned for the finite-time control of the chaotic logistics system. In our experimental setup, the logistic equation is programmed into a PIC microcontroller, and a part of the controller was conceived using analog electronics. Because the system to be controlled is in the discrete-time domain, and the finite-time stability proof is stated in the continuous-time representation, our finite-time control approach is a good example for designing control algorithms in both time domain schemes. Hence, our experimental results support our main contribution. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is the signal format used to translate digital signals into continuous-time fields.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ddd0ee51d463dc9120dd048b51bb858ee583f1c2a6b9c4aaf91de9539064d17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
