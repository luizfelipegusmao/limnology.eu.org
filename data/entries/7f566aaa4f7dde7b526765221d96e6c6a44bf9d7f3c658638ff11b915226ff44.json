{"title":"The GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Liraglutide Decreases Primary Bile Acids and Serotonin in the Colon Independently of Feeding in Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0315/v1","date":1718014924000,"content":"Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 analog used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity, is a po-tential new treatment modality for bile acid (BA) diarrhea. Here, we show that administration of liraglutide significantly decreased total BAs, especially the primary BAs, including cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, glycocholic acid, and β-muricholic acid, in the liver and feces. In addition, liraglutide significantly decreased trypto-phan metabolites, including L-tryptophan, serotonin, 5-hydroxy indole-3-acetic acid, L-kynurenine, and xanthurenic acid, in the colon, whereas it significantly increased in-dole-3-propionic acid. Moreover, the administration of liraglutide remarkably decreased the ex-pression of apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, which mediates BA uptake across the apical brush border member in the ileum, ileal BA binding protein, and fibroblast growth factor 15 in association with decreased expression of the BA-activated nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor and the heteromeric organic solute transporter Ostα/β, which induces BA excretion, in the ileum. Liraglutide acutely decreased body weight and blood glucose levels in association with decreases in plasma insulin and serotonin levels in food-deprived mice. These findings suggest the potential of liraglutide as a novel inhibitor of primary BAs and serotonin in the colon, which may be in-volved in the improvement of BA diarrhea.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f566aaa4f7dde7b526765221d96e6c6a44bf9d7f3c658638ff11b915226ff44","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
