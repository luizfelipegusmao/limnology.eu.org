Results showed that the coalesced bainite significantly enhanced the hydrogen embrittlement resistance by restricting hydrogen accumulation at the prior austenite grain boundaries, thus shifting the hydrogen-assisted failure mode from intergranular to transgranular fracture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"82fe40da7b2b86ee0f58820a4fe01d8cb79d94464b5c1437d810185f01e798d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
