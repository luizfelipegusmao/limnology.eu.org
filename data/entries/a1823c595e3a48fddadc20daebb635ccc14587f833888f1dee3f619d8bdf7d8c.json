{"title":"Cytotoxic Activity of Koninginins Isolated from the Mangrove-Derived Endophytic Fungus Trichoderma sp.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2273/v1","date":1727686550000,"content":"The search for bioactive compounds for the treatment of several diseases has led to the study of endophytic fungi. Neoplastic diseases are among the most significant health concerns due to their high mortality rate, and there is a dearth of efficacious pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of cancer. Gastric cancer is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer and is among those with the highest mortality rates in Brazil. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to identify compounds with cytotoxic activity from the mangrove-derived endophytic fungus Trichoderma sp. Isolation of the chemical compounds was conducted using chromatographic methods, while structural elucidation was achieved through the application of spectroscopic (NMR and UV) and spectrometric (MS) techniques. The fungus Trichoderma sp. was found to produce five distinct koninginins (A, B, C, E, and J). The organic phases of the extracts and isolated compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial and cytotoxic potentials, respectively, through microdilution testing and the MTT method. In the cytotoxicity assay, both the AF extract and koninginin A demonstrated favorable outcomes, indicating their potential as promising anticancer therapeutic agents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1823c595e3a48fddadc20daebb635ccc14587f833888f1dee3f619d8bdf7d8c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
