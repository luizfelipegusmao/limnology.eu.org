{"title":"Forging the Iron-Net: Towards a Quantitative Understanding of Microbial Communities via Siderophore-Mediated Interactions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0834/v1","date":1720684753000,"content":"Iron is a critical yet limited nutrient for microbial growth. To scavenge iron, most microbes produce siderophoresâ€”diverse small molecules with high iron affinities. Different siderophores are specifically recognized and uptaken by corresponding recognizers, enabling targeted interventions and intriguing cheater-producer dynamics. We propose constructing a comprehensive iron interaction network, or \"iron-net,\" across the microbial world. Such a network offers the potential for precise manipulation of the microbiota, with conceivable applications in medicine, agriculture, and industry, as well as advancing microbial ecology and evolution theories. Previously, our successful construction of an iron-net in the Pseudomonas genus demonstrated the feasibility of co-evolution-inspired digital siderophore typing. Enhanced by machine learning techniques and expanding sequencing data, forging such an iron-net calls for multidisciplinary collaborations, and holds significant promise in addressing critical challenges in microbial communities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ccefd257db40e1d60f521cb37040f12c6bd0f8fafe4b2f957a110a0ec5b3ff2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
