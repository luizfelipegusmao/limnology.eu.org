{"title":"The management of common carp fisheries using spawning potential ratio in the southeast of the Caspian Sea","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12660?af=R","date":1709729842000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Spawning potential ratio (SPR) is an important index used by fisheries biologists and managers to determine how a fishery should be harvested to prevent recruitment overfishing. In the southeastern Caspian Sea, Iran, 3430 common carp <i>Cyprinus carpio</i> were caught by beach seine in 2-week intervals of two fishing seasons in 2019 and 2020. Fork length (FL) was measured to the nearest 1 cm. The age and maturity stage of 434 specimens, including 236 females and 198 males, were estimated by scale and gonad microscopic examinations. Estimated <i>L</i>\n<sub>∞</sub> was 71.9 and <i>K</i> (growth constant) was 0.09. Instantaneous total mortality (<i>Z</i>) was 1.08, natural mortality (<i>M</i>) was 0.18, and fishing mortality (<i>F</i>) was 0.9. Estimated SPR at current fishing mortality (0.18) was lower than the reference point (0.4). Our findings indicated that fishing mortality should be reduced to <i>F</i> = 0.38 for <i>C. carpio</i> to meet the SPR reference point of 0.4. Further, higher minimum length limits should be set to reduce fishing mortality, and catch quotas for fishing cooperative corporations should be considered to meet the 40% SPR threshold.</p>","author":"Mohammad Larijani, \nZiya Kordjazi, \nRahman Patimar, \nGholamali Bandani, \nZeinab Ansari, \nHojjat Jafarian","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"25bdfaa7e0adee9f2cff417441f336ca9b507c98aabf6848081ef3ff87ffebee","category":"Environment"}
