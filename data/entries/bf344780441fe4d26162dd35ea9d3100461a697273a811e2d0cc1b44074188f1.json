{"title":"Enhancing Precision of Forest Growing Stock Volume in the Estonian National Forest Inventory with Different Predictive Techniques and Remote Sensing Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1741/v1","date":1727089201000,"content":"Estimating Forest growing stock volume (GSV) is crucial for forest growth and resource management, as it reflects forest productivity. National measurements are laborious and costly, however integrating satellite data such as optical, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) with National Forest Inventory (NFI) data and machine learning (ML) methods has transformed forest management. In this study, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were used to predict GSV using Estonian NFI data, Sentinel-2 imagery, and ALS point cloud data. Four variable combinations were tested: CO1 (vegetation indices and LiDAR), CO2 (vegetation indices and individual band reflectance), CO3 (LiDAR and individual band reflectance), and CO4 (a combination of vegetation indices, individual band reflectance, and LiDAR). Across Estonia's geographical regions, RF consistently delivered the best performance. In the northwest (NW), RF achieved an R² of 0.63 and an RMSE of 125.39 m³/plot. In the southwest (SW), it achieved an R² of 0.73 and an RMSE of 128.86 m³/plot. In the northeast (NE), RF achieved an R² of 0.64 and an RMSE of 133.77 m³/plot, and an R² of 0.70 and an RMSE of 120.72 m³/plot was achieved in the southeast (SE). These results underscore RF's precision in predicting GSV across diverse environments, though refining variable selection and improving tree species data could further enhance accuracy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf344780441fe4d26162dd35ea9d3100461a697273a811e2d0cc1b44074188f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
