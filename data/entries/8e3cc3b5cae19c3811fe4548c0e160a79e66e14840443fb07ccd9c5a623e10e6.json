{"title":"The impact of patient engagement on patient safety in care transitions after cancer treatment: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307831","date":1724767200000,"content":"<p>by Larissa Brust, Ingo Schmidt-Wolf, Matthias Weigl</p>\r\nBackground <p>Transitions of care after cancer treatment pose a major challenge for patient safety as adverse events and unplanned healthcare utilization occur frequently. At this point, patient and family engagement (PFE) is particularly valuable since patients and their families experience various challenges along this pathway, such as changing roles and recurrent needs to navigate across structural gaps between different services. However, there is currently a lack of evidence on the impact of PFE on patient safety in transitions after cancer treatment.</p> Objective <p>To systematically review and synthesize evidence on effects of different PFE interventions on patient safety in the transition of care after cancer treatment.</p> Methods <p>This protocol for a systematic review with meta-analysis follows PRISMA-P guidelines. A comprehensive database search will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and APA PsycInfo. Trial registries and grey literature will be searched, forward and backward citation tracking will be performed. Trials with prospective, longitudinal, interventional study designs will be included if they evaluate PFE interventions on patient safety outcomes (primary outcomes: healthcare utilization, patient harm, adherence, patient experience; secondary: quality of life, distress); eligible studies need to survey patients with any oncological disease during or after transition following cancer treatment. Results will be synthesized narratively and meta-analytically using a random-effects model. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane RoB-2 and revised JBI critical appraisal tool. The certainty of evidence will be judged according to the GRADE approach.</p> Discussion <p>Robust evidence of effectiveness is needed to establish PFE interventions for patient safety in care transitions for oncological patients. This review will allow evidence-based conclusions about types and effects of different PFE interventions for transitional safety in oncology care and inform stakeholders in designing sustainable PFE activities.</p> Trial registration <p>PROSPERO (CRD42024546938), OSF (doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9XAMU).</p>","author":"Larissa Brust","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8e3cc3b5cae19c3811fe4548c0e160a79e66e14840443fb07ccd9c5a623e10e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
