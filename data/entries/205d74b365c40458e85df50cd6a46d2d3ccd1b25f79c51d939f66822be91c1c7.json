{"title":"Prevalence and Trend of Drug Use among Adolescents in Mississippi and the United States: Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) 2001&ndash;2021","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1825/v1","date":1716878316000,"content":"Mississippi youth are demographically unique compared to that of the nation. The purpose of this study was to determine the trend of drug use among adolescents of the United States and Mississippi, and to estimate the differences of drug use prevalence as a whole, and by gender and by race. National and Mississippi YRBSS data from 2001 to 2021 were obtained for analysis. Summary statistics, prevalence ratio, and survey Chi-squared tests of independence statistics were generated for the comparison for all students, and by gender and race separately. Trend analysis was conducted using logistic regression combined with joinpoint regression. Six survey questions being studied were: have you ever used marijuana, inhalant, heroin, methamphetamines, injected drugs, and were you offered, sold, or given an illegal drug on school property during the last 12 months. Survey packages in R were used to account for the complex sampling design of YRBSS data. On the national level, all six drug related risk behaviors being studied showed significant decrease from 2001 to 2021. In Mississippi however, only “ever used marijuana” showed a trend of decrease, while three remain unchanged, and two increased. 2021 YRBSS data shows that Mississippi adolescents exhibited significantly higher prevalence of drug use, and are more likely to be offered, sold or given an illegal drug on school property. Our study suggests an urgent need for drug use intervention among Mississippi adolescents. More concerted actions at the community, school and government level are needed for reducing youth drug use and controlling the drug traffic on school property.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"205d74b365c40458e85df50cd6a46d2d3ccd1b25f79c51d939f66822be91c1c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
