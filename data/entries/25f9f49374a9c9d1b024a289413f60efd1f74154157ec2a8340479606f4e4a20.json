{"title":"Detailed GNSS Observation Noise Assessment Based on Ultra-Short Baseline","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0566/v1","date":1715234163000,"content":"Assessing observation noise is a critical step in the development of a stochastic model for GNSS navigation and positioning. This process ensures that the statistical properties of the observational data are accurately characterized, leading to more reliable and precise positioning results.  Traditionally, the one sigma values for observation noise, 0.3 m for code and 3 mm for carrier phase, alongside elevation-dependent weighting schemes, have been standard. However, these may no longer be suitable due to significant advancements in GNSS systems, receivers, and antennas. Previous research predominantly focused on code type and PPP techniques, often limited by the inability to separately assess observation types across different frequency bands due to ionospheric delay. Furthermore, these studies were generally constrained by limited experimental data. This research advocates for the use of ultra-short baselines to eliminate atmospheric delay and other error sources, providing a detailed assessment of observation noise for various frequency bands, GNSS systems, and receiver &amp; antenna types over an extensive period and across multiple baselines. The findings suggest a need to reconsider traditional one sigma values and elevation-dependent weighting schemes for current applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25f9f49374a9c9d1b024a289413f60efd1f74154157ec2a8340479606f4e4a20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
