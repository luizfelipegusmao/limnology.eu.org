{"title":"Isolation and identification of active components from Grifola frondosa and its anti‐EV71 virus effect","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13332?af=R","date":1712732400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>It is reported that anti-enterovirus 71 (EV71) drugs have some side effects on human health. Notably, fungi plays a crucial role in promoting human health and anti-virus. <i>Grifola frondosa</i> is a type of large medicinal and edible fungi, rich in active substances. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-EV71 effect of <i>G. frondosa</i> and the potential active substances.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In the present study, the water extract of <i>G. frondosa</i> was subjected to ethanol precipitation to obtain the water-extracted supernatant of <i>G. frondosa</i> (GFWS) and water-extracted precipitation of <i>G. frondosa</i>. Their inhibitory effects on EV71 virus were studied based on a cell model. The results showed that GFWS had stronger security and anti-EV71 effects. In addition, the chemical constituents of GFWS were identified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, which were selected for further separation and purification. Three compounds, <i>N</i>-butylaniline, succinic acid and <span>l</span>-tryptophan, were isolated from GFWS by NMR spectroscopy. It is noteworthy that <i>N</i>-butylaniline and <span>l</span>-tryptophan were isolated and identified from the <i>G. frondosa</i> fruiting bodies for the first time. Our study found that <span>l</span>-tryptophan has anti-EV71 virus activity, which reduced EV71-induced apoptosis and significantly inhibited the replication process after virus adsorption. Furthermore, it could also bind to capsid protein VP1 to prevent the virus from attaching to the cells.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p><span>l</span>-tryptophan was an inhibitor of the EV71 virus, which could be used in infant nutrition and possibly provide a new drug to treat hand, foot and mouth disease. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Wenyu Xiong, \nXiaoqin Jiang, \nJunqiang He, \nYue Zhong, \nXiaodong Ge, \nBin Liu, \nFeng Zeng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a9f8afcacf4ea7018ad7fc14a9b5622e1d6186a3106f1b24bed6ebd5a9497ce0","category":"Environment"}
