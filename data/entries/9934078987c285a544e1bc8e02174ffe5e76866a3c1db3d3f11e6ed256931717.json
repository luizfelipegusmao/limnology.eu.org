To investigate the effect of polymer biosynthesis mutations on SCW patterning, we developed a method to induce tracheary element transdifferentiation of isolated protoplasts, by transient transformation with <span>VND7</span>. Our data showed that proper xylan elongation is necessary for distinct cellulose bands, celluloseâ€“xylan interactions are essential for coincident polymer patterns, and cellulose deposition is needed to override the intracellular organization that yields unique xylan patterns. These data indicate that a properly assembled cell wall network acts as a scaffold to direct polymer deposition into distinctly banded domains. We describe the transdifferentiation of protoplasts into TEs, providing an avenue to study patterned SCW biosynthesis in a tissue-free environment and in various mutant backgrounds.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"9934078987c285a544e1bc8e02174ffe5e76866a3c1db3d3f11e6ed256931717","category":"Environment"}
