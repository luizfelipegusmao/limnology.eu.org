{"title":"Small Bowel Obstruction Masking a Perforated Dermoid Ovarian Cyst","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0234/v1","date":1722839187000,"content":"A 58 year old female presented with abdominal pain, vomiting and constipation. Laboratory tests indicated elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels. Imaging via CT scan revealed a large cystic mass in the right ovary, abscesses and generalized small bowel distension, which initially led to a diagnosis of ovarian cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Despite conservative management, the patientâ€™s condition did not improve, prompting a laparotomy. Intraoperative findings included generalized peritonitis, significant small bowel dilation due to inflammatory adhesions and a perforated dermoid ovarian cyst. The cyst was resected and a prophylactic ileostomy was installed. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a benign dermoid ovarian cyst. This case illustrates the rare presentation of a perforated dermoid cyst mimicking peritoneal carcinomatosis and emphasizes the importance of considering such complications in the differential diagnosis of bowel obstruction and peritoneal disease. Early recognition and appropriate surgical intervention are crucial for optimal outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6381899c14e4f40ed43f219ce5fd1d8223826348360f31a64d80f282007826d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
