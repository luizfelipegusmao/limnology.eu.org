{"title":"The Ameliorative Effect of Litsea martabanica (Kurz) Hook. f. Leaf Water Extract on Chlorpyrifos-Induced Toxicity in Rats and Its Antioxidant Potentials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1950/v1","date":1714464992000,"content":"Litsea martabanica root's antioxidant and AChE activity showed promise as a pesticide detoxification agent in our previous study. In addition to roots, its leaves can help mitigate pesticide exposure, although there is limited scientific evidence supporting their efficacy. However, the use of roots in many countries, such as Thailand, could contribute to environmental degradation, as highland communities traditionally cut down whole trees to obtain them. This study aims to evaluate the antioxidant activity and anti-pesticide potential of water extracts from L. martabanica leaves instead of its roots through in vitro and in vivo investigations. The findings showed that L. martabanica water extracts and fractions demonstrated varied antioxidant activity. The water extract, obtained using traditional extraction methods, was chosen for in vivo experiments. Rats received the extract followed by chlorpyrifos exposure for 16 days. Results indicated reduced acetylcholinesterase activity in chlorpyrifos-exposed rats, while treatment with leaf extract led to increased activity, suggesting its potential as a detoxifying agent. Histopathological examination revealed no liver cell necrosis and showed liver cell regeneration, indicating potential protection against free radical-induced liver damage without affecting rat liver weight or biochemical profiles. Utilizing L. martabanica leaves for healthcare purposes holds promise without negative environmental impact.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9c5d0d00858e1acfa0b5380fbd73211a5720dacea8321676e5132794ce0c0e0f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
