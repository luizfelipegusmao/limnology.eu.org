{"title":"Effects of different adzuki bean flour additions on structural and functional characteristics of extruded buckwheat noodles","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13894?af=R","date":1726314268000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Understanding the effects of different additions of adzuki bean flour (ABF) on structural and functional characteristics of extruded buckwheat noodles is important in developing high-quality starchy foods with desirable glycemic indexes. This study explored how varying amounts of ABF in extruded buckwheat noodles influenced their structural and functional characteristics.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The findings indicated that adding ABF substantially boosted the levels of protein and flavonoids, while decreasing the content of fat and starch. Adding ABF to the noodles extended the optimum cooking time and led to a reduction in both the stickiness of the cooked noodles and the pore size of the starch gel structure, compared with pure buckwheat noodles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that <i>R</i>\n<sub>1047/1022</sub> increased with the content of ABF increased, while <i>R</i>\n<sub>1022/995</sub> decreased. X-ray diffraction showed that the relative crystallinity of buckwheat noodles was enhanced with increasing ABF amount. Adding ABF notably significantly decreased the estimated glycemic index. The buckwheat noodles extruded with 20% ABF addition demonstrated notably stronger α-glucosidase inhibitory effects than those extruded with no ABF addition.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study demonstrates that the additions of ABF improved the structure and hypoglycemic activity of extruded buckwheat noodles while decreasing starch digestibility, and the optimal value was reached at an ABF addition of 20%. The study might fill gaps in starch noodle research and provide a new strategy for the development of functional food in the food industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Chaofan Zhao, \nJiankang Zhou, \nZhuo Zhang, \nWenting Wang, \nShengyuan Guo, \nYu Bai, \nYajie Xue, \nYuting Zhu, \nFei Gao, \nGuixing Ren, \nLizhen Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"befa83aef241f0e5c87a296575865d68ea348a1f10fe370d10f6d0bdd79115ee","category":"Environment"}
