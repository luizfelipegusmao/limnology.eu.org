{"title":"Slaughterhouse Wastewater Properties Assessment by Modern and Classic Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0485/v1","date":1720180406000,"content":"Advanced 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) relaxometry and diffusometry methods and VIS-nearIR spectroscopy combined with pH, electric conductivity (EC) and totally dissolved solids (TDS) measurements were used to assess the properties of wastewater collected from a chicken slaughterhouse in each step of the treatment process (wastewater before treatment, biologically treated wastewater, chemically treated wastewater and discharged wastewater) and from sludge. The 1H NMR Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) and Pulsed-Gradient-Stimulated-Echo (PGSE) decay curves recorded for all samples of wastewater were analyzed by inverse Laplace transform (ILT) to obtain the distributions of transverse relaxation times T2 and diffusion coefficient D. The VIS-nearIR total absorbance, T2-values, D-values, pH, EC and TDS parameters were used for statistical analysis in principal component analysis (PCA). The 1H T2-distributions measured for the slaughterhouse wastewater lie in two main regions reflecting the amount of dissolved solids or the distribution of undissolved solids mobility. The PCA analysis successfully differentiates between polluted and less polluted types of wastewater and sludge. The wastewater treatment applied by the slaughterhouse is efficient. The recommended methods for wastewater monitoring are the NMR T2- and D-distributions and EC, TDS and NMR-D diffusion coefficient. Finally, Machine Learning AI-algorithms are used to provide prediction maps of wastewater treatment stage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"696c01fee9fe6230aa44f500566af449bb925a8c2a552e4bf36f18253055ca7a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
