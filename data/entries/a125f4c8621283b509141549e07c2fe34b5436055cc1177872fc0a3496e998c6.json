{"title":"Strategic Deductive Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Dual-Agent Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1875/v1","date":1727171891000,"content":"This study explores the enhancement of deductive reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) through a strategic dual-agent framework. In this framework, one agent acts as a questioner and another as an answerer, with both employing advanced linguistic and logical processing to optimize information exchange. Utilizing a structured environment that limits query opportunities, our approach emphasizes the development of LLMs that can efficiently generate and interpret questions to deduce hidden information effectively. The models, which incorporate self-defined agents with a combination of pretraining and llama-3-8b enhancements, demonstrate a remarkable ability to navigate the complexities of logical deduction. Performance evaluations, based on a series of simulated interactions, illustrate the agents' improved precision and strategic acumen in narrowing down possibilities through targeted inquiries. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs in tasks requiring intricate reasoning and collaboration, marking a significant step towards more intelligent and autonomous systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a125f4c8621283b509141549e07c2fe34b5436055cc1177872fc0a3496e998c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
