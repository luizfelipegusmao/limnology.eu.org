{"title":"The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Military Systems: Impacts on National Security and Citizen Perception","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2328/v1","date":1727661764000,"content":"This study examines the rationale and perceptions surrounding AI in military technologies, focusing on its application in autonomous weapons systems (AWS), intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and decision-support systems (DSS). AI models, such as unmanned aerial and ground platforms, showed high mission success rates, with 92% mission accomplishment, 95% true positive threat identification, and low false alarms. AI's effectiveness surpassed human operators, particularly in response time and threat detection. A global survey revealed mixed opinions: two-thirds believed AI enhances national security, yet 70% opposed autonomous weapons due to ethical concerns, particularly civilian casualties. The study highlights AI's advantages in improving decision-making speed and accuracy but acknowledges challenges such as ethical considerations and public trust in autonomous systems. Future research should address ethical AI models, international humanitarian law (IHL) standards in military operations, human-AI interaction in hazardous environments, and policies related to military robotics and accountability. Understanding and enhancing public awareness of AI in military contexts is also essential.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2428f9786f15c4012e3f1fdfcb93d33722e3323abac211dcb288f5bddf01e15a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
