{"title":"Disturbance Observer-Based Anti-shock Controller for Laser Beam Steering Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1893/v1","date":1714377375000,"content":"This paper presents an approach to improve the robustness of tip-tilt controllers for fast-steering mirror (FSM)-based laser beam steering (LBS) systems in the presence of dynamic disturbances such as external shocks. To this end, we propose the addition of a disturbance observer (DOB)-based anti-shock controller in parallel to the original linear servo control loop to improve its control performance in the presence of external shocks. To increase the tip-tilt control performance against external shocks, the DOB-based control method, which is an improved control method for eliminating nonperiodic disturbances, is implemented in the original tip-tilt control system. Results indicate that the control error of the DOB-based anti-shock controller decreased, resulting in an efficient improvement in its disturbance-rejection performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f12f4947470540bebb455b14929c89e1cd5b326c30d4b241f42c943749015e5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
