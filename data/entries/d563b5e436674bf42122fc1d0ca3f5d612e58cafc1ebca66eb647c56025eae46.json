{"title":"Analysis of Food Safety Import Notifications and Relevant Standards and Regulations for Aquaculture Products With a Focus on Antimicrobial Residues and Use","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/9427435?af=R","date":1728400787000,"content":"<p>The use of antimicrobials is essential for the aquaculture sector; however, their misuse is cause for concern because it could adversely affect the environment and human health. Irresponsible use of antimicrobials can lead to antimicrobial resistance and result in the presence of unwanted residues in aquaculture products. The establishment of maximum residue limits (MRLs) for antimicrobials is of great importance for monitoring their correct use, but the lack of harmonized standards as well as the regulatory gaps for the aquatic products create a challenging situation, as it is reflected in import notifications related to food safety. This paper collects information about current MRLs for antimicrobials in aquatic commodities in the main importing and exporting countries of aquatic products and compares them with each other and with MRLs set by <i>Codex Alimentarius</i>. This analysis highlighted the need for <i>Codex Alimentarius</i> guidance regarding MRLs for nine antimicrobials in aquaculture products (chlortetracycline, doxycycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, florfenicol, sulfadimethoxine + ormetoprim, sulfamerazine, tetracycline, and trimethoprim). This paper shows that there is still work to do to implement exhaustive science-based international standards for residues permitted in aquatic commodities and promote harmonization.</p>","author":"S.
