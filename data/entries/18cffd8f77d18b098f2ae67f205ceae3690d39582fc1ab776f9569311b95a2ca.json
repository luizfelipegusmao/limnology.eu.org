{"title":"Effect of temperature on metabolic stress and recovery of two Argyrosomus species from simulated catch‐and‐release angling","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12696?af=R","date":1709809203000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Catch-and-release (C&amp;R) angling has grown in popularity due to increasing numbers of conservation-minded anglers and regulations of recreational fisheries. C&amp;R is often assumed to cause low mortality but can cause physiological and physical impairment. Fish metabolism and temperature interact to play a critical role in the biological functioning of fish. Understanding the relationship between temperature, fish metabolism, and physiological impairment is important for effective fisheries management and conservation, particularly for C&amp;R angling in a changing thermal environment. We used respirometry to quantify post-release metabolic stress and recovery of two popular Namibian angling species (<i>Argyrosomus inodorus and A. coronus</i>) subjected to simulated C&amp;R angling across a range of temperatures. Metabolic stress and recovery time did not differ significantly between warm (<i>A. coronus</i>) and cold-water (<i>A. inodorus</i>) species at any test temperature. However, several specimens of both species failed to recover physiologically and physically after 10 hours, thereby indicating C&amp;R-related impairment and potential for mortality. Given the predator-rich environment of coastal waters in Namibia, best C&amp;R practices are needed to minimise post-release mortality.</p>","author":"Brett A. Pringle, \nMurray I.
