{"title":"Plumage coloration differs between offspring raised in natural cavities and nestboxes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/doi/10.1093/ornithology/ukae002/7517532?rss=1","date":1705017600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Most of our knowledge of secondary hole-nesting birds comes from populations breeding in human-provided nestboxes, yet these might differ from natural cavities in a number of parameters, including internal dimensions or microclimate, leading to differences in reproductive ecology. Here, we demonstrate differences in plumage coloration, an important visual signal of individual quality, in Blue Tit (<span>Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) and Great Tit (<span>Parus major</span>) nestlings raised in natural cavities and nestboxes. For this study, we collected feather samples over two breeding seasons and applied reflectance spectrophotometry to calculate color metrics. Carotenoid chroma was higher in nestbox-reared Blue Tits, whereas brightness was higher in nestbox-reared Great Tits (with a similar tendency for Blue Tits). The latter result might be explained by the better nutritional condition of Great Tit nestlings raised in nestboxes. Furthermore, we found no evidence for preference of adults expressing more elaborate plumage towards a specific cavity type in either species. Consequently, we assume that differences in nestling plumage reported here are driven by rearing conditions (nestboxes vs. natural cavities) and not by differences in plumage-based parental quality. Our study adds to the growing body of evidence confirming that anthropogenic environmental modifiers, such as nestboxes, might influence avian physiology and the resulting phenotype.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Ornithology Current Issue","siteHash":"4b42e15d9ceec568e037973cb16bc8a0448c103c6eaf3f714117d3650f8eefe7","entryHash":"7fa8f5084706b8d5edf8887679bc8bd8387ce2574456e5e7e7c22682d6f07a08","category":"Environment"}
