{"title":"Assessment of Hygroscopic Behavior of Arctic Aerosol by contemporary Lidar and Radiosonde Observations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2039/v1","date":1721901901000,"content":"This study aims to investigate the microphysical properties of Arctic, tropospheric aerosol in the transition from the Arctic Haze in spring towards the summer season in 2021. A special focus lies on the hygroscopicity of the aerosol. Therefore, a one-parameter growth curve model is applied to lidar data from the Koldewey Aerosol Raman Lidar (AWIPEV in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard) and simultaneous radiosonde measurements. Hygroscopic growth depends on different factors like aerosol diameter and chemical composition. To detangle this dependency, three trends in hygroscopicity are additionally investigated by classifying the aerosol first by its color ratio, and then by its season and altitude. Furthermore, two special days are discussed using Mie-theory. They show on the one side the complexity of analyzing hygroscopic growth by means of lidar data, but on the other side demonstrate that it is in fact measurable with this approach. For these two case studies we calculated, that the aerosol effective radius increased from 0.16 μm (dry) to 0.18 μm (wet), and from 0.28 μm to 0.32 μm for the second case.  Generally, we found two different modes of stronger or weaker hygroscopic particles and a complex altitude dependence with the least hygroscopic particles in the middle free troposphere.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5298a41ed830587c65f80b30cdb022d9d020a622c5f1a423d381237d0c1f43ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
