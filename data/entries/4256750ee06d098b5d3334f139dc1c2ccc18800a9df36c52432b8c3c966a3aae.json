{"title":"Emotional Eating and Uncontrolled Eating as Risk Predictors for Disordered Eating Attitudes in Candidates for Bariatric Surgery Treated at a Public Hospital in the Amazon","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1393/v1","date":1713773710000,"content":"This study analyzes the eating behavior and factors associated with the presence of disordered eating attitudes in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. It is a cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study conducted at a hospital in the Amazon region of Brazil. The Disordered Eating Attitude Scale reduced version (DEAS-s) was used to assess the risk of eating disorders and the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R21) to characterize eating behavior. A total of 205 patients participated, with a mean age of 37.5 ± 8.6 years, the majority being female (93.7%; p&amp;lt;0.001), the mean BMI was 45.3±6.7 kg/m2. It was found that cognitive restraint had the highest mean (52.6±19.9; p&amp;lt;0.001). As for the DEAS-s, the question with the highest mean was \"spending one or more days without eating or consuming only liquids to lose weight\" (2.80±1.99). Female participants had a higher score in the emotional eating (p=0.016). Disordered eating attitudes showed a correlation with emotional eating and uncontrolled eating. These results suggest that candidates for bariatric surgery may have susceptibility to eating disorders. The importance of a multidisciplinary team in monitoring during the preoperative period is highlighted.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4256750ee06d098b5d3334f139dc1c2ccc18800a9df36c52432b8c3c966a3aae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
