{"title":"Senescence in Adipose-Derived Stem Cells: Biological Mechanisms and Therapeutic Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0190/v1","date":1719908643000,"content":"Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) represent a subset of mesenchymal stem cells in every adipose compartment throughout the body. ADSCs can differentiate into various cell types, including chondrocytes, osteocytes, myocytes, and adipocytes. Moreover, they exhibit a notable potential to differentiate in vitro into cells from other germinal lineages, including endothelial cells and neurons. ADSCs have a wide range of clinical applications, from breast surgery to chronic wounds. Furthermore, they are a promising cell population for future tissue-engineering uses. Accumulating evidence indicates decreased proliferation and differentiation potential of ADSCs with increasing age, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, or exposure to radiotherapy. Therefore, recent literature thoroughly investigates this cell population's senescence mechanisms and how they can hinder their possible therapeutic applications. This review will discuss the biological mechanisms and the physio-pathological causes behind ADSC senescence and how they can impact cellular functionality. Moreover, we will examine the possible strategies to invert these processes, re-establishing the full regenerative potential of this progenitor population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b7ea3d5d5c503c236032b211b15c2fda40b3a6d47d1c7211d9c6c84297c42878","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
