{"title":"Nutraceutical Strategies for Aging: Looking Towards Parkinson’s Disease and Frailty","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2082/v1","date":1727327850000,"content":"Aging is a complex and inevitable biological process characterized by a gradual decline in physiological function, including increased oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. While aging is a natural part of life, it is often accompanied by various disorders collectively known as age-related diseases (ARDs) or aging disorders. These include neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s (PD), cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis, and frailty, among others. As the global population ages, the prevalence of ARDs such as PD and frailty is rising, necessitating innovative approaches to enhance healthy aging. Nutraceuticals are natural bioactive compounds in foods that offer health benefits beyond essential nutrition, which is pivotal in preventing and managing aging-related disorders. Nutraceuticals, with their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, offer promising strategies to counteract these processes and promote healthy aging. This review highlights the potential of nutraceuticals as valuable adjuncts in managing PD and frailty, two conditions intricately linked to ARD. By examining the differential impacts of these bioactive compounds on the underlying mechanisms of each condition, this study underscores the promise of nutraceuticals in promoting healthy aging. The review aims to inform future research and clinical strategies by advocating for developing novel bioactive compounds, using advanced delivery technologies, and integrating personalized approaches based on genetic and epigenetic profiles. These efforts will pave the way for more precise, effective, and individualized interventions, ultimately extending health span and preventing ARD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31c7807673252cc5aa0b798ded33660b2173101c134c0c61498cb6afa739d7d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
