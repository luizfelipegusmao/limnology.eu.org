{"title":"New Therapeutic Targets in Vitiligo","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0700/v1","date":1720504545000,"content":"Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by progressive depigmentation of the skin caused by the selective destruction of melanocytes. Although its etiopathogenesis remains unclear, multiple factors are believed to be involved, including genetic and metabolic factors linked to cellular oxidative stress, melanocyte adhesion defects, innate and adaptive immunity. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the role of different cellular mechanisms, including cytokines and chemokines interactions in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. Although there is no definitive cure for vitiligo, excessive progress has been made and several treatments have shown favourable results. A thorough understanding of the basis of the disease, uncover promising drug targets for future research, providing clinical researchers with valuable insights for developing improved treatment options.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8869d023638c829050aeff5a07b8996e63e391bcb2a20dc2266094c876272bfe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
