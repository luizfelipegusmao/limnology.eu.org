{"title":"Following carpel tunnel release, what factors affect whether patients return to the same or different hand surgeon for a subsequent procedure?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312159","date":1729605600000,"content":"<p>by Scott J. Halperin, Meera M. Dhodapkar, Neil Pathak, Peter Y. Joo, Xuan Luo, Jonathan N. Grauer</p>\r\nBackground <p>Following carpal tunnel release (CTR), patients may be indicated for subsequent hand surgery (contralateral CTR and/or trigger finger release [TFR]). While surgeons typically take pride in patient loyalty, the rate of returning to the same hand surgeons has not been previously characterized.</p> Methods <p>Patients undergoing CTR were isolated from 2010â€“2021 PearlDiver M151 dataset. Subsequent CTR or TFR were identified and characterized as being performed by the same or different surgeon, with patient factors associated with changing to a different surgeon determined by multivariable analyses.</p> Results <p>In total, 1,121,922 CTR patients were identified. Of these, subsequent surgery was identified for 307,385 (27.4%: CTR 289,455 [94.2%] and TFR 17,930 [5.8%]). Of the patients with a subsequent surgery, 257,027 (83.6%) returned to the same surgeon and 50,358 (16.4%) changed surgeons. Multivariable analysis found factors associated with changing surgeon (in order of decreasing odds ration [OR]) to be: TFR as the second procedure (OR 2.98), time between surgeries greater than 2-years (OR 2.30), Elixhauser-Comorbidity Index (OR 1.14 per 2-point increase), and male sex (OR 1.06), with less likely hood of changing for those with Medicare (OR 0.95 relative to commercial insurance) (p&lt;0.001 for each). Pertinent negatives included: age, Medicaid, and having a 90-day adverse event after the index procedure.</p> Conclusions <p>Over fifteen percent of patients who required a subsequent CTR or TFR following CTR did not return to the same surgeon. Understanding what factors lead to outmigration of patients form a practice may help direct efforts for patient retention.</p>","author":"Scott J.
