{"title":"Stress-Related Roles of Exosomes and Exosomal miRNAs in Common Neuropsychiatric Disorders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1659/v1","date":1716554880000,"content":"Exosomes, natural nanovesicles that contain a cargo of biologically active molecules such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, are released from cells to the extracellular environment. They then act as autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine mediators of communication between cells by delivering their cargo into recipient cells and causing downstream effects. Exosomes are greatly enriched in miRNAs, which are small non-coding RNAs that act as cytoplasmic posttranscriptional repression agents, modulating the translation of mRNAs into proteins, as well as nuclear transcriptional gene activators. Neuronal exosomal miRNAs have important physiologic functions in the Central Nervous System (CNS), including cell-to-cell communication, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis, as well as modulating stress and inflammatory responses. Stress-induced changes of exosomal functions include effects on neurogenesis and neuroinflammation, which can lead to the appearance of various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's and Huntingtonâ€™s's diseases. The current knowledge regarding the roles of exosomes in the pathophysiology of common mental disorders is discussed in this review.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0275fbe05e4e2d4c8d7bc0b517bdbc336b6efb4cd418fcf0e86655d372ab43e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
