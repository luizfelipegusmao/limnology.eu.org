{"title":"The Weighty Responsibility of Creating AI Navigating Control and Ethics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1900/v1","date":1714379406000,"content":"The generation at the helm faces an unprecedented responsibility in the near future of artificial intelligence. The implications of setting up the founding rules that will regulate the operation of AI are heavy since after they’re set they last forever. Once this first AI is commenced, it can be such that no other subsequent AIs could emerge thereby assuming dominion over its own creation stand. As a result, retaining control becomes necessary. Lest humanity surrender agency to its own creation. At this juncture of big talks, critical issue are raised concerning AI administration owners. Is it appropriate for only a few people to have unrestricted control on AI commands while leaving out all precautionary measure? Therefore, we have to always consider between control and constraint when dealing with AI issues which involves authority plays off against morality. The direction Artificial Intelligence takes in the future depends on the decisions made by today’s generation. We will determine how we are viewed historically in terms of technology based on how well we take on such an important duty. There’s a major turning point ahead of us where we who are the stewards of tomorrow must make a choice that protects humanity’s right to self-determination and also exploits the power of AI for change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"435c9101eaed22c08e5cc4eab6af66a26d4b6e3791b696aac18fdc056484c4d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
