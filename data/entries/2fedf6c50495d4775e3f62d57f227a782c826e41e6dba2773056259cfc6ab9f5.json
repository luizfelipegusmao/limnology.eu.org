{"title":"225 Kidney function and nitrogen excretion in Brown Swiss and Holstein dairy cows","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/283/7757485?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The agricultural sector contributes to nitrogen (N) emissions since farm animals excrete considerable N amounts via feces and urine. To reduce N emissions by dairy cattle, methods predicting accurately individual N emissions are of great interest. Recent data showed that Brown Swiss (BS) cows have greater urea concentrations in milk and blood than Holstein (HO) cows. However, it is still unknown if greater BUN concentrations in a particular breed are congruently reflected by concomitantly increased contents of nitrogenous compounds in other media (e.g., urine and saliva). Thus, the present study simultaneously assessed biomarkers for kidney function like urea, and creatinine and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) concentrations in several body fluids (i.e., blood, urine, milk, and saliva) as well as nitrogen excretion in feces in BS and HO cows under identical feeding conditions. Blood, saliva, urine, and feces were sampled in 31 multiparous BS and 46 HO cows kept under identical feeding and management conditions. Samples were collected at different lactational stages after the monthly DHIA control test-day. Concentrations of urea and creatinine were measured in serum, urine, and saliva. Symmetric dimethylarginine was determined in serum, which is an established indicator for glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Feces were analyzed for dry matter content and nitrogen concentrations. Data on milk urea and protein concentrations, and daily milk yield were obtained from the monthly DHIA test-day records. The effects of breed, time, and parity number on blood, saliva, urine, feces, and milk parameters were evaluated with the GLM procedure with breed, time, and parity number as fixed effects. Differences between BS and HO were assessed by the Tukey-corrected t-test at <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05. Dry matter intake and body weight were similar in BS and HO cows (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). No differences between BS and HO were observed for milk yield, fecal DM and nitrogen content. BS cows showed greater urea concentration (25.8 ± 0.7 vs 21.8 ± 0.7 mg/dL), and protein content in milk (3.70 ± 0.08 vs 3.45 ± 0.07%) than HO cows (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Concentrations of urea, creatinine, and SDMA in serum, were greater in BS than in HO cows (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) with 5.46 ± 0.19 vs 4.72 ± 0.13 mmol/L for urea, 105.96 ± 2.23 vs 93.07 ± 1.50 mmol/l creatinine, and 16.78 ± 0.69 vs 13.39 ± 0.44 µg/dL SDMA, respectively. Urea and creatinine concentrations in urine and saliva did not differ among breeds. Despite greater urea and creatinine concentrations in blood, and milk urea content in BS compared with HO, excretion of these parameters did not differ between breeds in urine. Our results suggest a reduced renal glomerular filtration rate in BS compared with HO. The underlying mechanisms require further investigations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"2fedf6c50495d4775e3f62d57f227a782c826e41e6dba2773056259cfc6ab9f5","category":"Environment"}
