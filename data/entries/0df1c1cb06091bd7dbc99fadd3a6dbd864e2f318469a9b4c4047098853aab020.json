{"title":"Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Dexmedetomidine in In Vivo Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Rat Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0799/v1","date":1726033391000,"content":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is increasingly used in intensive care units; however, ECMO can modify drug pharmacokinetics (PK), leading to underexposure and associated treatment failure. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of ECMO on the PK of dexmedetomidine (DEX). In vivo rat models were developed, both of which involved a bolus injection of DEX and concentration monitoring. In the in vivo model experiment, rats which underwent ECMO were compared with a control group. PK analysis of in vivo data (noncompartmental analysis and nonlinear mixed-effects modelling) was carried out to determine the effect of ECMO. In vivo PK exploration showed that ECMO induced a decrease in DEX clearance. Because the effect of ECMO on the PK of DEX is not clinically significant, normal DEX dosing for critically ill patients should be effective for patients undergoing ECMO.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0df1c1cb06091bd7dbc99fadd3a6dbd864e2f318469a9b4c4047098853aab020","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
