{"title":"Observation and quantitative analysis of dislocations in steel using electron channeling contrast imaging method with precise control of electron beam incident direction","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/73/4/308/7479919?rss=1","date":1702944000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) was applied by precisely controlling the primary electron beam incident direction of the crystal plane in scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the dislocation contrast in steel materials was investigated in detail via SEM/ECCI. The dislocation contrast was observed near a channeling condition, where the incident electron beam direction of the crystal plane varied, and the backscattered electron intensity reached a local minimum. Comparing the dislocation contrasts in the visualized electron channeling contrast (ECC) images and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images, the positions of all dislocation lines were coincident. During the SEM/ECCI observation, the dislocation contrast varied depending on the incident electron beam direction of the crystal plane and accelerating voltages, and optimal conditions existed. When the diffraction condition <strong>g</strong> and the Burgers vector <strong>b</strong> of dislocation satisfied the condition <strong>g⸱b </strong>= 0, the screw dislocation contrast in the ECC image disappeared. An edge dislocation line was wider than a screw dislocation line. Thus, the SEM/ECCI method can be used for dislocation characterization and the strain field evaluation around dislocation, like the TEM method. The depth information of SEM/ECCI, where the channeling condition is strictly satisfied, can be obtained from dislocation contrast deeper than 5<span>ξ</span><sub>g</sub>, typically used for depth of SEM/ECCI.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"8e2c4d73560079bb76218fb46607b5a1a08c977f0090a233b28d84a347c54d02","category":"Environment"}
