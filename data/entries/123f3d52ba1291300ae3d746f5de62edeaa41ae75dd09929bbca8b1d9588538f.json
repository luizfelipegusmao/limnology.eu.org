{"title":"Gravitational Lensing Effects from Models of Loop Quantum Gravity with Rigorous Quantum Parameters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1122/v1","date":1726378392000,"content":"Many previous works have studied gravitational lensing effects from Loop Quantum Gravity. So far, Gravitational lensing effects from Loop Quantum Gravity have only been studied by choosing large quantum parameters much larger than the Planck scale. However, by construction, the quantum parameters of the effective models of Loop Quantum Gravity are usually related to the Planck length and, thus, are extremely small. In this work, by strictly imposing the quantum parameters as initially constructed, we study the true quantum corrections of gravitational lensing effects by five effective black hole models of Loop Quantum Gravity. Our study reveals several interesting results, including the different scales of quantum corrections displayed by each model and the connection between the quantum correction of deflection angles and the quantum correction of the metric. Observables related to the gravitational lensing effect are also obtained for all models in the case of SgrA* and M87*.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"123f3d52ba1291300ae3d746f5de62edeaa41ae75dd09929bbca8b1d9588538f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
