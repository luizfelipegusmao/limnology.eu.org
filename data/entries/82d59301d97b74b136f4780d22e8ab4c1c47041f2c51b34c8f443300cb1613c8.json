{"title":"Main Ships Propulsion Boiler Control and Hardware-in-Loop Model Implementation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0429/v1","date":1722993933000,"content":"The article presents the issues related to the operation and modelling of the ship main propulsion steam boiler. Such objects are used widely in seagoing ships especially the very large crude oil carriers as a main propulsion turbine feed. The advantages of such along with simple construction thus great reliability make oil feed boilers an excellent source of power for chosen type of the large ships. It must be pointed out that a lot of research work was done in the previous years regarding automatic control of boiler automation but since then this technology was not in the focus of the researchers. In the future the fossil fuels will become less important than they are now, but the control techniques of boilers would eventually change due to different fuel parameters therefore, development of such is necessary. The article presents the results of research collected in real ship boilers during their operation and then, based on the results, a digital model of such an object was created. This model was implemented into Hardware-In-Loop which is the initial step for preparing the full model (including sensors etc.) of a steam heated boiler. Theoretical background along with chosen simulation and experimental results of control implemented into HIL were presented to validate assumptions...","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"82d59301d97b74b136f4780d22e8ab4c1c47041f2c51b34c8f443300cb1613c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
