For instance, it has been shown that Cu-Pt nanoparticles can outperform pure Pt particles in important catalytic reactions such as the activation of propene [<a href=\"#ozae044.241-B2\">2</a>] or CO oxidation [<a href=\"#ozae044.241-B3\">3</a>]. Additionally, the wide range of possible bimetallic combinations is helpful for tailoring the chemical and physical properties of the nanostructures used in complex catalytic processes [<a href=\"#ozae044.241-B4\">4</a>]. However, the dynamic restructuring effects of bimetallic catalysts in a reactive environment can greatly change their catalytic potential. Changes in composition, morphology, and valence state can significantly degrade innovative nanomaterials. These changes in bimetallic structures can be overwhelming and difficult to analyze with a single characterization technique as many changes in phase, oxidation states, and composition can occur in a bimetallic system.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5eee90200a071af7f21599053c6047a6454cf00720a0582e2bd955d12ad698a6","category":"Environment"}
