The pinewood nematode (PWN), <i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i>, is the causal agent of pine wilt disease and is obligately vectored by pine sawyer beetles, of the genus <i>Monochamus</i>.\n\nFor the disease to be present, the habitat must be suitable for the PWN, and include at least one vector species, and at least one host species. To predict its potential distribution, a model must consider all three components. However, no comprehensive study has examined the influence of climatic suitability on the distribution of this “biological complex”. This study addresses this gap by incorporating biotic interactions, specifically involving 13 vectors and 61 host plants, into projections based on the PWN model. We predicted the global potential distribution of pine wilt disease and compared it with the PWN model to highlight the importance of including biotic interactions in species distribution models under climate change.\n\nWe found that the model revealed an overall trend of increasing suitability scores for both the PWN and pine wilt disease models under future climate scenarios. Furthermore, compared to the PWN model, the biotic model results in an apparent increase in suitability worldwide in the future as the climate will be more suitable to vector and host complexes, suggesting that pine wilt disease could potentially spread to other places via available hosts and vectors.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>. By incorporating biotic interactions, we projected a more accurate suitable area for pine wilt disease, offering valuable insights into regions at high risk for future invasions by the disease and its vectors. This information supports the development of management and early detection strategies in areas of high suitability, helping to mitigate potential economic and ecological losses. Additionally, this study introduces a novel approach for integrating biotic factors into species distribution models.\n</p>","author":"Ya Zou, \nXuezhen Ge, \nShixiang Zong, \nJonathan A.
