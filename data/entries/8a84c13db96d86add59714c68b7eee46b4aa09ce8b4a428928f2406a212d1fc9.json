{"title":"Examining the potential impacts of a coastal renourishment project on the presence and abundance of <i>Escherichia coli</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304061","date":1716559200000,"content":"<p>by Jordan A.

To combat this threat, management agencies often utilize renourishment, which supplements eroded beaches with offsite sand. This process can alter the physical characteristics of the beach and can influence the presence and abundance of microbial communities. In this study, we examined how an oceanic beach renourishment project may have impacted the presence and abundance of <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>), a common bacteria species, and sand grain size, a sediment characteristic that can influence bacterial persistence. Using an observational field approach, we quantified the presence and abundance of <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> in sand (from sub-tidal, intertidal, and dune zones on the beach) and water samples at study sites in both renourished and non-renourished sections of Folly Beach, South Carolina, USA in 2014 and 2015. In addition, we also measured how renourishment may have impacted sand grain size by quantifying the relative frequency of grain sizes (from sub-tidal, intertidal, and dune zones on the beach) at both renourished and non-renourished sites. Using this approach, we found that <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> was present in sand samples in all zones of the beach and at each of our study sites in both years of sampling but never in water samples. Additionally, we found that in comparison to non-renourished sections, renourished sites had significantly higher abundances of <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> and coarser sand grains in the intertidal zone, which is where renourished sand is typically placed. However, these differences were only present in 2014 and were not detected when we resampled the study sites in 2015. Collectively, our findings show that <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> can be commonly found in this sandy beach microbial community. In addition, our results suggest that renourishment has the potential to alter both the physical structure of the beach and the microbial community but that these impacts may be short-lived.","author":"Jordan A.
