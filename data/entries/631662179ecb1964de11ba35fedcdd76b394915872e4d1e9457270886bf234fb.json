{"title":"Global Mean Based Nearest Feature Object Value Selection with Feature Creation Method for Clustering Accuracy Improvement","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1036/v1","date":1723630326000,"content":"In the modern days the data is coming from various devices like mobiles, tabs, laptops, computers, IOT devices e.tc and is stored in the electronics form in the systems using the concept of files or data bases. Clustering Technique is used to extract data from these sources. Improving the accuracy of the model is improved using the feature selection or feature engineering or both. The feature engineering is used to add a new feature based on the global mean. Along with that new feature in addition to the feature selection increase the overall accuracy of the model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"631662179ecb1964de11ba35fedcdd76b394915872e4d1e9457270886bf234fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
