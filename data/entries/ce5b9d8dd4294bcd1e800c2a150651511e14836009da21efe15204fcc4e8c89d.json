{"title":"Intelligent Vehicle Classification System Based on Deep Learning and Multi-Sensor Fusion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2102/v1","date":1721967377000,"content":"With the rapid development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), vehicle type classification, as a key link in Automatic Toll Collection systems (ATC), is of great significance in improving traffic efficiency and reducing economic losses. This study proposes an intelligent vehicle classification system based on deep learning and multi-sensor data fusion to address the accuracy issues existing in vehicle classification methods based on optical sensors (OS) and human observers. The system significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of vehicle classification by combining deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), LiDAR sensors, and machine learning algorithms. We first constructed a large-scale annotated dataset containing multiple vehicle types and complex traffic scenes to improve our model's capability to identify different vehicle characteristics. Next, CNN models based on different architectures were designed to extract global and local features of the vehicle, respectively. In addition, the LiDAR sensor was used to achieve the spatial structure architectures of the vehicle and combined with the output of the CNN model to improve classification performance under occlusion and complex scenes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce5b9d8dd4294bcd1e800c2a150651511e14836009da21efe15204fcc4e8c89d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
