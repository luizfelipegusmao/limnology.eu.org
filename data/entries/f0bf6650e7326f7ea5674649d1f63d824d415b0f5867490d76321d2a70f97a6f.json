{"title":"Cinematographic study of stochastic chemical events at atomic resolution","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/73/2/101/7326077?rss=1","date":1697846400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The advent of single-molecule atomic-resolution time-resolved electron microscopy (SMART-EM) has created a new field of ‘cinematic chemistry,’ allowing for the cinematographic recording of dynamic behaviors of organic and inorganic molecules and their assembly. However, the limited electron dose per frame of video images presents a major challenge in SMART-EM. Recent advances in direct electron counting cameras and techniques to enhance image quality through the implementation of a denoising algorithm have enabled the tracking of stochastic molecular motions and chemical reactions with sub-millisecond temporal resolution and sub-angstrom localization precision. This review showcases the development of dynamic molecular imaging using the SMART-EM technique, highlighting insights into nanomechanical behavior during molecular shuttle motion, pathways of multistep chemical reactions, and elucidation of crystallization processes at the atomic level.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"f0bf6650e7326f7ea5674649d1f63d824d415b0f5867490d76321d2a70f97a6f","category":"Environment"}
