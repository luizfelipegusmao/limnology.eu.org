The objectives of the current study were to examine: (1) The differences in anxiety, depression, stress, and somatization levels between women diagnosed with GDM and healthy pregnant women. (2) The differences in anxiety, depression, stress, and somatization levels among women with well-controlled blood sugar levels compared to those who are not well-controlled. Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted, involving 103 women who had been pregnant at least once, including 40 women diagnosed with GDM and 63 healthy pregnant women. An online questionnaire was distributed and included three parts: a socio-demographic parameters, the DASS-21 questionnaire assessing anxiety, depression, and stress, and the BSI (Brief Symptom Inventory) questionnaire assessing somatization. Results: Differences in anxiety (t=14.470, &lt;.001), depression (t=8.17, &lt;.001), stress (t=16.354, &lt;.001), and somatization (t=13.679, &lt;.001) levels between women diagnosed with GDM and healthy pregnant women were found. Women diagnosed with GDM reported higher levels of anxiety, depression, stress, and somatization compared to those without GDM. Additionally, Women with better blood sugar control, indicated by lower glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, reported lower levels of anxiety. (t (38) = -2.04, p&lt;0.05), depression (t(38)= -2.88, p&lt;0.01), stress (t(38)= -1.88, p&lt;0.05), and somatization (t(38)= -1.88, p&lt;0.05) compared to women with poorer blood sugar control. Conclusion: Pregnant women diagnosed with GDM report higher levels of negative personality traits such as anxiety, depression, stress, and somatization compared to healthy pregnant women.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2fad453dadfd1f00007afa79eac0216d7ac8bdb3ef51f64e3508839155a4955","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
