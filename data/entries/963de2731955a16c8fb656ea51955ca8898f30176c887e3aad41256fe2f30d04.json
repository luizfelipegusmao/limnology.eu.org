{"title":"Exploring Phenolic Compounds in Crop By-Products for Cosmetic Efficacy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1410/v1","date":1713803287000,"content":"Phenolic compounds represent a group of secondary metabolites that serve essential functions in plants. Beyond their positive impact on plant, these phenolic metabolites, often referred to as polyphenols, possess a range of biological properties that can promote skin health. Scientific research indicates that using phenolics derived from plants topically can be advantageous, but the activity and stability highly depend on storage of the source material and the extract method. These compounds have the ability to relieve symptoms and hinder the progression of different skin diseases. Because they come from natural sources and have minimal toxicity, phenolic compounds show potential in addressing the causes and effects of skin aging, skin diseases, and various types of skin damage, such as wounds and burns. Hence, this review provides an extensive information of the particular crops from which by-product phenolic compounds can be sourced, but pointing the need investigation according to a proper storage plant material and the choice of the best extracting method, along with an examination of their specific functions and the mechanisms by which they act to protect skin.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"963de2731955a16c8fb656ea51955ca8898f30176c887e3aad41256fe2f30d04","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
