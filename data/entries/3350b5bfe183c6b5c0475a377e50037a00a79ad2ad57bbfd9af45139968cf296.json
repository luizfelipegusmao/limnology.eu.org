{"title":"Modulation of T-cell-dependent humoral immune response to influenza vaccine by multiple antioxidant/immunomodulatory micronutrient supplementation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0002/v1","date":1711958766000,"content":"In spite of prevalence gaps in several micronutrients supporting immune function, significance of their deficits/supplementation for efficacy of vaccines is underinvestigated. Thus, influence of supplementation combining vitamins C and D, zinc, selenium and manganese, and N-acetyl-cysteine on mouse IgG responses and underlying mechanisms to seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) was investigated. QIV was given in two doses (28 days apart). The supplementation starting 5 days before the first injection increased the total serum IgG titre, through stimulation of germinal centre (GC) reaction in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), as indicated by increase in the frequency of GC B cells and follicular CD4+ T helper (Th) cells, and IL-21-producing Th cells. Additionally, the supplementation “optimized” IgG response following the second QIV injection by supporting more favorable (in respect to virus clearance) IgG2a response through favoring Th1 differentiation as indicating by Th1 (INF-γ) /Th2 (IL-4) signature cytokine level ratio upon QIV restimulation in SLO cell cultures. This most likely reflected partly their antioxidant action (as indicated by redox status analyses) on Th cell differentiation. Thus, the study forms solid base for further research aimed at repurposing use this safe and inexpensive micronutrient combination as an adjuvant for virus influenza vaccine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3350b5bfe183c6b5c0475a377e50037a00a79ad2ad57bbfd9af45139968cf296","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
