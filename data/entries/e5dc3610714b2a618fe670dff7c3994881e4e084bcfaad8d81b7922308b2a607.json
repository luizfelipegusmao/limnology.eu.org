{"title":"Revolutionizing Banking: Neobanks’ Digital Transformation for Enhanced Efficiency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0197/v1","date":1712053130000,"content":"The changing of banking customer preferences after Covid-19 pandemic encourages banking transformation. Neobanks emerges as innovation in banking that enter the market to compete with the incumbent banks by offering new digital experience for customer. This paper analyzes the neobanks which transformed from traditional bank, specifically its efficiency after they implement digital transformation. Efficiency is measured by using Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). This study also uses Pooled Mean Group (PMG) of Panel ARDL (Autoregressive Distributed Lagged) to investigate digital transformation as one of determinants neobank’s efficiency, as well as to examine the existence of short-term and long-term relationship between digital transformation and efficiency. The SFA results show that the efficiency of the neobanks increase after they carry out digital transformation. Furthermore, from PMG Panel ARDL, it can be concluded that digital transformation is one of determinant of efficiency and there is longevity relationship between digital transformation and efficiency. In the short run, digital transformation has a significant and negative correlation with efficiency and in the long run, it has a significant positive relationship because initially digital transformation cost for operational and risk management innovation decreases the profit efficiency, but afterwards it increases the profit efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e5dc3610714b2a618fe670dff7c3994881e4e084bcfaad8d81b7922308b2a607","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
