{"title":"Socio-cultural Construction of Menstruation in the Ghanaian Context: A Qualitative Study of the Perspectives of Parents, Teachers and Adolescent Girls","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1527/v1","date":1729504943000,"content":"Background: Menstruation is a natural physiological process experienced by 1.8 billion girls, and pre-menopausal women globally, and can be experienced about 300 times in a woman’s lifetime. Even though menstruation is a sign of normal female reproductive functions and marks an important transition into womanhood for adolescent girls, it is bounded by several taboos, myths, misbeliefs, or misconceptions in low-and middle-income countries including Ghana. Hence, the topic and cultural practices around menstruation are rarely discussed, and the experiences of young girls during menarche and early menstrual life remain poorly captured. This study explored the cultural construction of menstruation in the Ghanaian context. \nMethods: This study was qualitative and adopted an exploratory study design. We used purposive and convenience sampling procedures for sampling five Senior High Schools and participants in the Volta Region of Ghana. 15 Focus Group Discussions (FGD) were conducted. This comprised five FGDs for female students, five FGDs for teachers, and five FGDs for parents. For each of the FGDs, 10 to 12 participants were sampled to participate in the discussion. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, translated, and imported into MAXQDA qualitative analysis software 2022 version for analysis. Data were coded and analyzed using a thematic analysis.\nResults: We found that there are a myriad of socio-cultural beliefs and practices that are associated with menstruation in Ghana. These beliefs such as menstrual blood is unclean and practices like celebration of menarche, and upholding some menstruation-related cultural/tribal taboos including household restrictions, religion, and social restrictions were identified. Our findings revealed that myths have long enveloped the facts about menstruation. \nConclusion: Cultural and social practices regarding menstruation depend on girls’ education, attitude, family environment, culture, and beliefs, pointing to the need for public health officials in the Ghanaian society to provide more culturally oriented education to the general public on menstruation and the impact of some conservative socio-cultural practices on the menstrual health of adolescents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc79d7c566c89f2f6e4088658ecb5c0c0fc551c76d4de3a35b87932ae2b45d09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
