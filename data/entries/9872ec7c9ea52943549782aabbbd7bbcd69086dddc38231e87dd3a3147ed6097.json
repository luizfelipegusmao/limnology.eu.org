{"title":"Incorporation of Sub‐Resolution Porosity Into Two‐Phase Flow Models With a Multiscale Pore Network for Complex Microporous Rocks","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036393?af=R","date":1713194424000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Porous materials, such as carbonate rocks, frequently have pore sizes which span many orders of magnitude. This is a challenge for models that rely on an image of the pore space, since much of the pore space may be unresolved. In this work, sub-resolution porosity in X-ray images is characterized using differential imaging which quantifies the difference between a dry scan and 30 wt% potassium iodide brine saturated images. Once characterized, we develop a robust workflow to incorporate the sub-resolution pore space into a network model using Darcy-type elements called microlinks. Each grain voxel with sub-resolution porosity is assigned to the two nearest resolved pores using an automatic dilation algorithm. By including these microlinks with empirical models in flow modeling, we simulate single-phase and multiphase flow. By fine-tuning the microlink empirical models, we match permeability, formation factor (the ratio of the resistivity of a rock filled with brine to the resistivity of that brine), and drainage capillary pressure to experimental results. We then show that our model can successfully predict steady-state relative permeability measurements on a water-wet Estaillades carbonate sample within the uncertainty of the experiments and modeling. Our approach of incorporating sub-resolution porosity in two-phase flow modeling using image-based multiscale pore network techniques can capture complex pore structures and accurately predict flow behavior in porous materials with a wide range of pore size.</p>","author":"Sajjad Foroughi, \nBranko Bijeljic, \nYing Gao, \nMartin J.
