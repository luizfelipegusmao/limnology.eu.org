The occurrence of multiple pathogens in stool samples of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in resource-limited countries have been repeatedly described. In this study, we assessed the differentiated effects of combined pathogen detections on recorded symptoms. A case-control study was conducted among 620 under-five-year-old children in rural northeastern Tanzania with emphasis of multiple detection. The median age of children was 11 months (IQR = 7, 20), and 52.1% were male. Cases (50.2%, n = 157) were less likely than controls (64.5%, n = 198) to have multiple colonization with gastrointestinal tract (GIT) pathogens. The children’s age was positively associated with the likelihood of harboring multiple GIT pathogens [OR, 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.04]. <i>Shigella</i> spp./enteroinvasive <i>Escherichia coli</i> (EIEC) [OR = 2.80, 95% CI 1.62, 4.83] and norovirus [OR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.23, 3.39] were more common in cases and were strongly associated with diarrhea, while enteroaggregative <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> (EAEC) [OR = 0.23, 95%CI 0.17–0.33] were more common in controls. Diarrheal diseases in under-five children from rural Tanzania are likely to be due to infections with Shigella spp./EIEC, and norovirus with strongly age-dependent associations.","author":"Daniel Haile Chercos","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e96c99a1fc76121144516a9dc7d14a44e4be7538e2af87ad2477487ac3dc39a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
