{"title":"A bold new purpose for an old method: Using invertebrate kick‐netting to improve monitoring of microplastic pollution in running waters","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lom3.10585?af=R","date":1708082732000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Freshwaters are impacted by many pollutants. Scientists and resource managers need to reliably detect and monitor these pollutants by employing appropriate sampling techniques to quantify and mitigate their impacts. Emerging freshwater contaminants such as microplastics are difficult to monitor as effective sampling techniques have not been fully developed and lack standardization. Here, we propose a novel method, adapted from stream invertebrate kick-net sampling, which can be employed for long-term, standardized microplastic monitoring. We hypothesized that invertebrate kick-net sampling would be effective at collecting microplastics, capturing higher microplastic concentrations than standard microplastic sampling, due to collecting suspended and benthic microplastics simultaneously. We sampled 28 streams for microplastics using standard drift and sediment microplastic collection methods and invertebrate kick-netting. As predicted, kick-netting captured microplastics at higher concentrations than conventional sampling, regardless of whether values were expressed per volume of water (as in drift samples), per kg of sediment or per area sampled (as in benthic samples). Consequently, kick-net sampling has the potential to be a time- and cost-efficient tool for monitoring microplastic pollution. We recommend the employment of invertebrate kick-netting as a new, standardized means to investigate and routinely monitor microplastic concentrations worldwide. This would generate a more robust dataset of global freshwater microplastic pollution, making it possible to answer unresolved questions pertaining to changes in microplastic pollution profiles. Standardized, long-term records of microplastic concentrations in freshwaters would also allow a more accurate assessment of the ecological risks of microplastic pollution. Finally, long-term microplastic data could be used to inform much-needed regulatory decisions pertaining to microplastic pollution.</p>","author":"Aidan Mora‐Teddy, \nGerry P. Closs, \nChristoph D.
