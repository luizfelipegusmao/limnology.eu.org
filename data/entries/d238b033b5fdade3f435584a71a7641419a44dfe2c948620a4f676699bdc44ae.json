{"title":"LC–MS-MS method for mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine in hair and its application in authentic hair samples of suspected kratom abusers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/6/429/7680334?rss=1","date":1716422400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Kratom is a natural psychoactive product known primarily in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Malaysia, etc. It is also known as krathom, kakuam, ithang, thom (Thailand), biak-biak, ketum (Malaysia) and mambog (Philippines) and is sometimes used as an opium substitute. It is stimulant at doses of 1–5 g, analgesic at doses of 5–15 g and euphoric and sedative at doses of &gt;15 g. Mitragynine is the most abundant indole compound in kratom (<span>Mitragyna speciosa</span>) and is metabolized in humans to 7-hydroxymitragynine, the more active metabolite. Adverse effects include seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, restlessness, tremors, hallucinations and death. There are few studies on the analytical method for the detection of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine in hair. Therefore, this study proposes a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS-MS) method for the analysis of kratom in hair. Hair samples were first weighed to ∼10 mg and washed with methanol. Then the washed hair samples were cut into pieces and incubated in methanol with stirring and heating (16 h/38℃). Extracts were then analyzed by LC–MS-MS. This method was validated by determining the limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification, linearity, intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision, recovery and matrix effects. The intra- and inter-day precision (CV%) and accuracy (bias%) were within ±20%, which was considered acceptable. Using this newly developed LC–MS-MS method, the simultaneous detection of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine in six authentic hair samples was achieved to provide the direct evidence of kratom use in the past. Mitragynine concentrations ranged from 16.0 to 2,067 pg/mg (mean 905.3 pg/mg), and 7-hydroxymitragynine concentrations ranged from 0.34 to 15 pg/mg (mean 7.4 pg/mg) in six authentic hair samples from kratom abusers. This may be due to the higher sensitivity of the LOD in this study, with values of 0.05 pg/mg for mitragynine and 0.2 pg/mg for 7-hydroxymitragynine in hair.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"d238b033b5fdade3f435584a71a7641419a44dfe2c948620a4f676699bdc44ae","category":"Environment"}
