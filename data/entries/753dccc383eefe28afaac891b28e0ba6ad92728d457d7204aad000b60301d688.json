Knowledge of preventive measures would enable the adjustment of preventive policies. Hence this study on knowledge and practices in rural Senegal. This was a cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical survey of subjects aged at least 18 and living in the commune of Niakhene, carried out in October 2020. A systematic random sample, stratified by sex and age group, was used. The questionnaire was based on the STEPS 2015 tool and a review of the literature. In addition to personal characteristics, the questionnaire was used to measure knowledge of symptoms, complications, risk factors, attitude to the disease and screening practices. Descriptive and analytical analyses were performed using R 4.0.2 software. A total of 300 subjects were surveyed. The average age was 35.3 years (+/-16.9), and 52.3% were women. Knowledge (62.7%) was associated with higher education (ORaj2.46{1.16–3.44}), awareness by healthcare staff (ORaj2.88{1.60–5.34}), and a family history of diabetes (ORaj3.09{1.06–11.3}). The positive attitude (53%) was associated with male sex (ORaj1.98{2.07–7.52}), awareness via audio-visual information sources (ORaj3.87{2.07–7.52}), community awareness (ORaj 3.87{2.07–7.52}), existence of a family history of hypertension and knowledge of diabetes (ORaj3.34{2.5–7.69}). Screening was carried out in 34.3% of patients. The associated risk factors were male sex (ORaj 1.95{1.12–3.34}), higher education (ORaj2.49{1.12–559}) and positive attitudes to diabetes (ORaj1.83{1.04–3.26}). One of the most effective interventions against this disease is the adoption of preventive measures which involve early detection and strengthening communication for more effective prevention.","author":"Amadou Ibra Diallo","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"753dccc383eefe28afaac891b28e0ba6ad92728d457d7204aad000b60301d688","category":"Environment"}
