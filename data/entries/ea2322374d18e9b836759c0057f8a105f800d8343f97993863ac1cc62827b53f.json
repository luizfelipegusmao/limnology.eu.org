{"title":"The Role of Ranolazine in the Treatment of Ventricular Tachycardia and Atrial Fibrillation: \nA Narrative Review of the Clinical Evidence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1881/v1","date":1716958895000,"content":"Cardiac arrhythmias are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. While antiarrhythmic drugs traditionally represent the first-line management strategy, their use is often limited by profound proarrhythmic effects. Several studies, including randomized control trials (RCTs), have demonstrated the antiarrhythmic efficacy of ranolazine, registered as an antianginal agent while also establishing its safety profile. This review compiles clinical evidence investigating the antiarrhythmic properties of ranolazine, focusing primarily on ventricular tachycardia (VT) and atrial fibrillation (AF), as common rhythm abnormalities with serious complications. Data from RCTs indicate that ranolazine reduces VT incidence, although this effect is not universal. Therefore, we attempt to better describe the patient population that gains the most benefit from ranolazine by VT suppression. Additionally, ranolazine is known to enhance the conversion rate of AF to sinus rhythm when combined with other antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, highlighting its synergistic effect in the atrium without provoking ventricular dysrhythmias. Despite the heterogeneity in currently available data, ranolazine appears to be an effective and safe option for the management of various arrhythmias.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea2322374d18e9b836759c0057f8a105f800d8343f97993863ac1cc62827b53f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
