Yet, the immediate, acute effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure on respiratory symptoms, such as cough, are less understood. This pilot study aims to investigate this relationship using objective PM<sub>2.5</sub> and cough monitors. Fifteen participants from rural Madagascar were followed for three days, equipped with an RTI Enhanced Children’s MicroPEM PM<sub>2.5</sub> sensor and a smartphone with the ResApp Cough Counting Software application. Univariable Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models were applied to measure the association between hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and cough counts. Peaks in both PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration and cough frequency were observed during the day. A 10-fold increase in hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration corresponded to a 39% increase in same-hour cough frequency (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.74). The strength of this association decreased with a one-hour lag between PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and cough frequency (IRR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.44) and was not significant with a two-hour lag (IRR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.23). This study demonstrates the feasibility of objective PM<sub>2.5</sub> and cough monitoring in remote settings. An association between hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and cough frequency was detected, suggesting that PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure may have immediate effects on respiratory health. Further investigation is necessary in larger studies to substantiate these findings and understand the broader implications.","author":"Alexandra J.
