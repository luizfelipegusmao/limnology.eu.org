{"title":"Clinical Role of Adjuvant Chemotherapy after Sublobar Resection for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer &le; 20 mm with Lymph Node Metastases: A Propensity-Matched Analysis of the National Cancer Database","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0770/v1","date":1715591375000,"content":"Sublobar resection is a standard surgical procedure for small-sized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, clinical role of adjuvant chemotherapy for small-sized NSCLC with pathological lymph node (LN) metastasis after sublobar resection is unknown. National Cancer Database was queried for NSCLC patients between 2004 and 2018. Eligibility included sublobar resection with pathological LN metastasis, R0 resection, Charlson comorbidity score = 0, clinical stage T1a-b, and tumor size â‰¤ 20 mm. Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses were used for assessing survival. Samples were evaluated before and after propensity score matching (PSM) with respect to age, sex, histologic type, and pathological LN status. Of 810 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 567 (70.0%) underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. After PSM, patients with adjuvant chemotherapy had a significantly longer survival than those without (median survival: 64.3 vs. 34.0 months, hazard ratio for death: 0.61, p &lt; 0.0001). Multivariate analyses after PSM showed that younger age (p = 0.0206), female (p = 0.0005), and adjuvant chemotherapy (p &lt; 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors for longer survival. Adjuvant chemotherapy has a prognostic impact in patients with small-sized NSCLC and pathological lymph node metastasis who undergo sublobar resection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e88defc377ef54c746eb8914572bffa0557dedc3207745b8e84b73f94fc5aa88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
