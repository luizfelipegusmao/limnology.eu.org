{"title":"Digital image processing: A new tool for morphological measurements of freshwater turtles under rehabilitation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300253","date":1710424800000,"content":"<p>by Ashish Kumar Panda, Vikas Verma, Anupam Srivastav, Ruchi Badola, Syed Ainul Hussain</p>\r\n\r\nFreshwater fauna is facing an uphill task for survival in the Ganga Basin, India, due to a range of factors causing habitat degradation and fragmentation, necessitating conservation interventions. As part of the ongoing efforts to conserve the freshwater fauna of the Basin, we are working on rehabilitating rescued freshwater chelonians. We carry out various interventions to restore rescued individuals to an apparent state of fitness for their release in suitable natural habitats. Morphometric measurements are crucial to managing captive wild animals for assessing their growth and well-being. Measurements are made using manual methods like vernier caliper that are prone to observer error experience and require handling the specimens for extended periods. Digital imaging technology is rapidly progressing at a fast pace and with the advancement of technology. We acquired images of turtles using smartphones along with manual morphometric measurements using vernier calipers of the straight carapace length and straight carapace width. The images were subsequently processed using ImageJ, a freeware and compared with manual morphometric measurements. A significant decrease in the time spent in carrying out morphometric measurements was observed in our study. The difference in error in measurements was, however, not significant. A probable cause for this may have been the extensive experience of the personnel carrying out the measurements using vernier caliper. Digital image processing technology can cause a significant reduction in the stress of the animals exposed to handling during measurements, thereby improving their welfare. Additionally, this can be used in the field to carry out morphometric measurements of free-ranging individuals, where it is often difficult to capture individuals, and challenges are faced in obtaining permission to capture specimens.","author":"Ashish Kumar Panda","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dcc8bda3cd688b8680ffb2e1d86e5a192b0ac0607dc006f9002f708bfc4f635b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
