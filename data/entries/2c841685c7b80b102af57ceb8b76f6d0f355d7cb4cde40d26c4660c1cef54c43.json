{"title":"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: Regulation, Cytokine Signaling, and Gaps in Our Knowledge","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1435/v1","date":1721212393000,"content":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [IPF] is a chronic progressive disease characterised by the accumulation of scar tissue in the lung parenchyma. It primarily occurs in middle-aged and elderly adults and results in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The disease occurs due to repetitive lung epithelial injury, subsequent fibroblast activation and myofibroblast differentiation, resulting in excessive extracellular matrix deposition. This leads to scar formation and subsequent loss of lung function. Current treatment options for patients with IPF include the two anti-fibrotic drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, which can slow disease progression; however, there are currently no known cures for the disease. As such, novel methods and drug targets are warranted. In this review, we provide an up-to-date account of the importance of specific cytokines and the potential role of regulatory immune cells. We discuss their role in the pathogenesis of IPF and address some of the key gaps in knowledge.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c841685c7b80b102af57ceb8b76f6d0f355d7cb4cde40d26c4660c1cef54c43","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
