Turbine blades within the hot-section of an engine are subjected to extreme environments, i.e. high temperature and corrosive gases from the fuel combustion process, resulting in degradation and generation of deleterious defects such as cracks [<a href=\"#ozae044.107-B1\">1</a>]. Due to the cost prohibitive nature of turbine blade replacement, repair has become a critical aspect of the maintenance process [<a href=\"#ozae044.107-B2\">2</a>]. One such method for repair is wide-gap brazing (WGB). Originally developed in the 1970's, WGB has been extensively utilized in the repair of hot-section turbine components in power generation and aerospace industries [<a href=\"#ozae044.107-B2\">2</a>]. WGB employs a mixture of high-melt and braze powders that are pre-mixed prior to insertion into the crack or defect. Although conventional WGB has shown much success in repairing Ni-superalloy components, limitations arise from the pre-mixed nature of the process, particularly the residual porosity. Typically, the larger the average braze particle size, the larger the potential porosity upon melting, with these pores being notoriously difficult to fill [<a href=\"#ozae044.107-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.107-B4\">4</a>]. To overcome these difficulties, a layered variant of WGB has been proposed, where first the high-melt powder is placed into the defect region, e.g. crack, and the braze powder is placed on top of it [<a href=\"#ozae044.107-B2\">2</a>]. In this configuration, the high-melting alloy forms a skeleton for the liquid braze to flow into. As a result, larger cracks can be repaired without excessive braze powder, reducing deleterious solidification products and residual porosity in the joint. Although there has been extensive research on conventional WGB and its microstructural and process evolution, the layered variant has received comparatively little attention [<a href=\"#ozae044.107-B5\">5</a>-<a href=\"#ozae044.107-B7\">7</a>]. In a recent review by Way et al., the need to explore the use of advanced imaging modalities including X-ray-based techniques for brazing research was emphasized to better understand the relevant metallurgical phenomena [<a href=\"#ozae044.107-B8\">8</a>]. As such, this study aims to build on the fundamental understanding of brazing, utilizing 3D X-Ray microscopy (XRM), to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the layered WGB variant.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ae35b4674a9a620f5a5787bb90988fc24d8d4997d875b3e51cf9f2575ba37f13","category":"Environment"}
