{"title":"Forest Owners’ Intention to Safeguard Forest Biodiversity: An Application of the Theory of Planned Behavior","link":"https://academic.oup.com/forestscience/article/70/1/64/7333960?rss=1","date":1698710400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Private nonindustrial forest owners’ intention to safeguard biodiversity in their own forest was studied by applying the theory of planned behavior. The data were collected in a nationwide mail survey sent to 3,000 Finnish forest owners (response rate 35%). The impact of attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control on the intention to safeguard biodiversity was empirically tested by estimating structural equation models (SEM). The empirical estimations supported the theoretical model. The influence of perceived behavioral control was inhibiting on the intention and slightly stronger than the explanatory power of attitude or the subjective norm. External factors had an impact on the explanatory pattern of the intention. The effect of subjective norm increased and the role of attitude decreased with age. Academic education increased the importance of attitudes and decreased the role of normative pressures. In the development of voluntary measures aimed at safeguarding biodiversity, special attention should be paid to the reduction of the obstacles for the implementation perceived by forest owners. Forest owners often perceive important to retain decision-making power for the next generation. Forest owners should be provided with information about the different measures for safeguarding biodiversity and the contract terms.<strong>Study Implications</strong>: Forest owners consider active timber production, compensation level, willingness to retain decision-making power for the next generation, and small forest ownership as factors that inhibit their intention to safeguard biodiversity in their own forests. Forest owners’ attitude toward safeguarding forest biodiversity and the normative pressures the reference groups create have a slightly smaller effect on intention. It is important to take the views of forest owners into account when developing voluntary measures for safeguarding biodiversity. It is essential to distribute information to forest owners about the available measures, their requirements, and compensation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Forest Science Current Issue","siteHash":"05e2fee9ae6a27cd288c89ae75adf607539d339849a171c4fab1eaa2f11b4162","entryHash":"5bd9ea625ce4cb395d388d5a7445e3320329a0ff65058cc16e3883d0a41bbcb0","category":"Environment"}
