{"title":"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in Wild Boar (Sus scrofa) in Portugal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0993/v1","date":1713245161000,"content":"Paratuberculosis, or Johne's disease, caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), is a chronic granulomatous enteritis affecting both domestic and wild ruminants. The agent was also found in wild mammals such as wild boar (Sus scrofa), however, the role of wild mammals in the epidemiology of MAP is unclear. During the research period, 941 free-ranging wild boar (S. scrofa) legally hunted in two locations in the Centre-eastern region of Portugal were examined. Ninety-seven wild boar exhibited one or more gross lesions and were tested for the presence of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis using acid-fast staining, mycobacterial culture, poly-merase chain reaction (PCR), and histopathological examination. Forty-five animals (46.4%, 95% CI: 36.5-56.3%) were identified as infected, as indicated by positive results in culture and/or PCR. The findings revealed that the most significant risk factor was being a juvenile compared to year-lings and adults (OR = 10.2, 95% CI: 2.2-48.0). Based on our results, 37.9% (n = 11) of the infected animals were considered suitable for human consumption. Our findings offer novel insights into mycobacterial infections in wild boar populations in Portugal and suggest that wild boar could be a source of human infection if zoonotic potential is considered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b843b8d5f6209f3fe7d085a2334b38c001130c9affb83a1cbeb8b58c3f6ba51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
