{"title":"End‐user preferences to enhance prospects for varietal acceptance and adoption in potato breeding in Uganda","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.12882?af=R","date":1715852592000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Potato varieties have diverse biophysical characteristics, so it is important for breeders to have the capacity to choose those that meet the preferences of end users, such as mealiness, firmness, and taste, among others. Combining user preferences with descriptive information regarding the sensory characteristics of boiled potatoes can contribute to the improvement of consumer-driven varieties. This study aimed to factor in the preferences of end users to improve the prospects for varietal acceptance, adoption, and discrimination among genotypes in potato breeding.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The priority quality traits (traits that play the most significant roles in acceptance and adoption) of the boiled potatoes were determined by evaluating gender and livelihood using the G+ tool. The G+ tool is designed to assess gender impact on roots, tubers and bananas (RTB) traits by serving as a validation check to reflect on important gender-based issues in agricultural food systems in order to reduce harm and promote positive impact. Potato genotypes were differentiated by penetration (textural parameters as measured by standard texture probe) and the procedure was repeatable, as there was no significant difference between the cooking replicates at 40 min of cooking. Instrument-based texture parameters, such as penetration peak force (hardness/firmness) and area (area under the curve, which represents energy needed to penetrate) of boiled potato tubers were significantly associated with sensory attributes such as fracturability and hardness in the mouth. An attempt to differentiate genotypes using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) revealed that the average results observed for the calibration for yellow color (<i>r</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = 0.70), homogeneity of color (<i>r</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = 0.48), moisture in mass (<i>r</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = 0.40), and uniformity of texture (<i>r</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = 0.56) suggested that these parameters could be used for initial breeding screening purposes.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>The preferred traits of the boiled potato can be integrated into the potato-breeding program/product profile. Near-infrared spectroscopy shows strong potential to predict potato color and the ability of NIRS models to predict some texture attributes is also promising. © 2023 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Judith Ssali Nantongo, \nSamuel Edgar Tinyiro, \nMariam Nakitto, \nEdwin Serunkuma, \nProssy Namugga, \nOluwatoyin Ayetigbo, \nSarah Mayanja, \nMukani Moyo, \nReuben Ssali, \nThiago Mendes","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"0c05022bc2b5e577a145d266900757d0771c14c698f369cef8546371ccd8988c","category":"Environment"}
