{"title":"Cross-Reactive Antibodies to the NS1 Protein of Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Are Absent in the Sera of Patients with Tick-Borne Encephalitis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0626/v1","date":1715268082000,"content":"Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV) is a member of the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) complex of the Flaviviridae family. Currently, there is no data on cross-reactivity of antibodies to the NS1 proteins of OHFV and TBEV. Such data are of major interest for monitoring viral encephalitis of unknown etiology due to the increasing geographical distribution of OHFV. In this study, recombinant OHFV NS1 protein was produced using Escherichia —Åoli expression system and purified. The recombinant OHFV NS1 protein was recognized by specific mice immune ascetic fluids to the native OHFV NS1 protein. Western blot analysis and ELISA of recombinant NS1 proteins of OHFV and TBEV were used to study the cross-reactivity of antibodies from immune ascites fluid obtained from OHFV-infected mice and mAbs against TBEV NS1. Anti-TBEV NS1 mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been shown not to be cross-reactive to OHFV NS1 protein. Sera from patients with confirmed tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) were examined by ELISA using recombinant OHFV NS1 and TBEV NS1 proteins as antigens. It was shown for the first time that cross-reactive antibodies to OHFV NS1 protein were not detected in the sera of TBE patients whereas the sera contained antibodies to TBEV NS1 protein.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a513dcd10093efc5dd9b802df95ad510b6d2085cd7332a27e11b1ca201ef72a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
