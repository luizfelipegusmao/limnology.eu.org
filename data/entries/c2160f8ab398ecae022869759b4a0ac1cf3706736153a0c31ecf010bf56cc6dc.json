{"title":"Unveiling Weather Impact on Intradialytic Blood Pressure: A Multifactorial Analysis on Hemodialysis Sessions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0620/v1","date":1728399600000,"content":"This study investigates the impact of environmental factors on intradialytic blood pressure in hemodialysis patients, using a four-year retrospective analysis. Employing a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model, we examined the associations between clinical variables, meteorological conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation), and blood pressure outcomes, including systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean arterial pressure. Our results reveal that higher temperatures, increased humidity, and stronger wind speeds are significantly associated with lower SBP and mean arterial pressure. In contrast, higher daily precipitation correlates with elevated mean arterial pressure. Among clinical factors, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dosage shows a positive association with both SBP and mean arterial pressure while a history of intradialytic hypotension and increased interdialytic weight gain are negatively correlated. Additionally, serum potassium levels were inversely related to SBP and mean arterial pressure. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating environmental variables into predictive models for intradialytic blood pressure management. We propose tailored interventions, such as weather-adapted fluid management strategies, personalized treatment plans, and patient education, to mitigate potential adverse effects. This study provides a foundation for enhancing patient-centered care and improving the quality of life for hemodialysis patients amid global climate changes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c2160f8ab398ecae022869759b4a0ac1cf3706736153a0c31ecf010bf56cc6dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
