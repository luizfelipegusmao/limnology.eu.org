{"title":"Large Eddy Simulation of the Flow past a Circular Cylinder at Re=130,000: Effects of Numerical Platforms and Single- and Double-Precision Arithmetic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1735/v1","date":1727090326000,"content":"Numerical simulations of the sub-critical flow past a circular cylinder at the Reynolds number, Re=130,000 are performed using two numerical platforms, commercial, Ansys Fluent and open source, OpenFoam (finite volume method and large eddy simulation based on a differential equation for the sub-grid kinetic energy). An overview of the available experimental data and similar large eddy simulation studies is presented. A detailed analysis of all accumulated data demonstrates satisfactory agreement between them with a dispersion of the order of 10% (for the main integral flow parameters). A detailed comparison of the results obtained by single- and double-precision numerical methods using Ansys Fluent did not reveal any noticeable discrepancies for the integral and local flow parameters, as well as spectral characteristics. It is shown that the behavior of the dynamic system of the fluid dynamic equations computed with single precision is stable by Lyapunov and does not lead to any loss of accuracy. The reconstructed attractors of the dynamic systems in the phase space are limited by an ellipsoid.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7986e871323fa1b3eb9e7d7eed6d2c3a553975ef3a1886dfc3283c5cec80787e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
