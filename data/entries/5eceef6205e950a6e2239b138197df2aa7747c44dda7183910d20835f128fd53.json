Monitoring and management of coastal rocky fish species is urgently needed in Chile, but knowledge of these species is fragmentary at best. Performance of Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) for assessing rocky fish assemblages was evaluated in south-central Chile. Seven medium- to large-sized exploited species dominated fish assemblages in the survey area, including five small cryptic rocky reef fishes, one agnathan and a catshark species. These seven species represented 78% of the species targeted by commercial fishing in the survey area. Furthermore, this tool provided new information on behaviour of rocky fish species. The simple, inexpensive and light nature of single-camera BRUVS may be crucial for maintaining monitoring programs along remote areas of Chile.</p>","author":"Alejo J.
