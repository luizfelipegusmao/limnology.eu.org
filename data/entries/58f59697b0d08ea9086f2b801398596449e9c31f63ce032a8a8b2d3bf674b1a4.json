{"title":"Ecological correlates of population genetics in Linum suffruticosum, an heterostylous polyploid and taxonomic complex endemic to the Western Mediterranean Basin","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/doi/10.1093/aobpla/plae027/7676907?rss=1","date":1716249600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Linum suffruticosum s.l.</span> is a taxonomic complex widespread in the Western Mediterranean basin. The complex is characterized by a high phenotypic and cytogenetic diversity, and by a unique three-dimensional heterostyly system that makes it an obligate outcrosser. We studied the patterns of genetic diversity and structure of populations throughout the entire distribution of <span>L. suffruticosum s.l.</span> with microsatellite markers. We analysed their relationships with various biological and ecological variables, including the morph ratio and sex organ reciprocity of populations measured with a novel multi-dimensional method. Populations consistently showed an approximate 1:1 morph ratio with high sex organ reciprocity and high genetic diversity. We found high genetic differentiation of populations, showing a pattern of isolation by distance. The Rif mountains in NW Africa were the most important genetic barrier. The taxonomic treatment within the group was not related to the genetic differentiation of populations, but to their environmental differentiation. Genetic diversity was unrelated to latitude, elevation, population size, niche suitability or breeding system. However, there was a clear influence of ploidy level on the genetic diversity of populations, and a seeming centreâ€“periphery pattern in its distribution. Our results suggest that polyploidization events, high outcrossing rates, isolation by distance and important geographical barriers to gene flow have played major roles in the microevolutionary history of this species complex.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"AoB PLANTS Current Issue","siteHash":"8840dd5ab55c091f7de845d03e42c474dbe2d076eb4181d88cf52a09aca2b17e","entryHash":"58f59697b0d08ea9086f2b801398596449e9c31f63ce032a8a8b2d3bf674b1a4","category":"Environment"}
