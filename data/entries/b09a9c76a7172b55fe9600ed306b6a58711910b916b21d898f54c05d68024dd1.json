{"title":"Examining the Impact of Chatbot-Based Language Learning Support, Adaptive Learning Algorithms, and Virtual Reality Language Immersion on EFL Learners&rsquo; Language Learning Proficiency and Self-Regulated Learning Skills","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1715/v1","date":1711622083000,"content":"The rapid advancement of technology has revolutionized language learning, introducing innovative methods that depart from traditional instructional approaches. This study employs a mixed-methods research design to examine the impact of chatbot-based language learning support, adaptive learning algorithms, and virtual reality language immersion on the language learning proficiency and self-regulated learning skills of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. The research design includes quantitative analysis of language proficiency scores and qualitative exploration of learner experiences with the technological interventions. The theoretical implications of this study are rooted in constructivist and socio-cultural learning theories, which underpin the design and implementation of the technological interventions. The triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data revealed that the participants' positive perceptions of the effectiveness of chatbot-based language learning support were supported by the quantitative results, with the variable \"chat-bot based support\" demonstrating a substantial mean difference compared to other groups. This convergence of findings reinforces the positive influence of chatbot-based support on language learning outcomes and highlights the importance of integrating theoretical perspectives with empirical evidence to gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of technological interventions on language learning outcomes for EFL learners. The study's findings provide insights into the potential of these technological interventions to optimize language learning outcomes for EFL learners and promote autonomous learning behaviors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b09a9c76a7172b55fe9600ed306b6a58711910b916b21d898f54c05d68024dd1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
