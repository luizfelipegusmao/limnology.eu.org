{"title":"A Fifteen Year Geological Journey with the IUCN Natural World Heritage Sites: Geoscience Education and the Conservation of Nature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1742/v1","date":1724451464000,"content":"As an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) voluntary reviewer of the natural World Heritage sites nominations focusing on criteria (vii) superlative natural phenomena and (viii) geological history I had the opportunity of evaluating 13 nominations from 12 countries from 2009 - 2022 from the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka to the Vatnajokull National Park Iceland. An early appreciation of the natural history and landscapes were developed as a geologist studying, working and visiting various areas in the USA and Canada. Further experience, as an academic in Sri Lanka and Australia, where I also had the opportunity of various assignments and meetings that afforded field trips and study tours to many World Heritage sites in Asia, Africa, South America and Europe. In this paper, I highlight the following sites that were subject to IUCN World Heritage evaluations and their potential for geo-education: Central Highlands Sri Lanka, China Danxia, Ningaloo Australia, Trang An Vietnam, Lut Desert Iran, Barberton South Africa, Trondek Klondike Canada, Vatnajokull Iceland, Classic Karst Slovenia, Sof Omar Ethiopia, Ha Long Bay – Cat Ba Archipelago, Vietnam and Evaporitic Karst Caves of Northern Apennines, Italy. From these experiences it is apparent that this relevant topic, the conservation of nature, should be an important part of the geoscience’s study curriculum along with other social and environmental subjects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2100092a973d2d6573532a3a10ac3513f65810f711570aa1e5553cd1fd1b207","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
