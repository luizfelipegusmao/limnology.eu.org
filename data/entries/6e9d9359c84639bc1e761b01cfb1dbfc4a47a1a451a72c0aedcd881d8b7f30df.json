{"title":"Enhancing Pain Management and Psychological Recovery in Earthquake Victims: The Impact of Catheterization Assessed by QoR-15","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1969/v1","date":1729778228000,"content":"Background/Objectives: After the earthquakes in Turkey, many citizens were injured, and a long process requiring physiological and psychological treatments started in the ongoing process. The aim of this study was to observe the pain and psychological changes in earthquake victims in light of the QoR-15 score. Methods: After approval by the local ethics committee (Decision No. 2023-194), earthquake victims with catheters in trauma and reconstructive surgery were retrospectively evaluated. Demographic and catheterization data were collected. Baseline, 24-hour, and 72-hour QoR-15 (Quality of Recovery-15) and VAS (Visual Analog Scala) scores were compared for changes over time. Results: A total of 40 catheters were placed in 29 patients (after the exclusion of children, 36 catheters were evaluated in 26 (15 w/11 m) patients). The mean age of the patients was 35.57 ± 13.69 years, and the duration of catheterization was 8 (4.25–12.75) days. Infusion of 0.1% bupivacaine 0.5–1 mg/kg/24 h was started routinely. The QoR-15 scores of the patients at baseline, 24-hour, and 72-hour were 80.45 ± 17.76, 95.27 ± 15.16, and 101.06 ± 15.52, respectively (p&lt;0.001). The VAS scores of the patients at baseline, 24-hour, and 72-hour were 4.61 ± 1.41, 1.79 ± 1.36, and 0.76 ± 0.86, respectively (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: In this study, a significant improvement in QoR-15 and VAS scores was achieved as a result of catheter insertion in earthquake victims. Considering that post-traumatic injuries require repeated surgeries and that pain aggravates the existing psychological state, it can be said that catheterization is beneficial.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e9d9359c84639bc1e761b01cfb1dbfc4a47a1a451a72c0aedcd881d8b7f30df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
