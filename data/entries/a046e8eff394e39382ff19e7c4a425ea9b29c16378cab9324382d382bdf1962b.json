{"title":"Cardiovascular Risk in Chinese Immigrants in the Colombian Caribbean Region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2468/v1","date":1722376576000,"content":"The Chinese community is one of the main minorities in Colombia, and although China has made advances in public health, it faces a growing burden of cardiovascular diseases. This study focuses on evaluating cardiovascular risk factors in Chinese immigrants in Barranquilla, Colombia, due to the lack of specific data on this population. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 67 Chinese immigrants over 18 years of age residing in Barranquilla. Sociodemographic, anthropometric, clinical, and biochemical data were collected through structured interviews and medical record reviews. Cardiovascular risk was estimated using the 10-year ASCVD (Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease) formula from the ACC/AHA. Statistical tests were employed to assess significant differences and relationships between variables. Results: The sample included 54% women with an average age of 53 years. 75% were over 45 years old, with the main occupations being trade (43%) and homemaking (40%). 54% had social security. Significant differences were observed in systolic blood pressure and the prevalence of smoking and alcoholism between men and women. Women had higher levels of HDL and lower creatinine, while men had higher levels of hemoglobin and creatinine. Cardiovascular risk was high in 9% of cases, moderate in 39%, and low in 52%. Conclusions: Chinese immigrants in Barranquilla present a significant prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors influenced by their socioeconomic situation and barriers to accessing healthcare. Interventions should focus on improving access to healthcare services and promoting healthy lifestyles for this vulnerable community.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a046e8eff394e39382ff19e7c4a425ea9b29c16378cab9324382d382bdf1962b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
