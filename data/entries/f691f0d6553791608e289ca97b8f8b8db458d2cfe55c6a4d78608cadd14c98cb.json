{"title":"Understanding the Influences of Multiscale Waviness on the Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication Performance, Part II: The Partial-Film Condition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1568/v1","date":1714005523000,"content":"This paper is the second part of a two-part report studying the responses of a typical point-contact elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) problem to multiscale roughness that is mimicked by artificially generated waviness with different amplitudes, frequencies, and directions. The previous Part I paper (doi:10.3390/lubricants10120368) focuses on the full film regime, while the current paper focuses on the partial film regime. The amplitudes and frequencies are related to the feature geometry of smooth EHL problems. Generated waviness is input to a transient thermal EHL model. The simulation is conducted 1,600 times for different waviness parameters, loads, and speeds. Eight performance parameters are extracted: the asperity contact ratio, minimum film thickness, maximum pressure, central point film thickness, central point pressure, mean film thickness, coefficient of friction (COF), and the maximum temperature rise. The ratios of the first seven parameters with and without waviness and the asperity contact ratio values are plotted on the frequencyâ€“amplitude coordinate plane as contour maps. The influences of the amplitude, frequency, wave direction, load, and speed on the eight performance parameters are analyzed and summarized. The simulated data and plotted contour maps are provided to the readers in the Supplementary Material.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f691f0d6553791608e289ca97b8f8b8db458d2cfe55c6a4d78608cadd14c98cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
