Cryo-electron microscopy, commonly abbreviated as cryo-EM, represents a versatile technique to enable structure determination of vitrified specimens under cryogenic conditions. By observing fundamental structures at near native states, a deeper understanding of macromolecular functions can be attained, resulting in new developments across diverse disciplines. To comprehensively address a diverse spectrum of specialties, cryo-EM incorporates a multitude of techniques; one of which is single particle analysis (SPA). SPA utilizes the unique projections of each protein particle frozen in various orientations. Each 2D projection can then be averaged and combined to produce a graphical three-dimension reconstruction [<a href=\"#ozae044.379-B1\">1</a>]. However, acquiring high-resolution data can have financial implications and unintuitive computational methodologies. Therefore, protein specimens must be evaluated through screening to determine whether resources should be committed towards data collection.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6a7146c593e4e5d21ddf1931a0a080086841891cdd4867872e16541c628b6ef2","category":"Environment"}
