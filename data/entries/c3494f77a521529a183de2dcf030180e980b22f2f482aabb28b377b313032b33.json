{"title":"VARS and HDMR Sensitivity Analysis of Groundwater Flow Modeling through an Alluvial Aquifer Subject to Tidal Effects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0551/v1","date":1723115918000,"content":"Groundwater flow and transport models are essential tools for assessing and quantifying the mi-gration of organic contaminants at polluted sites. Uncertainties in the hydrodynamic and transport parameters of the aquifer have a significant effect on model predictions. Uncertainties can be quantified with advanced sensitivity methods such as Sobol’s High Dimensional Model Reduction (HDMR) and Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces (VARS). Here we present the application of VARS and HDMR to assess the global sensitivities of the outputs of a transient groundwater flow model of the Gállego alluvial aquifer which is located downstream the Sardas landfill in Huesca (Spain). The aquifer is subject to the tidal effects caused by the daily oscillations of the water level in the Sabiñánigo reservoir. Global sensitivities are analysed for hydraulic heads, aquifer/reservoir fluxes, groundwater Darcy velocity and hydraulic head calibration metrics. Input parameters in-clude aquifer hydraulic conductivities and specific storage, aquitard vertical hydraulic conductiv-ities, and boundary inflows and conductances. VARS, HDMR and graphical methods agree to identify the most influential parameters which for most of the outputs are the hydraulic conduc-tivities of the zones closest to the landfill, the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the most permeable zones of the aquitard, and the boundary inflow coming from the landfill. The sensitivity of heads and aquifer/reservoir fluxes with respect to specific storage change with time. The aquifer/reservoir flux when the reservoir level is high shows interactions between specific storage and aquitard conductivity. VARS and HDMR parameter rankings are similar for the most influential parameters. However, there are discrepancies for the less relevant parameters. The efficiency of VARS was demonstrated by achieving stable results with a relatively small number of simulations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c3494f77a521529a183de2dcf030180e980b22f2f482aabb28b377b313032b33","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
