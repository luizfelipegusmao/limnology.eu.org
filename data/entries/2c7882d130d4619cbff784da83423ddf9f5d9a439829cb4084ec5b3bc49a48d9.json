Formed by scalable top-down methods, the dealloying of Ag-Au precursors yields a mechanically stable, noble metal nanostructure (see Fig. 1) with active mass-specific surface areas on the order of several m<sup>2</sup>/g. This property is readily exploited for the abundance of binding sites in many useful applications. Throughout the porous layer, the predominance of surface atoms relative to the master alloy, coupled with the local curvature at the solid-pore interface, changes the strain state in the bulk of the solid phase [<a href=\"#ozae044.123-B1\">1</a>]. The strain alters the macroscopic deformation of the material and is impacted by the adsorption and desorption of reactants [<a href=\"#ozae044.123-B2\">2</a>]. Understanding and harnessing these strain effects are pivotal in advancing the design and optimization of NPG-based functional materials for enhanced performance in actuation and sensing applications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2c7882d130d4619cbff784da83423ddf9f5d9a439829cb4084ec5b3bc49a48d9","category":"Environment"}
