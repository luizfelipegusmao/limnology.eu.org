{"title":"Behavior of IL-6 and Its Soluble Receptor Complex during Different Waves of the COVID-19 Pandemic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0409/v1","date":1717670831000,"content":"In late December 2019 a novel RNA beta-coronavirus was recognized as the causative agent of previously pneumonia cases of unknown origin. The virus was successively named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as well as the respiratory illness that it causes Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) (1, 2). The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the thousands of deaths caused by COVID-19 led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic on 11 March 2020. To date, the world has paid a high toll in this pandemic in terms of human lives lost, economic repercussions and increased poverty. Indeed, even if most patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or experience mild self-limiting disease, 14% of them progress to severe disease and 5% to critical illness with complications, such as interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and  multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS) (3). It is accepted that SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory system, although other organs are also involved (4). The virus enters host cells by attaching its Spike like surface projections to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor which is mainly expressed on alveolar epithelial cells and in nearly all human organs in varying degrees. Thus, although the central target of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the lung, the wide distribution of ACE2 receptors in other organs may lead to cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, kidney, liver, central nervous system and ocular damages that have to be closely monitored during the disease (5, 6). The virus then activates the innate and adaptive immune system resulting in a large number of cytokines release, known as “cytokine storm”, that is directly correlated with tissue injury and unfavourable prognosis of severe lung disease (7). In particular, interleukin (IL)-6 seems to plays an important role in driving this cytokine release so that its increased levels have been recognized as a hallmark inflammatory signature in sera of COVID-19 patients (8). IL-6 is a polyfunctional cytokine with both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory properties which exerts its several functions through two main signal transduction pathways (9). In the classical signal transduction pathway, IL-6 binds to IL-6-trans membrane receptor (IL-6R) to form a complex that, then, binds to the trans membrane glycoprotein gp130, inducing its homo-dimerization and initiating intracellular signal transduction. This kind of signaling is limited to cells (hepatocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, etc.) that express IL-6R on their cell surface (10). Nevertheless, cells do not express IL- 6R, as stromal and epithelial cells, are able to still respond to IL-6 because the soluble form of the receptor (sIL-6R) binds to IL-6 in circle and then anchors to membrane gp130 receptor, initiating the trans-signaling pathway. For this reason, sIL-6R is able to increase the function of IL-6 and is considered the agonist form of its receptor. When the level of IL-6 increases, its effects are widely expressed because gp130 molecules are ubiquitous and, therefore, also present in cells without IL-6R in the membrane form. On the contrary, a soluble form of the glycoprotein 130 (sgp130) can complex with sIL-6R to prevent the sIL-6R from binding to the membrane-bound gp130. In this case sgp130 is able to decrease the function of IL-6 and is considered the antagonist form of IL-6 receptor system (11). Based on the central role of IL-6 in the inflammatory pathology of COVID-19 and the consistent association between elevated levels of the cytokine and severe disease outcomes found in the first phase of infection, we sought to analysis IL-6 and its soluble receptor complex behavior during the different waves of COVID-19 pandemic, in order to evaluate the possible differences which occur among them and to hypothesize if they might be used as prognostic markers of disease severity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9dfc981bfdea51d4daf5cf2f365e7c4e7f77f0099f4b2b07c779a1083807ae8c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
