{"title":"Commutative Encryption and Reversible Watermarking Algorithm for Vector Maps Based on Virtual Coordinates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1615/v1","date":1719211460000,"content":"The combination of encryption and digital watermarking technologies is a trend to achieve full lifecycle data protection. Recently, reversible data hiding in encrypted domain (RDHED) has greatly aroused the interests of many scholars. But the fixed order of first encryption and then watermarking makes this kind of algorithms unsuitable to many applications. Commutative encryption and watermarking (CEW) technology realizes the flexible combination of encryption and watermarking, and suits more applications. However, most existing CEW schemes for vector maps are not reversible and unsuitable to high precision maps. To solve this problem, here we propose a commutative encryption and reversible watermarking (CERW) algorithm for vector maps based on virtual coordinates which are uniformly distributed on the number axis. The CERW algorithm consists of virtual interval step based encryption scheme and coordinate difference based reversible watermarking scheme. In the encryption scheme, the map coordinates are moved randomly by multiples of virtual interval step defined as distance between two adjacent virtual coordinates. In the reversible watermarking scheme, difference expansion (DE) technique is used to embed the watermark bit into the coordinate difference computed based on the relative position of a map coordinate in a virtual interval. Since the relative position of a map coordinate in a virtual interval keeps unchanged during the coordinate scrambling encryption process, the watermarking operation and the encryption operation donâ€™t interfere with each other and the commutativity between encryption and watermarking achieves. Results show that: proposed method has high security, high capacity and good invisibility. In addition, the algorithm is not only applicable to polyline and polygon vector data, but also can be applied to sparsely distributed point data which the traditional DE watermarking algorithm often fails to watermark.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0fbd1d7668d2f263a24c1855ca2085593b9a5c219bb42118dfe83c7f3eee6897","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
