{"title":"Innovative Strategies and Methodologies in Antimicrobial Peptide Design","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0587/v1","date":1725864171000,"content":"Multiple lines of research have led to the hypothesis that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an important component of the innate immune response, playing a vital role in the defense against a wide range of infectious diseases. In this review we explore the occurrence and availability of antimicrobial proteins and peptides across various species, highlighting their natural abundance and evolutionary significance. The design of AMPs has been driven by the identification of key structural and functional features, which are essential for optimizing their antimicrobial activity and reducing toxicity to host cells. We discuss various approaches, including rational design, high-throughput screening, and computational modeling, that have been employed to develop novel AMPs with enhanced efficacy. A particular focus is given to the identification and characterization of peptide fragments derived from naturally occurring host defense proteins, which offer a promising avenue for the discovery of new AMPs. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools into AMP research has further accelerated the identification, optimization, and application of these peptides. This review also discusses the current status and therapeutic potential of AMPs, emphasizing their role in addressing the growing issue of antibiotic resistance. The conclusion highlights the importance of continued research and innovation in AMP development to fully harness their potential as next-generation antimicrobial agents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1857be8f7eb6487167bee130ce28db601caf4ee6dcf6df2fbb4ae7140eed5beb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
