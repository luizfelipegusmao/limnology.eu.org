{"title":"Neural Architecture Comparison for Bibliographic Reference Segmentation: An Empirical Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0982/v1","date":1710746774000,"content":"In the realm of digital libraries, efficiently managing and accessing scientific publications necessitates automated bibliographic reference segmentation. This study addresses the challenge of accurately segmenting bibliographic references, a task complicated by the varied formats and styles of references. Focusing on the empirical evaluation of Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with CRF (BiLSTM+CRF), and Transformer Encoder with CRF (Transformer+CRF) architectures, this research employs Byte Pair Encoding and Character Embeddings for vector representation. The models underwent training on the extensive Giant corpus and subsequent evaluation on the Cora Corpus to ensure a balanced and rigorous comparison, maintaining uniformity across embedding layers, normalization techniques, and Dropout strategies. Results indicate that the BiLSTM+CRF architecture outperforms its counterparts by adeptly handling the syntactic structures prevalent in bibliographic data, achieving an F1-Score of 0.96. This outcome highlights the necessity of aligning model architecture with the specific syntactic demands of bibliographic reference segmentation tasks. Consequently, the study establishes the BiLSTM+CRF model as a superior approach within the current state-of-the-art, offering a robust solution for the challenges faced in digital library management and scholarly communication.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b54911fd5941c9c43a2e6d532e97f35b9b24cffd1713bc14c5ea5218a07cf89e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
