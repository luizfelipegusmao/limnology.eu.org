{"title":"Exploring the Lived Experience of Living with Cardiac Arrhythmia Developed During the Pregnancy Period","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0216/v1","date":1727941898000,"content":"Approximately half of all women develop palpitations during pregnancy with a quarter experiencing arrhythmias. While most presentations are benign, some cases can result in sudden cardiac death or serious symptom development. Considering such clinical presentation, healthcare providers must acquire knowledge in this area to provide comprehensive prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal care. However, no study could be located that focused on women’s lived experiences of such complications during or in the post-pregnancy period. The study aims to share the results of a study that explored the lived experience of one woman who developed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during her third pregnancy that lasted into the post-partum period. Using Narrative Inquiry self-study methodology, a woman’s experiences were explored to uncover the challenges she faced in coping with such complications during a period of transition for herself and her family. This methodology allowed for an in-depth understanding of how these complications could affect all aspects of her life. Four narrative threads were produced: 1) diagnostic challenges and delayed recognition; 2) impact on maternal identity and family dynamics; 3) navigating healthcare systems and treatment decisions; and 4) long- term adaptation and resilience. The intention was to add to this topic area to ensure future researchers, current and future healthcare providers, and patients have literature they can refer to when studying, providing care for, or experiencing similar health complications. Acquiring this knowledge can aid healthcare professionals to ensure appropriate care is provided, risks are minimized and their recovery is well supported.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f849b5b22ae475400b9eb66aac42a2ec7b2cf8ea87893016e7d5e2fc65ce3581","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
