{"title":"Pointwise data depth for univariate and multivariate functional outlier detection","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/env.2851?af=R","date":1713599376000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Data depth is an efficient tool for robustly summarizing the distribution of functional data and detecting potential magnitude and shape outliers. Commonly used functional data depth notions, such as the modified band depth and extremal depth, are estimated from pointwise depth for each observed functional observation. However, these techniques require calculating one single depth value for each functional observation, which may not be sufficient to characterize the distribution of the functional data and detect potential outliers. This article presents an innovative approach to make the best use of pointwise depth. We propose using the pointwise depth distribution for magnitude outlier visualization and the correlation between pairwise depth for shape outlier detection. Furthermore, a bootstrap-based testing procedure has been introduced for the correlation to test whether there is any shape outlier. The proposed univariate methods are then extended to bivariate functional data. The performance of the proposed methods is examined and compared to conventional outlier detection techniques by intensive simulation studies. In addition, the developed methods are applied to simulated solar energy datasets from a photovoltaic system. Results revealed that the proposed method offers superior detection performance over conventional techniques. These findings will benefit engineers and practitioners in monitoring photovoltaic systems by detecting unnoticed anomalies and outliers.</p>","author":"Cristian F.
