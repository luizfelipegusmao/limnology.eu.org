{"title":"Human-Activity-Mediated Gene Flows Are Involved in the Establishment of Magnaporthe oryzae Population Structures: A Population Genomic Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2221/v1","date":1724999782000,"content":"Magnaporthe oryzae is a filamentous heterothallic ascomycete fungus globally distributed in rice-growing regions and serves as the causative agent of rice blast disease. Populations shaped by environmental factors and human intervention play important roles in the formation of genetic structure. In this study, population structures and spatiotemporal dynamics were investigated based on the large-scale whole genomic sequences of rice-infecting M. oryzae around the world. By analyzing the genetic structures, we identified divergent clades that crossed geographic boundaries. While we observed associations between the isolates and their geographic origins, we also found that there were frequent migration events occurring worldwide. The populations in Asia demonstrated the highest genetic diversity due to the continentâ€™s history of rice domestication, followed by separate gene flows to Africa, North America, South America and Europe. Within Asia, China was the migration origin, facilitating gene flows to Japan and South Korea. Additionally, our analysis of the evolutionary history of global M. oryzae populations provided insights into the population expansion that has taken place in recent decades. Overall, our findings indicate that human-mediated gene flows played a pivotal role in shaping the genetic structure of M. oryzae.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b8cc96fb8d53f90c0a2450fed73af175cd5b23ed5657fb0a556328d57c40dd0b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
