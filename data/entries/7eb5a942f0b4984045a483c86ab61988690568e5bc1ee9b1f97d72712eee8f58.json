{"title":"A three‐dimensional analytical model based on Gaussian distribution for wind‐turbine wakes","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14302?af=R","date":1715141849000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A Gaussian-shaped, three-dimensional (3DG-<i>k</i>) wake model is proposed considering the shear wind effect. The model defines the wake radius <i>r</i>\n<sub>w</sub> to be equal to twice the Gaussian standard deviation <i>σ</i> and establishes a link with the expansion coefficient <i>k</i> of the physical wake boundary to describe the wake boundary. Garrad Hassan (GH) wind tunnel test data, Shiren wind farm measurement data, Nibe wind farm measurement data, and Vestas V80-2MW wind turbine computational data by large eddy simulation method are used to validate the accuracy of the 3DG-<i>k</i>, Jensen, 3D Gaussian (3DG), and 3D cosine (3D-C) models. Results show that the 3DG-<i>k</i> model exhibits higher accuracy for the four cases compared to other models. Due to its simplicity and universality, the model can be used for layout optimization and wake control of wind farms.</p>","author":"Ziyan Ling, \nZhenzhou Zhao, \nYige Liu, \nHuiwen Liu, \nYuanzhuo Ma, \nTongguang Wang, \nDingding Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"7eb5a942f0b4984045a483c86ab61988690568e5bc1ee9b1f97d72712eee8f58","category":"Environment"}
