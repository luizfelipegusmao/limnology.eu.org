{"title":"Association between self-reported napping and risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality: A meta-analysis of cohort studies","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311266","date":1729087200000,"content":"<p>by Meng Wang, Xin Xiang, Zhengyan Zhao, Yu liu, Yang Cao, Weiwei Guo, Linlin Hou, Qiuhuan Jiang</p>\r\nObjectives <p>This meta-analysis aims to assess the association between adult nap duration and risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular diseases (CVD).</p> Methods <p>PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched to identify eligible studies. The quality of observational studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We performed all statistical analyses using Stata software version 14.0. For the meta-analysis, we calculated hazard ratio (HR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To assess publication bias, we used a funnel plot and Egger’s test.</p> Results <p>A total of 21 studies involving 371,306 participants revealed varying methodological quality, from moderate to high. Those who indulged in daytime naps faced a significantly higher mortality risk than non-nappers (HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.18–1.38; I<sup>2</sup> = 38.8%; P&lt;0.001). Napping for less than 1 hour showed no significant association with mortality (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.90–1.11; I<sup>2</sup> = 62.6%; P = 0.971). However, napping for 1 hour or more correlated with a 1.22-fold increased risk of mortality (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.12–1.33; I<sup>2</sup> = 40.0%; P&lt;0.001). The risk of CVD associated with napping was 1.18 times higher than that of non-nappers (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.02–1.38; I<sup>2</sup> = 87.9%; P = 0.031). Napping for less than 1 hour did not significantly impact CVD risk (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.87–1.12; I<sup>2</sup> = 86.4%; P = 0.721). However, napping for 1 hour or more was linked to a 1.37-fold increased risk of CVD (HR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.09–1.71; I<sup>2</sup> = 68.3%; P = 0.007).</p> Conclusions <p>Our meta-analysis indicates that taking a nap increases the risk of overall mortality and CVD mortality. It highlights that the long duration time of the nap can serve as a risk factor for evaluating both overall mortality and cardiovascular mortality.</p>","author":"Meng Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"65a5da1e131bcdded7b9606e2e202c9913b1968cee6355e1f9c36c2bd942ac8f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
