{"title":"Deep Dynamic Weights for Underwater Image Restoration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1308/v1","date":1718769223000,"content":"Underwater imaging presents unique challenges, notably color distortions and reduced contrast due to light attenuation and scattering. Most underwater image enhancement methods, first use linear transformations for color compensation and then enhance the image. We observed that linear transformation for color compensation is not suitable for certain images. For such images, a non-linear mapping is a better choice. Our paper introduces a unique underwater image restoration approach leveraging a streamlined convolutional neural network (CNN) for dynamic weight learning for linear and non-linear mapping. In the first phase, a classifier is applied that classifies the input images into Type-I or Type-II. In the second phase, depending on the classification, the Deep Line Model (DLM) for Type-I images or the Deep Curve Model (DCM) for Type-II images. For mapping an input image to an output image, DML creatively combines color compensation and contrast adjustment in a single step and uses deep lines for transformation, whereas DCM employs higher-order curves. Both models utilize lightweight neural networks that learn per-pixel dynamic weights based on the input image’s characteristics. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets using metrics like peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR) and root mean squares error (RMSE) affirm our method’s effectiveness in accurately restoring underwater images, outperforming existing techniques.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7feea896b98a2e10118562aebf7d241bea419506aecfc1367e49e0fb67fa5a9f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
