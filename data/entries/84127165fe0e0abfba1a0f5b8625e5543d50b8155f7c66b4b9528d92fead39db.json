{"title":"Reproduction cycle, trematode parasitism and growth of freshwater mussel Anodonta anatina (Bivalvia: Unionidae)","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05418-w","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p><em>Anodonta anatina</em>, a widely distributed Eurasian freshwater mussel, has dramatically declined and listed as endangered species in IUCN Red List in some parts of the Europe. To better understand its basic biology and possible sex-dependent effects of parasitism on reproduction, we investigated the reproductive traits, trematode parasitism and growth between November 2020 and October 2021. Our data from a Finnish population indicates male-biased sex ratio and the gonadal development  lasting throughout the year with a bradytictic brooding pattern. Gonadosomatic index of both sexes peaked in May and declined in June. Mature oocytes were smaller sized than those of previously studied unionids, fecundity was fairly low, and the maximum predicted lifespan was 14 years. Gonads were infected with digenean trematode parasites, <em>Rhipidocotyle campanula</em> being the dominant species. Interestingly, trematode infection rate was higher in females than in males. In July, when the water temperature reached its annual maximum, the trematode prevalence also peaked, which was accompanied with 16% of mussels being sterile. The trematode parasitism was thus negatively associated with reproduction, that might become even more affected if parasitism increases along with the predicted climate warming, which should be considered in possible future conservation and aquaculture efforts of this species.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"84127165fe0e0abfba1a0f5b8625e5543d50b8155f7c66b4b9528d92fead39db","category":"Environment"}
