{"title":"A Perspective on Developing Modeling and Image Analysis Tools to Investigate Mechanosensing Proteins","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/63/6/1532/7240147?rss=1","date":1691539200000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>The shift of funding organizations to prioritize interdisciplinary work points to the need for workflow models that better accommodate interdisciplinary studies. Most scientists are trained in a specific field and are often unaware of the kind of insights that other disciplines could contribute to solving various problems. In this paper, we present a perspective on how we developed an experimental pipeline between a microscopy and image analysis/bioengineering lab. Specifically, we connected microscopy observations about a putative mechanosensing protein, obscurin, to image analysis techniques that quantify cell changes. While the individual methods used are well established (fluorescence microscopy; ImageJ WEKA and mTrack2 programs; MATLAB), there are no existing best practices for how to integrate these techniques into a cohesive, interdisciplinary narrative. Here, we describe a broadly applicable workflow of how microscopists can more easily quantify cell properties (e.g., perimeter, velocity) from microscopy videos of eukaryotic (MDCK) adherent cells. Additionally, we give examples of how these foundational measurements can create more complex, customizable cell mechanics tools and models.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative and Comparative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"715dd1b0fb4f45600bceadb227e9b7fdf8bd9d1d7a2fd3d5e0399d2c1f410646","entryHash":"8aff9c7c0e9c10a1ad9012ff59ecc8ab3be41682a43a5586348ad35f180bda1a","category":"Environment"}
