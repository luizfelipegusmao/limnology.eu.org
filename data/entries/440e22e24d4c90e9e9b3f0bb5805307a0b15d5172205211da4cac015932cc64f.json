{"title":"Exploring the Efficacy of Alpha-Lipoic Acid in Comorbid Osteoarthritis and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0127/v1","date":1725312852000,"content":"The comorbidity of osteoarthritis and type 2 diabetes mellitus represents a complex clinical challenge and complicates patient management due to the interplay of overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms. The research aimed to analyze the exacerbation of clinical symptoms and biochemical markers in patients with osteoarthritis and type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to those with osteoarthritis. We utilized various assessment methods to measure the patient cohorts' inflammation, oxidative stress, and glycemic control. The study also involved the administration of alpha-lipoic acid to patients with comorbid osteoarthritis and type 2 diabetes mellitus and monitored its effects on joint function, inflammatory markers, oxidative stress levels, and glycemic control. Our findings revealed that the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus significantly intensified osteoarthritis symptoms and altered biochemical markers, including increased inflammation, elevated oxidative stress, and disrupted immunological balance. The treatment with alpha-lipoic acid resulted in improved joint function, reduced inflammation and oxidative stress levels, and better glycemic control. Additionally, it was identified several potential predictors for developing osteoarthritis and type 2 diabetes mellitus comorbidity. The results underscore the detrimental impact of type 2 diabetes mellitus on osteoarthritis and highlight the beneficial effects of alpha-lipoic acid in alleviating some of the adverse consequences associated with this comorbidity. Nonetheless, further research is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of alpha-lipoic acid and its long-term effects on managing comorbidity of osteoarthritis and type 2 diabetes mellitus.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"440e22e24d4c90e9e9b3f0bb5805307a0b15d5172205211da4cac015932cc64f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
