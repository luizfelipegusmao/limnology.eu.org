{"title":"Zebrafish avatars: towards functional precision medicine in low-grade serous ovarian cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1257/v1","date":1711014303000,"content":"Ovarian cancer (OC) is an umbrella term for cancerous malignancies affecting the ovaries, yet treatment options for all subtypes are predominantly derived from high-grade serous ovarian cancer, the largest subgroup. The concept of \"functional precision medicine\" involves gaining personalized insights on therapy choice, based on direct exposure of patient tissues to drugs. This especially holds promise for rare subtypes like low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC). This study aims to establish an in vivo model for LGSOC using zebrafish embryos, comparing treatment responses previously observed in mouse PDX models, cell lines, and 3D tumor models. To address this goal, a well characterized patient-derived LGSOC cell line with the KRAS mutation c.35 G &gt; T (p.(Gly12Val)) was used. Fluorescently labelled tumor cells were injected into the perivitelline space of 2 days post fertilization zebrafish embryos. At 1 day post-injection xenografts were as-sessed for tumor size, followed by random allocation into treatment groups with trametinib, luminespib, and trametinib + luminespib. Subsequently xenografts were euthanized and analysed for apoptosis and proliferation by confocal microscopy. Tumor cells formed compact tumor masses (n=84) in vivo and with clear Ki67 staining, indicating proliferation. Zebrafish xenografts exhibited sensitivity to trametinib and luminespib, individually or combined, within a two-week period, establishing them as a rapid and complementary tool to existing in vitro and in vivo models for evaluating targeted therapies in LGSOC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e414162d3e12fa79dc61201d09a30dea3ee36fb7765b5347c766a4dc91dbb57","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
