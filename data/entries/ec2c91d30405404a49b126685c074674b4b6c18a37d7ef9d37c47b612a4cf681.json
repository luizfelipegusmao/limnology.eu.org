{"title":"Three-dimensional reconstruction and multiomics analysis reveal a unique pattern of embryogenesis in Ginkgo biloba","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/95/7649219?rss=1","date":1713312000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Ginkgo (<span>Ginkgo biloba</span> L.) is one of the earliest extant species in seed plant phylogeny. Embryo development patterns can provide fundamental evidence for the origin, evolution, and adaptation of seeds. However, the architectural and morphological dynamics during embryogenesis in <span>G. biloba</span> remain elusive. Herein, we obtained over 2,200 visual slices from 3 stages of embryo development using micro-computed tomography imaging with improved staining methods. Based on 3-dimensional (3D) spatiotemporal pattern analysis, we found that a shoot apical meristem with 7 highly differentiated leaf primordia, including apical and axillary leaf buds, is present in mature Ginkgo embryos. 3D rendering from the front, top, and side views showed 2 separate transport systems of tracheids located in the hypocotyl and cotyledon, representing a unique pattern of embryogenesis. Furthermore, the morphological dynamic analysis of secretory cavities indicated their strong association with cotyledons during development. In addition, we identified genes <span>GbLBD25a</span> (lateral organ boundaries domain 25a), <span>GbCESA2a</span> (cellulose synthase 2a), <span>GbMYB74c</span> (myeloblastosis 74c), <span>GbPIN2</span> (PIN-FORMED 2) associated with vascular development regulation, and <span>GbWRKY1</span> (WRKYGOK 1), <span>GbbHLH12a</span> (basic helix–loop–helix 12a), and <span>GbJAZ4</span> (jasmonate zim-domain 4) potentially involved in the formation of secretory cavities. Moreover, we found that flavonoid accumulation in mature embryos could enhance postgerminative growth and seedling establishment in harsh environments. Our 3D spatial reconstruction technique combined with multiomics analysis opens avenues for investigating developmental architecture and molecular mechanisms during embryogenesis and lays the foundation for evolutionary studies of embryo development and maturation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"ec2c91d30405404a49b126685c074674b4b6c18a37d7ef9d37c47b612a4cf681","category":"Environment"}
