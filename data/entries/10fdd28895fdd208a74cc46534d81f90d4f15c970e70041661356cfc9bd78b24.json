{"title":"Investigation on uniaxial compression and fracture damage mode of prefabricated parallel double-jointed red sandstone","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305565","date":1718632800000,"content":"<p>by Xiaojuan Xie, Zhanxin Liu, Kun Ding, Yajun Xiao, Zhengqi Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nAs a special type of joint fracture, the fracture evolution characteristics of parallel double joints have important engineering significance for the stability analysis of fractured rock mass. In this work, a new method for calculating stress intensity factor of parallel double-jointed fractures was importantly proposed. Physical uniaxial compression tests were carried out on parallel double jointed red sandstone filled with cement mortar under different geometric parameters, and the macroscopic mechanical properties and failure characteristics of red sandstone are deeply analyzed. The results show that the larger the connectivity rate is, the smaller the peak stress and strain are. The increase of connectivity rate will affect the change rate of transverse strain in the center of rock bridge. The closer the dip angle of the joint is, the lower the peak stress is and the shorter the failure time is. The damage mode of joint tip encroachment affects the lateral displacement of the rock bridge center, and the displacement is always close to the first damage section. The closer the joint tip is to the load, the easier the end-face penetrating cracks occur. The research content can provide basic support for guaranteeing the stability of underground engineering rock mass.","author":"Xiaojuan Xie","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"10fdd28895fdd208a74cc46534d81f90d4f15c970e70041661356cfc9bd78b24","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
