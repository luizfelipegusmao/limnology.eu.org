{"title":"Application of Lightweight Design Based on Response Surface Methodology in 410t Hydraulic Climbing Mechanism","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1148/v1","date":1710848253000,"content":"The multi-objective optimization design of hydraulic climbing mechanism (the core mechanism of gantry crane) was realized by using the method of combining central composite design (CCD), Kriging and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). Firstly, the hydraulic climbing mechanism model was established and the appropriate design variables were selected. The mass, maximum deformation and maximum equivalent stress of the hydraulic climbing mechanism was taken as the optimization objectives. Through the comparative analysis of the parameters of wedge block, anchor block, anchor plate„ÄÅbaffle, the parameters that have the greatest impact on the optimization objectives are selected as geometric constraints. Then, according to the results of experimental design, Kriging model was used to establish the response surface optimization model of objective function. Finally, the optimal results were obtained by using MOGA method. The experimental results show that the optimization strategy is reliable, and the mass of the optimized model is reduced by 10.28%. While meeting the actual production requirements, the lightweight design of the hydraulic climbing mechanism is realized, which saves the design cost and improves the material utilization rate.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46bb796f48991471d10a1c466c7fe52ee5446bee514609bd083878f06a6b63fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
