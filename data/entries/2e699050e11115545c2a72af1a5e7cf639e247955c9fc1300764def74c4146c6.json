{"title":"Plug-and-Play: An Efficient Post-training Pruning Method for Large Language Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.1487/v2","date":1716791658000,"content":"With the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing demand for memory and computation in LLMs. Recent efforts on post-training pruning of LLMs aim to reduce the model size and computation requirements, yet the performance is still sub-optimal.  In this paper, we present a plug-and-play solution for post-training pruning of LLMs. The proposed solution has two innovative components: 1) Relative Importance and Activations (RIA), a new pruning metric that jointly considers the weight and activations efficiently on LLMs; and 2) Channel Permutation, a new approach to maximally preserve important weights under N:M sparsity. The two proposed components can be readily combined to further enhance the N:M semi-structured pruning of LLMs. Our empirical experiments show that RIA alone can already surpass all existing post-training pruning methods on prevalent LLMs, e.g., LLaMA ranging from 7B to 65B. Furthermore, N:M semi-structured pruning with channel permutation can even outperform the original LLaMA2-70B on zero-shot tasks, together with practical speed-up on specific hardware.
