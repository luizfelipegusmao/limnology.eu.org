{"title":"Diel Variations in Abundance of Microbial Communities in the Pacific Western Subtropical Coastal Waters in Spring: Potential Role of Picoeukaryotes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1401/v1","date":1721210292000,"content":"The diel variations of viruses (&lt; 0.2 μm), picoplankton (0.2—2 μm; heterotrophic bacteria, Syn-echococcus spp., Prochlorococcus spp. and picoeukaryotes) and nanoplankton (2—20 μm; hetero-trophic nanoflagellates and pigmented nanoflagellates) were investigated for 2 days with about 4 hours of temporal sampling in spring 2024 in coastal surface waters of the subtropical western Pacific. A period of wind change associated with rain and increased turbulence, disrupted diel patterns of the overall microbial communities during the second cycle. The abundance of bacteria did not follow a consistent diel pattern, while viral abundance positively correlated with bacterial abundance. Synechococcus spp. and Prochlorococcus spp. grew during the light period and with peak abundance at night, exhibited marked diel variability, however, opposite patterns were observed in picoeukaryotes. According to Synechococcus spp. and Prochlorococcus spp. diel changes, nano-flagellate grazing could control their abundances and may explain temporally varying picocyanobacteria abundances. As we observed in the culture experiments, the results showed a significant increase in picoeukaryotic abundance from noon to nighttime, and a decrease in bacterial abundance during nighttime, to show the prey-predator cycle. Our study suggests picoeukaryotes could serve as bacteria predators by being mixotrophs. Future studies aiming to understand the interactions between prokaryotes and picoeukaryotes within marine microbial communities should take these differences into account.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b7c570bd12ddded071bf87ce07b05294de9807432c12d9219d2798fa8c8662f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
