Effective implementation strategies included engaging leadership, building a dedicated team, and developing quality assurance mechanisms. These experiences and findings may inform implementation at health systems interested in eConsult programs.</p>","author":"Anita Arora","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2651a93b1194bd682e4d84714f7652477953d0917637630bf95c92b35b1d57e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
