{"title":"PSI-19 Growth performance of weaned pigs fed Jerusalem Artichoke tubers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/276/7665070?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Recent studies have shown that prebiotics have been able to positively affect growth of beneficial bacteria, indices of gut health, and growth performance in pigs. This type of research is important to identify alternative methods for maintaining herd health other than antimicrobial usage. Jerusalem Artichoke tubers were chosen due to their relatively greater amount of inulin (~60%) compared with other prebiotic crops (i.e., chicory pulp - ~20% inulin). The objective of this work was to evaluate growth performance of weaned pigs fed Jerusalem Artichoke tubers. Sixty-four pigs approximately 21 d of age, weighing 6 kg each were used to test four dietary treatments with four pens per treatment (two barrows and two gilts per pen). Dietary treatments were randomly allocated to pens following a completely randomized design in a three-phase feeding trial. Diet treatments consisted of a corn-soybean meal basal diet (control) meeting the nutrient requirements for weanling pigs and three treatment diets with ground Jerusalem Artichoke tubers replacing corn at the rate of 0.05%, 0.5%, and 5.0% (JA-low, JA-mid, and JA-high, respectively) through all three phases. The pigs were allowed 3 d to acclimate to the facility following arrival (d -3 to -1). The trial ran from d 0 to d 35. Growth performance data were collected on d 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35. Blood samples were obtained on d 0, 7, 14, and 28. Fecal samples were collected on d 0, 14, and 28. PROC GLIMMIX in SAS was utilized to analyze the growth performance data. Results indicate greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) gain to feed ratio (G:F) at wk 2 for JA-high and JA-mid pigs compared with all other treatments. No differences were observed for overall body weight (BW; 25.14, 25.48, 21.8, 22.83 kg), average daily gain (ADG; 0.52, 0.52, 0.51, 0.47 kg/d), or average daily feed intake (ADFI; 0.73, 0.74, 0.71, 0.72 kg/d), respectively, for control, JA-low, JA-mid, and JA-high fed pigs. The growth data suggests that Jerusalem Artichoke tubers may be included in weaned pig diets without negative effects on growth performance; however, these results need to be interpreted in conjunction with the pending analyses to provide a comprehensive look at the role of prebiotic fiber in the gastrointestinal tract of the pig. Future analyses will include evaluation of serum biomarkers (e.g., intestinal fatty acid binding protein as a measure of intestinal epithelial cell damage) and microbiome profiling via 16S microbial sequencing to assess gut health. It is important to note that our study population experienced morbidity and mortality (<span>Trueperella pyogenes</span> was cultured from one pig submitted for necropsy) and the decision was made to prophylactically treat the herd with ceftiofur on d 7 following sample collection to prevent additional loss.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"bd21391476d5aa963bf1f673305579868bddeda07b2246712024a33ce4fe62d8","category":"Environment"}
