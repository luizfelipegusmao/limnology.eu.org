{"title":"Outcome One Year After Acetabular Rim Extension Using a Customized Titanium Implant for Treating Hip Dysplasia in Dogs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0468/v1","date":1720096798000,"content":"The ACEtabular rim eXtension (ACE-X) implant is a custom-made 3-dimensional-printed titanium device designed for the treatment of canine hip dysplasia. Thirty-four dogs (61 hips) underwent ACE-X implantation, and assessments were conducted using computed tomography, force plate analysis, Ortolaniâ€™s test, and Helsinki Chronic Pain Index (HCPI) questionnaires at five intervals: pre-operative day, surgery day, 1.5-month, 3-month, and 12-month follow-up. Statistically significant increases in femoral head coverage with negative Ortolani subluxation test were observed immediately after surgery and persisted throughout the study. Osteoarthritis (OA) scores remained stable, but osteophyte size significantly increased between the surgery day and the 12-month follow-up, especially in hips with a baseline OA score of 2 compared to those with a score of 1. Force plate data showed no significant changes during the study. The HCPI demonstrated a significant decrease in pain score from pre-operative value to 6-week follow-up and gradually decreased over time. Major complications were identified in 6 hips (9.8%) of 4 dogs. In conclusion, the ACE-X implant effectively increased femoral head coverage, eliminated subluxation, and provided long-term pain relief with minimal complications, benefiting over 90% of the study population. The study supports the ACE-X implant as a secure and valuable treatment for canine hip dysplasia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3531427417dc8c706c2933eaf7ec85afcd995e1d01f425bfd4f991a3335dac8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
