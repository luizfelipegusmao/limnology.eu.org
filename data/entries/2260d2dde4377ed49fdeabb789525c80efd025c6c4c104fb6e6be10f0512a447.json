{"title":"The Ability of Artificial Transpiration Devices to Raise Water to Any Given Height and the Prospects of Creating Large Artificial Transpiration Systems as Sources of Clean Energy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0240/v1","date":1714973112000,"content":"Using the phenomenon of transpiration, plants are able to raise soil water to a height of about 100 meters. According to the Cohesion - Tension theory, water moves through the capillaries of plant along a gradient of negative water potential in a single unified flow along a single route from roots to leaves, entering on its way into living cells for their nutrition and evaporating into the atmosphere in significant amounts in the leaves. The paper shows that in a case of artificial transpiration devices (ATD), the flow of rising water can be divided into two streams - the transpiration stream and the passive water stream - and as a result, such devices become capable of raising water to any given height. As proof, the working variant of two-stream ATD is proposed. The development of this ATD was carried out in two stages, discussed in details in the paper. At the first, experimental stage, a physical model was designed and manufactured, in which the flow of rising water was divided into two streams moving along two independent routes. The first route is used exclusively for the purpose of transpiration of water - transporting it into an artificial evaporator for complete evaporation into the atmosphere. The second route is used exclusively to transport passive water using the energy obtained in the first route during the process of transpiration. During many hours of testing, the physical model demonstrated a stable ability to bring masses of passive water, maintaining normal atmospheric pressure in them, to a small height, even in the extreme case not exceeding 10 meters. At the second, analytical stage, this two-stream model was developed into a two-stream multi-stage model, capable of raising water to any given height by choosing the number of stages. The number of stages can be very large, and portions of water can be delivered to any given height, remaining under normal atmospheric pressure. The conclusion part of the paper discusses the prospects of creating on the basis of the developed two-stream ATDs large systems that can, using the phenomenon of transpiration, become a sources of clean energy, similar to how it is realized in the mass of plants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2260d2dde4377ed49fdeabb789525c80efd025c6c4c104fb6e6be10f0512a447","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
