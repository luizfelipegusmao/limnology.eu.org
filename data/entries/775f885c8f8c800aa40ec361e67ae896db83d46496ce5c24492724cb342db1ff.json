{"title":"Health literacy and high blood pressure among Myanmar migrant workers in Northeastern Thailand","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302057","date":1714053600000,"content":"<p>by Kittipong Sornlorm, Wor Mi Thi</p>\r\n\r\nHypertension, related to serious consequences unless diagnosed and treated, is a global concern, also affecting migrant workers. Due to the high prevalence of hypertension among migrant workers in Thailand, the influences of health literacy and other factors on blood pressure were needed to explore among Myanmar migrant workers in Northeastern Thailand. Hence, this study aimed to identify the prevalence of high blood pressure (HBP), its association with health literacy and other factors among Myanmar migrant workers in Northeastern Thailand. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in Northeastern Thailand. A multistage sampling procedure was applied. Data was gathered through interviews utilizing validated and reliable structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics with multiple logistic regression were used. Among 406 participants, about 60% were male and about 70% of them were married. The prevalence of overall HBP was 63.3% (95% CI: 58.49–67.86), 52% in females and 71.86% in males. Participants with limited health literacy were 79% more likely to have HBP than those with excellent and adequate health literacy (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.13–2.84). Other factors substantially linked with having HBP were being male gender (AOR = 4.68, 95% CI: 2.81–7.78), being overweight (AOR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.18–4.23), being obese (AOR = 5.69, 95% CI: 2.96–10.96), not having health insurance (AOR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.11–3.66), staying in Thailand for more than 48 months (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.48–3.9), and having family history of hypertension (AOR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.28–3.35). In conclusion, more than half of Myanmar migrant workers had HBP. Factors associated with HBP were limited health literacy, male gender, overnutrition, lack of health insurance, longer duration of stay in Thailand and having family history of hypertension. Therefore, there is a need for a multifaceted strategy to prevent hypertension and its consequences by promoting health literacy as well as by enhancing good behavioural practice among this community.","author":"Kittipong Sornlorm","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"775f885c8f8c800aa40ec361e67ae896db83d46496ce5c24492724cb342db1ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
