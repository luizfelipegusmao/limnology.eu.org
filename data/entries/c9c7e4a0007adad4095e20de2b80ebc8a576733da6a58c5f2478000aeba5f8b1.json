{"title":"Unveiling Consumer Insights: Understanding Price Inflation in Renewable Energy Markets Through Qualitative Research","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1368/v1","date":1716288377000,"content":"This qualitative study investigates consumer perceptions of price inflation within renewable energy markets. Renewable energy markets have seen significant growth due to global sustainability efforts, yet understanding consumer responses to price inflation remains limited. Through semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis, this research explores consumer awareness, factors influencing perceptions, attitudes towards price fluctuations, and strategies for enhancing acceptance. Findings reveal varied levels of awareness among consumers, with economic, environmental, social, and cultural factors shaping their perceptions. While some view price fluctuations as natural market dynamics, others express concerns about affordability and equity. Strategies to address negative perceptions include enhancing transparency, implementing progressive pricing schemes, and promoting community engagement. Ultimately, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of consumer attitudes towards renewable energy pricing mechanisms, providing insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders to foster greater acceptance and support for renewable energy adoption.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c9c7e4a0007adad4095e20de2b80ebc8a576733da6a58c5f2478000aeba5f8b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
