{"title":"Production of Polymeric Films from Orange and Ginger Waste for Packaging Application and Investigation of Mechanical and Thermal Characteristics of Biofilms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0830/v1","date":1715588646000,"content":"Citrus waste has been used as a source of bioplastic research in different ways. Because the juice industry produces significant amounts of residue each year, it would be advantageous to use the byproducts in the creation of new materials. For many years, researchers have been investigating an environmentally friendly way to take citrus and other organic waste and turn it into polymers that may be used, for instance, to produce bio-based and biodegradable films for food packaging. The goal of this study is to create biofilms from orange (OW) and ginger waste (GW) using an ultrafine grinder and study the films' properties. Since pectin has the ability to gel and because cellulosic fibres are strong, citrus waste has been studied for its potential to produce biofilms. After being washed, dried, and milled, orange and ginger waste were shaped into films using a casting process. Tensile testing was used to determine the mechanical properties of biofilms, while dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to determine their thermal properties. As the number of grinding cycles increased, the suspension's viscosity increased from 29 to 57 mPa.s for OW and from 217 to 376 mPa.s for GW while the particle size in the suspension significantly decreased. For OW and GW films, the highest tensile strength was 17 MPa and 15 MPa, respectively. The maximum strain obtained among all films was 4.8%. All the tested films were stable up to 150°C, and maximum degradation occurs after 300°C.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8620b62d78999ca0247ed77197b37f484c1974d454c53de710cb2ccdbca27c92","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
