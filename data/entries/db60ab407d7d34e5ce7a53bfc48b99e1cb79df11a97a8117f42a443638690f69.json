{"title":"Phytohormones in a universe of regulatory metabolites: lessons from jasmonate","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/135/7593487?rss=1","date":1706572800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Small-molecule phytohormones exert control over plant growth, development, and stress responses by coordinating the patterns of gene expression within and between cells. Increasing evidence indicates that currently recognized plant hormones are part of a larger group of regulatory metabolites that have acquired signaling properties during the evolution of land plants. This rich assortment of chemical signals reflects the tremendous diversity of plant secondary metabolism, which offers evolutionary solutions to the daunting challenges of sessility and other unique aspects of plant biology. A major gap in our current understanding of plant regulatory metabolites is the lack of insight into the direct targets of these compounds. Here, we illustrate the blurred distinction between classical phytohormones and other bioactive metabolites by highlighting the major scientific advances that transformed the view of jasmonate from an interesting floral scent to a potent transcriptional regulator. Lessons from jasmonate research generally apply to other phytohormones and thus may help provide a broad understanding of regulatory metaboliteâ€“protein interactions. In providing a framework that links small-molecule diversity to transcriptional plasticity, we hope to stimulate future research to explore the evolution, functions, and mechanisms of perception of a broad range of plant regulatory metabolites.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"db60ab407d7d34e5ce7a53bfc48b99e1cb79df11a97a8117f42a443638690f69","category":"Environment"}
