{"title":"Muli-Agent AI Systems in Healthcare: Technical and Clinical Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0182/v1","date":1727873996000,"content":"Scaling the operation is the single greatest challenge in every enterprise. The more complex the enterprise, the greater the challenge. Scaling in healthcare has been a consistent challenge, with the need to meet clinical endpoints with less staff, increased costs of resources, regulatory oversight, and the goal of improving access to care. The article explores the emerging paradigm of multi-agent AI systems in healthcare, representing a significant leap beyond traditional Large Language Models. We comprehensively analyze the potential of these systems to revolutionize patient care, streamline administrative processes, and support complex clinical decision-making. The paper describes a hypothetical sepsis management system comprising seven specialized AI agents, each handling specific aspects of patient care, from data collection and diagnosis to treatment recommendations and resource management. We also examine applications in chronic disease management and hospital patient flow optimization. The technical implementation of these systems is discussed, including the use of advanced Large Language Models, inter-agent quality control measures, implementing guardrails, self-reflection, integration with Electronic Health Records, and the importance of explainable AI for decision transparency. In addition to describing the promising potential benefits, such as enhanced diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment plans, we address significant challenges, including data quality assurance, workflow integration, and ethical considerations. We conclude the article by highlighting future directions, such as integrating IoT devices and developing more sophisticated natural language interfaces. Our work underscores the transformative potential of multi-agent AI systems in healthcare while emphasizing the need for rigorous validation, ethical oversight, and a patient-centered approach in their development and implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"645d08100d1aef219d92558393fa06bb19c7f3104fe2a579a4c6817e7f0e1dfe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
