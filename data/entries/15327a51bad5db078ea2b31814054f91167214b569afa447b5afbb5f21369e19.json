{"title":"Correlations between Symmetry and Frequency of Artificial and Natural Symbols","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1071/v1","date":1720790228000,"content":"We report positive correlations between letter frequency and symmetry (more symmetric symbols are more frequent) in English and Russian languages and in four types of numerals (Western, Roman, Arabic, and Chinese) with the coefficients of determination of R2=0.899 (English), R2=0.693 (Russian) and R2=0.740 (numerals). For comparison, we studied \"symbol-like\" 2D colloidal clusters and found negative correlations between frequency and symmetry (R2=0.814 and R2=0.994). While in human-made systems the frequency of using of a symbol is the driving force which leads to symbols simplification and symmetrizing, in natural system, symmetry leads to lower frequency of occurrence because there are fewer ways of building symmetric clusters than asymmetric ones. We interpret these results as a correlation between the symbol as a type and as a token and we attribute this correlation to the inherent iconicity of symbols","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15327a51bad5db078ea2b31814054f91167214b569afa447b5afbb5f21369e19","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
