Yet the quality of information gained from monitoring can vary greatly, and perceived monitoring costs often results in reduced monitoring effort. Selecting cost-effective monitoring strategies that provide high quality data are therefore important for assessing translocation outcomes and making informed management decisions.\n\nTo compare how monitoring strategy affects information gained, we monitored a toutouwai/North Island robin (<i>Petroica longipes</i>) reintroduction in Aotearoa New Zealand, based on monitoring objectives of determining survival, site fidelity and whether the extent of management was large enough to protect dispersing individuals. We compared how these objectives were met through four monitoring strategies: (1) comprehensive surveys with ground radio telemetry and playback; (2) aerial drone telemetry; (3) dedicated playback by trained surveyors and (4) opportunistic playback by predator control contractors. We undertook a viewshed analysis to determine search coverage of each strategy and compared detection rates, efficiency and cost.\n\nComprehensive ground telemetry and playback, while costly, covered the largest area and provided the most accurate data on dispersal, survival and the translocation outcome. In comparison, opportunistic playback monitoring detected substantially fewer individuals, giving a false impression of low site fidelity and survival and a failed translocation. Although drone telemetry had considerable site-specific limitations, which limited its effectiveness during our study, it was the most cost-effective with a high detection rate and low search effort.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>: Our study shows the value of intensive monitoring in facilitating management decisions for wildlife translocations. Comprehensive telemetry and playback, while costly, were invaluable for gaining high quality information on the translocation outcome. Without suitable monitoring, reintroduction outcomes can be difficult to assess and potentially result in unnecessary, ineffective or overly expensive management actions. We recommend that monitoring intensity and methodology should reflect the site, species and level of uncertainty regarding the translocation outcome. Prioritising monitoring can help reduce long-term costs, increase quality of information gained and allow for more informed management decisions that can improve subsequent translocation outcomes.\n</p>","author":"Zoë L.
