{"title":"Surgical Correction of Infundibular Muscular Ventricular Septal Defect in a Cat: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0680/v1","date":1715563636000,"content":"This report elucidates the first surgical correction of an infundibular muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) in a one-year-old Ragdoll cat via cardiac arrest using cardiopulmonary bypass, a method that is rarely used in feline cardiac surgery. VSDs can lead to congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, particularly in patients with large shunts. This case involved a VSD that was atypically located and classified under the Soto classification instead of the standard Kirklin classification. Detailed echocardiography revealed that the defect required intervention owing to left heart and main pulmonary artery enlargement. Despite the VSD being located on the contralateral side, as anticipated in the preoperative examinations, the choice of median sternotomy allowed for successful closure of the defect. Conversely, the insertion of two cannulas into the ascending aorta resulted in damage to the adjacent thoracic duct, causing transient chylothorax, which resolved with conservative treatment. Cardiac arrest induced by a cardioplegic solution facilitated the surgical procedure, although it has led to anemia in cats. However, on postoperative day 490, the patient exhibited only minor residual shunting with normalized heart size, and remained healthy. This technique appears to be a viable treatment option for congenital heart disease in cats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1e1f2bb56e688ff94bb97bde568598f730075aec96e3e14dc0c6be4751f249c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
