{"title":"Oscillating magnetic field does not disrupt orientation in the presence of stellar cues in an avian migrant","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10336-023-02129-w","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Weak oscillating magnetic fields (OMF) in the radiofrequency range are known to disrupt the orientation of birds. However, until now, it has not been experimentally verified that the sensitivity to OMF is a characteristic feature specifically of the magnetic compass and OMF does not influence the celestial compass system as well. Here we studied if OMF affected the star compass of a long-distance migrant, the Garden Warbler. The birds were tested under the natural starry sky under two different conditions: in the natural magnetic field (NMF) and in radiofrequency OMF with the amplitude 20nT and frequency 1.41Â MHz (matching the Larmor frequency of a freestanding electron spin in the local NMF of 50,400 nT). This amplitude is about ten times higher than the sensitivity threshold to OMF shown for this species in previous studies. Our experimental results clearly demonstrated that OMF did not influence the celestial (star) compass system: with access to the starry sky garden warblers showed migratory orientation appropriate for autumn migratory season both in the NMF and in the OMF. Thus, the OMF effect is pertinent to the magnetic compass system, not to the avian orientation in general.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"8ce9c4d518bdb3a1acd4e64c73bbef48f938fec3f8c999c3152ecc4ac9b708b5","category":"Environment"}
