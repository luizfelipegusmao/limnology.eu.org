{"title":"Assessment of PPMV-1 Genotype VI Virulence in Pigeons and Chickens, and Protective Effectiveness of Paramyxovirus Vaccines in Pigeons","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1825/v1","date":1724660905000,"content":"Pigeon paramyxovirus serotype 1 (PPMV-1), primarily originating from racing pigeons, has become a global panzootic, spreading to poultry and wild birds, thus posing a threat to the poultry industry. Egypt uses both inactivated pigeon paramyxovirus (PPMV-1) and conventional Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccines to protect pigeons. However, the impact of prevalent strains and the effectiveness of available vaccines in pigeons in Egypt are unclear. This study investigates the virulence of PPMV-1 isolated from vaccinated pigeons in Sharkia, Egypt (Pigeon/ Egypt/Sharkia-19/2015/KX580988). Ten-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs infected with this strain exhibited a mean death time (MDT) of 86.4Â±5.88 hours. The intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in day-old chicks was 0.8, while pigeons experienced an ICPI of 0.96 and an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 2.11. These findings classify the strain as virulent and velogenic. Experimental infection with this PPMV-1 strain at 106 EID50/0.1 ml resulted in a 62.5% mortality rate in pigeons, displaying nervous and enteric distress. The virus caused extensive lesions in visceral organs, with strong immunohistochemistry signals in all examined organs, indicating the systemic spread of the virus concurrent to its neurotropic and viscerotropic tropism. Furthermore, vaccination using inactivated PPMV-1 and live NDV LaSota vaccine regimen protected 100% of pigeons against mortality, while a single NDV LaSota vaccine provided 62.5% protection. The PPMV alone or combined with NDV LaSota induced protective levels of hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers and reduced virus shedding from buccal and cloacal cavities. These findings suggest that using both inactivated PPMV-1 (G-VI) and live attenuated NDV (LaSota) vaccines is an effective prophylactic regimen for preventing and controlling PPMV-1 and NDV in pigeons, thereby reducing the risk of interspecies transmission.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5785e98da3e5a7ced748c127170f05b2d2fa5da158aace567627a02a843c3e9e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
