{"title":"Algorithmic Implementation to Visually Controlled Interception: Harmonic Ratios and Stimulation Invariants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1930/v1","date":1716964019000,"content":"This research presents a novel algorithmic implementation to improve the analysis of visually controlled interception and accompanying motor action through the computational application of harmonic ratios and stimulation invariants. \nUnlike traditional models that focus mainly on psychological aspects, our approach integrates the relevant constructs into a practical mathematical framework. This allows for dynamic prediction of interception points with improved accuracy and real-time perception-action capabilities, essential for applications in neurorehabilitation and virtual reality.\nOur methodology uses stimulation invariants as key parameters within a mathematical model to quantitatively predict and improve interception outcomes. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms over conventional methods, confirming their potential for ad-vancing robotic vision systems and adaptive virtual environments. By translating complex theo-ries of visual perception into algorithmic solutions, this study provides innovative ways to im-prove motion perception and interactive systems. This study aims to articulate the complex inter-play of geometry, perception, and technology in understanding and utilizing cross-ratios at infin-ity, emphasizing their practical applications in virtual and augmented reality settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe0ef8667d947879e725921a84b739b03049576b759a7cbd8c9421fe18e09cdb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
