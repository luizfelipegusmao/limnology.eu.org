{"title":"On the Additive and Subtractive Representation of Even Numbers from Primes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0087/v9","date":1660787581000,"content":"We demonstrate a new quantitative method to the sieve of Eratosthenes, which is an alternative to the sieve of Legendre. In this method, every element of a given set is sifted out once only, and therefore, this method is free of the Mobius function and of the parity barrier. Using this method, we prove that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes, and that every even number is the difference of two primes in infinitely many ways.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"969e183c8a3451d281915867ecd67a25c44995c8fd45bd33611f84a8b512992b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
