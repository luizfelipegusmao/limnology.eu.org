{"title":"Prostate Adenocarcinoma with Signet-Ring Cells and Features of Mucin. A Clinical Case and Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1070/v1","date":1713275238000,"content":"Introduction: Signet-ring cells are typically associated with mucin-secreting epithelium thus most commonly found in a gastrointestinal tract, however not exclusively. Primary signet ring cell carcinoma of the prostate is a rare and poorly differentiated, aggressive acinar adenocarcinoma variant with a grim prognosis. Clinical case: In June of 2023 a 54-year-old Caucasian male came to the hospital complaining of lower urinary tract obstructive symptoms with occasional macrohematuria, non-specific body aches, and shortness of breath. A prostate specimen obtained in transurethral resection of the prostate was sent for histopathological examination. After a series of extraprostatic diagnostic workups including fibrogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy computed tomography imaging, and immunohistochemical studies, the patient was diagnosed with primary prostatic signet-ring cell adenocarcinoma st. IV. Unfortunately, the patient with the disease this advanced, PE, and third-degree thrombocytopenia was not a candidate for chemotherapy and died of cardiopulmonary insufficiency later that week. Discussion: Prostatic signet-ring cell carcinoma accounts for 0.02% of all prostate adenocarcinoma cases. Due to its nature and epidemiology, a diligent extraprostatic investigation has to be carried out. The disease often presents with unremarkable clinical symptoms and variable serum prostate-specific antigen results which may contribute to its late diagnosis which together with inconsistent immunohistochemical findings and unpredictable response to hormonal treatment pose both diagnostic and therapeutic challenges that negatively affect the prognosis. Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and the need for diagnostic and therapeutic consensus within the research community in search of the primary site of the disease which may positively influence the prognosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f72a0bfaae8678404ccc0e9fa081274dc99de3e5a489fa93b1792720439f94c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
