{"title":"Creation of a Spatio-Temporal Algorithm &amp; Application to COVID-19 Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1165/v1","date":1721036945000,"content":"This study offers an in-depth analysis of the COVID-19 pandemicâ€™s trajectory in several member countries of the European Union (EU) to assess similarities in their crisis experiences. We also examine data from the United States to facilitate a larger comparison across continents. We introduce our new approach, which uses a spatio-temporal algorithm to identify five distinct and recurring phases that each country undergoes at different times during the pandemic. These stages include a Comfort Period characterized by minimal COVID-19 activity and limited impacts. The Preventive Situation demonstrates the implementation of proactive measures, with relatively low numbers of cases, deaths, and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions. The Worrying Situation is defined by high levels of concern and preparation as deaths and cases begin to rise and reach substantial levels. The Panic Situation is marked by a high number of deaths relative to the number of cases and a rise in ICU admissions, denoting a critical and alarming period of the pandemic. Finally, the Epidemic Control Situation distinguishes itself by limiting COVID-19 deaths despite a high number of new cases. By examining these phases, we identify the various waves of the pandemic, indicating periods where the health crisis has a significant impact. This comparative analysis highlights the time lags between countries as they transition through these different critical stages and navigate the waves of COVID-19.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"14c6280c61d764af740cfa2b79ad73fb24ca999e872ad021817823a7a25b6ec2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
