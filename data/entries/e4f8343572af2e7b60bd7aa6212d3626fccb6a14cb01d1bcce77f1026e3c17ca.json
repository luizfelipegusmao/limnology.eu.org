In this regard, the pressing need for energy storage systems with both higher energy densities and high-power capabilities requires the development and implementation of new battery electrode nanomaterials as well as high stability liquid/solid electrolytes, in a manner that also permits a circular economy to be developed – recycling Li-ion batteries is a major challenge in itself.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e4f8343572af2e7b60bd7aa6212d3626fccb6a14cb01d1bcce77f1026e3c17ca","category":"Environment"}
