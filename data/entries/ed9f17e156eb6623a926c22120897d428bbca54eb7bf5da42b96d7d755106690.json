{"title":"Influenza A Viruses in Swine Population &ndash; a Scientific Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0234/v1","date":1727945819000,"content":"Influenza viruses are important pathogens that affect human and animal health. The ecology and epidemiology of influenza viruses are very complex because they have a diverse host range. Influenza A viruses are responsible for serious epidemics. Influenza B viruses cause respiratory disease in humans, seals, and pigs. Influenza C viruses are infectious to humans and pigs. Influenza D virus infects cattle, although it was first isolated from a sick pig in 2011. Only influenza A viruses are of clinical importance in pigs. Although influenza A viruses infect a variety of animal species, pigs are one of the natural hosts of these viruses. Swine influenza is a very serious respiratory disease in pigs, and its main causative agents are the H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes, which are antigenically related to human influenza viruses. Pigs are susceptible to infection by avian and human influenza viruses and are thought to play a significant role in the ecology of human influenza. This review examines scientific articles on the zoonotic spread of swine influenza A viruses to humans, their circulation in pig populations worldwide, reverse zoonosis from humans to pigs, and the role of pigs in interspecies transmission.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed9f17e156eb6623a926c22120897d428bbca54eb7bf5da42b96d7d755106690","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
