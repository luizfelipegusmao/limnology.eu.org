In this study, we used a GFP-activation assay to screen 14 new Cas12a nucleases for mammalian genome editing, successfully identifying 9 active ones. Notably, these Cas12a nucleases prefer pyrimidine-rich PAMs. Among these nucleases, we extensively characterized Mb4Cas12a obtained from <i>Moraxella bovis CCUG 2133</i>, which recognizes a YYN PAM (Y = C or T). Our biochemical analysis demonstrates that Mb4Cas12a can cleave double-strand DNA across a wide temperature range. To improve specificity, we constructed a SWISS-MODEL of Mb4Cas12a based on the FnCas12a crystal structure and identified 8 amino acids potentially forming hydrogen bonds at the target DNA-crRNA interface. By replacing these amino acids with alanine to disrupt the hydrogen bond, we tested the influence of each mutation on Mb4Cas12a specificity. Interestingly, the F370A mutation improved specificity with minimal influence on activity. Further study showed that Mb4Cas12a-F370A is capable of discriminating single-nucleotide polymorphisms. These new Cas12a orthologs and high-fidelity variants hold substantial promise for therapeutic applications.","author":"Jingjing Wei","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"30b68f852c4a3b77d8c701c4733fdf5e916570c579b828e5164500ae3c54e2f9","category":"Environment"}
