In cancer management, the monitoring of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from liquid biopsies can provide valuable information for precision care, including treatment selection and monitoring, prognosis, and early detection. However, the rare and heterogeneous nature of ctDNA has made its precise detection and quantification challenging, particularly for ctDNA containing hotspot mutations. We have developed a new real-time PCR tool, PROMER technology, which enables the precise and sensitive detection of ctDNA containing cancer-driven single-point mutations. The PROMER functions as both a PRObe and priMER, providing enhanced detection specificity. We validated PROMER technology using synthetic templates with known KRAS point mutations and demonstrated its sensitivity and linearity of quantification. Using genomic DNA from human cancer cells with mutant and wild-type KRAS, we confirmed that PROMER PCR can detect mutant DNA. Furthermore, we demonstrated the ability of PROMER technology to efficiently detect mutation-carrying ctDNA from the plasma of mice with human cancers. Our results suggest that PROMER technology represents a promising new tool for the precise detection and quantification of DNA containing point mutations in the presence of a large excess of wild-type counterpart.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"3f0d55f9c84a119ffc1b60aed5f76aa35b514d5d71d51f7a1adc6b6e9e06e85f","category":"Environment"}
