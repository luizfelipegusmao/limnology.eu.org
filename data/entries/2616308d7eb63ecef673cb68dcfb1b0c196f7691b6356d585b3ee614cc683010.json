{"title":"Advancements in Facial Recognition for Automated Attendance   \nManagement: A Comprehensive OpenCV-based Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1472/v1","date":1724151082000,"content":"Abstract: Abstract: In the present era, there is no longer a necessity to rely on outdated and \nlaborious methods for attendance management in the field of education. Managing attendance \nfor large groups of students in a classroom can be a challenging and time-consuming task when \nit comes to recording data. Fortunately, modern technologies offer us the opportunity to \nstreamline attendance management and make it more efficient. One effective approach is \nReal-Time Face Recognition, which simplifies the process of tracking attendance for numerous \nstudents daily. We employ the Haar cascade classifier to identify positive and negative facial \nattributes, along with the LBPH algorithm for accurate face recognition. These techniques are \nimplemented using Python programming language and the OpenCV library while \nincorporating a user-friendly Tkinter GUI (Graphical User Interface) for seamless usability. By \nembracing these advancements, we can revolutionize how attendance is managed in \neducational environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2616308d7eb63ecef673cb68dcfb1b0c196f7691b6356d585b3ee614cc683010","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
