{"title":"Job Satisfaction Among First-Generation Migrant Physicians in Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine in Germany","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0819/v1","date":1725974045000,"content":"This study investigates job satisfaction, burnout, and well-being among first-generation migrant physicians in anesthesia and intensive care medicine in Germany, comparing them to their native German counterparts.\nUtilizing a cross-sectional survey design, the study collected data from 513 physicians, 110 of whom identified as having a migration background. Job satisfaction was measured using the German version of the Warr-Cook-Wall (WCW) Job Satisfaction Scale, burnout was assessed with the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), and well-being was evaluated using the WHO-5 Well-Being Index. \nThe job satisfaction ratings revealed no significant differences between migrant and German physicians in most dimensions, including physical workload, freedom to choose work methods, satisfaction with colleagues, responsibility, income, skill utilization, and variety in work tasks. However, migrant physicians reported significantly higher satisfaction with recognition received for their work and lower dissatisfaction with working hours. Burnout assessments showed that migrant physicians experienced higher psychological strain, perceiving every work hour as more exhausting and having significantly less energy for family and friends. Notably, migrant physicians reported higher difficulty and frustration in working with patients. Well-being ratings indicated that migrant physicians felt less energetic and active but found their daily life more filled with interesting activities.\nThe findings underscore the unique challenges faced by migrant physicians, particularly in terms of recognition and patient-related burnout. These results highlight the need for targeted interventions to support migrant physicians, including cultural competence training and flexible working hours to enhance their job satisfaction and overall well-being. Addressing these issues is crucial for maintaining the quality of patient care and the occupational health of migrant physicians in Germany.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b7c645fc68c8b6cef0e0810ebe7702b71922603a875422e7247277ebc9501ccc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
