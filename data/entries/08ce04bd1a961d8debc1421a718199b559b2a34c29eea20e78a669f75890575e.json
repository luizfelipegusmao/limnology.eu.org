{"title":"Integrated metabolomics and network pharmacology to reveal the lipid‐lowering mechanisms of Qizha Shuangye granules in hyperlipidemic rats","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13213?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Qizha Shuangye granules (QSG) comprise six traditional Chinese herbal medicines (TCHMs), which have a long history of treating hyperlipidemia (HLP) in China. This study aimed to evaluate the potential lipid-lowering effects of QSG in an HLP rat model and investigate possible mechanisms. The HLP rat model was induced by a high-fat diet. Lipid-related indicators in serum were detected. Serum and liver metabolites were investigated using a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach. A herb–compound–target–metabolite (H-C-T-M) network was further constructed to reveal the possible molecular mechanism of QSG to alleviate HLP.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The administration of QSG inhibited the HLP-induced changes in total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels. Additionally, QSG significantly attenuated the liver histopathological changes induced by HLP. Metabolomic analysis showed the serum and liver metabolic disorders presented in HLP rats. QSG can reverse the abnormal metabolism caused by HLP. Through network pharmacology analysis, key proteins such as androgen receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α were screened out, and they were speculated to be possible therapeutic targets for QSG to treat HLP.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study integrated metabolomics and network pharmacology analysis to reveal the efficacy and possible mechanism of QSG in treating HLP, which provides a new reference for the research and development of QSG as a functional food. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Liang Zhao, \nShuyue Wang, \nXiaohang Xu, \nWenjun Guo, \nJingxuan Yang, \nYue Liu, \nShengxu Xie, \nGuangchun Piao, \nTunhai Xu, \nYang Wang, \nYajuan Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"08ce04bd1a961d8debc1421a718199b559b2a34c29eea20e78a669f75890575e","category":"Environment"}
