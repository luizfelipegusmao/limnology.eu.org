{"title":"RBD specific B-cell Memory Responses among Vaccinated Individuals against SARS-CoV-2","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0230/v1","date":1722917127000,"content":"During the last few years, the world witnessed one of the worst calamities to humankind- the COVID-19 pandemic. We also witnessed the development of vaccines at an unprecedented pace against the SARS-CoV-2- the causative agent. India was among the hard-hit countries by COVID-19, developed its indigenous vaccine and implemented vaccines developed in other countries as well. Initially, the antibody level and the neutralizing antibody titer against the pathogen were considered as the correlates of immune protection from the disease. However, the long-term protection from the pathogen was provided by the immune memory cells viz. T and B memory cells and their ability to efficiently make recall responses. In this regard, globally the research studies focused mainly on the mRNA-based vaccines. The studies on immune memory response, particularly- the B cell memory response bestowed by the vaccines given to Indians is relatively obscure. We studied the level of RBD specific memory B cells in the peripheral circulation of the study participants and the ability of B cells to secrete antigen-specific antibodies among Indians vaccinated with Covaxin (BBV152), Covishield (AZD1222), Corbevax (BECOV2D) and Sputnik Light (Gam-COVID-Vac) as well as unvaccinated individuals. Our study revealed that Corbevax and Sputnik Light conferred better antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a22bf2ceade0978a23c69f06718aa5c63755c28d7ae8d90892d9b8b76aafc05","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
