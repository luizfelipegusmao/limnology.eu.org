{"title":"Investigating the Epigenetic Landscape of Major Depressive Disorder: A Genome-Wide Meta-Analysis of DNA Methylation Data, including New Insights into Stochastic Epigenetic Muta-Tions and Epivariations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1504/v1","date":1724208020000,"content":"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition with substantial social and economic consequences. This study focuses on the interplay between genetic and environmen-tal factors in MDD, with particular emphasis on epigenetic mechanisms such as stochastic epige-netic mutations (SEMs), epigenetic age acceleration, and epigenetic drift. We conducted a meta-analysis of DNA methylation patterns across six datasets (n=1125 MDD cases, 398 controls in whole blood; n=95 MDD cases, 96 controls in brain tissues) from the Gene Expression Omnibus. The analysis did not reveal significant global methylation differences between MDD cases and controls. However, a brain-specific probe (cg25801113) near the SHF gene consistently exhibited hypomethylation, suggesting its potential relevance to MDD. SEMs were assessed, revealing a dis-tinct burden at the gene level in MDD cases, though no significant findings emerged for epigenetic age acceleration, indicating it may not play a central role in MDD. The study also identified rare epivariations in specific genes unique to MDD cases. In blood tissue, 51 genes were associated with these unique epivariations, while 1 gene was highlighted in the brain tissue. These results un-derscore the importance of exploring rare epivariations in understanding the molecular mecha-nisms underlying MDD and offer potential targets for further investigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3214eebfe442df5fed514f0154a0c131a4c9fc1fc197426132e2f42da2e3eec2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
