{"title":"144 Bioavailability of calcium salt of hydroxy analogue of methionine relative to DL-methionine to support growth performance of 11 to 20 kg pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/115/7664699?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Methionine (Met) is typically the third limiting AA in commercial swine diets and is commonly supplied as dry DL-Met (99% pure) or DL-Met hydroxy analogue. Data on the relative bioavailability (RBV) of calcium salt of hydroxy analogue of DL-Met (MHA-Ca; 84%) compared with DL-Met in weaned pigs is scarce. The objective of the experiment was to determine the RBV of MHA-Ca compared with DL-Met to support growth performance of 11 to 20 kg pigs. A total of 504 piglets [DNA x Pietrain pigs; approximately 42 d of age and 11 kg body weight (BW)] were used in two blocks of 252 pigs each with 6 pigs (3 entire males and 3 gilts) per pen and 12 replicate pens per treatment. Within each block, pigs were randomly allotted to 7 diets for 21 d. A basal diet (BD) was formulated to be adequate in all essential nutrients except for Met (0.22% standardized ileal digestible Met), which was 61% of the SID Met requirement of 0.36% recommended by NRC (2012) for 10 to 25 kg pigs. The Met-deficient BD was then supplemented with 3 graded levels of DL-Met (0.05, 0.10, and 0.15%) or MHA-Ca (0.077, 0.154, and 0.231%) at the expense of corn. Pigs had ad libitum access to feed (mash) and water. Individual pigs and pen feed disappearance were weighed on d 0 and d 21 to calculate average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed conversion rate (FCR). On d 21, blood samples were collected from 1 pig per pen after 8 h fasting to determine total protein, albumin and glucose. Data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design using GLM procedure of SAS 9.4 (SAS Inst. Inc.). Orthogonal-polynomial contrasts were used to determine linear and quadratic effects of increasing levels of DL-Met and MHA-Ca, and the effect of Met sources. The final BW at d 21 and overall average daily gain (ADG; 375, 401, 429, 430, 402, 431, and 428 g/d for diets 1 to 7, respectively) increased linearly (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) by graded additions with both Met sources. The ADFI was not different but the overall FCR (1.64, 1.55, 1.51, 1.45, 1.59, 1.46, and 1.50 for diets 1 to 7, respectively) improved linearly (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) by supplementation with DL-Met or MHA-Ca. Pig performance responses (ADG, ADFI and FCR) was not different (<span>P</span> â‰¥ 0.15) when Met was supplemented in the Met-deficient diet at a DL-Met to MHA-Ca ratio of 65:100 on a product basis. Plasma concentrations of total protein, albumin and glucose on d 21 were not affected (<span>P</span> &gt;0.05) by dietary treatments or Met sources. Based on ADG as a response of Met supplementation level, the linear and exponential regressions estimated the RBV of 64 and 65%, respectively for MHA-Ca relative to DL-Met (product-to-product basis) in 11 to 20 kg pigs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"d544b7ece9714c369bc43695b19ecf9521056c8835fb1cff22c94949032e9b1d","category":"Environment"}
