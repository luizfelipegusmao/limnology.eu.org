{"title":"The Carotenoid Composition of Larvae Feed Is Reflected in Adult House Fly (Musca domestica) Body","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0943/v1","date":1715669484000,"content":"Carotenoids are common and diverse organic compounds with various functional roles in ani-mals. Except for certain aphids, mites, and gall midges, all animals acquire necessary carotenoids only through their diet. The House fly (Musca domestica) is a cosmopolitan pest insect that populates diverse habitats. Its larvae feed on organic substrates that may vary in carotenoid composition according to their specific content. We hypothesized that the carotenoid composition in the adult House flyâ€™s body would reflect its composition in the larval feed. We reared house fly larvae on substrates that differed in carotenoid composition and characterized the carotenoid composition of the emerging adults. Our results indicate that the carotenoid composition of adult House flies is related to the carotenoid composition in its natal substrate, but does not directly reflect it. We suggest that these findings may be developed to identify sources of House fly in-festations. We also recommend that care should be taken when considering the rearing substrates of House fly larvae used for animal feed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"18f1b72e397da0b23a3f23d9260d9527a8d2d1ebd1b23e90c383653f13976db3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
