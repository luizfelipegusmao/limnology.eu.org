Conditions are not always amendable to estimating feed digestibility through total collection methods, and as a result digestibility markers are frequently employed. The first “Digestibility markers” were reported in the early 1900s where colored glass beads were used to estimate the flow of digesta through the digestive tract. Subsequently, a myriad of digestibility markers has been assessed with the internal markers; acid insoluble ash, acid detergent lignin, indigestible neutral detergent fiber and n-alkanes and the external markers titanium dioxide and chromic oxide being the most common. Chromic oxide (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) was first proposed as a digestibility maker in 1918 and continues to be widely used in modern day metabolism, confined performance and grazing livestock experiments. It was the demand to use chromic acid as a digestibility marker that led Terry and Mira Fenton to publish the article “An improved procedure for the determination of chromic oxide in feed and feces” in the Canadian Journal of Animal Science in 1979. This became the most cited article in the history of the journal with over 800 citations. The procedure eliminated the use of nitric acid in a pre-digestion step and ashing reduced the organic matter content, making it less likely that perchloric acid would be converted to anhydrous perchloric acid which poses an explosive hazard. The procedure continues to be widely used to measure Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a digestibility marker and has made a significant contribution to our assessment of the value of a wide range of feeds for Canadian livestock.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"ab6bbc41227590cf7569173ac29056e7d17a014ebf987f63fb42515ea2a93ad7","category":"Environment"}
