{"title":"A Study on the Effect of XRF-Escape Process on the Energy Resolution of a Scintillation Detector: The Case of a NaI(Tl) for Medical Imaging or Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202308.0680/v2","date":1714644851000,"content":"Present work investigates, in photon energy domains of specific interest for medical imaging, the effect of the escape of X-ray fluorescence from the scintillator materials on the energy resolution of scintillation detector itself. Monolithic as well as pixelated crystals differently sized are considered, in the case of the NaI because it is the gold standard in the field. The volumetric ratio is introduced, as a figure of merit, taking into account, alongside the surface-to-volume ratio, the geometric shape, the elemental composition and also the mean-free-path for the given scintillator and energy. The inter-crystal XRF escape is finally suggested to be considered among the effects producing image blurring in segmented scintillatros due to the spread of events between the primary pixel and the first neighbors ones.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4cfe9a946b03f53cd42dba172f1be08a49ead5f27353c3ee40146eafbf50767","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
