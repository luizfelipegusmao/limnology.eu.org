{"title":"Peat‐based amendment of soils reduces the complexity of the volatile profile in cultivated black truffles","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13722?af=R","date":1721910849000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Truffle cultivation is evolving rapidly and new agronomic practices such as ‘truffle nests’ (localized peat amendments of the orchard soil) are being developed. Truffle nests improve the shape of truffles and their depth in the soil and reduce the occurrence of insect damage but have also raised concerns about their impact on the ripeness and maturity of the harvested truffles. In this study, the effect of the nests on the volatile organic compounds profile and the aromatic profile of black truffles was evaluated, as well as the existence of perceptible sensorial differences in truffles. For this, truffles growing in nests were compared with truffles growing in the bulk soil of the same host tree.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Gas chromatography showed that nest truffles had a less complex volatile organic compound profile than bulk-soil truffles. Olfactometry indicated that nest truffles were associated with higher modified frequency values of odorants corresponding to sulfur-containing compounds. Despite this, sensory evaluation with consumers could not clearly show that nest truffles can be distinguished sensorially from bulk-soil truffles.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The results prove that soil conditions can influence the aromatic profile of truffles and thus suggest the possibility of managing truffle aroma using agronomic practices. © 2024 The Author(s).
