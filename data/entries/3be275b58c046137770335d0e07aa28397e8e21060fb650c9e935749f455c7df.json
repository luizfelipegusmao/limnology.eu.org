{"title":"A balancing act: ERFVII feedback loops finetune the flooding stress response","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1271/7420156?rss=1","date":1699920000000,"content":"<span>Plants are masters of environmental adaptation. Flooding is one of the environmental stresses that plants face ever more frequently as a consequence of climate change. The first signal of submergence stress is the accumulation of gaseous phytohormone ethylene (<a href=\"#kiad609-F1\">Fig. A</a>). Ethylene mediates the adaptation to submergence stress by regulating a battery of Ethylene Response Factors (ERFs) at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational level (<a href=\"#kiad609-B9\">Maric and Hartman 2022</a>). A specific family of ERFs, the ERFVIIs, are part of a cellular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and nitric oxide (NO) sensing mechanism because their stability is directly controlled by the concentration of these gases (<a href=\"#kiad609-B2\">Gibbs et al. 2011</a>; <a href=\"#kiad609-B8\">Licausi et al. 2011</a>; <a href=\"#kiad609-B3\">Gibbs et al. 2014</a>). Indeed, ERFVIIs stabilize during O<sub>2</sub> deprivation (hypoxia) and NO depletion (<a href=\"#kiad609-B3\">Gibbs et al. 2014</a>; <a href=\"#kiad609-B6\">Holdsworth and Gibbs 2020</a>). Ethylene can further promote ERFVII stability in Arabidopsis through the fast induction of a plant hemoglobin, <span>PHYTOGLOBIN 1</span> (<span>PGB1</span>) (<a href=\"#kiad609-B4\">Hartman et al. 2019</a>). PGB1 is a NO scavenger that can limit the NO-dependent proteolysis of ERFVIIs (<a href=\"#kiad609-B4\">Hartman et al. 2019</a>). Consequently, in response to the flooding signals ethylene and hypoxia, the ERFVIIs quickly accumulate and start a signaling pathway increasing plant tolerance to flooding.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"3be275b58c046137770335d0e07aa28397e8e21060fb650c9e935749f455c7df","category":"Environment"}
