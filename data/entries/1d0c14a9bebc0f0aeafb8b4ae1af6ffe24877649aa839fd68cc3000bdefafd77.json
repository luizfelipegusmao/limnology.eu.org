Cubic boron arsenide (BAs) was predicted and found to have an ultra-high thermal conductivity (κ) [<a href=\"#ozae044.076-B1\">1–3</a>], a high electron-hole mobility [<a href=\"#ozae044.076-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.076-B5\">5</a>], and a long hot photocarrier lifetime [<a href=\"#ozae044.076-B6\">6</a>]. However, these reported properties have poor uniformity within the same sample and large variations between different samples due to defects. Here, we performed vibrational electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) across coherent twin boundaries (CTB) and found that the optical modes have a small redshift around 0.5 meV while the acoustic modes do not show a clear variation at CTBs. The small redshift of the optical modes implies a slight reduction of the averaged group velocities, which agrees with simulation in other systems [<a href=\"#ozae044.076-B7\">7</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1d0c14a9bebc0f0aeafb8b4ae1af6ffe24877649aa839fd68cc3000bdefafd77","category":"Environment"}
