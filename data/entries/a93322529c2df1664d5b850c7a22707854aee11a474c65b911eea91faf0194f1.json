{"title":"Environmental Impact Evaluation of CO2 Absorption and Desorption Enhancement by Membrane Gas Absorption: A life Cycle Assessment Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0323/v1","date":1715092821000,"content":"Membrane gas absorption technology has been considered as a promising approach to mitigate CO2 emissions from power plants. The aim of this study is to evaluate the environmental impacts of CO2 absorption and desorption processes by hollow fiber membrane contactors using life cycle assessment methodology. On the basis of ReCipe 2016 Midpoint and ReCipe 2016 Endpoint methods, the research results show that, membrane gas absorption system exhibits the lowest environmental impacts across the majority assessed categories in comparison with chemical absorption and membrane gas separation systems. The CO2 capture process via membrane gas absorption has the most significant impact on METP category, with heat consumption as the primary contributing factor accounting for 55%, followed by electricity consumption accounting for 43.1%. According to the sensitivity analysis, heating by natural gas shows a better performance than other heat supply sources in improving overall environmental impacts. In addition, the increasing utilization of renewable energy in electricity supply reduces the global warming potential, fossil resource consumption and ozone formation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a93322529c2df1664d5b850c7a22707854aee11a474c65b911eea91faf0194f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
