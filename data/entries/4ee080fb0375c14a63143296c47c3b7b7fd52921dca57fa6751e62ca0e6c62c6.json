{"title":"Rapid Modeling Method for Airborne FSS Radomes Based on Dynamic Customizable Primitives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0721/v1","date":1715364022000,"content":"The digital model of airborne frequency selective surface radomes (AFSSRs) is the basis of design, simulation analysis, manufacturing, and other related research of AFSSRs. This paper proposes a rapid modeling method of AFSSRs based on dynamic customizable primitives. Firstly, a layered digital model construction scheme of AFSSR is presented based on the typical radome wall structure. Then, according to the characteristics of various surface configurations and complex wireframe information of AFSSRs, the dynamic primitives are raised to express the boundary and contour information of all kinds of radomes. Focusing on the undevelopable characteristics of the aero-dynamic shape surface of the AFSSR, the arrangement solution and mapping method for frequency selective elements on undevelopable surfaces are proposed. Furthermore, the imple-mentation logic of this method on the creation of each layer model and the assembly of the whole machine model is introduced. Finally, according to this method, a rapid modeling system (RMS) is established, and the modeling effect and efficiency of the RMS are demonstrated and compared, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of this method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ee080fb0375c14a63143296c47c3b7b7fd52921dca57fa6751e62ca0e6c62c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
