{"title":"Physical, Textural and Sensory Properties of Spreadable Processed Whey Cheese as Affected by Addition of Polysaccharides","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0847/v1","date":1728611925000,"content":"Different polysaccharides, namely xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum and κ-carrageenan were used as stabilizers, individually or in mixtures (50:50), in order to prepare nine (9) spreadable processed whey cheese (PWC) samples: X, G, L, C, X/G, X/L, C/X, C/G, and C/L. The pH and chemical composition of samples were constant. The impact of polysaccharides on the physical, textural, and sensory characteristics of PWC samples was examined, revealing significant differences (P&amp;lt;0.05) in all assessed properties among the samples. PWC samples had an off-white color with a slight yellowish hue. All samples were stable emulsion gels, with free oil formation values ​​ranging between 4% (X/L) and 12% (C/G). Textural properties, as determined by texture profile analysis, highly correlated with physical and sensory attributes. The PWC samples X, G, L, X/G and C/X were less hard, while they were rated by panelists as having increased fattiness, stickiness, as well as texture and overall acceptability. Sample X was the softest and the most cohesive, adhesive, springy, stringy and gummy, in comparison to the other PWC samples. In contrast, brittleness and increased hardness were exhibited by the samples C, C/G, C/L and X/L, which were judged unsuitable for spreading by the panelists. In conclusion, the development of such cheeses aims not only at the production of tasty and nutritious products, but also at sustainability, as it utilizes whey, which is a by-product of cheese making.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0aed15d2d063c42c5517f9f1ce2db76df182ba3413efcb4d14469521ef5fb5f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
