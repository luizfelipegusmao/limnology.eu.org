{"title":"Exploring Silica Nanoparticles: A Sustainable Solution for Pest Control in Sri Lankan Rice Farming","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1712/v1","date":1727142656000,"content":"Rice cultivation stands as a cornerstone of Sri Lanka's economy, serving as a vital source of em-ployment for rural communities. However, the constraints of limited land availability have prompted an escalating dependence on agrochemicals, notably for pest management, thereby posing significant threats to human health and the environment. This review delves into the ex-ploration of silica nanoparticles as a promising eco-friendly substitute for conventional pesticides in the context of Sri Lankan rice farming. It comprehensively examines various aspects including the synthesis methods of silica nanoparticles, their encapsulation with synthetic pesticides, and an evaluation of their efficacy in pest control. Furthermore, it sheds light on the innovative utilization of agricultural waste such as rice husk and straw in the production of silica-based nano-pesticides. This approach not only demonstrates a shift towards sustainable agricultural practices but also aligns with the principles of green chemistry and circular economy, offering a holistic solution to the challenges faced by the rice farming sector in Sri Lanka.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed3630d59a65dfc993c15e71b6e219edb2df175c6ed2aeef0346fe05b130e672","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
