{"title":"Fruit Variation in Yellow-Fleshed A. chinensis Plants Grown in Southern Italy as a Function of Shoot Type","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0040/v1","date":1719812817000,"content":"One of the goals of modern orcharding is to have a high production of fruits that are uniform in size, organoleptic parameters, and health characteristics. The aim of the work was to study the assortment of different shoot types and their prevailing position along the cane and how shoot type can contribute to on shoot type on fruit quality in Actinidia tree. The experiment was carried out over two years in a commercial orchard of Actinidia chinensis, cv Gold 3. Along the cane, the shoots were classified as Spur shoot (SP), terminate shoot (TE), no terminate shoot (NT), and cut no terminate shoot (CNT). The data were statistically processed using ANOVA and Principal Component Analysis (ACP). Four different fruit categories were obtained from to the four shoot type to compared: a prevailing category (55% of total fruits), which is characterised by its higher soluble solids content, sweetness, and excellent health characteristics, but with a lower hardness of the pulp, which would lead to the hypothesis that harvesting could be brought forward; a second category of fruit (19% of total fruit) with the lowest soluble solids content, but a high antioxidant capacity detached from CNT shoot; another category of fruit (13% of total fruit) produced from NT shoots, with the lowest health value, but good sweetness perception; finally the category with the lowest fruit percentage over total fruit harvested (10%) from SP shoots, characterised by its smaller size. It is to be verified what the performance of each category will be after post-harvest to speculate whether it is possible to differentiate the product at harvest into quality categories or possibly to differentiate the harvest time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"199af2139b843c5656f49530c6b6ae34eb5d5771e504416c2e06033ec5cd862a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
