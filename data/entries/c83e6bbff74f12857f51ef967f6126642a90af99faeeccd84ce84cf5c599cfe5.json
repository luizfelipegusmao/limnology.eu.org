Additionally, no study has been conducted to explore the consequence of the combination of both ORS and MEF on the kidneys of rats with obesity-induced renal injury (OBS). Objectives: Therefore, the objective of the current research was designed to explore the possible ameliorative effects of either ORS and/or MEF or their combination against obesity (OBS) induced experimental renal oxidative stress. Methods: Renal oxidative stress was investigated at redox histopathological and immunohistological points in the kidney tissues. Results: The levels of urea, uric acid, and creatinine increased with the obesity effect; in addition, the myeloperoxidase (MPO) and xanthine oxidase (XO) activators were elevated significantly with the induction of OBS. The levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants (glutathione and thiol) declined sharply in OBS rats as compared to the normal group. Conclusion: The data displayed that the combination of both ORS and MEF declined the obesity effects significantly by reducing the level of peroxidation (MDA), and enhancement intracellular antioxidant enzymes. These biochemical findings were supported by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and Masson-Trichrome evaluation, which showed minor morphological changes in the kidneys of rats.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"c83e6bbff74f12857f51ef967f6126642a90af99faeeccd84ce84cf5c599cfe5","category":"Environment"}
