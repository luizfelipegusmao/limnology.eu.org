{"title":"Control System Modification of a 5-kW Pellet Stove: Study and Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0212/v1","date":1717566206000,"content":"The use of sustainable energy sources is a feasible alternative for fossil fuel products, which can represent a positive factor to alleviate many current environmental issues. In that sense, not only the sustainable industrial development is important, but also sustainable practices at local level, including households. Specifically, heating and cooking are one of the most important activities that require energy in households, where the role of biomass could be interesting, as it can provide an energy source with lower environmental impact. However, there is room for improvement in biomass stoves, whose adaptability to specific wastes, as well as their improvement in efficiency, should be accomplished. The aim of this work was to assess the improvement of combustion performance of a domestic stove by the implementation of a programmable logic converter for a better adaptation to different biomass samples (holm oak, pear tree, poplar and sugarcane bagasse pellets). Thus, the working regime of the stove was controlled, especially concerning the screw conveyor (to regulate pellet feeding) and flue gas fan (to change oxygen supply). As a result, better combustion performances were obtained, heat capacities from 5.66 to 8.67 kW for the selected samples. On the other hand, different improvements of the combustion stove to avoid blockages, for instance, are proposed as further steps.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"825c9418ce0a89b36b50a3ef67940cff09eda2369ffafa433921714006f6f741","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
