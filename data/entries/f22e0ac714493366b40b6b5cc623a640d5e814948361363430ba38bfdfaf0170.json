{"title":"Transient Elevation of Liver Function Tests and Bilirubin Levels after Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1466/v1","date":1729262374000,"content":"Background\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy constitutes the current “gold standard” treatment of symptomatic gallstone disease. In order to avoid intraoperative vasculobiliary injuries it is mandatory to establish “critical view of safety”. In case of poor identification of the cystic duct and artery leading to a missed intraoperative injury, patients present with elevated liver function tests (LFTs) or increased bilirubin postoperatively. The aim of this study is to present a series of patients of our institute with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the absence of intraoperative injury or any other obvious etiology and to provide a possible explanation of this finding.\n\nMethods\nFrom 2019 to 2023, 200 patients underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the Papageorgiou General Hospital and at the European Interbalcan Medical Center of Thessaloniki utilizing the “critical view of safety” method. We retrospectively collected the intraoperative reports and the pre and postoperative imaging and laboratory studies of the patients included in this series. Postoperative LFTs and bilirubin levels were extracted and the reason for their transient elevation was examined.\n\nResults\nFrom 200 cases of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, in 6 patients elevated LFTs and bilirubin were found on the first postoperative day, which is suggestive of a missed intraoperative injury. All patients were asymptomatic. During the investigatory workup, a triple-phase CT of the liver and/or an MRCP were ordered, but no pathological findings, such as biliary injury, hepatic artery injury or choledocholithiasis, were found. On postoperative day 3, LFTs and bilirubin levels decreased or normalized without any intervention. No postoperative complications were reported.\n\nConclusion\nIn select cases, a transient increase in LFTs and/or bilirubin may be observed in the early postoperative period after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the absence of an obvious etiology. A possible interpretation of these findings could involve the pneumoperitoneum or  the anesthesia regimens used intra- or perioperatively. The specific cause however remains undetermined and yet to be examined by future studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f22e0ac714493366b40b6b5cc623a640d5e814948361363430ba38bfdfaf0170","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
