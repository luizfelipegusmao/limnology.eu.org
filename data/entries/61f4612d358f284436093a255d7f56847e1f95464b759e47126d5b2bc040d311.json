However, its uptake mechanism and transport in rice remain to be explored. In this article, rice seedlings were treated by the foliar spraying method, and the content of KSM in rice leaves, stems and roots under different treatments was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), respectively. Results showed that leaf-applied KSM could be transported to the phloem and migrate to roots and stems after uptake by leaves. Concentration, temperature and pH had significant effects on the uptake of KSM. Compared with the control, the competitive inhibitors <span>d</span>-glucose and phlorizin both inhibited the uptake of KSM, demonstrating that sugar transporter proteins were involved in the uptake process. The energy inhibitors dinitrophenol (DNP) and carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) also significantly inhibited the uptake of KSM, indicating that the uptake of KSM required energy consumption. Thus, the uptake of KSM by rice was an active process involving sugar transporter proteins, and it could migrate downward through the phloem. This study contributes to the promotion of the scientific application of antibiotics and the biological control of crop diseases. It will also provide a theoretical basis for the development of root-targeted pesticides and transport pesticides with phloem mobility.</p>","author":"Huayang Xu, \nHongzhen Zhang, \nGuoyu Wei, \nYuling Jiang, \nMeto Yao Charles, \nAnlong Hu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of Applied Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a403b38a3432c20b8a9e38602184acbfc416cca77ff6bdf54b49e3b6eafe9c39","entryHash":"61f4612d358f284436093a255d7f56847e1f95464b759e47126d5b2bc040d311","category":"Environment"}
