{"title":"Multi-Criteria Calibration of a Thermo-Mechanical Model of Steel Plate Welding in Vacuum","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2359/v1","date":1727675278000,"content":"This paper proposes a methodology for multi-criteria calibration of a thermo-mechanical model for numerical simulation of welding in vacuum. A finite element model of a steel plate is created. Experimental and computational data are obtained. An inverse problem is formulated for the vector identification of five calibration parameters from the heat flow model. They are evaluated for adequacy with controlled accuracy according to four criteria. An optimization problem is solved using a two-step interactive procedure. The parameter space studying method (PSI) has been applied to the study of multidimensional regions by means of quasi-uniform sounding. A Pareto-optimal set is defined. It is used to determine reduced ranked Pareto subsets by -selection. Salukvadze optimum is also determined.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c9babe631d6496e170acff081a1fe1ea83265273537196286e4493219dcc05e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
