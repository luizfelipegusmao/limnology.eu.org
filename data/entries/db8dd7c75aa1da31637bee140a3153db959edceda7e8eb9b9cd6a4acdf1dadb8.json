{"title":"Porvac&reg; Subunit Vaccine Confers Full Protection against Three Field Isolates of Classical Swine Fever Virus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0269/v1","date":1717576259000,"content":"The control of classical swine fever (CSF) in endemic areas has been attempted with modified live vaccines. However, in some regions, the implementation of imperfect vaccination programs has led to a reduction in the genetic diversity of the circulating strains and a change in their virulence. Porvac® subunit vaccine has been shown to provide a rapid onset of protection against the “Margarita” strain. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the immune response induced by Porvac® is also effective against autochthonous isolates of low, medium or high virulence. All pigs vaccinated with Porvac® were protected against the disease after the challenge. PR-11/10–3 isolate caused a very mild disease in controls, whilst Holguin_2009 isolate produced mild to moderate signs of CSF and one of the pigs died. Finally, controls inoculated with PR-2016 isolate developed moderate to severe signs of CSF and two of them died. Viral replication was detected in controls, but not in pigs immunized with Porvac®. Finally, anti-Erns antibodies were induced in five out of six control pigs but in any of the vaccinated pigs. These results support the use of Porvac® for the control and elimination of CSF in Cuba and other endemic regions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db8dd7c75aa1da31637bee140a3153db959edceda7e8eb9b9cd6a4acdf1dadb8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
