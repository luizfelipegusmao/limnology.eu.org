Its swim bladder is rich in collagen but has not yet been exploited scientifically.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Collagen peptides (CPs) prepared from sturgeon swim bladder by trypsinolysis had an average molecular weight of 528.5 Da and consisted of 407 peptides, 16.1% of the content of which was GF<span>P</span>GADGSAGPK. The CPs at 25 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> extended the lifespan of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> by 22.6%, which was significantly higher than the extension achieved by other hydrolysis methods and source materials. They also improved fitness-related traits (body size, motor capacity, oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, and epidermal barrier function), indicating prolonged healthspan. Transcriptome analysis showed that the effect was mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which enhanced stress resistance, the insulin/IGF-1 pathway, which inhibited protein aggregation, and the NHR-80/FAT-6 pathway, which regulated lipid metabolism.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Collagen peptides from sturgeon swim bladder by trypsinolysis prolonged the lifespan and healthspan in <i>C. elegans</i>, and might be promising anti-aging agents. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Lin Wang, \nPeiyu Li, \nFuping Zheng, \nZhiling Zhu, \nFan Bai, \nRuichang Gao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"00517b0ef136023c5b4019b53dd6bcb555fec43e9128fd7eecf8b57742dc56af","category":"Environment"}
