{"title":"Impact of Withdrawal of SGLT2 Inhibitors on Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Heart Failure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0901/v1","date":1713173802000,"content":"Background: The clinical impact of withdrawal of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) on the all-cause readmission in patients with heart failure remains unknown. Methods: Consecutive 212 patients who were hospitalized for heart failure and received SGLT2i during the index hospitalization between February 2016 and July 2022 were evaluated. Of these, 51 patients terminated SGLT2i during or after their index hospitalization. The primary outcome was defined as an all-cause readmission rates/times. Results: Over a median of 23.2 months, an all-cause readmission occurred in 38 of 51 patients (74.5%) withdrawn from SGLT2i and 93 of 161 patients (57.8%) with continuation of SGLT2i (p = 0.099). The total number of all-cause readmissions per year was 0.97 [0-1.50] in patients withdrawn from SGLT2i and 0.50 [0-1.03] in patients with continuation of SGLT2i (p = 0.030). There was no significant difference in total medical cost (62,906 [502-187,246] versus 29,236 [7,920-180,305] JPY per month, p = 0.866) between both patient groups. Conclusions: Termination of SGLT2i may be associated with incremental all-cause readmission and no benefit in reducing total medical costs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0441083657fffd7fba3a740d75e5590e5c9e4fb6042d82157c00061ab03d0d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
