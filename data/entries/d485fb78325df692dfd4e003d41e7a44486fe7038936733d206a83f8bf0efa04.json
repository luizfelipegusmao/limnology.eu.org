{"title":"Design and Implementation of a Methodological Tool for the Application of Energy Poverty Criteria and Indicators in Panama","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0744/v1","date":1710345303000,"content":"Despite achieving over 90% household service coverage, the Latin American and Caribbean region faces energy poverty (EP) challenges, particularly in rural areas. With growing GDP and foreign investments, Panama grapples with significant energy inequality, ranking poorly in clean energy access. Almost 177,000 Panamanians experience energy poverty, impacting their quality of life. This study proposes a Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index for Panama (MEPIP), considering dimensions like lighting, cooking, food refrigeration, thermal comfort, and knowledge/communication. MEPIP, inspired by indicators from Chile, Mexico, and the UK, aims to provide a nuanced understanding of EP. Results from surveyed rural communities, Gu√°simo, Llano Grande Abajo, Los Aguilares, and La Tranquilla, reveal pervasive energy poverty, emphasizing the urgency of targeted interventions. MEPIP's application identifies critical areas, such as Llano Grande Abajo, highlighting stark inequalities and the need for comprehensive energy policies to address EP in Panama.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d485fb78325df692dfd4e003d41e7a44486fe7038936733d206a83f8bf0efa04","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
