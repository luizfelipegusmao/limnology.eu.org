{"title":"A pilot study on bio-banding in male youth ice hockey: Players’ perceptions and coaches’ selection preferences","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308676","date":1723471200000,"content":"<p>by Oliver Lindholm, Erik Niklasson, John Lind, Daniele A. Cardinale, Tommy R. Lundberg</p>\r\n\r\nClassifying athletes based on estimates of biological maturation (i.e., bio-banding) as a supplement to traditional age grouping has been shown to be a potential tool for enriching player development in team sports; however, bio-banding has not yet been evaluated in ice hockey. The primary aim was to investigate player experiences and coaches’ selection preferences in bio-banding versus age-banding in a group of 12-13-year-old (early growth spurt) male elite players (n = 69). We also examined the relationship between somatic maturity, expressed as a % predicted adult height (%PAH), and fitness performance. Bio-banding was assessed using a questionnaire and 29 coaches selected their top players in each game based on age or bio-bands. %PAH correlated with grip strength (r = .57, p&gt;0.001) and jumping power (r = .63, p&lt;0.001), but not with vertical jump height, sprint time or endurance. Players who played against more mature players in bio-bands than in age groups experienced higher demands, while players who played against less mature players were able to utilize their skills to a greater extent. Coaches generally favored later-than-average maturing players who performed better on performance tests and chronologically older players in bio-banding. We conclude that bio-banding in youth ice hockey has some promising effects and warrants further evaluation.","author":"Oliver Lindholm","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4c27134e2faae0cfd335f7a0ddc8da746a69f66e9a04599a7ab5a3970a42c950","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
