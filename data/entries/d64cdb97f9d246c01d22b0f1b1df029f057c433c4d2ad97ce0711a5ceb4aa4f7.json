While several cytotoxic agents have demonstrated efficacy against HGG, drug sensitivity testing platforms to aid in therapy selection are lacking. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have been shown to faithfully preserve the biological characteristics of several cancer types including HGG, and coupled with the experimental-analytical hybrid platform Quadratic Phenotypic Optimization Platform (QPOP) which evaluates therapeutic sensitivity at a patient-specific level, may aid as a tool for personalized medical decisions to improve treatment outcomes for HGG patients.</p> Methods <p>This is an interventional, non-randomized, open-label study, which aims to enroll 10 patients who will receive QPOP-guided chemotherapy at the time of first HGG recurrence following progression on standard first-line therapy. At the initial presentation of HGG, tumor will be harvested for primary PDO generation during the first biopsy/surgery. At the point of tumor recurrence, patients will be enrolled onto the main study to receive systemic therapy as second-line treatment. Subjects who undergo surgery at the time of recurrence will have a second harvest of tissue for PDO generation. Established PDOs will be subject to QPOP analyses to determine their therapeutic sensitivities to specific panels of drugs. A QPOP-guided treatment selection algorithm will then be used to select the most appropriate drug combination. The primary endpoint of the study is six-month progression-free survival. The secondary endpoints include twelve-month overall survival, RANO criteria and toxicities. In our radiological biomarker sub-study, we plan to evaluate novel radiopharmaceutical-based neuroimaging in determining blood-brain barrier permeability and to assess <i>in vivo</i> drug effects on tumor vasculature over time.</p> Trial registration <p>This trial was registered on 8<sup>th</sup> September 2022 with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05532397.</p>","author":"Tan Boon Toh","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d64cdb97f9d246c01d22b0f1b1df029f057c433c4d2ad97ce0711a5ceb4aa4f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
