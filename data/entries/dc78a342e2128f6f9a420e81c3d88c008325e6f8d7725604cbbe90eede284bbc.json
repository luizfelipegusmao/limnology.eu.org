{"title":"Knee Joint Response to Mechanical Loading: Bounding Mechanotransduction with Rehabilitation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0995/v1","date":1726138601000,"content":"The knee joint plays a vital role in human movement, bearing mechanical loads during daily and athletic activities. This review explores the knee joint's response to mechanical loading, particularly focusing on mechanotransduction—the process by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals. These signals trigger cellular responses crucial for maintaining joint health, promoting repair, and adapting to mechanical changes.\nUnderstanding mechanotransduction is key to developing effective rehabilitation strategies for knee injuries and managing conditions like osteoarthritis. This review synthesizes current research on the cellular and molecular pathways involved in knee joint mechanotransduction, examining how various loading conditions—such as compression, tension, and shear—affect tissues like cartilage, synovium, ligaments, and tendons.\nThe review discusses the impact of mechanotransduction on cellular components such as chondrocytes, synoviocytes, and fibroblasts, which are essential for maintaining tissue integrity and function. It also highlights the role of signaling pathways like MAPK, NF-κB, and Wnt in mediating cellular responses to mechanical stimuli, influencing gene expression, protein synthesis, and metabolism.\nBy understanding these mechanisms, clinicians can develop targeted therapeutic interventions, including controlled loading protocols, exercise regimens, and manual therapies. This review underscores the importance of integrating mechanobiology insights into rehabilitation practices to enhance tissue repair, restore function, and prevent further joint degeneration, ultimately improving knee joint health and patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc78a342e2128f6f9a420e81c3d88c008325e6f8d7725604cbbe90eede284bbc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
