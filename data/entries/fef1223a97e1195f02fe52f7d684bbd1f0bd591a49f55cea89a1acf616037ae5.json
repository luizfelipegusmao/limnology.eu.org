{"title":"Effect of Carbonization Temperatures on the Synthesis of Biocarbon from Borassus flabellifer Fruit Fibre for Capacitive Energy Storage","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/appl.202400005?af=R","date":1711785872000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Borassus flabellifer</i> (Palmyra) fruit fibre was extracted and converted into biocarbon materials at different carbonization temperatures of 400, 600, and 800°C under N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 1 h. The physicochemical properties of obtained biocarbon materials were investigated via CHNS, SEM-EDX, FTIR, RAMAN, XRD, BET-specific surface area, and TGA techniques. The obtained results were correlated with the capacitive energy storage application of biocarbon materials. The highest specific surface area of 46.36 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> was observed for the biocarbon materials obtained at 800°C, which also showed superior capacitive performances. The specific capacitances of PFF-derived biocarbon materials obtained at 400, 600, and 800°C are respectively found to be 28.58 F.g<sup>−1</sup>, 37.07 F.g<sup>−1,</sup> and 45.76 F.g<sup>−1</sup> at 1 A.g<sup>−1</sup> employing 1M KOH as electrolyte. The biocarbon materials obtained at 800°C showed the highest specific energy and power of 1.99 Wh.kg<sup>-1</sup> and 261 W.kg<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A.g<sup>-1</sup>.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
