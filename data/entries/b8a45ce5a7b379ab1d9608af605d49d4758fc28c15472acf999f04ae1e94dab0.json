{"title":"From Germ Cells to Implantation: The Role of Extracellular Vesicles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0445/v1","date":1720086530000,"content":"Extracellular vesicles represent a large heterogeneous class of near and long-distance intercellular communication mediators, released by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Specifically, the scientific community has shown a growing interest in exosomes, which are nano-sized vesicles with an endosomal origin. Not so long ago, the physiological goal of exosome generation was largely unknown and required more investigation; at first, it was hypothesized that exosomes are able to remove excess, rejects and unnecessary constituents from cells to preserve cellular homeostasis. However, thanks to recent studies, the central role of exosomes in regulating cellular dialogue has emerged. Exosomes act as vectors on cell-cell signaling by their cargo, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, and influence physiological and pathological processes. The findings on exosomes are widespread in a large spectrum of biomedical applications from diagnosis and prognosis to thera-pies. In this review, we describe exosome biogenesis and the current methods for their isolation and characterization, emphasizing the role of their cargo in female reproductive processes, from gametogenesis to implantation, and the potential involvement in human female disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b8a45ce5a7b379ab1d9608af605d49d4758fc28c15472acf999f04ae1e94dab0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
