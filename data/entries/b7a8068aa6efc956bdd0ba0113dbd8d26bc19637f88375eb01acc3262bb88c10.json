{"title":"Drivers of continuous colour variation in the Madeiran wall lizard (Teira dugesii)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/biolinnean/blae089/7824635?rss=1","date":1729123200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Animal coloration is often shaped by a myriad of factors that lead to differences in colour through changes in the chromatophores. Depending on how this variation is partitioned, coloration is often categorized as continuous or polymorphic. However, the boundaries between these two categories are not always clear. Here, we investigated whether the ventral coloration of the Madeiran wall lizard (<span>Teira dugesii</span>) varies continuously or corresponds to discrete colour morphs, via by-eye colour classification and visual modelling. By combining these two approaches, we show that <span>T. dugesii</span> coloration varies continuously and that colour classifications based on anthropomorphic approaches alone are ill suited to describe animal coloration. We also tested the influence of size, body condition, and sex as possible factors that might explain differences in <span>T. dugesii</span> coloration. We found that body condition, and especially size and sex, explain a great proportion of the variability observed in this species. These differences point to an effect of ontogeny, which might play a major role in colour development owing to the longevity of this species. Moreover, the sexual dichromatism that this species shows is indicative of an effect of sexual selection on coloration, perhaps explained by differences in circulating hormones.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"b7a8068aa6efc956bdd0ba0113dbd8d26bc19637f88375eb01acc3262bb88c10","category":"Environment"}
