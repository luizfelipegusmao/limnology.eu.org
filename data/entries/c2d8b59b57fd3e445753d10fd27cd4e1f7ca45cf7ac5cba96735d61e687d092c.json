{"title":"Benefits and barriers to the adoption of climate‐smart agriculture practices in West Africa: A systematic review","link":"https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cli2.79?af=R","date":1720076400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) serves as a credible mechanism to simultaneously address food security, climate change, and agricultural productivity. Despite the widespread adoption of CSA approaches across West Africa, many countries have still not been able to resolve the problems of food insecurity and rural poverty. This systematic review evaluates published evidence on the types of CSA practices, the determinants and benefits of adoption, and the barriers confronting the adoption of CSA practices across West Africa, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement checklist. Articles published in English from January 2010 to March 2023 investigating the benefits of and barriers to the adoption of CSA practices in West Africa were retrieved from ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools for use in systematic reviews. The themes emerging from the articles were extracted, and a summary was provided to illustrate each theme. After applying the eligibility criteria, 12 articles were included in the final review. The studies reviewed revealed that farmers used more knowledge-, water-, carbon-, and nitrogen-smart practices, compared to weather- and energy-smart practices. Across the reviewed papers, factors such as the education level of farmers, age, gender, household size, membership of a social group, agricultural extension services, and access to credit/financial resources influenced CSA adoption. The reviewed studies identified that farmers who used CSA practices reported benefits such as improved soil fertility, higher yield, improved household income, climate resilience (such as overcoming the effects of drought and extreme temperatures), and food security. Some farmers adopted CSA practices to reduce the effect of droughts and high temperatures on their crops, and thus increase their resilience to climate variability and change. However, farmers’ adoption is confronted with challenges related to the technicality of some CSA practices, high cost of labor for CSA implementation, lack of credit and government support, limited access to weather and climate information, limited information about CSA options, high illiteracy level of smallholder farmers, and incompatibility of some practices with farmers’ crop of interest. Our findings show that most CSA practices in the studies we reviewed are not well targeted to meet farmers’ crop of interest, and that governments should provide more practical training to enhance farmers’ understanding of CSA practices, especially those related to weather- and energy-smart initiatives. There should also be more robust financial and institutional support to improve the adoption and usage of CSA practices at all levels. Additionally, socio-cultural factors such as values, customs, and beliefs should be properly integrated into CSA plans as they influence the adoption of CSA practices.</p>","author":"Thomas Peprah Agyekum, \nPhilip Antwi‐Agyei, \nAndrew J.
