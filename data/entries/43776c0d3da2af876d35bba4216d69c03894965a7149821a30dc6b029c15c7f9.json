{"title":"Impacts of vegetable processing and cheese making effluent on soil microbial functional diversity, community structure, and denitrification potential of land treatment systems","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wer.11036?af=R","date":1715654680000,"content":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8dce4df2-bb16-46fb-9fc2-e4eaf16f6cd2/wer11036-toc-0001-m.png\" alt=\"Impacts of vegetable processing and cheese making effluent on soil microbial functional diversity, community structure, and denitrification potential of land treatment systems\" />\n<p>In this first known soil microbial analysis of cheese making and vegetable processing wastewater land application systems, we provide an analysis of the soil phospholipid fatty acids, respiration, and microbiome of these systems and how these factors might influence system denitrification. Despite years-long application of high-nitrogen wastewater, these systems retain soil microbial characteristics common to other denitrifying soil environments.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The cheese making and vegetable processing industries generate immense volumes of high-nitrogen wastewater that is often treated at rural facilities using land applications. Laboratory incubation results showed denitrification decreased with temperature in industry facility soils but remained high in soils from agricultural sites (75% at 2.1Â°C). 16S rRNA, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), and soil respiration analyses were conducted to investigate potential soil microbiome impacts. Biotic and abiotic system factor correlations showed no clear patterns explaining the divergent denitrification rates. In all three soil types at the phylum level, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria dominated, whereas at the class level, Nitrososphaeria and Alphaproteobacteria dominated, similar to denitrifying systems such as wetlands, wastewater resource recovery facilities, and wastewater-irrigated agricultural systems. Results show that potential denitrification drivers vary but lay the foundation to develop a better understanding of the key factors regulating denitrification in land application systems and protect local groundwater supplies.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nIncubation study denitrification rates decreased as temperatures decreased, potentially leading to groundwater contamination issues during colder months.\nThe three most dominant phyla for all systems are Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria.\nThe dominant class for all systems is Nitrosphaeria (phyla Crenarchaeota).\nNo correlation patterns between denitrification rates and system biotic and abiotic factors were observed that explained system efficiency differences.\n</p>","author":"Geoffrey S.
