{"title":"Trends in Physiotherapy of Chronic Low Back Pain Research: Knowledge Synthesis Based on Bibliometric Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1372/v1","date":1718835800000,"content":"Background: Physiotherapy and chronic low back pain (CLBP) form a broad and fast developing research area. The aim of the article was to holistically, thematically and chronologically analyze and synthesise literature production and identify most prolific research entities and research themes. Methods: The article quantitatively and quantitatively analyzed research literature production harvested from the Scopus bibliometric database. using a triangulation of bibliometric and thematic analysis. For this, Excell and VOSwiever software were used. Results: In the Scopus database, 2843 data sources were found, which were published between 1974 and February 26, 2024. The growth trend has been linearly positive since the beginning of publication, and after 2018, exponential growth began. A review of the most prolific entities showed that the most literature was published in America, Europe and Australasia. The thematic analysis of the information sources identified six main themes, while the chronological analysis revealed three main areas of developments: assessment tools, CLBP processing and study methodology. Conclusions: The results of the bibliometric study presents a good starting point for further research providing Taxonomy and research landscapes as a holistic framework offering multidisciplinary knowledge about CLBP, while chronological analysis provides a basis for identifying prospective research trends.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"afc8bce8fbe2a9ce6902deb922ea55765b787d6f842607e4c8dcde96b807ddf7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
