{"title":"Implementing Distributed System using Auto Promote and Web Services","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1995/v1","date":1720772524000,"content":"While advances in information and communication technology have increased the efficiency of information distribution, it has also brought several challenges to the database industry. One of the main challenges is ensuring the real-time availability of data, which is critical. In addition, downtime in centralized database systems can cause significant failures. Therefore this research applies database replication, especially the multi-master method, is used to increase availability and reduce the possibility of failure. For distributed transaction distribution, this research uses the auto-promote master method and web services for PostgreSQL database replication. The focus of the research is on real-world college site selection transactions, where speed, scalability, and high data availability are critical. The results show that combining these methods can improve system performance and protect data availability. With fast response time, high throughput, and low error rate, the API performs well with various loads. As a testament to scalability and reliability, the system can handle large volumes of traffic without experiencing significant crashes. For containerization, Docker supports efficient and stable performance and ensures consistency and manageability. Future recommendations include improving the data security mechanism and further efforts to optimize the distribution system architecture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2462bb0322ca77c1cf7b2dba3520ebbdcfdedf8a4a64db6b983527f16270683c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
