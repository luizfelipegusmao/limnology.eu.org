{"title":"The Current State and Future of the Road Transport Based Cold Chain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1052/v1","date":1715775034000,"content":"Cold chains are essential in providing us humans with food and medicine across the globe. However, cold transportation, like all transportation, has massive negative impacts on the environment and human well-being, which especially culminate in cities. Thus, it is important to research the ways to reduce these impacts and reinvent urban logistics infrastructure. In this article, we articulate the massive problems the road-based transportation sector imposes on the environment and on the health of humans, especially in cities. We present algorithms that show promise in optimizing the whole road transportation sector as well as some innovations and alternative ways to model cities and the whole urban transportation infrastructure. We approach the issues discussed specifically from the point of view of refrigerated transportation, but many of the solutions can be applied to all the transportation sector in general.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"268da803f42993688c8b21db925955d058f0a12b21c75850c06d1df5d2f9e52c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
