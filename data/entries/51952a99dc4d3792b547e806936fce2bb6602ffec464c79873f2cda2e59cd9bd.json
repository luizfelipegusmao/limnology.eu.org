{"title":"Brace compliance process in adolescents with spinal deformities: A qualitative study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305754","date":1722607200000,"content":"<p>by Faezeh Ghorbani, Mohammad Kamali, Hadi Ranjbar, Mojtaba Kamyab, Hiva Razavi, Taher Babaee</p>\r\nBackground <p>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis affects 2–4% of adolescents aged 10–16, while Scheuermann’s kyphosis affects 0.4–10% of adolescents aged 11 to 16. Over the past 50 years, brace treatment has been recommended as the most common non-surgical intervention for treating these spinal deformities. The effectiveness of brace treatment depends on the duration of brace wearing. This study aimed to understand the brace compliance process for adolescents with spinal deformities through a qualitative approach.</p> Method <p>This study applied multicenter exploratory qualitative research with an interpretative framework and enlisted the participation of as many individuals as possible involved in brace-wearing in adolescents with spinal deformities. Semi-structured, in-depth, and face-to-face interviews and telephone conversations from September 2020 to May 2021 were conducted. The recorded audio of each interview was typed into Word software with each personal code. The content analysis method was used to analyze the data.</p> Results <p>Seventy-four participants were interviewed, including 32 adolescents treated with braces and their parents (27 mothers, five fathers), six orthotists, two physiotherapists, and two spine surgeons. Following data analysis, four main categories, 14 categories, and 69 subcategories of 2403 related codes were discovered.</p> Conclusion <p>Based on the analysis of the current qualitative research, adolescents with spinal deformities experience extensive challenges in the treatment process, which can affect the results and brace intervention efficacy. The current research findings showed that every adolescent goes through similar but unique conditions during the treatment. The importance of considering each adolescent’s specific conditions and characteristics and providing functional solutions and support was understood to help them navigate critical situations more quickly and achieve effective treatment outcomes.</p>","author":"Faezeh Ghorbani","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"51952a99dc4d3792b547e806936fce2bb6602ffec464c79873f2cda2e59cd9bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
