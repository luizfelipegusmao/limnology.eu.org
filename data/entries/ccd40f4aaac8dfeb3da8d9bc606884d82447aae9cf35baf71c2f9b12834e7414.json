{"title":"How Can Religious Fractionalization and Polarization Inform Us at the County Level in Post-Communist Romania?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0849/v1","date":1710408895000,"content":"This study explores religious diversity in Romania and how the trends of indices of religious fractionalization and polarization manifest at the county level in the post-communist period. The county is selected as the relevant level for analysis due to its spatial confessional dynamics being more clearly visible. Recent studies have revealed that erosion of diversity represents an important aspect for any country and needs to be considered as an important aspect of democracy. This paper highlights that religious polarization and fractionalization in Romania has been generally maintained, although the regions of Transylvania, Banat, Dobrogea and Western Moldova remain areas where there are different confessions. Besides the general aspect of religion diversity depending the ethnic trends, there is a rise of Pentecostals and Baptists at the county level. This aspect can inform policymakers to create new institutions for dialogue between majority Orthodox communities and Protestants so that potential conflicts do not appear between the Orthodox and emerging religious communities, but also to ensure objective, cultural, religious coherence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ccd40f4aaac8dfeb3da8d9bc606884d82447aae9cf35baf71c2f9b12834e7414","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
