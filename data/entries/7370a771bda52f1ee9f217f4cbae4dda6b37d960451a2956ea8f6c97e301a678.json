{"title":"Molecular detection of herpesvirus in a skin lesion of a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) from the Western Mediterranean Sea","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10344-024-01782-7","date":1709942400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Herpesvirus has the potential to infect a wide variety of animal species. In cetaceans, <em>Alpha</em>- and/or <em>Gammaherpesvirinae</em> have been identified in eight families of odontocetes, and one family of mysticetes. In May 2022, an adult humpback whale (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>) was found stranded in Valencia, Spain. The whale was emaciated, in poor body condition, with multiple lacerations on the dorsal fin and a high number of epibionts of the Cyamidae family, known as whale lice. The individual had been previously released from a ghost net entanglement 5 days before becoming stranded. In a closer examination, various skin lesions were observed, including chronic, proliferative, and erosive dermatitis and a large ulcer extending to the deep dermis. As part of the infectious disease surveillance programme, molecular testing was performed on skin samples for herpesvirus, cetacean morbillivirus, and poxvirus. A positive result for herpesvirus was obtained from one of the skin lesions. The sequence was found to belong to the <em>Alphaherpesvirinae</em> subfamily, and it was closely related to alphaherpesvirus sequences from a fin whale (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>) and a humpback whale. Cetacean morbillivirus and poxvirus testing was negative. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of herpesvirus in a humpback whale from the Mediterranean Sea. Reports on herpesvirus detection or infection in humpback whales (only species within the genus <em>Megaptera</em>) are scarce. In consequence, future virological assessments of humpback whales should include testing for herpesvirus.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"7370a771bda52f1ee9f217f4cbae4dda6b37d960451a2956ea8f6c97e301a678","category":"Environment"}
