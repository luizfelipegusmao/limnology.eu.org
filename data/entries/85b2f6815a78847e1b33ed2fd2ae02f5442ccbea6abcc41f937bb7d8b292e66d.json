{"title":"Development of an Immersive Virtual Reality System during Robot Assisted Gait Training for Individuals with Neurological Diseases: Feasibility and Proof of Concept Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2139/v1","date":1724919582000,"content":"Immersive virtual reality has the potential to motivate and challenge patients that need and want to relearn movements in the process of (neuro-)rehabilitation. The aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility and usersâ€™ acceptance of an innovative immersive virtual reality system (head-mounted display) used in combination with robot assisted gait training in subjects suffering from neurological diseases. Fifteen participants tested a single session of immersive virtual reality by means of head-mounted display during a Lokomat gait session. Training parameters and safety indicators were collected and the acceptance was investigated among the participants and the therapists. The results suggest that the immersive virtual reality system is feasible with respect to safety and tolerance. Furthermore, the very positive overall acceptance of the system suggests that it has potential to be included in a robot assisted gait training session by means of Lokomat. Taken together, this study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptance of an innovative immersive virtual reality system in combination with a robot assisted gait training in subjects suffering from stroke and spinal cord injury, as well as their therapists.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"85b2f6815a78847e1b33ed2fd2ae02f5442ccbea6abcc41f937bb7d8b292e66d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
