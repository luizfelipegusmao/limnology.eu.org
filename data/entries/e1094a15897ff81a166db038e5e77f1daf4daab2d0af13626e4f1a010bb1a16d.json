{"title":"Architectural Experimentations. New Meanings for Ancient Ruins","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0556/v1","date":1718020841000,"content":"From the critical premises that underpin the debate between archeology and architecture, evi-dence emerges, namely that the musealization of building or urban remains of the past is even more harmful, for the purposes of its real understanding, than that of any other artefact. In a country, Italy, that has archeological presences more than any other, architecture must contribute to overcoming the consolidated aporia that the Contemporary, understood not only as a period but also and above all as its “forms and functions”, it’s structurally in opposition to the conser-vation of the archeological heritage. What is presented is an attempted exercise for “inhabiting archaeology”, that is, trying to re-grant inclusive usability to a historical fragment, which has lost the elements necessary for its habitability. The set of questions, doubts and steps have been high-lighted more than the final “figure” of the project: an essential form directly connected with the primordial principles of its constitution, for a project that protects and encourages to visit the complex, trying to offer new perspectives, new narratives and new connections that translate into the possibility of being – for those who visit this place – the protagonists of a unique experience made of history, memory and continuous discoveries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e1094a15897ff81a166db038e5e77f1daf4daab2d0af13626e4f1a010bb1a16d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
