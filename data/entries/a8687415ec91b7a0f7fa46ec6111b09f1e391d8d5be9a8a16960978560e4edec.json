The World Health Organization and American Psychiatric Association Organization recognizes gaming disorder as a disorder that results in significant problems in daily life as a result of excessive gaming. Both organizations emphasize the similarities to behavioral addictions such as gambling. We examined the appropriate usage of video games from the perspectives of health and management in this study.
