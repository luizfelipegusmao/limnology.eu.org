{"title":"A Review of the Recent Advances in Heat Transfer Through Ducting in the Rotational Moulding Process and The Future Trends","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1717/v1","date":1729588986000,"content":"A common technique for producing large-scale hollow plastic items is rotomoulding. Rotation speed, mould design, and temperature management significantly affect the quality of finished products. The growing demand may cause the rotomoulding industry to reach a peak soon. Few studies have been applied in the industrial sector. Meanwhile, the lack of sufficient research on the phase transition from the heat source for the rotomoulding procedure led to a great research gap in this field. Although, their conclusions contribute significantly to the topic but cannot be considered accurate in the analysis. Proper temperature variations in both the heating and cooling phases impact the final product quality. Moreover, if the required temperature is not achieved it may result in raw material ( HDPE, LLDPE) loss. To produce the necessary amount of hot air by convection, this review article focuses on the use of ducts as the medium for hot air circulation to the mould, ducting model analysis, and mould model adjustments. Additionally, insulation has been discussed concerning sustainable heat, which could help the industry to better comprehend the procedure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45889db2092177c27334baa134c532738a0c95fc2120c511cf213c575751833f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
