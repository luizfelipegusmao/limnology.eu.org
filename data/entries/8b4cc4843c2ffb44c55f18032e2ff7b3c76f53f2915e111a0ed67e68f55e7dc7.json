{"title":"Mortality of Boreal Trees","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0922/v1","date":1713169182000,"content":"A dataset collected from Central-South Finland is used to investigate the mortality of boreal trees. The mortality rate is found to be the order of three times that predicted by earlier Nordic mortality models, being in the upper range of international literature observations. Small subpopulations of any tree species tend to die out. Mortality of downy birch increases with stand basal area, as well as with stand age. Mortality of Norway spruce and silver birch increases after 100 years, while that of Scots pine is invariant to age. As the relative loss rate of basal area is insensitive to stand basal area, the mortality of trees does not strongly regulate thinning practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b4cc4843c2ffb44c55f18032e2ff7b3c76f53f2915e111a0ed67e68f55e7dc7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
