{"title":"Prognostic Impact of Statins in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1093/v1","date":1723647668000,"content":"Background: Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (pEF) has lacked effective treatments for reducing mortality. However, previous studies have found an association between statin use and decreased mortality in patients with HFpEF.  The aim of this study was to analyze whether statin therapy is associated with a reduction in mortality in these patients and whether the effect differs according to presence or absence of ischemic heart disease (IHD). Methods: We analyzed data from the National Registry of Heart Failure, a prospective study including patients admitted for HF in Internal Medicine units nationwide. Patients with HFpEF were classified according to the use of statins and differences between two groups were analyzed. A multivariate analysis was performed using Cox regression to assess factors independently related to mortality. Results: 2788 patients with HFpEF were included, 63% of them were women with a mean age of 80.1(Â±7.8) years. The statin-treated group (40.2%) was younger, with better functional status, and had a more common diagnosis of vascular disease and lower frequency of atrial fibrillation. The most frequent etiology of HF in both groups was the hypertensive one. Nevertheless, ischemic HF was more common in those who received statins (24.8% vs. 9.6%; p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7cc89b712a462289725da18b5c3432a869e62b8c606296b12849c7a9d1356f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
