{"title":"Prognostic Properties of Instantaneous Amplitudes Maxima of Earth Surface Tremor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2163/v1","date":1721987580000,"content":"A method is proposed for analyzing the tremor of the earth's surface, measured by GPS, in order to highlight prognostic effects. The method is applied to analysis of daily time series of vertical displacements in Japan. The network of 1047 stations is divided into 15 clusters. The Huang Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is applied to the time series of principal components from clusters with subsequent calculation of instantaneous amplitudes using the Hilbert transform. To ensure the stability of estimates of the waveforms of the EMD decomposition, 1000 independent additive realizations of white noise of limited amplitude were averaged before the Hilbert transform. Using a parametric model of the intensities of point processes, we analyze the connections between the instants of sequences of times of the largest local maxima of instantaneous amplitudes averaged over the number of clusters and the times of earthquakes in the vicinity of the Japan with minimum magnitude thresholds of 5.5 for the time interval 2012-2023. It is shown that part of the intensity of the sequence of times of seismic events, due to the influence of the times of the most expressive local extrema of instantaneous amplitudes, significantly exceeds the reverse influence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa8209a603195d860911729e6a5d234272e3c879a9652651dbaa9297273fa789","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
