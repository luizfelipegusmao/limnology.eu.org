{"title":"Odorant receptors for floral- and plant-derived volatiles in the yellow fever mosquito, <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302496","date":1715004000000,"content":"<p>by Heidi Pullmann-Lindsley, Robert Mark Huff, John Boyi, Ronald Jason Pitts</p>\r\n\r\nAdult mosquitoes require regular sugar meals, including nectar, to survive in natural habitats. Both males and females locate potential sugar sources using sensory proteins called odorant receptors (ORs) activated by plant volatiles to orient toward flowers or honeydew. The yellow fever mosquito, <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Linnaeus, 1762), possesses a large gene family of ORs, many of which are likely to detect floral odors. In this study, we have uncovered ligand-receptor pairings for a suite of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> ORs using a panel of environmentally relevant, plant-derived volatile chemicals and a heterologous expression system. Our results support the hypothesis that these odors mediate sensory responses to floral odors in the mosquitoâ€™s central nervous system, thereby influencing appetitive or aversive behaviors. Further, these ORs are well conserved in other mosquitoes, suggesting they function similarly in diverse species. This information can be used to assess mosquito foraging behavior and develop novel control strategies, especially those that incorporate mosquito bait-and-kill technologies.","author":"Heidi Pullmann-Lindsley","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"188bee01bd6a28c61e772fe690f1aeac4711d2bcb8673b7e49cc8d226f38cd03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
