{"title":"Further Evidence of the Role of myomiRs miR-133a, -133b and -206 Dysregulation in Cardiovascular Disease Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1614/v1","date":1726824104000,"content":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major global health concern. The number of people with CVD is expected to rise due to aging populations and increasing risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. Identifying new molecular markers is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment. Among these, plasma levels of some miRNAs specifically expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle known as myomiRs, has gained attention for their roles in cardiovascular health. This study analyzed the plasma levels of myomiR-133a, -133b, and -206 in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Exploiting of a case-control study design with patients recruited from several nursing homes form Calabria (Southern Italy) characterized by different types of CVD compared to non-CVD controls, we found downregulation of miR-133a in heart failure and miR-133b in stroke, along with the overall decreased expression of miR-133b and miR-206 in CVD patients. In silico functional characterization of their targets and signaling pathways revealed their involvement in critical cardiovascular processes. Although further research is necessary to fully elucidate their mechanisms and clinical utility, the results here reported support the idea that myomiRs could serve not only as biomarkers but also as therapeutic targets, offering new avenues for managing and potentially preventing CVD progression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0543930a6364c90debe4c98598391bba667483feebbb5c91a44a1c78404a6168","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
