{"title":"Design and Synthesis of Pyridyl and 2-Hydroxyphenyl Chalcones with Antitubercular Activity.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0139/v1","date":1719872301000,"content":"A focussed library of pyridyl and 2-hydroxyphenyl chalcones were synthesized and tested for growth inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, and normal and cancer breast cell lines. Pyridyl chalcones bearing lipophilic A-ring, e.g., dichloro-phenyl- (14), pyrene-1-yl (20)- and biphenyl-4-yl (21) moieties, were found to be the most potent of the series inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis H37Rv with IC90 values ranging from 8.9 – 28 µM. Aryl chalcones containing a 3-methoxyphenyl A-ring and either p-Br-phenyl (25) or p-Cl- phenyl (26) B-rings showed an IC90 value of 28 μM. Aryl-chalcones were generally less toxic to HepG2 cells compared to pyridyl-chalcones. Dose-dependent antiproliferative activity against MDA468 cells was observed for trimethoxy-phenyl (16) and anthracene-9-yl (19) pyridyl-chalcones with IC50 values of 0.7 and 0.3 µM, respectively. Docking studies revealed that chalone 20 was predicted to bind to the M. tuberculosis protein tyrosine phosphatases B (PtpB) with higher affinity compared to a previously reported PtpB inhibitor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33a13e885e78677b1daca1cc6998928b54d937ca09541f10a22c216810acdea3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
