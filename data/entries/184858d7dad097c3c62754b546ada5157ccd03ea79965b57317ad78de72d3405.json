{"title":"Simulation and Registration Assisted Planar Structure Reconstruction with Adaptive Apex Shapes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.042/7719491?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Algorithms have been used for enforcing planarity of features in the reconstruction of Atom Probe Tomography (APT) data. However, many of these have been developed in the context of a spherical apex assumption where a simple analytical projection law is used in the reconstructions. [<a href=\"#ozae044.042-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.042-B2\">2</a>] A practical result of that limitation is that planar landmark registrations can flatten interfaces in the reconstruction but generally don’t correctly account for local magnification effects. More recently we showed initial results on using the constraints of planarity of a layer’s midplane to automatically create a sequence of non-spherical shapes to be used in electrostatic reconstructions. [<a href=\"#ozae044.042-B3\">3</a>] These reconstructions compute electrostatics around the variable apex shapes and can more accurately place ions since they account for local magnification. We will discuss recent developments in this area.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"184858d7dad097c3c62754b546ada5157ccd03ea79965b57317ad78de72d3405","category":"Environment"}
