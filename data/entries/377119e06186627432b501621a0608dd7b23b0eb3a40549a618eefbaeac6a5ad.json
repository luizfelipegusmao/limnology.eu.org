{"title":"Ovarian Rejuvenation and Transvaginal Hydro Laparoscopy: An Added Value for Patients with Premature Ovarian Failure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0635/v1","date":1723181291000,"content":"The term ovarian rejuvenation is used for treatments aiming to reactivate ovarian function in women suffering from premature ovarian insufficiency or women with poor ovarian response following ovarian stimulation treatments. Following Bologna criteria, patients with poor ovarian response (POR) are those patients with at least one previous stimulated cycle with POR, are of advanced maternal age, and have an abnormal ovarian reserve. Patients with at least 3 failed IVF cycles due to poor ovarian response (POR) and patients with POF with amenorrhea for at least 6 months, low estradiol, and high concentrations of LH and FSH were referred for ovarian PRP treatment. Out of 190 procedures, 15 were performed using the THL as there was an inaccurate visibility by vaginal ultrasound. Under direct visualization, PRP was injected in each ovary using a 19G needle. In the 53 patients referred for IVF, an embryo transfer was possible in 40% of the started cycles (n=21); the pregnancy rate per transfer was 52% with a live birth rate of 24%. The access to the pelvis by the THL enabled a direct visualization of both ovaries allowing a correct injection. Due to maternal age, patients should be informed of the elevated risks of 40% - 50% of biochemical pregnancies or miscarriages.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"377119e06186627432b501621a0608dd7b23b0eb3a40549a618eefbaeac6a5ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
