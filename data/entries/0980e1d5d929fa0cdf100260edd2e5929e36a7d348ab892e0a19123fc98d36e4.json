A Case of Industrial Site Community, Victoria Falls","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0403/v1","date":1728438566000,"content":"The WHO is so passionate about good health for all meanwhile the emerging counselling discipline is a complimentary arm whose interest is to fully complement those efforts through helping humankind in issues that may be affecting the health and the overall well-being. The researcher has discovered through studies and general knowledge that men tend to delay in seeking health help compared to women. Men appear to be reluctant in seeking professional assistance in problems pertaining to their health, marriages, work place, infertility, sexual dysfunction and other social life ills subsequently leading to depression, suicides, excessive uptake of alcohol, violence, mental psychosis and physical disabilities or premature death. Studies have shown that men are socially constructed to be strong from a tender age and they grow into adulthood believing that they are strong both physical and emotional hence they are supposed to withstand any situation affecting them. Masking and faking have been regarded as sign of being a real man, however these social constructs, perceptions and expectations appear to be the root cause of problems manifesting daily in men’s behavior towards seeking health help. This study therefore endeavors to find out more about the factors or determinants influencing men’s reluctance to seeking help in areas concerning their health in Industrial site of Victoria Falls. The study serves as additional educational awareness guide for the significant other, while issues unraveled help in gender mainstreaming programs for gender equality when it comes to societal hegemonizing of men’s health. Moreover, the exploration of influencing factors or determinants, causes and effects of men’s reluctance in seeking health help were scrutinized as well as possible solutions. There has been much realization of more various literature on women’s issues than men because women in general have been known to open up and talk through their issues unlike men hence the aim is to focus on men in order to understand the attitude and perceptions underlying the reluctance to seek medical care regularly and promptly. When communities get to understand that men too, feel the pain both emotionally and physically, may be then, men would not fear stigmatization but come out to seek health help promptly and communities would realize that some cultural expectations placed on men result in more harm than good.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0980e1d5d929fa0cdf100260edd2e5929e36a7d348ab892e0a19123fc98d36e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
