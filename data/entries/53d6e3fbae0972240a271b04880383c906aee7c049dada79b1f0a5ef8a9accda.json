{"title":"Delayed sowing and its ramifications: biophysical, yield and quality analysis of wheat cultivars in the northwest Indo‐Gangetic plains","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13512?af=R","date":1720851246000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The continuous cultivation of rice–wheat in the same field is a key element of double-cropping systems in the Indo-Gangetic plains. Yields of such cropping systems are increasingly challenged as climate change drives increases in temperature, terminal stress and uneven rainfall, delaying rice harvesting and subsequently delaying sowing of wheat. In this paper, we evaluate the optimum sowing dates to achieve high grain yield and quality of wheat cultivars in northwest India. Three cultivars of wheat, HD-2967, HD-3086 and PBW-723, were sown on three different dates at the research farm of ICAR-IARI, New Delhi, to generate different weather conditions at different phenological stages. Different biophysical attributes, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, were measured at different phenological stages. Yield and grain quality parameters such as protein, starch, amylopectin, amylose and gluten were measured in different cultivars sown on different dates.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Biophysical parameters were found to be higher in timely sown crops followed by late-sown and very late-sown crops. Further, the different sowing dates had a significant (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) impact on the grain quality parameters such as protein, starch, amylopectin, amylose and gluten content. Percentage increases in the value of starch and amylose content under timely sown were ~7% and 11.6%, ~5% and 8.4%, compared to the very late-sown treatment. In contrast, protein and amylopectin contents were found to increase by ~9.7% and 7.5%, ~13.8% and 16.6% under very late-sown treatment.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>High-temperature stress during the grain-filling periods significantly decreased the grain yield. Reduction in the grain yield was associated with a reduction in starch and amylose content in the grains. The protein content in the grains is less affected by terminal heat stress. Cultivar HD-3086 had higher growth, yield as well as quality parameters, compared to HD-2967 and PBW-723 in all treatments, hence could be adopted by farmers in northwest India. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Debasish Roy, \nAnanta Vashisth, \nPrameela Krishnan, \nJoydeep Mukherjee, \nMahesh Chand Meena, \nNiraj Biswakarma, \nPooja Rathore, \nKoushik Bag, \nSweta Kumari","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"53d6e3fbae0972240a271b04880383c906aee7c049dada79b1f0a5ef8a9accda","category":"Environment"}
