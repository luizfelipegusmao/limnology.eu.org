{"title":"Phylogenetic In Silico Analysis Indicates that the Moonlighting 14-3-3 Protein of Ajellomycetaceae Family and Homo sapiens Share Conserved and Distinct Features in Their Peptide Binding Site","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2323/v1","date":1727675232000,"content":"The 14-3-3 protein in dimorphic fungi from the Ajellomycetaceae family, including Blastomyces spp., Histoplasma spp., Paracoccidioides spp., Emergomyces spp., and Emmonsia spp., play a crucial role in host-pathogen interactions. Thus, we performed a comparative genomic analysis across 21 fungal species which revealed the presence of two 14-3-3 gene copies in most fungi, with exceptions in Histoplasma ohiense and Emergomyces africanus which revealed one and three gene copies, respectively. Moreover, in this study it was found a high degree of similarity (over 70%) between fungal 14-3-3 proteins and the human 14-3-3É› isoform, particularly in conserved Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites. However, distinct differences were noted in the C- and N-terminal regions, where fungal 14-3-3 proteins have additional amino acids. Though not directly linked to pathogenicity, these structural differences may offer insights into new therapeutic strategies. The conserved regions and 3D similarities identified could serve as potential targets for broad-spectrum antifungal drug development and vaccine production. Further research is necessary to validate these in silico findings and explore the functional roles of these phosphorylation sites, which could contribute to understanding fungal pathogenicity and developing specific antifungal interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"429e23698131eb406a4f944b6727e51abafcb11d126b8e4780d7eb3e7a55a5bc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
