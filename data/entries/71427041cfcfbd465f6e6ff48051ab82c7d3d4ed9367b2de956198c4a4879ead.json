{"title":"A secreted bacterial protein protects bacteria from cationic antimicrobial peptides by entrapment in phase-separated droplets","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae139/7639141?rss=1","date":1712016000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Mammalian hosts combat bacterial infections through the production of defensive cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs). These immune factors are capable of directly killing bacterial invaders; however, many pathogens have evolved resistance evasion mechanisms such as cell surface modification, CAP sequestration, degradation, or efflux. We have discovered that several pathogenic and commensal proteobacteria, including the urgent human threat <span>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span>, secrete a protein (lactoferrin-binding protein B, LbpB) that contains a low-complexity anionic domain capable of inhibiting the antimicrobial activity of host CAPs. This study focuses on a cattle pathogen, <span>Moraxella bovis</span>, that expresses the largest anionic domain of the LbpB homologs. We used an exhaustive biophysical approach employing circular dichroism, biolayer interferometry, cross-linking mass spectrometry, microscopy, size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering coupled to small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC–MALS-SAXS), and NMR to understand the mechanisms of LbpB-mediated protection against CAPs. We found that the anionic domain of this LbpB displays an α-helical secondary structure but lacks a rigid tertiary fold. The addition of antimicrobial peptides derived from lactoferrin (i.e. lactoferricin) to the anionic domain of LbpB or full-length LbpB results in the formation of phase-separated droplets of LbpB together with the antimicrobial peptides. The droplets displayed a low rate of diffusion, suggesting that CAPs become trapped inside and are no longer able to kill bacteria. Our data suggest that pathogens, like <span>M. bovis</span>, leverage anionic intrinsically disordered domains for the broad recognition and neutralization of antimicrobials via the formation of biomolecular condensates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"71427041cfcfbd465f6e6ff48051ab82c7d3d4ed9367b2de956198c4a4879ead","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
