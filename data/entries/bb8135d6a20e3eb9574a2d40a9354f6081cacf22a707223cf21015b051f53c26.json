{"title":"The Variation of G and Λ in Cosmology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1482/v1","date":1729243620000,"content":"The idea of varying constants of nature is very old, and has commanded a lot of attention 1 since first mooted. The variation of the gravitational parameter G and cosmological parameter Λ is still an active area of research. Since the idea of a varying G was introduced by Dirac almost a century ago, there are even theories that have variable G such as Brans-Dicke theory and the scale covariant theory. Both these theories also have a varying Λ in their full generalisations. A varying Λ was also introduced around the same time as that of varying G. It is interesting to note that a possible solution to the cosmological constant problem can be realised from a dynamic Λ. In this work, we focus on a varying Λ and G framework. In almost all studies in the simplest framework of variable Λ and G, it is found that one of them has to increase with time. However, observations and theoretical considerations indicate that both Λ and G should decrease with time. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem, finding theories in which both Λ and G decrease with time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb8135d6a20e3eb9574a2d40a9354f6081cacf22a707223cf21015b051f53c26","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
