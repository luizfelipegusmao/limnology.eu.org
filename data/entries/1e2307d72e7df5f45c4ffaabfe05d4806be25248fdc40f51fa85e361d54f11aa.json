{"title":"CWT-AM-CNN: A Lightweight Feature Extraction Network with Attention Mechanism Based on CWT Peak Seeking Method for Aero-Engine Hot Jet FT-IR Classification","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1279/v1","date":1718880680000,"content":"Focusing on the problem of identifying and classifying aero-engine models, this paper measures the infrared spectrum data of aero-engine hot jets using a telemetry Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Simultaneously, infrared spectral data sets with the six different types of aero-engines are created. For the purpose of classifying and identifying infrared spectral data, a CNN architecture based on the continuous wavelet transform peak seeking attention mechanism (CWT-AM-CNN) is suggested. This method calculates the peak value of middle wave band by continuous wavelet transform, and the peak data is extracted by the statistics of the wave number locations with high frequency. Attention mechanism is used for the peak data, and the attention mechanism is weighted to the feature map of the feature extraction block. The training set, vali-dation set and prediction set are divided in the ratio of 8:1:1 for the infrared spectral data sets. For three different data sets, CWT-AM-CNN proposed in this paper is compared with the classical classifier algorithm based on CO2 feature vector and the popular AE, RNN and LSTM spectral processing networks. The prediction accuracy of the proposed algorithm in the three data sets is as high as 97%, and the lightweight network structure design not only guarantees high precision, but also has a fast running speed, which can realize the rapid and high-precision classification of the infrared spectral data of the aero-engine hot jets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e2307d72e7df5f45c4ffaabfe05d4806be25248fdc40f51fa85e361d54f11aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
