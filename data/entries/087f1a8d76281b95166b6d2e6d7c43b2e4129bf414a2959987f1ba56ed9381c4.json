{"title":"Testing the radiation cascade in postglacial radiations of whitefish and their parasites: founder events and host ecology drive parasite evolution","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evlett/article/8/5/706/7695994?rss=1","date":1718755200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Reciprocal effects of adaptive radiations on the evolution of interspecific interactions, like parasitism, remain barely explored. We test whether the recent radiations of European whitefish (<span>Coregonus</span> spp.) across and within perialpine and subarctic lakes promote its parasite <span>Proteocephalus fallax</span> (Platyhelminthes: Cestoda) to undergo host repertoire expansion via opportunity and ecological fitting, or adaptive radiation by specialization. Using de novo genomic data, we examined <span>P. fallax</span> differentiation across lakes, within lakes across sympatric host species, and the contributions of host genetics versus host habitat use and trophic preferences. Whitefish intralake radiations prompted parasite host repertoire expansion in all lakes, whereas <span>P. fallax</span> differentiation remains incipient among sympatric fish hosts. Whitefish genetic differentiation per se did not explain the genetic differentiation among its parasite populations, ruling out codivergence with the host. Instead, incipient parasite differentiation was driven by whitefish phenotypic radiation in trophic preferences and habitat use in an arena of parasite opportunity and ecological fitting to utilize resources from emerging hosts. Whilst the whitefish radiation provides a substrate for the parasite to differentiate along the same water-depth ecological axis as <span>Coregonus</span> spp., the role of the intermediate hosts in parasite speciation may be overlooked. Parasite multiple-level ecological fitting to both fish and crustacean intermediate hosts resources may be responsible for parasite population substructure in <span>Coregonus</span> spp. We propose parasites’ delayed arrival was key to the initial burst of postglacial intralake whitefish diversification, followed by opportunistic tapeworm host repertoire expansion and a delayed nonadaptive radiation cascade of incipient tapeworm differentiation. At the geographical scale, dispersal, founder events, and genetic drift following colonization of spatially heterogeneous landscapes drove strong parasite differentiation. We argue that these microevolutionary processes result in the mirroring of host–parasite phylogenies through phylogenetic tracking at macroevolutionary and geographical scales.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Letters Current Issue","siteHash":"ccc44437a8276654c44dddd156a8ce3b5dae5730f1c2406ed04aa90599bdf071","entryHash":"087f1a8d76281b95166b6d2e6d7c43b2e4129bf414a2959987f1ba56ed9381c4","category":"Environment"}
