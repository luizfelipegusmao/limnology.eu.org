{"title":"256 Anchor Talk: Accounting for effects of microbial phytase on digestibility of calcium and phosphorus","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/154/7664839?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Inclusion of increasing levels of microbial phytase in diets for weanling and growing pigs results in a linear increase in the standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) of Ca and P. In many experiments, maximum effects on STTD of Ca and P were obtained with inclusion of around 1,200 phytase units (FTU) per kg of diet, although some of the newer phytases appear to release Ca and P until at least 2,000 FTU is included in the diets. In most individual feed ingredients and most practical diets, the maximum standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) of P that is obtained by using between 500 and 1,000 FTU per kg diet is around 70%, whereas the STTD of Ca for some ingredients can be over 80% if microbial phytase is used. One reason for the decreased STTD of P than of Ca in diets with maximum dosages of phytase is that dietary Ca prevents some P from being absorbed, and the STTD of P in practical diets, therefore, will never be 100% regardless of phytase inclusion. It is, however, important that the increased STTD of dietary Ca that is caused by phytase is taken into account in diet formulation because of the negative effects of Ca on STTD of P. In addition, at low dietary phytase there is release of more Ca than P, whereas at greater inclusion levels of phytase, there may be a similar release of Ca and P. Release of Ca and P by phytase is also impacted by ingredient composition in the diets because phytase does not have the same effect on all ingredients. In general, ingredients with low concentration of phytate have greater STTD of P if no phytase is used than ingredients with greater concentrations of phytate P, but the response to phytase is greater for ingredients with high concentrations of phytate. Sows also have lower digestibility of Ca and P than growing pigs and the response to phytase in diets for sows is less than in diets for growing pigs. Likewise, there is a linear reduction in phytase effects on STTD of both Ca and P as pigs get older. In contrast, in diets for newly weaned pigs there are specific advantages to using high concentrations of phytase (at least 2,000 FTU) because gastric pH is reduced in diets with phytase, which results in less diarrhea. This effect may be related to increased concentrations of plasma inositol in pigs fed diets with phytase, which may positively impact the immune status of the pigs. In conclusion, use of phytase in diets for pigs results in increased STTD of Ca and P and may have other benefits as well.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"29e6aeca0d70a712594fd823a83605c1bd1ae5b0d8802a197f05eddbb80f9dba","category":"Environment"}
