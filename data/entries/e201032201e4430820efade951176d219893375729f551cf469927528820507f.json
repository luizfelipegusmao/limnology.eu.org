{"title":"A Novel Security System Using a Physical Unclonable Framework with Modified Elliptic Curve Cryptography Algorithm.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1179/v1","date":1718704519000,"content":"A Physical Unclonable Framework (PUF) is a detached hardware component or, the structural arrangement of hardware that provides natural variations in the physical parts of semiconductor devices to generate unique and unpredictable identifiers based on challenging-to-replicate. In this case, PUFs are giving us a tool to utilise these variations to create an unclonable identifier for your device. PUFs generate a response or a unique pattern based on the physical characteristics of the device, and this response is difficult to predict or duplicate. This study aims to introduce a PUK device to provide security research on the Internet of Things technology. The elliptic curve cryptography algorithm was modified with an advanced equation to calculate a private key and K value. In this study, a PUF device will be employed with a modified elliptic curve cryptography algorithm on a novel security system to be used in current and future communication technology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e201032201e4430820efade951176d219893375729f551cf469927528820507f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
