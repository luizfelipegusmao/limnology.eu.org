{"title":"Is refractive error a factor affecting scoliosis?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303324","date":1715608800000,"content":"<p>by Jianru Cai, Yue Zhou, Xiaojuan Chen, Xiaobo Huang, Lele Li, Yan Zhu, Qi Cai, Jianping Huang, ZhiMin Sun</p>\r\nBackground <p>Scoliosis is one of the most common surgical disorders of the pediatric spine. Refractive errors are commonly associated with vision impairment worldwide. However, it is currently unclear whether refractive error correlates directly with the development of scoliosis.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional study was performed in 2023, and a stratified cluster sampling technique was employed among school-aged students in Nantong City, China. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate specific correlations between scoliosis and related parameters; various types of refractive errors were also included in the study.</p> Results <p>The prevalence of scoliosis among school-aged students was 2.2% in Nantong city. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and anisometropia were not correlated with the development of scoliosis (all, p≥0.05). Lower body mass index (BMI) [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88−0.95; p&lt;0.001], living in rural areas (aOR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.05−1.86; p = 0.020), and older age (aOR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.25−1.38; p&lt;0.001) had significantly higher risks of scoliosis.</p> Conclusions <p>Refractive errors did not correlate with the development of scoliosis. However, BMI, living in rural areas and older age did correlate with the development of scoliosis.</p>","author":"Jianru Cai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7af6b80d7188619a6c974cd7b463ab275e50e2facd22757a141685e9853ee8ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
