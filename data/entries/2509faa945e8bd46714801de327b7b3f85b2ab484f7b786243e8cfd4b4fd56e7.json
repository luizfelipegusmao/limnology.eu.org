{"title":"Safety and Effectiveness of Coronary Sinus Reducer in the Therapy of Refractory Angina Pectoris - Mid-Term Results of the Real-Life Cohort","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1305/v1","date":1716229097000,"content":"Background: Despite continuous improvements in revascularization techniques, refractory angina without potential revascularization options remains a relevant clinical issue with significant impact on patient’s quality of life. Recently, a novel device, the Coronary Sinus Reducer (CSR), has been introduced into clinical practice as a therapeutic option for patients with disabling angina pectoris. In this single-center, observational study, we evaluated the mid-term (3-month) safety and efficacy of the CSR in a real-world cohort. Methods: The study population consisted of 55 patients with refractory angina without potential revascularization options, predominantly men (87.3%) with a high cardiovascular risk factor burden and advanced angina (baseline CCS angina class 3.15 ± 0.6). In terms of procedure safety, all patients underwent successful device deployment with only one periprocedural complication. Results: At the 3-month follow-up we observed statistically significant improvement in angina control measured CCS class and SAQ-7 Total questionnaire along with increased abolition of physical limitation – 6-MWT (233.3 ± 107.1 vs 305.2 ± 126.8; p&amp;lt;0.0001). Additionally, we observed significant improvement in terms of quality of life measurements SF-36, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, and the EQ-VAS. Conclusions: Our real-world data suggest that CSR implantation is a relatively safe procedure and appears to be particularly effective in relieving angina symptoms and improving quality of life in subjects with refractory angina.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2509faa945e8bd46714801de327b7b3f85b2ab484f7b786243e8cfd4b4fd56e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
