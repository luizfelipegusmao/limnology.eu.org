{"title":"HIV/AIDS-Associated Knowledge and Attitudes Towards Treating Disadvantaged Communities among Pre-CBDE Dental Students in the U.S.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0898/v1","date":1715677740000,"content":"This study examines HIV/AIDS-associated knowledge and attitudes towards treating disadvantaged communities among predoctoral dental students in U.S. dental schools who had not yet commenced their Community-Based Dental Education (CBDE) training. It also compares the difference in knowledge and attitudes between students with reported community engagement with PLWHA, and those without. Our study comprised 89 predoctoral dental students within their D1-D3 years of dental school who had not yet initiated their Community-Based Dental Education (referred to as pre-CBDE dental students). Responses were collected via an online survey. Participants were 68% females, 94% heterosexual, of mean age (years): 25.9 Â± 3.5 SD. The majority (62%) were in their first (D1) and second (D2) years of dental education. Of the thirty knowledge questions, only five received a minimum of 90% correct responses. Similarly, we found no statistical differences in most of the knowledge/attitude sections, between those with and without prior PLWHA exposure. Encouragingly, 90% of our participants reported prior experience working with disadvantaged communities. Early community engagement fosters a sense of professional responsibility towards administering dental care to disadvantaged communities and we propose that it must be encouraged among aspiring dental school students.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b97348147d8ee3d6c7feae163adb64611903e4657b4a96aaf875cef01f0e147d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
