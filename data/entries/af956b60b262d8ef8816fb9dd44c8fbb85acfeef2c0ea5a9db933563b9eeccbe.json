To protect the chilling-sensitive boar spermatozoa, holding the extended semen at a higher temperature before cooling could be beneficial and facilitate the implementation of the innovative preservation concept in practice, provided that bacterial growth is kept at a low level. The aim of this study was to introduce a holding time (HT) at 17°C before cooling and to examine the effect on sperm quality and bacterial growth compared to the original cooling protocol for antibiotic-free 5°C semen storage. A series of experiments with semen doses from eight boars extended in Androstar<sup>®</sup> Premium without conventional antibiotics revealed that sperm kinematics and the integrity of sperm plasma membranes and acrosomes were improved with HT between 16 and 24 h followed by delayed cooling with 0.04°C/min when compared to the original protocol for semen preservation at 5°C (p &lt; 0.05). Both a shorter HT of 6 h and a faster cooling rate of 0.07°C/min reduced sperm quality (p &lt; 0.05). The HT for 24 h did not compromise the inhibitory effect on bacterial growth during long-term semen storage at 5°C, not even in semen doses spiked with <i>Serratia marcescens</i>. In conclusion, semen storage at 5°C with the modified cooling protocol improved sperm quality and is antimicrobially efficient. It thus presents a ready-to-use tool for a reduction or replacement of antibiotics in pig insemination.","author":"Anne-Marie Luther","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"af956b60b262d8ef8816fb9dd44c8fbb85acfeef2c0ea5a9db933563b9eeccbe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
