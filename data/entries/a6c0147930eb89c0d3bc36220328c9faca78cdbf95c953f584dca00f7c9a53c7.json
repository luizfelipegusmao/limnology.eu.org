{"title":"Features of the Effect of Quercetin on Different Genotypes of Wheat under Hypoxia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0183/v1","date":1712047107000,"content":"Hypoxia is one of the common abiotic stresses that negatively affects the development and productivity of agricultural crops. Quercetin is used to protect plants from oxidative stress when exposed to environmental stressors. O2 deficiency leads to impaired development and morphometric parameters in wheat varieties Orenburgskaya 22 (Triticum aestivum) and varieties Zolotaya (Triticum durum). Cytological analysis revealed various types of changes in the cytoplasm under conditions of hypoxia and treatment with quercetin. The most critical changes in the cytoplasm occur in the Zolotaya variety during pretreatment with quercetin followed by hypoxia, and in the Orenburgskaya 22 variety during hypoxia. Quercetin has a protective effect only on the Orenburgskaya 22 variety, and also promotes more effective recovery after exposure to low O2 content. Hypoxia causes an increase in ROS and activates the antioxidant system. It has been shown that the most active components of the antioxidant system in the Orenburgskaya 22 variety are MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD, and in the Zolotaya variety GSH. We have shown that quercetin provides resistance only to the wheat genotype Orenburgskaya 22, as a protective agent against abiotic stress, which indicates the need for a comprehensive study of the effects of exogenous protectors before use in agriculture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a6c0147930eb89c0d3bc36220328c9faca78cdbf95c953f584dca00f7c9a53c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
