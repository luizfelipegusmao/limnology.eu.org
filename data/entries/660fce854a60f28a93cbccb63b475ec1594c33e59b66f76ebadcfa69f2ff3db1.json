{"title":"Enhanced stream greenhouse gas emissions at night and during flood events","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10374?af=R","date":1716819035000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Headwater streams play a large role in aquatic greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and dissolved oxygen in streams often undergo changes through diel cycles. However, methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) have unknown diel dynamics. Here, we reveal consistent patterns in CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O over diel cycles and during flood events using high-frequency continuous observations in a subtropical headwater stream. Diel cycles were most pronounced during baseflow. Increased nighttime discharge due to higher groundwater inputs enhanced gas transfer velocities and concentrations. Overall nocturnal emissions were 31%, 68%, and 32% greater than daytime for CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. Floods dampened diel signals. If both flood events and diel patterns are neglected, estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from headwaters may be greatly underestimated. Overall, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from headwater streams may be underestimated by ~ 20–40% due to a lack of observations during nighttime, floods, and in warmer climates.</p>","author":"Rebecca L.
