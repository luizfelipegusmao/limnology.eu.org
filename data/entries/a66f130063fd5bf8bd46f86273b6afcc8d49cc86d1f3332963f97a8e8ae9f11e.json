{"title":"Characterization of iso-LSD metabolism using human liver microsomes in comparison to LSD and its applicability as urinary biomarker for LSD consumption","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/5/281/7645271?rss=1","date":1711670400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Urinalysis of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) poses a challenge due to its rapid metabolism, resulting in little to no LSD detectable in urine. Instead, its primary metabolite, 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD, is predominantly detected. In this study, we observed several urine profiles with iso-LSD detected together with 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD. Iso-LSD is derived from illicit preparation of LSD as a major contaminant, and it was detected at higher abundance than LSD and 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD in certain urine samples. Therefore, the metabolism of iso-LSD and its potential as a viable urinary biomarker for confirming LSD consumption is of interest. For metabolism studies, LSD and iso-LSD were incubated in human liver microsomes (HLMs) at 0 min, 60 min and 120 min to characterize their metabolites using LC–QTOF-MS. For urinary analysis, 500 µL of urine samples underwent enzymatic hydrolysis and clean-up using supported-liquid extraction (SLE) prior to analysis by LC–QTOF-MS. From HLM incubation study of LSD, the metabolites detected were dihydroxy-LSD, 2-oxo-LSD, <span>N</span>-desmethyl-LSD (nor-LSD) and 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD with LSD levels decreasing significantly throughout all time points, consistent with the existing literatures. For HLM study of iso-LSD, metabolites eluting at retention times after the corresponding metabolites of LSD were detected, with iso-LSD levels showing only a slight decrease throughout all time points, due to a slower metabolism of iso-LSD compared to LSD. These findings corroborate with the urinalysis of 24 authentic urine samples, where iso-LSD with 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD was detected in the absence of LSD. Based on our findings, iso-LSD is commonly detected in urine (18 out of 24 samples) sometimes with traces of possible 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-iso-LSD. The slower metabolism and high detection rate in urine make iso-LSD a viable urinary biomarker for confirming LSD consumption, especially in the absence of LSD and/or 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"a66f130063fd5bf8bd46f86273b6afcc8d49cc86d1f3332963f97a8e8ae9f11e","category":"Environment"}
