{"title":"Artificial Intelligence in Pediatric Emergency Medicine: Applications, Challenges, and Future Perspectives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1642/v1","date":1714028402000,"content":"The dawn of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare stands as a milestone in medical innovation. A plethora of different medical fields are heavily involved and pediatric emergency medicine is no exception. These new tools do not merely provide more advanced and efficient systems for patients’ diagnosis, management and treatment. They rather concern a strict shift from traditional methods based upon broad categories towards a more personalized healthcare. AI offers many promises in pediatric emergency medicine with a wide range of applications involving clinical decision making, patients’ flows management and prioritization. Main barriers to a widespread diffusion involve technological challenges but also ethical issues and the paucity of extensive datasets in pediatric contexts. We conducted a narrative review structured in two parts. The first part explores the theoretical principles of AI, providing all the necessary background to feel confident with these new state-of-the-art tools. The second part presents an informative analysis of AI models in pediatric emergencies, pointing out the actual applications and challenges until future feasible research perspectives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"087e899a686b6e332b9e01ca0795998ff04a221a3d1f93af281f0c1f4212c4e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
