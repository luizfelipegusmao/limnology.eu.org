{"title":"Lower Extremity Joint Kinetics during Walk–to–Run and Run–to–Walk Transitions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0710/v1","date":1710250222000,"content":"Lower extremity joint kinetic factors are thought to modulate walk–to–run transition (WRT) and run–to–walk transition (RWT). This study aimed to investigate joint stiffness and energetic patterns during the WRT and RWT processes and identify whether gait transitions occurred within a single step or not. Ten healthy subjects participated in treadmill WRT (1.8 m/s – 2.4 m/s) and RWT (2.4 m/s – 1.8 m/s) tests. We investigated two steps before transition (S–2, S–1), two steps after transition (S1, S2) and the transition step (S0). We found significant differences between S2 and S–2 for ankle joint stiffness during WRT and RWT (p &amp;lt; 0.001); and for hip joint stiffness, we found significant differences between S1 and S–1 during WRT and RWT (p ≤ 0.001). Additionally, stance phase mechanical energy generation was observed to transfer from proximal to distal joints at S0 during WRT, and from distal to proximal at S0 during RWT. Transition step ankle kinematic and kinetic patterns were similar to the target locomotion task gait format in both WRT and RWT. Moreover, RWT required longer adaptation time compared with WRT. These findings indicate that WRT and RWT were modulated before and after the actual transitions, not within a single step. Redistribution of joint mechanical work generation was related to gait transition triggers, which modulate the WRT and RWT process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3dd3f2c00a63961fcf1d11fbeaebfc75c26263aaa780c77d9c7b9e688690d97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
