{"title":"Investigating the Influence of Power Dynamics on Supply Chain Decision-Making Processes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0561/v1","date":1718013961000,"content":"The study investigates the influence of power dynamics on supply chain decision-making processes through a qualitative lens, aiming to understand how various forms of power impact interactions, relationships, and strategic outcomes within supply chains. Using semi-structured interviews with supply chain managers and executives from diverse industries, the research explores the multifaceted nature of power, identifying key sources such as economic leverage, expertise, resource control, and network centrality. Findings reveal that power dynamics significantly shape decision-making by determining negotiation outcomes, governance structures, and operational efficiencies. Economic power, often exercised by larger firms, enables them to dominate negotiations and impose favorable terms, creating pressures on smaller partners and potentially leading to conflicts. Expertise and resource control allow firms with specialized knowledge or unique inputs to influence product development and process innovation, further dictating supply chain configurations. The study differentiates between coercive and non-coercive power strategies, showing that while coercive power enforces compliance, it can erode trust and collaboration. Non-coercive power, on the other hand, promotes positive relationships through incentives and collaborative approaches, fostering trust and alignment of supply chain objectives. Governance structures imposed by dominant firms often reflect their strategic priorities but can burden less powerful partners, highlighting the need for balanced oversight. Power also plays a crucial role in risk management, resilience, sustainability, and innovation within supply chains, with digitalization introducing new dimensions of influence. The research underscores the importance of balanced and equitable power dynamics to enhance cooperation, resilience, and innovation in supply chains. These insights provide valuable implications for practitioners and scholars in developing more effective and adaptive supply chain strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72049a7f04e6e0316aad34264f4d29fe6f7f9c6520045092ce5a1873433df3b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
