{"title":"Leveraging the Voluntary Carbon Market to Improve Water Resilience in the Colorado and Mississippi River Basins","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1314/v1","date":1724062560000,"content":"The Colorado and Mississippi River Basins are crucial for water supply, agriculture, and ecological stability in the U.S., yet climate change, water management practices, and energy sector demands pose significant challenges to their sustainability. This paper highlights the potential of leveraging the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) to address these challenges by creating new revenue streams and incentivizing sustainable water management practices. The paper provides high-level estimates by extrapolating from existing literature. The results suggests that water projects in these basins could generate over 45 million carbon credits annually, potentially attracting around $4.5 billion in investments over the next decade. However, challenges such as high costs, complex regulations, and stakeholder coordination must be addressed. The paper also identifies opportunities for advancing water resiliency projects, including increasing public awareness, engaging corporations, and utilizing innovative financing mechanisms. Recommendations include promoting the VCM-water relationship, encouraging methodology innovation, developing pilot programs, investing in digital monitoring technologies, and conducting localized analysis to optimize carbon credit potential in water management. By integrating carbon markets with water management strategies, the paper suggests significant contributions to global climate goals and enhanced water resilience in these critical regions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8998d61844dd2303d547174df59dd54a64deec7e39a1f26938628502eb536e71","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
