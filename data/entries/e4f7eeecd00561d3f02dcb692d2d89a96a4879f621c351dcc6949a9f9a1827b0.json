{"title":"Scaling of leaf area with biomass in trees reconsidered: constant metabolically active sapwood volume per unit leaf area with height growth","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/13/3993/7650252?rss=1","date":1713398400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Hypoallometric (slope&lt;1) scaling between metabolic rate and body mass is often regarded as near-universal across organisms. However, there are compelling reasons to question hypoallometric scaling in woody plants, where metabolic rate is directly proportional to leaf area. This leaf area must provide carbon to the volume of the metabolically active sapwood (<span>V</span><sub>MASW</sub>). Within populations of a species, variants in which <span>V</span><sub>MASW</sub> increases per unit leaf area with height growth (e.g. ⅔ or ¾ scaling) would have proportionally less carbon for growth and reproduction as they grow taller. Therefore, selection should favor individuals in which, as they grow taller, leaf area scales isometrically with shoot <span>V</span><sub>MASW</sub> (slope=1). Using tetrazolium staining, we measured total <span>V</span><sub>MASW</sub> and total leaf area (LA<sub>tot</sub>) across 22 individuals of <span>Ricinus communis</span> and confirmed that leaf area scales isometrically with <span>V</span><sub>MASW</sub>, and that <span>V</span><sub>MASW</sub> is much smaller than total sapwood volume. With the potential of the LA<sub>tot</sub>–<span>V</span><sub>MASW</sub> relationship to shape factors as diverse as the crown area–stem diameter relationship, conduit diameter scaling, reproductive output, and drought-induced mortality, our work indicates that the notion that sapwood increases per unit leaf area with height growth requires revision.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"e4f7eeecd00561d3f02dcb692d2d89a96a4879f621c351dcc6949a9f9a1827b0","category":"Environment"}
