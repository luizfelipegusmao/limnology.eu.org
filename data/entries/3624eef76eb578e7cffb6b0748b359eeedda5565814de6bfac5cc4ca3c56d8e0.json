{"title":"On the Salient Limits of Strings of Assembly Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1581/v2","date":1727938532000,"content":"We consider the formation of strings of any natural radix b within the framework of assembly theory. In particular, we show that the upper bound of the assembly index depends on the radix b both quantitatively and qualitatively, and the longest length N of a string that has the assembly index of N-k is given by N(N-k)=b2+b+3k-2 for k={1,2,3}. We also provide two particular forms of such strings. For k=1 such odd length strings are nearly balanced and there are four such different strings if b=2 and seventy-two if b=3. Since these results are valid also for b=1, assembly theory subsumes information theory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3624eef76eb578e7cffb6b0748b359eeedda5565814de6bfac5cc4ca3c56d8e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
