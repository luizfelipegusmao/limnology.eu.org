By some estimates, chronic respiratory impairment, or post-tuberculosis lung disease (PTLD), is present in just over half of all patients who have completed TB therapy. Despite this high prevalence and substantial associated morbidity, discussion of PTLD is essentially absent from international and national TB policies and guidelines. Clear and ambitious clinical standards should be established for the diagnosis and management of PTLD, including the stipulation that all patients completing TB therapy should be screened for PTLD. Patients diagnosed with PTLD should receive linkage to chronic care, with access to inhalers and home oxygen, as indicated based on individual symptoms and pathophysiology. Leveraging their considerable influence, major funders, such as The Global Fund, could help close the gap in PTLD care by including PTLD in their strategic vision and funding streams. Immediate action is needed to address the substantial burden of disease associated with PTLD. This will require expanding the global approach to TB to include a commitment to diagnosing and treating long-term complications following initial curative therapy.","author":"Chase Yarbrough","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"0e1e97949c9c773bd9917b9ffd1c21118d6b80d5625e877a28686e1ad6fac6bc","category":"Environment"}
