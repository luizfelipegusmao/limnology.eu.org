Soil salinization is one of the major issues of changing climate, causing adverse impacts on agricultural crops. Germination and seedlings establishment are damaged under these conditions, so seeds must be safeguard before planting. Here, we use recycled organic tree waste combined with cold (low-pressure) plasma treatment as grain coating to improve the ability of wheat seed cultivars (Misr-1 and Gemmeza-11) to survive, germinate and produce healthy seedlings. The seeds were coated with biofilms of lignin and hash carbon to form a protective extracellular polymeric matrix and then exposed them to low-pressure plasma for different periods of time. The effectiveness of the coating and plasma was evaluated by characterizing the physical and surface properties of coated seeds using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and wettability testing. We also evaluated biological and physiological properties of coated seeds and plants they produced by studying germination and seedling vigor, as well as by characterizing fitness parameters of the plants derived from the seeds. The analysis revealed the optimal plasma exposure time to enhance germination and seedling growth. Taken together, our study suggests that combining the use of recycled organic tree waste and cold plasma may represent a viable strategy for improving crop seedlings performance, hence encouraging plants cultivation in stressed ecosystems.","author":"Abd Elfattah T.
