{"title":"A Rational Approximation of the Two-Term Machin-Like Formula for &pi;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0554/v1","date":1718006341000,"content":"In this work, we consider the properties of the two-term Machin-like formula and develop an algorithm for computing digits of π by using its rational approximation. In this approximation, both terms are constructed by using a representation of 1/π in the binary form. This approach provides the squared convergence in computing digits of π without any trigonometric functions and surd numbers. The Mathematica codes showing some examples are presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f31503a6a985bfe077666f89480619c5c2838633e37805c11beb1f4fac9342bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
