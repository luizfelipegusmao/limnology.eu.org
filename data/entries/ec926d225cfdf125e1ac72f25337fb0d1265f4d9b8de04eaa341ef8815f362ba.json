{"title":"A molecular approach to identify parrotfish (Sparisoma) species during early ontogeny","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15921?af=R","date":1728360926000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Sparisoma</i> species (parrotfish) comprise an important functional group contributing to coral-reef resilience. The morphological diagnostic characteristics for species identification are clearly described for adult forms but not for the early stages. Consequently, many taxonomical listings of <i>Sparisoma</i> larvae are restricted to the genus level. The aims of this study are to determine whether the morphological and molecular identification techniques are useful to assign the species taxonomic level to <i>Sparisoma</i> larvae occurring in the Gulf of Mexico and whether there is a set of diagnostic features that could be used to discriminate between species in larvae of different developmental stages. Morphological assignment of <i>Sparisoma</i> was performed based on morphological and meristic features for 30 larvae collected in the Gulf of Mexico from late August to mid-September 2015. To corroborate and complement the morphological assignments, molecular identification was carried out using DNA sequences from regions of two mitochondrial genes, mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtDNA COI) and mitochondrial 16S rRNA (mtDNA 16S rRNA). COI and 16S gene trees for <i>Sparisoma</i> and related fish taxa were constructed using sequences available in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) GenBank and BOLD (Barcode of Life Data) databases. Two morphotypes were identified based on morphology, but no diagnostic characteristics for species discrimination were found. Molecular identification, in contrast, successfully discriminated four early development stages of <i>Sparisoma atomarium</i>, three stages of <i>Sparisoma radians</i>, and two stages of <i>Sparisoma chrysopterum</i> and <i>Sparisoma aurofrenatum</i>, therefore demonstrating the successful and necessary application of molecular taxonomic approaches for species-level identifications of <i>Sparisoma</i> larvae.</p>","author":"José Manuel Morales‐Pulido, \nClara Elizabeth Galindo‐Sánchez, \nSylvia Patricia Adelheid Jiménez‐Rosenberg, \nPaola Gabriela Batta‐Lona, \nSharon Zinah Herzka, \nMaría Clara Arteaga","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"ec926d225cfdf125e1ac72f25337fb0d1265f4d9b8de04eaa341ef8815f362ba","category":"Environment"}
