Gorman, Yaroslava G Yingling, Brooke K Mayer<br />Adsorbents featuring high-affinity phosphate-binding proteins (PBPs) have demonstrated highly selective and rapid phosphorus removal and recovery. While immobilized PBP is promising for inorganic phosphate (orthophosphate, Pi) removal and recovery, increased...<br />The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"RSC - Environ.
