Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled to MALDI-TOF MS elucidated the overabundance of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and <span>l</span>-lactate dehydrogenase that are positively correlated with stress in JS broilers. Bioinformatic analysis explored the multifaceted landscape of molecular functions.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The study has uncovered that ritual slaughter performed without stunning against commercial slaughter with ES practices elicit varying levels of stress as evident from blood biochemistry and novel protein markers. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Prasad M Govindaiah, \nNaveena B Maheswarappa, \nRituparna Banerjee, \nMuthupalani Muthukumar, \nBalaji B Manohar, \nBidyut Prava Mishra, \nArup R Sen, \nAshim K Biswas","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"6551132b822c7fe0b917d3d5c1d97ce1542b2fdc57843237e9d233664fa611a4","category":"Environment"}
