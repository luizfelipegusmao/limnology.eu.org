{"title":"The Effect of Intravenous Oxyhydrogen Nanobubble on Chronic Kidney Disease: Case Series","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1114/v1","date":1718602287000,"content":"Background. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition with limited treatment options that often lead to significant morbidity. Recent studies suggest that oxyhydrogen nanobubbles (HHOnb) may offer therapeutic benefits due to their antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. This case series examines the effects of intravenous HHOnb therapy on three patients with varying stages of CKD.Methods. Three patients with CKD underwent a series of ten HHOnb infusions over a period of two to three months. The patients, aged 43 to 70, presented with additional comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and polycystic kidney disease. Clinical parameters, including glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine, blood pressure, and uric acid levels, were monitored alongside subjective health improvements.Results. Patient A. A 70-year-old woman with CKD grade 3a experienced a reduction in serum creatinine from 0.98 mg/dL to 0.82 mg/dL and an improvement in GFR from 59 mL/min/1.73 m² to 73.2 mL/min/1.73 m². She reported reduced leg swelling and increased vitality. Patient B. A 52-year-old man with CKD grade 4 and class III obesity showed a decrease in serum creatinine from 3.0 mg/dL to 2.86 mg/dL, an increase in GFR from 23 mL/min/1.73 m² to 24.4 mL/min/1.73 m², and improved sleep quality. Blood pressure reduced from 167/82 mmHg to 145/85 mmHg. Patient C. A 43-year-old man with CKD grade 4 and massive polycystic kidney disease reported reduced fatigue and normalized urination. His serum creatinine decreased from 3.26 mg/dL to 3.09 mg/dL, and his GFR improved from 22 mL/min/1.73 m² to 23.6 mL/min/1.73 m².Conclusion. Intravenous HHOnb therapy demonstrated potential benefits in improving renal function and overall health in CKD patients. These findings suggest that HHOnb could be a promising complementary treatment for CKD, though larger, controlled studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"094aa5bfbb8aca15c19ef0ce6d310e626a5a8e9dbe116e3f98583d3a94545c39","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
