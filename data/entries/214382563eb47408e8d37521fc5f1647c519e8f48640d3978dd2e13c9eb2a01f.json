{"title":"Acute Care Rehabilitation Services Utilization and Post-acute Discharge Destination among Adults with Traumatic Brain Injury: The Moderating Effect of Functional and Physical Performance at Discharge","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0906/v1","date":1718266400000,"content":"Objective: To investigate whether the relationships between acute care occupational therapy (OT) and physical therapy (PT) utilization and community discharge are moderated by functional or physical performance at discharge among individuals hospitalized with traumatic brain injury (TBI). \nSetting: 14 acute care hospitals in the state of Colorado.\nParticipants: We studied 5,599 adults hospitalized with TBI between June 2018 and April 2021.\nDesign: In a secondary analysis of de-identified electronic health record (EHR) data, multivariable moderation logistic regression models were performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for the likelihood of community discharge among patients who utilized OT/PT services.\nMain Measures: Functional (activities of daily living [ADL]) and physical (mobility) performance at discharge, OT and PT utilization, and community discharge status. \nResults: Overall, 67% of patients discharged to the community. The mean age of the sample was 55 years (SD = 20 years). Most participants were male (64%) and non-Hispanic white (72%). Mean hospital length of stay was 6 days (SD = 6 days). Both OT and PT utilization (OT: OR= 1.21, 95% CI [1.11, 1.33]; PT: OR= 1.22, 95% CI [1.14, 1.30]) and discharge ADL and mobility scores (ADL: OR= 1.34, 95% CI [1.30, 1.39]; mobility: OR= 1.38, 95% CI [1.33, 1.42]) were significantly and positively associated with community discharge. The OT and PT utilization-by-discharge ADL and mobility interaction terms yielded slightly negative, but statistically significant moderation effects in both models (ORs= 0.99, 95% CIs [0.98, 1.00]); indicating the magnitude of the OT and PT utilization effect diminished as ADL and mobility scores increased. Several sociodemographic characteristics and clinical factors were also independently associated with community discharge in both models (p-values","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"214382563eb47408e8d37521fc5f1647c519e8f48640d3978dd2e13c9eb2a01f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
