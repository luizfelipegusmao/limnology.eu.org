{"title":"The Importance of Bioactive Compounds and Plant Extracts in the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2469/v1","date":1722347507000,"content":"Pancreatic cancer is a serious and aggressive type of cancer that affects the digestive system and has a low chance of survival. Although traditional treatment methods have achieved some efficacy, the survival rate of patients remains low. Therefore, exploring novel treatment strategies is important. This article looks at the research done on bioactive compounds and plant extracts for treating pancreatic cancer. Bioactive compounds, such as naringenin and ziyuglycoside II, have significant anticancer activity and exert anti-pancreatic-cancer effects by inducing cell apoptosis, inhibiting the cell cycle, and blocking signaling pathways. Plant extracts, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate and resveratrol, also demonstrate good anti-pancreatic cancer activity and inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, the combined application of bioactive compounds and plant extracts may result in improved therapeutic effects. This article aims to provide a theoretical basis for the application of bioactive compounds and plant extracts in the treatment of pancreatic cancer and to help guide future medical research and practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8c2f9ea94a96a1f16afecfd455c727eb431835c6e6d1254c3698b7e03bde093","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
