Depending on the A- and B-site cations, delafossite oxides exhibit a variety of interesting physical properties. These include p-type or bipolar semiconductivity (for A = Cu, B = Al, Cr, Fe, Ga, Y, In), photocatalytic activity (e.g. AgGaO<sub>2</sub>), multiferroicity (CuFeO<sub>2</sub>), and metallic conductivity (PdCoO<sub>2</sub>, PdCrO<sub>2</sub>, PdRhO<sub>2</sub>, PtCoO<sub>2</sub>, and AgNiO<sub>2</sub>) [<a href=\"#ozae044.914-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e2ca9dba5ed5868610129be3c3843786f3c917a4fef2c8d89e7eb2770df6d1e1","category":"Environment"}
