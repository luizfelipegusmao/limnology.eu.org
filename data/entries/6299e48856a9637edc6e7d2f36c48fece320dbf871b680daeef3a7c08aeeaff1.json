These approaches reduce infection times, promote reproducibility, and enable a rapid evaluation of plant-pathogen interactions. As a result, these systems have become essential in breeding programs aimed at developing plant resistance to diseases. In this study, we developed and validated an <i>in vitro</i> co-culture system to investigate the Armillaria root rot (ARR) affecting <i>Prunus</i> spp. This disease, caused by fungi <i>Armillaria</i> spp. and <i>Desarmillaria caespitosa</i>, poses a severe threat to the stone and nut fruit industry due to the susceptibility of most commercial rootstocks to infection and the lack of effective management options for its control. The system consists of a fiber-supported liquid approach in sterile plastic vessels that allows a fast and reproducible fungal infection under controlled environmental conditions. The floor of the vessels was covered with a polyester-fiber matte and a germination paper that served as an interface between the mycelia and the plant roots. The vessels were subjected to inoculation with <i>Armillaria mellea</i> and <i>D</i>. <i>caespitosa</i>, and three <i>Prunus</i> genotypes (‘Guardian<sup>®</sup>’, ‘MP-29’, and <i>Prunus cerasifera</i> ‘14–4’) were co-cultured with both fungi. Disease progression and plant and fungal biomass were monitored during co-culture. The presented <i>in vitro</i> co-culture approach facilitates the concurrent growth of <i>Armillaria/Desarmillaria</i> spp. and <i>Prunus</i> spp., excluding most of the limitations associated with greenhouses and field experiments. This system provides consistent and reproducible conditions for investigating a prominent plant disease affecting <i>Prunus</i> spp.","author":"Alejandro Calle","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6299e48856a9637edc6e7d2f36c48fece320dbf871b680daeef3a7c08aeeaff1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
