{"title":"Decomposition of air conditioning electricity consumption considering the dependence between the temperature and electricity consumption","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308542","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Chao Xun, Lin Liu, Chang Wang, Junhong Ni</p>\r\n\r\nWith the continuous increase in air conditioning installations, the proportion of air conditioning electricity consumption to total electricity consumption is growing. Research on the decomposition of air conditioning electricity consumption is of great significance for assessing electricity usage, formulating electricity scheduling plans, and ensuring the stable operation of the power grid. Currently, typical day selection strategies for the decomposition of air conditioning electricity consumption often overlook the corresponding relationship between typical daily electricity consumption and temperature. Therefore, this paper proposes an air conditioning electricity consumption decomposition method based on the dependence between temperature and electricity consumption. This method filters typical days based on Copula-based dependence indicators and equiprobable ellipses, determines the baseline electricity consumption curve through model selection voting, and ultimately calculates the air conditioning electricity consumption. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by applying it to electricity consumption data in Fuzhou from 2019 to 2022.","author":"Chao Xun","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f1c50891e6a5704630980c3cc6b86ce16fec20d803d5cb70e45b834115c5aa88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
