Photo taken in Chongqing, China, on August 28th 2022 by Haoping Zhang.</p>\n<p>The record-breaking and long-lasting 2022 heat waves in China led to extensive leaf damage of urban plants. The authors of this study surveyed the in-situ responses of urban woody species in four cities along the Yangtze River, which suffered the worst heat stress from June to August 2022. They found that evergreen species suffered significantly less leaf damage during the heat waves and exhibited higher leaf heat tolerance than deciduous species. Evergreen leaves are thicker than deciduous leaves; leaf thickness significantly correlated with a critical indicator of leaf damage. This study provided insights for predicting leaf heat tolerance of urban woody plants in subtropical China and their physiological and ecological responses to severe heat waves.</p>\n<br />","author":"","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"e792ffcaa812e7d88ea9e3a31ea84f989db26f3d3598d71e200dab5355cd6747","category":"Environment"}
