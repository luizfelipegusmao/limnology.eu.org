{"title":"Dark Energy and Dark Matter from Extra Dimensional Symmetry as Different Manifestations of Vacuum Energy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202309.1002/v6","date":1727086755000,"content":"Dark energy and dark matter are described as different manifestations of vacuum energy in the cyclic universe framework of Extra Dimensional Symmetry (EDS). Motivated by the cosmological constant problem, EDS doubles large spatial dimensions with microscopic partners of opposite chirality and dimension number (gravitational charge). In this framework, the bulk of vacuum energy, constrained by a Planck density constraint, exists in a gravitationally inert state where actual gravitational constant is zero G. This is in contrast with the gravitationally active state where actual gravitational constant is two Gs with each of these two states corresponding to opposite particle chirality. Dark energy is described as a small repulsive component of vacuum energy constrained to the active state by an asymptotically evolving asymmetry. Dark matter is described as the attractive component of vacuum energy, enabled by neutrino induced gravitational constant which also serves as neutrino mass generation mechanism. While ordinary neutrino interaction with dark energy yields light neutrino mass, chiraly inverted neutrino interaction with dense vacuum energy yields heavy neutrino mass. Transition to sterile neutrino phase can be activated by the gravitational effect of shear stress on the microscopic partners of the visible spatial dimensions. Observational and experimental tests are briefly discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"66aab3706c81a4bc3b2f45ad898cd41fefd6b6b1fa32cb4d7d2beaeccb78f473","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
