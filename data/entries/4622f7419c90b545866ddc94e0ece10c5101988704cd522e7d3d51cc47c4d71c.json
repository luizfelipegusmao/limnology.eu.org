{"title":"48 Dietary functional fiber properties for improved health and disease outcomes in pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/264/7757185?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In swine production, using feed antibiotics as antimicrobial growth promotants has been reduced; thus, feed alternatives to manage gut health are required. Dietary fiber and similar carbohydrate structures such as resistant starch, oligosaccharides, and exopolysaccharides are nutritional tools that may enhance gut health in pigs. Dietary fiber may have a role to alleviate diarrheal diseases including in pigs post-weaning but can also reduce constipation in sows, but specific functionality depends on fiber properties. Antibiotics are hypothesized to influence gut health via modulation of intestinal microbial profiles; fermentation and intestinal inflammation are considered important mechanisms. Dietary fiber sources differ in a key functional property: fermentability. Rapid fermentation of fiber and oligosaccharides is associated with changes in microbial profiles and increased metabolite production. Recently, microbial composition was hypothesized to be less important and combined output of metabolites should be the focus. Fiber properties may also manipulate retention time and physico-chemical properties of the undigested residue; hence, non-fermentable fiber may prevent constipation in sows. The fiber-like structure resistant starch is not digested and acts as fermentable fiber but has unique properties, because it specifically increases intestinal abundance of bifidobacteria, which are associated with improved gut health. Using crop breeding, feed processing, and feed additives, the structure of fiber and starch can be altered thereby changing its degradation kinetics and affecting its prebiotic activity. Finally, fiber-like structures such as exopolysaccharides from <span>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</span> and unique oligosaccharides may serve as receptor analogues for pathogenic bacteria, e.g., enterotoxigenic <span>Escherichia coli</span> (ETEC). These receptor analogues block lectin domains of bacterial adhesins and thus prevent adherence of pathogens to the gut wall, thereby avoiding initiation of post-weaning diarrhea. In conclusion, dietary fiber and similar structures possess important functional properties that may also provide important solutions to maintain gut health in pigs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"4622f7419c90b545866ddc94e0ece10c5101988704cd522e7d3d51cc47c4d71c","category":"Environment"}
