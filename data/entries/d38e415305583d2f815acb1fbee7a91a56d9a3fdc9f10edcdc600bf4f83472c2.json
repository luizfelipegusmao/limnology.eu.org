{"title":"Application of the Knife-Edge Technique on Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayers for Resolution Assessment of Nonlinear Microscopy Modalities","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/4/671/7712562?rss=1","date":1720742400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We report application of the knife-edge technique at the sharp edges of WS2 and MoS2 monolayer flakes for lateral and axial resolution assessment in all three modalities of nonlinear laser scanning microscopy: two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF), second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG, THG) imaging. This technique provides a high signal-to-noise ratio, no photobleaching effect and shows good agreement with standard resolution measurement techniques. Furthermore, we assessed both the lateral resolution in TPEF imaging modality and the axial resolution in SHG and THG imaging modality directly via the full-width at half maximum parameter of the corresponding Gaussian distribution. We comprehensively analyzed the factors influencing the resolution, such as the numerical aperture, the excitation wavelength and the refractive index of the embedding medium for the different imaging modalities. Glycerin was identified as the optimal embedding medium for achieving resolutions closest to the theoretical limit. The proposed use of WS2 and MoS2 monolayer flakes emerged as promising tools for characterization of nonlinear imaging systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d38e415305583d2f815acb1fbee7a91a56d9a3fdc9f10edcdc600bf4f83472c2","category":"Environment"}
