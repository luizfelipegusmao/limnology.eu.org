{"title":"Immobilization of Phospholipase D on Magnetic Graphene Oxide for Efficient Phosphatidylserine Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1233/v1","date":1726630019000,"content":"Phosphatidylserine (PS) has significant applications in various sectors, such as the medical and food industries. However, its production relies heavily on phospholipase D (PLD), a crucial tool that is hindered by issues like poor stability and irrecoverability. Immobilization presents itself as an effective solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, magnetic graphene oxide (MGO) modified with amino (-NH2) were synthesized and utilized for PLD immobilization. The activity of the immobilized PLD (MGO-PLD) reached 3062 U/gMGO, with a specific activity of 33.9 U/mgPLD, virtually identical to that of the free PLD. MGO-PLD was utilized to synthesize PS efficiently in a biphasic system. Under optimal conditions, PS yield reached 18.66 g/L, with a conversion rate of 92.8% and a productivity of 3.11 g/L/h. Notably, MGO-PLD retained an impressive PS conversion rate of 77.4% even after seven repetitive usages. Moreover, MGO-PLD displayed enhanced thermal and pH resistance properties compared to free PLD, alongside an augmented storage stability. Post a 8-week preservation at 4Â°C, its residual activity was able to maintain at 76.3%. This study provides a sustainable and highly efficient pathway for biocatalytic synthesis of PS.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"185749e7f4f4d6a3799e6c3a5a0941506b2af1739dc0c8d3bff7773b4a24e2f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
