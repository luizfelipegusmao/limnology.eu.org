The study determined the polymorphic distribution of the HAMP promoter gene rs10421768 and hepcidin levels in SCA patients.</p> Method <p>Sixty participants aged ≥12years [45 SCA patients and 15 controls (HbA)] were recruited from 15<sup>th</sup> March, 2023 to 20<sup>th</sup> July, 2023 for a case-control study at Methodist Hospital Wenchi, Ghana. Complete blood count and hepcidin levels assessment were done using haematology analyzer and ELISA, respectively. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen Kit, and HAMP gene rs10421768 (c.-582 A&gt;G) was sequenced using the MassARRAY method. Data were analysed using SPSS version 26.0.</p> Results <p>The frequencies of the HAMP promoter rs10421768 genotypes AA, AG, and GG were 64.4%, 33.3%, and 2.2% in SCA patients, and 86.7%, 13.3%, and 0% in the controls, respectively. Serum hepcidin levels were significantly higher among controls than cases [204.0 (154.1–219.3) vs 150.2 (108.1–195.6)μg/L, <i>p</i>&lt;0.010]. Participants with HAMP rs10421768 homozygous A genotype had higher serum levels of hepcidin compared with those in the wild genotypes (AG/GG) group [(188.7 (130.9–226.9) vs 136.8 (109.7–157.8)μg/L, <i>p</i>&lt;0.016]. Disease severity and blood cell parameters were not associated with the HAMP variants (<i>p</i>&gt;0.05).</p> Conclusion <p>The HAMP promoter rs10421768 AA genotype has the highest frequency of distribution and the GG genotype with the least distribution. Participants with HAMP rs10421768 G allele (c.-582A&gt;G) had reduced levels of hepcidin. HAMP rs10421768 genotypes had no association with blood cell parameters and disease severity. The HAMP rs10421768 genotypes may influence serum levels of hepcidin. Further study is required to elucidate the potential effect of the G allele on hepcidin transcription.</p>","author":"Samuel Kwasi Appiah","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7b7c8d92b6f5c31da3bba3ea3643600cd4b602b84eb0e814937e40a022dcd47a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
