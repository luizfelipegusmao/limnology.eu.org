{"title":"Performance of a Combined Energy System Consisting of Solar Collector, Biogas Dry Reforming and Solid Oxide Fuel Cell &ndash; An Indian Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0090/v1","date":1722560004000,"content":"An energy production system consisting solar collector, biogas dry reforming reactor and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was assumed to be installed in Kolkata, India. This study aims to understand the impact of climate condition on the performance of solar collectors with different lengths of parabolic trough solar collector (dx) and mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid (m). In addition, this study has evaluated the amount of H2 produced by biogas dry reforming (GH2), the amount of power generated by SOFC (PSOFC) and the maximum possible households (N) whose electricity demand could be met by the energy system proposed, considering the performance of solar collector with the different dx and m. As a result, the optimum dx was found to be 4 m. This study revealed that temperature of heat transfer fluid (Tfb) decreased with the increase in m. Tfb in March, April and May was higher than that in other months, while Tfb from June to December was the lowest. GH2, PSOFC and N in March, April and May were higher than that in other months irrespective of m. The optimum m was 0.030 kg/s.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25238fa7100a8332acdc9b48099b48ed712aacfbc04aea76812b7c91d1e5379f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
