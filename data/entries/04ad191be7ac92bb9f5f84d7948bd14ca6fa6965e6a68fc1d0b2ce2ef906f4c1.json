{"title":"Signal Transduction of Fucoxanthin Nanoparticles as Anti-Oxidative Stress and Anti-Inflammatory Protecting Aortic Damagein Diabetic Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1861/v1","date":1729690973000,"content":"The anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory effects of natural products can prevent diabetic complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and blood vessel damage. Fucoxanthin has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This research aimed to examine the preventative effects of fucoxanthin nanoparticles against aortic damage in diabetic rats. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) was utilized to identify the size of fucoxanthin nanoparticles. The experiment consisted of five groups (n=8) namely: rats only received streptozotocin (STZ) solvent and fucoxanthin nanoparticles solvent as a control group; rats only received STZ and solvent of fucoxanthin nanoparticles solvent as the diabetic group; and rats received STZ and fucoxanthin nanoparticles at a dose of 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg BW as the fucoxanthin nanoparticle group. The fucoxanthin nanoparticle sizes were 217.2 ± 42.8 nm in DLS. The dose-dependent administration of fucoxanthin nanoparticles elevated significant superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), nitric oxide (NO), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and insulin. However, blood glucose, malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and endothelial cell necrosis decreased compared to those in the streptozotocin group. Our findings suggest that fucoxanthin nanoparticles decrease malondialdehyde levels and increase superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase levels to inhibit oxidative stress, consequently preventing diabetes-induced aortic damage. Furthermore, fucoxanthin nanoparticles also may inhibit inflammation by reducing IL-6 and TNF-α levels. These mechanisms reduce endothelial cell necrosis, which can increase the expression of eNOS and NO levels in the aorta of diabetic rats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04ad191be7ac92bb9f5f84d7948bd14ca6fa6965e6a68fc1d0b2ce2ef906f4c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
