{"title":"Antioxidant Activity of Special Functional Beers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0193/v1","date":1714978363000,"content":"Prenylated flavonoids of Humulus lupulus L. have gained attention for their potential health benefits. In this study, Amber ALE and Russian Imperial Stout beers were prepared. In order to increase the content of prenylated flavonoids in beer, there was added ethanol extract of Polaris hops, they were dry hopping with Polaris hops or pure xanthohumol was added. In unfiltered beers, the highest total content of polyphenols (3.60 ± 0.32 g/L gallic acid) was determined on the eighth day of fermentation and maturation in Amber ALE beer without the addition of extract. The highest total antioxidant capacity was determined in Russian Imperial Stout beer with the addition of xanthohumol on the eighth day of fermentation and maturation (0.675 ± 0.008 mmol/L Trolox). This type of beer also had a high antioxidant efficiency (85.96 - 88.00%). Xanthohumol (2.05 mg/L) and isoxanthohumol (2.819 mg/L) were detectable only until the thirteenth day of fermentation and beer maturation. Therefore, the beers were filtered, and the ethanol extract of the Polaris was added to them for 24 hours. This procedure was used to prepare a functional beer of the Amber ALE type (15.210 ± 0.053 mg xanthohumol in 1 L and 0.922 ± 0.077 mg isoxanthohumol in 1 L) and a functional beer of the Russian Imperial Stout type (32.375 ± 0.032 mg xanthohumol in 1 L and 1.877 ± 0.043 mg isoxanthohumol in 1 L).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"87393639906bd1770e9cc4a46046e0c8683e7b2643c1b345ed13663b0bf04222","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
