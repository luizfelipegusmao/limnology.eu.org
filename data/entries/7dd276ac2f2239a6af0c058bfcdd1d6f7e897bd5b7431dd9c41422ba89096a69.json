{"title":"Validating the performance of organ dysfunction scores in children with infection: A cohort study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306172","date":1721397600000,"content":"<p>by Shaojun Li, Tao Tan, Jing Li, Hongdong Li, Liang Zhou, Ke Bai, Li Xiao, Ximing Xu, Liping Tan</p>\r\nPurpose <p>We aimed to validate the performance of six available scoring models for predicting hospital mortality in children with suspected or confirmed infections.</p> Methods <p>This single-center retrospective cohort study included pediatric patients admitted to the PICU for infection. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The six scores included the age-adapted pSOFA score, SIRS score, PELOD2 score, Sepsis-2 score, qSOFA score, and PMODS.</p> Results <p>Of the 5,356 children admitted to the PICU, 9.1% (488) died, and 25.1% (1,342) had basic disease with a mortality rate of 12.7% (171); 65.3% (3,499) of the patients were younger than 2 years, and 59.4% (3,183) were male. The discrimination abilities of the pSOFA and PELOD2 scores were superior to those of the other models. The calibration curves of the pSOFA and PELOD2 scores were consistent between the predictions and observations. Elevated lactate levels were a risk factor for mortality.</p> Conclusion <p>The pSOFA and PELOD2 scores had superior predictive performance for mortality. Given the relative unavailability of items and clinical operability, the pSOFA score should be recommended as an optimal tool for acute organ dysfunction in pediatric sepsis patients. Elevated lactate levels are related to a greater risk of death from infection in children in the PICU.</p>","author":"Shaojun Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7dd276ac2f2239a6af0c058bfcdd1d6f7e897bd5b7431dd9c41422ba89096a69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
