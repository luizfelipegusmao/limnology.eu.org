From “blob-ology” to high-resolution structure determination technique, it has seen rapid advancements in detector technology as well as algorithm development. It remains, however, very much a brute force technique. Data is collected semi-randomly until the user is satisfied that maximum resolution has been achieved. This can result in long wait times for image processing, as well as the accumulation of large (costly) datasets. Here we discuss how to address optimization of cryoEM SPA from both a sample preparation side, as well as a data processing and data management side in order to increase overall efficiency in structure determination and minimize cost-per-stucture.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"66975fbd90d140f95493f61a59b0fdb2e807e390ada78970fa6ddc1545353271","category":"Environment"}
