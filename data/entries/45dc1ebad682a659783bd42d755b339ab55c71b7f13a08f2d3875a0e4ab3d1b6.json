The FDM process builds parts by adding material layer by layer only where it is needed, saving energy, costs, production time for complex parts, and minimizing waste [<a href=\"#ozae044.630-B1\">1-2</a>]. Fiber reinforcement can significantly enhance the mechanical properties of a polymer material, and depends significantly on the fiber length distribution and fiber orientation distribution of the final part [<a href=\"#ozae044.630-B3\">3</a>]. In this report, we present infill patterns of FDM printed Markforged onyx, nylon filament samples with chopped up carbon fiber (CF) reinforcement. The effects of printing parameters of the FDM samples in relation to surface morphology, microstructure, and void fractions were characterized.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"45dc1ebad682a659783bd42d755b339ab55c71b7f13a08f2d3875a0e4ab3d1b6","category":"Environment"}
