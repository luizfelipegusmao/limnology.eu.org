To evaluate the use of high-iron diets to prevent or reverse channel catfish (<i>Ictalurus punctatus</i>) anaemia of unknown causes, we investigated the expression of these iron-regulatory genes and proteins in channel catfish fed plant-based diets. Catfish fingerlings were fed five diets supplemented with 0 (basal), 125, and 250 mg/kg of either inorganic iron or organic iron for 2 weeks. Ferritin, transferrin, and transferrin receptor I and II mRNA and protein expression levels in fish tissues (liver, intestine, trunk kidney, and head kidney) and plasma were determined. Transferrin (iron transporter) and TfR (I and II) genes were generally highly expressed in fish fed the basal diet compared to those fed the iron-supplemented diets. In contrast, ferritin (iron storage) genes were more expressed in the trunk kidney of fish fed the iron-supplemented diets than in those fed the basal diet. Our results demonstrate that supplementing channel catfish plant-based diets with iron from either organic or inorganic iron sources affected the expression of the iron-regulatory genes and increased body iron status in the fish.</p>","author":"Isaac Buyinza, \nGrace Ramena, \nRebecca Lochmann, \nAmit Sinha, \nMichele Jones","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"3df226bf8a24f4be03c47132a889a5411474be319fbd3a084c9458f79fb461f4","category":"Environment"}
