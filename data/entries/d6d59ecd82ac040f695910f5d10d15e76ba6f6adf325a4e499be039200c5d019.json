{"title":"Epigenetic and gene therapy in human and veterinary medicine","link":"https://academic.oup.com/eep/article/doi/10.1093/eep/dvae006/7668578?rss=1","date":1715299200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Gene therapy is a focus of interest in both human and veterinary medicine, especially in recent years due to the potential applications of CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Another relatively new approach is that of epigenetic therapy, which involves an intervention based on epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and post-transcription modifications of distinct RNAs. The epigenome results from enzymatic reactions, which regulate gene expression without altering DNA sequences. In contrast to conventional CRISP/Cas9 techniques, the recently established methodology of epigenetic editing mediated by the CRISPR/dCas9 system is designed to target specific genes without causing DNA breaks. Both natural epigenetic processes and epigenetic editing regulate gene expression and thereby contribute to maintaining the balance between physiological functions and pathophysiological states. From this perspective, knowledge of specific epigenetic marks has immense potential in both human and veterinary medicine. For instance, the use of epigenetic drugs (chemical compounds with therapeutic potential affecting the epigenome) seems to be promising for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, and infectious diseases. Also, there is evidence that an epigenetic diet (nutrition-like factors affecting epigenome) should be considered as part of a healthy lifestyle and could contribute to the prevention of pathophysiological processes. In summary, epigenetic-based approaches in human and veterinary medicine have increasing significance in targeting aberrant gene expression associated with various diseases. In this case, CRISPR/dCas9, epigenetic targeting, and some epigenetic nutrition factors could contribute to reversing an abnormal epigenetic landscape to a healthy physiological state.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Epigenetics Current Issue","siteHash":"5549213f473d96cee0cf7ca1db1da1a69239cc267977bfd813fd34781f2cddbb","entryHash":"d6d59ecd82ac040f695910f5d10d15e76ba6f6adf325a4e499be039200c5d019","category":"Environment"}
