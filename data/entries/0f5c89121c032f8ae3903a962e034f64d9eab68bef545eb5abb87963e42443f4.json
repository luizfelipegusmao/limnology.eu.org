Global warming over the next century is generally predicted to reduce food web complexity, but this is rarely tested empirically due to the dearth of studies isolating the effects of temperature on complex natural food webs. To overcome this obstacle, we used ‘natural experiments’ across 14 streams in Iceland and Russia, with natural warming of up to 20°C above the coldest stream in each high-latitude region, where anthropogenic warming is predicted to be especially rapid. Using biomass-weighted stable isotope data, we found that community isotopic divergence (a universal, taxon-free measure of trophic diversity) was consistently lower in warmer streams. We also found a clear shift towards greater assimilation of autochthonous carbon, which was driven by increasing dominance of herbivores but without a concomitant increase in algal stocks. Overall, our results support the prediction that higher temperatures will simplify high-latitude freshwater ecosystems and provide the first mechanistic glimpses of how warming alters energy transfer through food webs at intercontinental scales.</p>","author":"Michelle C.
