Objective of the study was to develop a sensitive, robust and simple method for simultaneous analysis of levosulpiride and omeprazole in human plasma and applicability of the method in determination of pharmacokinetics drug-drug interaction. In the presented study, a reversed-phase HPLC-UV method was developed for the simultaneous determination of levosulpiride and omeprazole using pantoprazole as the internal standard. Experimental conditions were optimized and the developed method was validated as per standard guidelines (USP and ICH). Furthermore, the developed method was applied for evaluation of pharmacokinetics drug-drug interaction between levosulpiride (50 mg) and omeprazole (40 mg) in healthy human volunteers. Sharpsil C8 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm), Ultisil C8 column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, 5 μm) and Agilent C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) were evaluated as stationary phase. The best resolution was achieved with Agilent C18 (4.6 x 250 mm, 5 μm) column and was selected for further study. The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of acetonitrile and phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) in 60:40 by volume, and was pumped at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Detector wavelength was set at 280 nm. Levosulpiride and omeprazole were extracted from human plasma with ethyl acetate and dichloromethane (4:1, v/v). The calibration curves for both levosulpiride (5–150 ng/mL) and omeprazole (10–1500 ng/mL) were linear. The lower limit of quantification and limit of detection for levosulpiride were 5 and 2 ng/mL, while for omeprazole these were 10 and 3 ng/mL, respectively. Pharmacokinetics analysis showed that co-administration of omeprazole increased the AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of levosulpiride, while the clearance was reduced. Both the changes were insignificant. Similarly, no significant change in the pharmacokinetic parameters of omeprazole was observed with co-administration of levosulpiride.","author":"Muhammad Hashim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"822e774a4dd1decc97bac9065f62779213eeb608ca27d2a1727d2210b2a7e730","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
