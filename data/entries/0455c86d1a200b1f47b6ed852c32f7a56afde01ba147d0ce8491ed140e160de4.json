Our analysis is based on the application of the sequence of even integers 2,10,16,22,26,28… which is defined as follows: F(0) = 2, for i &gt; 0, F(i) = F(i − 1)+ l, where l is the smallest even integer that is valid for: F(i − 1)+ 2k − 1 ∈ P, for k = 1, 2, . . . l/2-1, F(i − 1)+ 2k − 1 ∉ P, for k = 2l and P is the set of prime numbers. The sequence F answers the question, which are the natural numbers that cannot be expressed as a sum of two primes. We prove that numbers expressed as j = F(i)+ 1 cannot be written as the sum of two primes, for i = 1, 2, ··· .","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0455c86d1a200b1f47b6ed852c32f7a56afde01ba147d0ce8491ed140e160de4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
