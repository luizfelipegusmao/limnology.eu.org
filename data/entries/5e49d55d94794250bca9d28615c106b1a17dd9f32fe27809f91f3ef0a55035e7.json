Dysfunction of lysosomes contributes to a variety of diseases, such as lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) and neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Altering lysosomal activity and examining its impact on the occurrence and development of disease is an important strategy for studying lysosome-related diseases. However, methods to dynamically regulate lysosomal function in living cells or animals are still lacking. Here, we constructed lysosome-localized optogenetic actuators, named lyso-NpHR3.0, lyso-ArchT, and lyso-ChR2, to achieve optogenetic manipulation of lysosomes. These new actuators enable light-dependent control of lysosomal membrane potential, pH, hydrolase activity, degradation, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in living cells. Notably, lyso-ChR2 activation induces autophagy through the mTOR pathway, promotes Aβ clearance in an autophagy-dependent manner in cellular models, and alleviates Aβ-induced paralysis in the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> model of Alzheimer’s disease. Our lysosomal optogenetic actuators supplement the optogenetic toolbox and provide a method to dynamically regulate lysosomal physiology and function in living cells and animals.","author":"Wenping Zeng","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"5e49d55d94794250bca9d28615c106b1a17dd9f32fe27809f91f3ef0a55035e7","category":"Environment"}
