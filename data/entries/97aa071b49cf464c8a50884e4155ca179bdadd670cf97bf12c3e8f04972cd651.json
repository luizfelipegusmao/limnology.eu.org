{"title":"Associated Gas Recovery Integrated with Solar Power for Produced Water Treatment: Techno-Economic &amp; Environmental Impact Analyses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1526/v1","date":1726742389000,"content":"Excess associated gas from unconventional wells is typically flared while excess produced water is injected underground. In this work, flare gas recovery is integrated with produced water desalination and a solar pre-heater. The solar module with a beam splitter preheats the produced water. Aspen Plus was used to perform process modeling as well as to estimate capital and operating costs. The Solar-Flare Gas RDcovery- desalination (Solar-FGRD) process can conserve water resources and reduce the brine injection by 77%. The accompanying solar farm results in excess solar electricity for exporting to the grid.\nThe process burner combustion efficiency (CE) is 99.8% with the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.99% for methane as opposed to the flare CE of 80-98% (and a methane DRE of 91-98%). The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for CO2 and methane in terms of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) can be reduced by 45 % for US North Dakota &amp; Texas flaring and 13% for North Sea flaring by employing the Solar- FGRD process. The comprehensive financial analysis demonstrates the financial-economic feasibility of the investment project with or without tax credits. Best-case and worst-case scenarios provide a realistic range that investors can consider before making investment decisions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97aa071b49cf464c8a50884e4155ca179bdadd670cf97bf12c3e8f04972cd651","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
