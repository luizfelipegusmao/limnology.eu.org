{"title":"Fetal Splenic Artery Pulsatility Index May Predict the Need for Neonatal Intensive Care in Gestational Diabetes Class A1 Cases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1608/v1","date":1711552322000,"content":"The fetal splenic artery pulsatility index (PI) is a parameter that reflects fetal well-being and has been used as a predictor of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value of splenic artery PI in GDM class A1 cases for NICU admission. In this  prospective case controlled study, only sixty single pregnancy cases diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus class A1 were evaluated. Fetal splenic artery Doppler parameters Peak systolic velocity (PSV), Pulsatility index (PI), Resistivity index (RI)  and  End diastolic velocity (EDV) were measured in all cases. The rate of re-quirement of need of neanoatal intensive care unit was noted. In cases with need fetal intensive care, fetal splenic PI index was found to be statistically significantly lower than in healthy cases without it (0.94 ± 0.29 vs. 1.70 ± 0.53, respectively, p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51e8c77b72097bad4b3a0c02d15ab4201657549e2f4b49bd23512a503db32d7a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
