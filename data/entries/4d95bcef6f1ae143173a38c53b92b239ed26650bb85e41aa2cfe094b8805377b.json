This structure can provide details on paleoecological, paleoenvironmental and paleopathological aspects of a species. However, characterization of tartar in <i>N. platensis</i> is lacking. The aim of this study was to provide a macromorphological characterization of tartar on <i>N. platensis</i> molars, and evaluate its prevalence, distribution patterns and severity. A total of 117 molariforms from Brazilian Quaternary fossiliferous assemblages were analyzed. Thirty-five (29.9%) molars presented tartar. The majority displayed moderate severity. Calculus was present at least on one inteloph(id) of each molar, and prevailed on the posterior region. It predominated on lower and third molars. Adult individuals showed a predominance compared to juveniles. These patterns in <i>N. platensis</i> are probably due to the susceptible oral environment, molar morphology, mature age and tooth replacement. These results suggest that <i>N. platensis</i> and probably other proboscideans were relatively susceptible to tartar development.</p>","author":"Ana Clara Fonseca De Paiva, \nLaís Alves‐Silva, \nFernando Henrique De Souza Barbosa","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Quaternary Science: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e4cb264adfd99de4695eda5f992d61d2819971c444b4237b1e7b12202742678e","entryHash":"4d95bcef6f1ae143173a38c53b92b239ed26650bb85e41aa2cfe094b8805377b","category":"Environment"}
