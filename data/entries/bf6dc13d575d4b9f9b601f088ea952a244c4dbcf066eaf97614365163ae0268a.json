{"title":"Lymphovascular Invasion in Gastric Cancer&mdash;Important or Unimportant?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0494/v1","date":1715215893000,"content":"Introduction: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. It is a very aggressive and heterogeneous tumor. GC does not cause symptoms, so it is often diagnosed in an advanced stage and associated with poor prognosis. Despite new treatment options, it still remains a therapeutic problem. An important element determining the method of treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) is the assessment of lymph node metastases in preoperative and postoperative imaging and/or histopathological examination.Aim: The assessment of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in histopathological examination in patients with LAGC after gastrectomy. The groups of patients were divided into patients who received preoperative chemotherapy, patients without preoperative chemotherapy, and all patients. Additionally, we assessed the correlation between the presence of LVI and the number of lymph nodes collected during gastrectomy.Material and method: We collected patients with histologically confirmed GC after gastrectomy. The collected samples were divided into three subgroups: patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), patients without NAC, and all patients. Histopathological examination assessed the presence of LVI infiltration. We then assessed the correlation between the presence of LVI  and the presence of lymph node metastasis in GC. Additionally, we assessed the correlation between LVI and the number of lymph nodes evaluated in patients in each group. The statistical analyses were performed using Statistica v13.3 and Microsoft Excel 2021. The significance limit was set at p&lt;0.05.Results:The presence of LVI strongly correlated with node involvement, and the result was statistically significant in all patients and the group of patients treated with NAC. The difference was not statistically significant in the group not treated by NAC. Additionally, we did not observe a correlation between the presence of LVI and the number of metastatic lymph nodes in GC.Summary and Conclusions: The presence of LVI in a patient with GC indicates a high probability of lymph node metastasis, which should translate into therapeutic procedures. Assessment of LVI may help identify potential patients with lymph node metastases, particularly in patients undergoing endoscopic resection without planned lymphadenectomy. It is advisable to expand research on a larger scale in order to establish clear standards in this area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf6dc13d575d4b9f9b601f088ea952a244c4dbcf066eaf97614365163ae0268a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
