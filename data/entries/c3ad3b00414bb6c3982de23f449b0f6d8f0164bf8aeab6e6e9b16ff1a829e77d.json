{"title":"Simplified Gravity Load Collapse Dynamic Analysis of Old-Type Reinforced Concrete Frames","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1069/v1","date":1728912345000,"content":"The results of shaking table tests from the literature on a one-story, two-bay reinforced concrete frame experiencing both shear and axial failures are compared with nonlinear dynamic analyses using simplified models designed for assessing the collapse of older reinforced concrete structures. To simulate the nonlinear behavior of columns—both those prone to shear failure and those more flexure-dominant—the one-component beam model was utilized. This model consists of a linear elastic element linked in series to a rigid-plastic linear hardening spring at each end, representing a concentrated plasticity element. To capture strength degradation through path-dependent plasticity, a negative kinematic hardening model was used, connecting points at shear and axial failure, respectively. Shear failure points were determined via pushover analysis of the shear-critical columns using Phaethon software. While the simplified model yielded reasonable predictions of the overall frame response and lateral strength degradation, the reduced computational cost of the modeling approach led to some deviations between the calculated and measured shear forces and drifts during portions of the time-history response.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c3ad3b00414bb6c3982de23f449b0f6d8f0164bf8aeab6e6e9b16ff1a829e77d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
