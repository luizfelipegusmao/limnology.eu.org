The results of anthropometric measurements were compared between patients with different outcomes.

In the Cox analyses based on all individuals, all models proved that the patients with higher AC, as well as CC and BS, may have a lower risk of 1-year mortality. Similarly, in the logistics analysis, AC, CC, and BS were proven to have strong predictive ability for 6-month and 1-year mortality in females and overall individuals. However, the predictive value of the eight common anthropometric measurements in free walking ability is not significant.</p> Conclusion <p>AC, CC, and BS may have strong predictive ability for 6-month and 1-year mortality in all individuals and females.</p>","author":"Liqiang Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8eda3cd82dcab9e9af0073002a03afb1965d7adcec8b5dee0bd447abd489efdf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
