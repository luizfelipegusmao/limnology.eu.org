{"title":"Rare Earth Element Content in Hair Samples of Children Living in the Vicinity of the Kola Peninsula Mining Site and Nervous Systems Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1306/v1","date":1721111718000,"content":"The aim of this study is to assess of rare earth elements (REE) content in hair samples in children, living in Lovozero village,  near  REE mining site, and possible effects of REEs on the prevalence of nervous system diseases in the Lovozersky district (Murmansk region, Kola Peninsula). School-age children (53 persons) were recruited for analysis of REE content in their hair samples. REEs (Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu) content was estimated by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Analysis of REE content in the hair of children living in the Russia, Kazakhstan and China indicates REEs intake from environment. A possible contribution of REEs to the  nervous system disorders is supported by the link between REE content in the hair samples of children, living near REE mining (China) and  by manifesting cognitive disorders in these children. It also turn out that highest prevalence of the nervous system diseases in children 15-17 years old manifested in the Lovozersky district then in other area in the Murmansk region. The paper discusses the possible contribution of REEs to the prevalence of episodic paroxysmal disorders (G40-G47), cerebral palsy (G80-G83), epilepsy and status epilepticus (G40-G41).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a7ccc181c9b2241d09dd45110b81e6e86a33b436c5c7eea3505f33923b6127d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
