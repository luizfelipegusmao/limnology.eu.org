{"title":"The Role of the CX3CR1-CX3CL1 Axis in Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection and the Triggered Immune Response","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0855/v1","date":1720684548000,"content":"Respiratory Syncytial Virus is a common respiratory pathogen known for causing respiratory illnesses, ranging from mild symptoms to severe lower respiratory tract infections in infants and the elderly. This virus is responsible for one-third of pneumonia deaths in the pediatric population, but there are currently only a few effective vaccines and pharmacological treatments. The frac-talkine (CX3CL1) receptor (CX3CR1) is a co-receptor for RSV expressed by airway epithelial cells and a diversity of immune cells. Recent research has highlighted the role of CX3CR1 in the host immune response to RSV infection, and its potential role in the development of an efficient vaccine and novel treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f349f9fa9e905d2771da6ba013a99d9e061e615eafeccad6ac2a8b95e8df6e4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
