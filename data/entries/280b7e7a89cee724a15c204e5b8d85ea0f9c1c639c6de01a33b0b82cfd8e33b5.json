Applying machine learning models for Arabic and Aramaic scripts such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) each model was used to compare the phylogenies. The methodology was utilized with a dataset containing Arabic and Aramaic scripts, demonstrating its relevance in a range of phylogenetic analyses. Results emphasize the essential role of feature selection by DNNs is outperforming other models in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Equal Error Rate (EER) across various datasets and fold sizes. Additionally, SVM and RF models show important understandings, advantages and limits of each approach within the context of phylogenetic analysis. This method not only simplifies the tree structures but also enhances their Consistency Index. Therefore offering a robust framework for evolutionary studies. The findings highlight the applications of machine learning in phylogenetics suggesting a path toward accurate and efficient evolutionary analyses and adding a deeper understanding of evolutionary relationships.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"280b7e7a89cee724a15c204e5b8d85ea0f9c1c639c6de01a33b0b82cfd8e33b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
