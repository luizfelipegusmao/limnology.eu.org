{"title":"The Future of Destruction: Analyzing the Potential Impact of Entropy on Technological Evolution in AGI, Autonomous Drones, and Applied Robotics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1762/v1","date":1719395389000,"content":"The rapid convergence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), autonomous drones, and applied robotics presents a transformative opportunity for many sectors. However, this advancement also raises critical ethical and existential questions, particularly in warfare. This paper explores the concept of entropy as a metaphor for the potential disorder introduced by these increasingly complex technologies. We examine the risks of AGI surpassing human control in conflict situations, where autonomous decision-making could have disastrous consequences. We then analyze autonomous drones, scrutinizing their impact on warfare tactics and the ethical dilemmas surrounding independent, real-time decision-making. Finally, we investigate applied robotics in military operations, focusing on the delicate balance between enhanced capabilities and the potential for uncontrollable systems. Through a multidisciplinary lens, drawing on technology ethics, military strategy, and AI safety, this paper utilizes the concept of entropy to highlight the need for caution in developing these technologies. We propose a scientifically grounded and ethically sound framework to guide policymakers, technologists, and ethicists in navigating the path between innovation and global stability. This framework concludes with recommendations for responsible development and deployment strategies that can mitigate the risks associated with these powerful tools.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"219a083eb688ceb1290fbee694f11cf9f21893f6435202c55942fd808d2f7719","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
