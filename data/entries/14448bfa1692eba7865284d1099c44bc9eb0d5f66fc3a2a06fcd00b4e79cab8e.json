{"title":"Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Its Oxidative Stress-Induced Pathologies and Redox Bioregulation through Low-Dose Medical Ozone. A Systematic Review.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0029/v1","date":1714541358000,"content":"Our hypothesis that controlled ozone applications interfere into the redox balance of the biological organism (first published in 1998 with a preclinical trial on protecting the liver from CCl4 intoxication), has been verified over the last 2 decades in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced mitochondrial pathologies, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, aging processes, diabetes-2 and in prevention of intoxications. Low-dose ozone acts as a redox bioregulator: The restoration of the disturbed redox balance is comprehensible in a number of preclinical and clinical studies by a remarkable increase of the antioxidant repair markers, here mainly shown as glutathione increase and a reduction in oxidative stress markers, mainly malondialdehyde. The mechanism of action is shown, relevant data are displayed, evaluated and comprehensively discussed: The repair side of the equilibrium increases by 21% up to 140% compared to the non-ozone treated groups and depending on the indication; the stress markers are simultaneously reduced, the redox system regains its balance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"14448bfa1692eba7865284d1099c44bc9eb0d5f66fc3a2a06fcd00b4e79cab8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
