Water saturation, pH, electrical conductivity, calcium carbonate equivalent, available potassium, available phosphorus, and organic matter analyses were implemented for inorganic materials. The elemental contents of the components for studied inorganic materials were obtained using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Furthermore, natural and artificial radionuclides of studied inorganic materials were calculated using gamma-ray spectrometry. The pumice has the highest <sup>226</sup>Ra activity concentration, and the zeolite has the highest <sup>232</sup>Th and <sup>40</sup>K activity concentrations. The <sup>137</sup>Cs activity concentration is the maximum for perlite and it is the minimum for expanded clay aggregate. The zeolite has the highest radiological hazard parameters whereas those are the smallest for the rock wool. The Fe, Na, B, Ca, K, Si, P, S, and Mn are the primary components of the inorganic materials used in soilless agriculture. Consequently, this study is contributed to environmental and health problems of livings. In the future, transferred radionuclides from plant to livings assessment can be carried out for these inorganic materials used in soilless agriculture.</p>","author":"Canel Eke, \nReyhan Ozaydin Ozkara","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"3acf5cc6aed36bd05e8a1d9c7513217a9dccaefa0bdc0ee2ecd339bf02a4a100","category":"Environment"}
