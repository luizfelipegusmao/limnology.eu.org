{"title":"Development of Worth Estimation and Key Target Selection Methods for Effective VE","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0860/v1","date":1710413714000,"content":"VE is a powerful technique for analyzing a design with a focus on functionality, reducing costs, and increasing value. However, in order to proceed with the design of VE, the theoretical basis for the VE target selection process, which must be preceded in the preparation stage, is lacking, and as a result, it is difficult to verify the most effective target selection. Thus, a theoretical basis is needed. In this study, we intend to quantify the WORTH value of the COST TO WORTH technique and present an objective model of the target selection method using the derived Value Index (VI). For this purpose, cost worth (WORTHC) was calculated based on the performance data of 1,008 cases of 15 building types provided by the Domestic Public Procurement Service and the share of 83 detailed processes in 7 fields. Then, a survey was conducted targeting the ordering companies, and the final worth (WORTHF) was calculated by multiplying the derived customer value (WORTHV ) weight for each detailed work type. We calculated the Value Index (VI) by comparing COST and WORTHF for each detailed construction type of the VE project and developed a model to select construction types that exceed the VI standard value derived using the standard error of the population. Both cost experts and non-cost experts can use the developed model to specify the VE target selection criteria in order to easily select the key target, objectively sort the values that serve as the basis for calculating the value index and make it possible to more easily select the VE target selection criteria based on theoretical evidence. Also, the model can be used to obtain effective detailed design VE results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49d863a95c65c44bc6ec9f5b379f5435e83bd70513aebfbd152bf2caf0cec3d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
