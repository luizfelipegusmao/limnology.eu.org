{"title":"The role of ultraviolet radiation in the flavor formation during drying processing of Pacific saury (Cololabis saira)","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13640?af=R","date":1718021000000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Traditional sun-drying aquatic products are popular and recognized by customers, owing to their unique flavor and long-term preservation. However, the product quality and production efficiency cannot be guaranteed. <i>Cololabis saira</i> is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, which are susceptible to hyperoxidation during the drying process. This study aimed to make clear the role of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in flavor formation during drying processes of <i>Cololabis saira</i> to develop a modern drying technology.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Lipid oxidation analysis revealed that moderate hydrolytic oxidation occurred in the UV-assisted cold-air drying group due to the combined influence of UV and cold-air circulation, resulting in the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value being higher than that of cold-air drying group but lower than the natural drying group. Hexanal, heptanal, <i>cis</i>-4-heptenal, octanal, nonanal, (<i>trans</i>,<i>trans</i>)-2,4-heptadienal, (<i>trans</i>,<i>trans</i>)-2,6-nonanedial, 1-octen-3-ol, heptanol, 2,3-pentanedione, 3,5-octadien-2-one and trimethylamine were identified as the characteristic flavor odor-active compounds present in all <i>Cololabis saira</i> samples. Yet, during the natural drying process, sunlight promoted the lipid oxidation, resulting in the highest degree of lipid oxidation among three drying methods. Light and heat promoted lipid oxidation in <i>Cololabis saira</i> prepared through natural drying process, leading to a large accumulation of volatile compounds, such as 3-methylbutyraldehyde, 2,3-pentanedione, 1-propanol, and 3-pentanone. Cold air circulation inhibited lipid oxidation to some extent, resulting in a blander flavor profile. More <i>cis</i>-4-heptenal, <i>cis</i>-2-heptenal, octanal and 2-ethylfuran accumulated during the UV-assisted cold-air drying process, enriching its greasy flavor and burnt flavor.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>UV-assisted cold-air drying could promote moderate lipid oxidation, which is beneficial for improving product flavor. To sum up, UV radiation played a crucial role in the flavor formation during the drying process of <i>Cololabis saira</i>. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ling Zhao, \nLin Wang, \nRong Cao, \nQi Liu, \nDong Su, \nYating Zhang, \nYueqin Yu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"5cbfc3e8c77c5c95bb31e7aa4167ba62ccbdedb0fb4bee3534a97a5fc35d708c","category":"Environment"}
