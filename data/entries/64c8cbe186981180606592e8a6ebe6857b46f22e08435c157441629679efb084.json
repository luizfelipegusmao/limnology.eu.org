{"title":"Cancer, Deuterium, and Gut Microbes: A Novel Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2139/v1","date":1727388866000,"content":"Deuterium is a non-radioactive isotope of hydrogen, containing a neutron as well as a proton, which makes it twice as heavy as hydrogen. Deuterium is a natural element found at 156 parts per million in seawater. Human metabolism employs clever strategies to minimize the amount of deuterium in mitochondrial water, because it causes a stutter in ATPase pumps, introducing excess reactive oxygen species and inefficiencies in ATP production. Gut microbes produce hydrogen gas that is 80% depleted in deuterium (deupleted), and this gas is recycled into organic matter that supplies deupleted nutrients to the host, such as acetate, butyrate, formate, methionine, and choline. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with many chronic diseases, most notably, cancer.  Dehydrogenases are flavoproteins that typically have a high deuterium kinetic isotope effect, and they supply deupleted protons to NAD+ to produce NADH, which supplies protons to the ATPase pumps. Here, we examine the unique metabolic policies of cancer cells in a new light, and we propose that a tumor may arise as a strategy to help repair the mitochondria of tumor-resident immune cells overburdened with deuterium. While lactate accumulation in the tumor microenvironment promotes tumor growth, it also provides a valuable deuterium depleted nutrient to the tumor-resident immune cells. We provide strong evidence that deuterium depleted water (DDW) is a promising treatment for cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64c8cbe186981180606592e8a6ebe6857b46f22e08435c157441629679efb084","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
