Feeding en route: Prey availability and traits influence prey selection by an avian predator on migration. <i>Journal of Animal Ecology</i>. Diet selection plays a key role in the eco-evolutionary dynamics of animals, exhibiting substantial variability across species, environments and seasons. The complex interplay between movement capability, hunting strategies, habitat use, prey traits and availability shapes the foraging patterns of avian predators. However, detailed information on how these birds exploit their extensive territories remains limited. In this study, Bourbour et al. utilised a novel integration of eDNA metabarcoding and citizen science to explore predator–prey interactions between migrating sharp-shinned hawks (<i>Accipiter striatus</i>) and an ephemeral avian prey community along North America's Pacific flyway. The research identified 1396 detections from the diet (65 species) of 588 migrating sharp-shinned hawks. Hawks' diet composition correlated with prey abundance indices sourced from the eBird database throughout the migration season, highlighting the significant impact of prey availability—shaped by migration tendency, flocking behaviour, and habitat—on raptor-songbird interactions. Notably, the study also found significant differences in prey size between male and female hawks, indicating that sexual dimorphism has led to diverse foraging strategies during migration. These findings underscore the potential of combining eDNA metabarcoding with citizen science to deepen our understanding of the foraging ecology of highly mobile and wide-ranging birds, as well as to monitor complex and vast ecosystems.</p>","author":"Julián Padró","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Animal Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"f972b3d77fac21002287eba655b32ce98ce44eaf7af59ef5bf44597986b2c27f","entryHash":"f467ae1ed1d578ec04dcf0a5b8ac9ebdfec08c52d2247536831e3287296e578c","category":"Environment"}
