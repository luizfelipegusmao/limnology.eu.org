{"title":"Developing lifestyle intervention program for pre-hypertensive patients; consensus building using a modified Delphi approach","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311766","date":1728568800000,"content":"<p>by Danish Hassan, Syed Shakil Ur Rehman, Saira Khalid, Imran Tipu, Muhammad Husnain</p>\r\nBackground <p>Prehypertension is a preclinical state of hypertension which leads to an increased likelihood of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease as well as target organ damage. Addressing pre-hypertension through early lifestyle interventions is crucial to mitigating these detrimental effects and improving long-term health outcomes. So, the main objective of this study is to develop a lifestyle intervention program (LSIP) for the management of prehypertension using consensus building approach.</p> Methods <p>It was a three round online modified Delphi study with 70 members panellists. All panellists had an experience of prehypertension either as patients (n = 30) or professionals (n = 40). Round 1 included initial recommendations developed from a previous systematic review and metanalysis, which were rated by panellists for their importance on a 5-point Likert scale. Panellists could also suggest additional items in the Round 1. Round 2 and 3 included all items from the Round 1 with new items suggested by the panellists. Data was analysed descriptively using SPSS version 29. All items receiving at least 70% of all respondents combined rating of ‘Important’ and ‘Very Important’ in Round 3 were included in the final set of recommendations.</p> Results <p>Fifty-one panellists (80.9%) (patients = 25, professionals = 26) completed Round 3. Twenty-six recommendation items were included in the Round 1. Twenty new items were added in Round 2 with 46 total items in Round 2 and 3. Thirty-five of these items reached consensus in Round 3. The final set of recommendation comprised of 15 educational. 10 dietary, and 10 exercise recommendations.</p> Conclusion <p>This modified Delphi study developed a comprehensive LSIP for the prevention of prehypertension, incorporating a holistic approach with educational, dietary, and exercise components aimed at the general population. Previously established standards of care (SOC) for managing prehypertension varied significantly and often provided fragmented guidance particularly on physical activity and education. This preventive model offers a novel and scalable approach for early intervention in prehypertension, potentially reducing reliance on medications and improving long-term health outcomes.</p>","author":"Danish Hassan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d103bfbedf41073da07cbd37aaeea8b7a553d4a13d36f2e49b0ef419fb91f61a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
