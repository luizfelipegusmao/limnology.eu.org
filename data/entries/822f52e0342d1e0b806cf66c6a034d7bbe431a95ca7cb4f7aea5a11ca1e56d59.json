{"title":"336 Effects of feeding an immunomodulatory feed additive (NutraGen) on metabolite concentrations and cortisol production in calves following exposure to a combination bovine respiratory disease challenge","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/64/7757213?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Two 89-d experiments (Exp 1 and Exp 2) evaluated the effects of feeding an immunomodulatory feed additive (NutraGen; NG) in calves following exposure to bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) on d -3 and <span>Mannheimia haemolytica</span> (MH) infection on d 0. For each experiment, steers [body weight (BW) = 251 ± 38.2 kg)] were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 treatments. Treatments included a placebo (CON; Exp 1 n = 5; Exp 2 n = 5), a placebo fed from d -18 to d -3 followed by NG fed from d -3 to d 28 (CHLG; Exp 1 n = 5; Exp 2 n = 6), and NG fed from d -18 to d 28 (PREC; Exp 1 n = 6; Exp 2 n = 5). Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.). Animal served as the experimental unit and time served as a repeated measure. Treatment, time, and the treatment × time interaction served as fixed effects. Block was included as a random effect. Multiple treatment × time interactions and time effects occurred for serum glucose, lactate, blood urea nitrogen, and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.003) in both experiments. There was a general trend for serum glucose to decrease over time post-challenge, suggesting increased cellular utilization of glucose in response to the challenge. In Exp 1, treatment effects occurred for serum glucose (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.001) and serum lactate (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.01), where calves assigned to the CHLG treatment displayed the greatest concentrations of the metabolites. Blood urea nitrogen concentrations peaked at h 48 in Exp 1 and h 6 in Exp 2. There were no treatment effects or treatment × time interactions for serum cortisol, hair cortisol, or fecal corticosterone concentrations in either experiment (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.17). There were, however, multiple time effects for serum cortisol, hair cortisol, and fecal corticosterone concentrations in both experiments (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.02), indicating that the challenge directly impacted cortisol and corticosterone production. Serum cortisol steadily increased from h 96 to h 168 in both experiments. Trends in cortisol and corticosterone production were similar in both experiments; however, peak concentration times for these variables occurred later in Exp 2. These data suggest that feeding NG to calves may alter glucose availability and nutrient utilization in response to infection resulting from a bovine respiratory disease challenge.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"822f52e0342d1e0b806cf66c6a034d7bbe431a95ca7cb4f7aea5a11ca1e56d59","category":"Environment"}
