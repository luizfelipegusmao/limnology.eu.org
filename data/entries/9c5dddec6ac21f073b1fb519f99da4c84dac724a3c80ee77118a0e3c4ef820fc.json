The study investigated nitrogen (N) removal, biomass quality, and safety by treating industrial leachate water with a polyculture of local microalgae and bacteria in open raceway ponds, supplied with industrial CO<sub>2</sub> effluent. Total N (TN) removal was higher in spring (1.5 g<sup>−2</sup>d<sup>−1</sup>), due to beneficial light conditions compared to winter and autumn (0.1 and 0.09 g<sup>−2</sup>d<sup>−1</sup>). Light, TN, and N species influenced the microalgal community (dominated by Chlorophyta), while the bacterial community remained stable throughout seasons with a large proportion of cyanobacteria. Winter conditions promoted biomass protein (19.6–26.7%) whereas lipids and carbohydrates were highest during spring (11.4–18.4 and 15.4–19.8%). Biomass toxin and metal content were below safety levels for fodder, but due to the potential presence of toxic strains, biofuels or fertilizer could be suitable applications for the algal biomass.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner points</h2>\n<p>\nMicroalgal removal of nitrogen from leachate water was evaluated in Nordic conditions during winter, spring, and autumn.\nTotal nitrogen removal was highest in spring (1.5 g<sup>−2</sup>d<sup>−1</sup>), due to beneficial light conditions for autotrophic growth.\nUse of local polyculture made the cultivation more stable on a seasonal (light) and short-term (N-species changes) scale.\nToxic elements in produced algal biomass were below legal thresholds for upcycling.\n</p>","author":"Lina Mattsson, \nHanna Farnelid, \nMaurice Hirwa, \nMartin Olofsson, \nFredrik Svensson, \nCatherine Legrand, \nElin Lindehoff","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"9c5dddec6ac21f073b1fb519f99da4c84dac724a3c80ee77118a0e3c4ef820fc","category":"Environment"}
