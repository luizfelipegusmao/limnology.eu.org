{"title":"Single-cell transcriptomics reveals heterogeneity in plant responses to the environment: a focus on biotic and abiotic interactions","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/17/5188/7625476?rss=1","date":1710115200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Biotic and abiotic environmental cues are major factors influencing plant growth and productivity. Interactions with biotic (e.g. symbionts and pathogens) and abiotic (e.g. changes in temperature, water, or nutrient availability) factors trigger signaling and downstream transcriptome adjustments in plants. While bulk RNA-sequencing technologies have traditionally been used to profile these transcriptional changes, tissue homogenization may mask heterogeneity of responses resulting from the cellular complexity of organs. Thus, whether different cell types respond equally to environmental fluctuations, or whether subsets of the responses are cell-type specific, are long-lasting questions in plant biology. The recent breakthrough of single-cell transcriptomics in plant research offers an unprecedented view of cellular responses under changing environmental conditions. In this review, we discuss the contribution of single-cell transcriptomics to the understanding of cell-type-specific plant responses to biotic and abiotic environmental interactions. Besides major biological findings, we present some technical challenges coupled to single-cell studies of plantâ€“environment interactions, proposing possible solutions and exciting paths for future research.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"ed14aae4f52a7132635fa40cd9919035e4a3fa0bea346833ba01964fae3e2b51","category":"Environment"}
