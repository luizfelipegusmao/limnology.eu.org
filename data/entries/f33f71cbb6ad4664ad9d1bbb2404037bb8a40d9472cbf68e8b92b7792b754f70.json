{"title":"High-precision charge analysis in a catalytic nanoparticle by electron holography","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/73/4/301/7637238?rss=1","date":1711670400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The charge state of supported metal catalysts is the key to understand the elementary processes involved in catalytic reactions. However, high-precision charge analysis of the metal catalysts at the atomic level is experimentally challenging. To address this critical challenge, high-sensitivity electron holography has recently been successfully applied for precisely measuring the elementary charges on individual platinum nanoparticles supported on a titanium dioxide surface. In this review, we introduce the latest advancements in high-precision charge analysis and discuss the mechanisms of charge transfer at the metalâ€“support interface. The development of charge measurements is entering a new era, and charge analyses under conditions closer to practical working environments, such as real-time, real-space, and reactive gas environments, are expected to be realized in the near future.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"f33f71cbb6ad4664ad9d1bbb2404037bb8a40d9472cbf68e8b92b7792b754f70","category":"Environment"}
