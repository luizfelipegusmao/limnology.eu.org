{"title":"Crucial Interactions between Altered Plasma Trace Elements and Fatty Acids Unbalance Ratio to Management of Systemic Arterial Hypertension in Diabetic Patients: Focus on Endothelial Dysfunction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1637/v1","date":1721618921000,"content":"The coexistence of SAH with T2DM is a common comorbidity. In this present study, we investigated the link between altered plasma antioxidant trace elements (ATE: Manganese, Selenium, Zinc and Copper) and fatty acids ratio (FAR: polyunsaturated/saturated) imbalance as transition biomarkers between vascular pathology (SAH) to metabolic pathology (T2DM). Our data revealed strong correlation between plasma ATE and FAR profile which is modified during SAH-T2DM association compared to healthy group. This relationship is mediated by lipotoxicity (simultaneously prominent visceral adipose tissue lipolysis, significant flow of non-esterified free fatty acids release, TG-Chol-dyslipidemia, high association of Total SFA, Palmitic acid, Arachidonic acid and PUFA 6/ PUFA 3; drop in tandem of PUFA / SFA and EPA+DHA); oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation confirmed by TAS depletion and MDA raise, concurrently drop of Zn/Cu-SOD, GPx, GSH, Se, Zn, Se/Mn, Zn/Cu; concomitantly enhance Cu, Mn and Fe); endothelial dysfunction (endotheline-1 increase); athero-thrombogenesis risk (concomitantly raise of ApoB100/ApoA1, Ox-LDL, tHcy and Lp(a)) and inflammation (higher of Hs-CRP, Fibrinogen and Ferritin). Our study open to new therapeutic targets and to better dietary management, such as to establish dietary ATE and PUFA 6 / PUFA 3 or PUFA / SFA reference values for atherosclerotic risk prevention in hypertensive-diabetics patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0305c4e3104b99e30a2a606f7bbf57415d862460fda1c41c76f0ff35a6856cfd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
