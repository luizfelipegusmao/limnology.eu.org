{"title":"Unraveling Dry Jigging: Insights into Pulsation, Energy Consumption, and Stratification Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0169/v1","date":1714714928000,"content":"Despite its growing importance as a dry beneficiation method, there is a lack of studies exploring the fundamentals aspects of dry jigging. In this sense, this study focuses on explore some essential aspects of density-based separation in dry jigs, like pulse profile, energy consumption and, especially, stratification over time, also exploring an innovative operational strategy here called “transient pulsation”. The tests were carried out using density tracers distributed across 11 density ranges (0.4-2.4 g/cm³) and employing a base bed (gravel) to analyze their segregation in a pilot-scale dry jig. Pressure drop and active power data were acquired to measure the pulse characteristics and energy consumption. The findings suggest that establishing the dry jigging cycle is more complex than in hydraulic jigs due to the compressibility of air. Stationary pulsation tests revealed an unstable behavior of stratification over time, contrasting with traditional hydraulic jigs, while transient pulsation tests unveiled varied trends in separation quality. Energy consumption analysis underscored the significant role of the blower drive. These insights have the potential to inform operational enhancements in dry jigging.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e52424a3b09267744084ee1d4d3e801832835365c6166875a6cb8d5394515de2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
