Paired with a fast, flexible scan control system (Digiscan3), multipass electron counted spectrum imaging (SI) may be performed with continuous drift tracking and zero dead time [<a href=\"#ozae044.815-B2\">2</a>]. As such, this configuration is ideal for high time resolution <span>in-situ</span> (scanning) transmission electron microscopy. Despite these advances, compromises remain when trying to achieve both high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution simultaneously with a finite electron dose. For example, scanning high pixel densities to improve spatial resolution increases the time per frame while cycling through multiple stimuli and acquisition modalities increases the number of frames or passes required dramatically. Simple manual control and data acquisition renders the experiment intractable.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3d0b6864a3179c658e1d29b83c45e8b7a35637ffd698d27db61304248743521c","category":"Environment"}
