{"title":"Local Haemostasis in the Contemporary Oral Surgery: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1987/v1","date":1721886832000,"content":"Abstract: Achieving effective haemostasis is crucial for successful outcomes and optimal patient care in contemporary oral surgery. Control of bleeding is essential in procedures like extractions, implant placements, periodontal surgeries, and soft tissue interventions. Efficient management ensures a clear surgical field, reduces post-operative complications, and promotes healing. Local haemostatic agents are essential tools for oral surgeons, offering targeted and controlled methods to achieve haemostasis. These agents include diverse materials and technologies, each with unique mechanisms of action suited to specific surgical scenarios. This review explores the spectrum of local haemostatic agents in contemporary oral surgery, focusing on their efficacy, safety, and practical utility. By examining the characteristics and clinical performance of various haemostatic agents, this review provides valuable insights to guide dentists and oral surgeons in selecting the most appropriate agent for specific situations. A literature search in electronic databases such as Medscape, PubMed-Medline, Science Direct, and EBSCO Host identified 46 publications from 1990 to 2023. This comprehensive examination aims to enhance understanding of local haemostatic agents and their role in advancing the standards of care in contemporary oral surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3840dfe0cd4afa02f9d56d0178cf03600088770997c8588833a574fa24765211","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
