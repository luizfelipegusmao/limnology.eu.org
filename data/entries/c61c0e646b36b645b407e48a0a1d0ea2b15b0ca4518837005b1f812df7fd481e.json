{"title":"Dynamic changes in aromas and precursors of edible fungi juice: mixed lactic acid bacteria fermentation enhances flavor characteristics","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13681?af=R","date":1719050631000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) fermentation technology has been increasingly used in the deep processing of edible fungi. However, the flavor profiles of edible fungi products after mixed LAB fermentation have received less attention and how aromas changes during the mixed LAB fermentation are still open questions. In the present study, fermented <i>Hericium erinaceus</i> and <i>Tremella fuciformi</i>s compound juice (FHTJ) was prepared by mixed LAB strains. We aimed to systematically monitor the dynamic changes of aromas and precursors throughout the fermentation process and a data-driven association network analysis was used to tentatively illustrate the mechanisms of formation between aromas and their precursors.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Mixed LAB fermentation could enrich the aroma profile of FHTJ, reducing the unpleasant flavors such as nonanal and 1-octen-3-ol, as well as increasing the floral flavors such as ethyl acetate and α-pinene. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis and relative odor activity values revealed that 11 volatile chemicals were recognized as aroma-active markers. Volcano plot analysis showed that 3-octen-2-one (green flavor) was the key aroma-active marker in each stage, which was down-regulated in fermentation stages I, II and IV, whereas it was up-regulated in stage III. 3-Octen-2-one was significantly negatively correlated with organic acids, particularly pyruvate (<i>r</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = −0.89). Ethyl caprylate (floral flavor) was up-regulated in the late fermentation stage, and showed a negative correlation with sugar alcohols and a positive correlation with organic acids, especially tartaric acid (<i>r</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = 0.96).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study demonstrates the beneficial effect of mixed LAB fermentation on flavor characteristics, providing guidance for fermented edible fungi juice flavor quality monitoring and control. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Hailan Sun, \nJiaxin Du, \nXingyue Yan, \nXiao Chen, \nLiyan Zhao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"c61c0e646b36b645b407e48a0a1d0ea2b15b0ca4518837005b1f812df7fd481e","category":"Environment"}
