Aim of the study: to study the relationship between the concentration of sex hor-mone-binding globulin in the blood serum and the age of the man, the level of total and free testosterone. A single-center retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted. The results of laboratory tests of 162 male patients aged from 18 to 56 years (median - 34 years) were analyzed. Methods: The level of total testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) was deter-mined by chemiluminescent immunoassay. The level of free testosterone was determined by the calculation method according to Vermeullen. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Sta-tistics v23. Results: Correlation analysis did not reveal a significant relationship between age and SHBG levels, as well as between age and total testosterone levels. Serum SHBG concentration showed a significant (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6aa65ceb7c9770dce318b1b7a1bf8106ae853f3a819ee456961da34ad3894b01","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
