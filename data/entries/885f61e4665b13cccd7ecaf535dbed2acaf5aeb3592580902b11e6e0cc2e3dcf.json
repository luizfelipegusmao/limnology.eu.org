{"title":"Simultaneous Laparoscopic Surgery for Esophageal Achalasia Combined with Epiphrenic Diverticulum: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0403/v1","date":1715118265000,"content":"We report a case in which a 74-year-old man suffering from esophageal achalasia complicated with epiphrenic esophageal diverticulum was successfully treated with a simultaneous laparoscopic surgery. The gentleman was referred with symptoms suggestive of a passage disorder in lower esophagus from 5 years. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrated an epiphrenic diverticulum at the left wall of the lower esophagus, and esophagography led to the suspicion of a combined esophageal achalasia. A simultaneous laparoscopic surgery, with an abdominal approach was performed in which, following the opening of the esophageal hiatus, the diverticular wall was separated from the mediastinal organs and diverticulectomy was performed with linear staplers. After Heller’s myotomy, Dor’s fundoplication was subsequently performed in which both incisional line of muscle layer and the suturing line of diverticulectomy were wrapped by the fornix of stomach to make up for the wall strength and avoid the suture leakage. It was theoretically considered logical and effective to reinforce this vulnerable site with Dor’s fundoplication. He had an uneventful recovery and a rapid relief from symptoms following surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"885f61e4665b13cccd7ecaf535dbed2acaf5aeb3592580902b11e6e0cc2e3dcf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
