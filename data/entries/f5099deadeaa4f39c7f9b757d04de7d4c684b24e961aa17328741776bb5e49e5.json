We performed an electrophysiological characterization of wild-type and dystrophic myoblasts/myocytes to shed light on the relationship between dystrophin loss and ion channel activity during myogenesis with the final aim to identify new biomarkers and drug targets in regenerative medicine approaches.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Myogenesis is essential for skeletal muscle formation, growth, and regeneration and can be altered in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an X-linked disorder due to the absence of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin. Ion channels play a pivotal role in muscle differentiation and interact with the dystrophin complex. To investigate ion channel involvement in myogenesis in dystrophic settings, we performed electrophysiological characterization of two immortalized mouse cell lines, wild-type (WT) H2K-2B4 and the dystrophic (DYS) H2K-SF1, and measured gene expression of differentiation markers and ion channels. Inward and outward currents/density increased as differentiation progressed in both WT and DYS cells. However, day-11 DYS cells showed higher (27%) inward current density with an increased expression ratio of <i>Scn5a</i>/<i>Scn4a</i> and decreased (48%) barium-sensitive outward current compared to WT. Furthermore, day-11 DYS cells showed more positive resting membrane potential (+10Â mV) and lower membrane capacitance (50%) compared to WT. DYS cells also had reduced <i>Myog</i> and <i>Myf5</i> expression at days 6 and 11. Overall, ion channel profile and myogenesis appeared altered in DYS cells. These results are a first step in validating ion channels as potential drug targets to ameliorate muscle degeneration in DMD settings and as differentiation biomarkers in innovative platforms.</p>","author":"Alessandro Giovanni Cerchiara, \nPaola Imbrici, \nRaffaella Quarta, \nEnrica Cristiano, \nBrigida Boccanegra, \nErika Caputo, \nDominic J.
