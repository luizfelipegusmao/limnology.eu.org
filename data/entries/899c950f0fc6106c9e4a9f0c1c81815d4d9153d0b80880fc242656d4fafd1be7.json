{"title":"The immune landscape and prognostic analysis of CXCL8 immune‐related genes in cervical squamous cell carcinoma","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24283?af=R","date":1712753108000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC), one of the most common malignancies in women, imposes a significant burden on women's health worldwide. Despite extensive research, the molecular and pathogenic mechanisms of cervical squamous cell carcinoma and CESC remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the immune-related genes, immune microenvironment infiltration, and prognosis of CESC, providing a theoretical basis for guiding clinical treatment. Initially, by mining four gene sets and immune-related gene sets from public databases, 14 immune-related genes associated with CESC were identified. Through univariate and multivariate COX regression analyses, as well as lasso regression analysis, four CESC-independent prognostic genes were identified, and a prognostic model was constructed, dividing them into high and low-risk groups. The correlation between these genes and immune cells and immune functions were explored through ssGSEA enrichment analysis, revealing a close association between the high-risk group and processes such as angiogenesis and epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, using public databases and qRT-PCR experiments, significant differences in CXCL8 expression between normal cervical cells and cervical cancer cells were discovered. Subsequently, a CXCL8 knockdown plasmid was constructed, and the efficiency of CXCL8 knockdown was validated in two CESC cell lines, MEG-01 and HCE-1. Through CCK-8, scratch, and Transwell assays, it was confirmed that CXCL8 knockdown could inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration abilities of CESC cells. Targeting CXCL8 holds promise for personalized therapy for CESC, providing a strong theoretical basis for achieving clinical translation.</p>","author":"Xiaoqian Zhang, \nJian Yang, \nQianqian Feng, \nLiping Gu, \nGongzhao Qin, \nChen Cheng, \nShunyu Hou, \nZhouhong Shi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"899c950f0fc6106c9e4a9f0c1c81815d4d9153d0b80880fc242656d4fafd1be7","category":"Environment"}
