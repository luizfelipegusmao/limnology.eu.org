{"title":"Pediatric Meningeal Diseases: What Radiologists Need to Know","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2098/v1","date":1727352025000,"content":"Evaluating altered mental status and suspected meningeal disorders in children often begins with imaging, typically before a lumbar puncture. The challenge is that meningeal enhancement is a common finding across a range of pathologies, making diagnosis complex. This review proposes a categorization of meningeal diseases based on their predominant imaging characteristics. It includes a detailed description of the clinical and imaging features of various conditions that lead to leptomeningeal or pachymeningeal enhancement in children and adolescents.\n\nThese conditions encompass infectious meningitis (viral, bacterial, tuberculous, algal, and fungal), autoimmune diseases (such as anti-MOG demyelination, neurosarcoidosis, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis, and NMDA-related encephalitis), primary and secondary tumors (including diffuse glioneuronal tumor of childhood, primary CNS rhabdomyosarcoma, primary CNS tumoral metastasis, extracranial tumor metastasis, and lymphoma), tumor-like diseases (Langerhans cell histiocytosis and ALK-positive histiocytosis), vascular causes (such as pial angiomatosis, ANCA-related vasculitis, and Moyamoya disease), and other disorders like spontaneous intracranial hypotension and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Despite the nonspecific nature of imaging findings associated with meningeal lesions, narrowing down the differential diagnoses is crucial, as each condition requires a tailored and specific treatment approach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f60315487e8720c9eb074a5a7d66ef18f2bcf191595c6b7fbf7df3c49c130555","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
