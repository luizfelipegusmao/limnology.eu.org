{"title":"Investigating the Critical Success Factors for Tourism PPP Projects in China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0066/v1","date":1719838931000,"content":"This research aims to explore and analyze the critical success factors (CSFs) that increase the likelihood of successful implementation of tourism PPP projects in China. As an important step toward developing such a protocol, this study identifies and examines 22 critical success factors for tourism PPPs based on a systematic research approach, which includes a rigorous literature review, and semi-structured interviews. A questionnaire survey was conducted to evaluate the relative importance of these 22 CSF. The results show that the top three critical success factors for Chinaâ€™s tourism PPPs are: adequate project evaluation and demonstration; political support and stability; clear and stable policy documents on PPP. Factor analysis indicated that the 22 CSFs could be grouped into five principal success factor groups. These insights are expected to profoundly influence the development of policies related to tourism PPPs, providing a structured framework to enhance the efficiency and success of these ventures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1aff1442bf06d28e27d067f7019dbaf54751c527540573e7c10eaad52fa3bc9f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
