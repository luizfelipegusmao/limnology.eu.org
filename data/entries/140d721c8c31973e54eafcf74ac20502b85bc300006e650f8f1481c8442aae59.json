{"title":"Aqueous Extracts of Rhus trilobata Inhibit the LPS-Induced Inflammatory Response In Vitro and In Vivo","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0092/v1","date":1725267422000,"content":"Chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are responsible for approximately 74% of deaths globally. Medicinal plants have traditionally been used to treat NCDs, including diabetes, cancer, and rheumatic diseases, and are a source of anti-inflammatory compounds. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of Rhus trilobata (Rt) extracts and fractions in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation models in vitro and in vivo. The aqueous extract (RtAE) and five fractions (F2 to F6) were obtained via C18 solid-phase separation and tested in murine LPS-induced J774.1 macrophages. Key inflammatory markers such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and COX-2 gene expression were measured using RT-qPCR, and PGE2 production was assessed via HPLC-DAD. The in vivo effects were tested in an LPS-induced paw edema model in Wistar rats. Results showed that RtAE at 15 μg/mL significantly decreased IL-1β and IL-6 gene expression in vitro. Fraction F6 further reduced IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 gene expression, COX-2 expression, and PGE2 production. In vivo, F6 significantly reduced LPS-induced paw edema, inflammatory infiltration, and IL-1β and COX-2 protein expression. These findings support the anti-inflammatory potential of RtAE and F6, reinforcing the medicinal use of Rt.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"140d721c8c31973e54eafcf74ac20502b85bc300006e650f8f1481c8442aae59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
