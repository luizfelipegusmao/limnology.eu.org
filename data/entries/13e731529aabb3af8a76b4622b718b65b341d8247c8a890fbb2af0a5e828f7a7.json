{"title":"Prophylactic and Therapeutic Usage of Drains in Gynecologic Oncology Procedures: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1406/v1","date":1724137311000,"content":"Background/Objectives: The use of post-operative drains in gynaecologic oncology procedures is controversial with evidence both supporting and questioning their efficacy. Proponents argue that such drains help detect complications early, reduce abscess formation, and also alleviate post-operative pain. On the other hand, drains are associated with increased risks of incisional hernia, infection, prolonged hospitalization, and postoperative pain. Methods: We conducted a research in the PubMed database and supplemented it with a manual search to retrieve addition-al papers eligible for inclusion. Results: Their use is not always found to improve outcomes, no-tably in surgeries such as a radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy, where they may actually enhance lymphocyst formation and other complications. In cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer, negative pressure wound therapy showed some potential benefits, but evidence remained inconclusive due to limited studies. The international guidelines presented in this re-view, suggest avoiding the routine use of drains and promote early removal when their use is necessary. Conclusions: This review aims to present an update on the current knowledge re-garding the role of drainage in gynaecologic oncology and while further good-quality research is required, particularly in high-risk surgical procedures, numerous prospective trials have exten-sively addressed the topic, trying to provide clear suggestions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"13e731529aabb3af8a76b4622b718b65b341d8247c8a890fbb2af0a5e828f7a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
