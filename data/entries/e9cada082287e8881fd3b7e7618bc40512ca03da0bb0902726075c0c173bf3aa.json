{"title":"Some Nanoparticle Applications Improve Morphological and Physiological Characteristics of Boysenberry Plants Grown Under Salinity Stress In Vitro Cultivation Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1486/v1","date":1726728964000,"content":"Salinity, one of the most important abiotic stress factors, affects plant growth and limits agricultural productivity. In the study, the effects of iron (FeNP; 0.025 and 0.05 mM), silver (AgNP; 0,2 ve 0,4 mg L-1) and silicon dioxide (SiNP;7,5 ve 15 mg L-1) nanoparticles on morphological and physiological parameters of in vitro blackberry plants grown under salinity stress (NaCl; 15 mM ve 35 mM) were investigated. According to our study results, it was determined that higher values obtained from SiNP application in terms of shoot development parameters, FeNP application found more succesfull for root development, AgNP application was effective in SPAD, leaf relative water content (LRWC) and relative growth rate (RGR), and FeNP application was increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzyme activities. Salt stress was significantly affected the root development, SPAD value, LRWC and RGR, SOD and CAT enzyme activities. As a result, under salt stress conditions, SiNP, FeNP and AgNP applications can significantly reduce the negative effects of stress and promote vegetative development of the plant compared to control conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9cada082287e8881fd3b7e7618bc40512ca03da0bb0902726075c0c173bf3aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
