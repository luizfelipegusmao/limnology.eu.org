{"title":"Utilization of waste from paper industry as a heterogeneous base catalyst for the synthesis of biodiesel","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14497?af=R","date":1729333424000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>To meet the pressing demand for alternative biofuel in the contemporary world, the production cost of biodiesel has to be decreased. Hence, this work addresses the usage of CaCO<sub>3</sub>-rich industrial waste produced in a local paper industry in Assam, India for the synthesis of a heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel synthesis. The collected lime sludge waste was subjected to calcination at 800°C for 3 h producing a CaO-rich catalyst which was then employed in the transesterification of cottonseed oil. The optimized reaction conditions obtained were 5 wt% catalyst concentration, oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:12 at 65°C temperature, and 3 h of reaction time. The catalyst's reusability was evaluated up to four cycles. Besides, the prepared catalyst has been characterized using Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powder X-ray Diffraction (p-XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) techniques and its basicity was measured using Hammett indicators. Moreover, the biodiesel obtained was characterized with <sup>1</sup>H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, Gas Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS), and FTIR techniques. A biodiesel yield of 98.03% was achieved and the quality of biodiesel formed during the transesterification of CSO also conforms to EN 14214 and ASTM D 6751 standards. Thus, our study highlights the sustainability and the potential for future industrial application of paper industrial waste in the production of biodiesel.</p>","author":"Sultana Parveen Ahmed, \nSudhamoyee Kataky, \nRiku Dutta, \nAshim Jyoti Thakur, \nSwapan Kumar Dolui","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"7effaaf642a5c572dae32570641a6e11024b34f5b6a6a8c252123f3462d4ef6d","category":"Environment"}
