Frequently, however, these investigations are conducted on different samples, which may impede a direct correlation of transport and imaging data.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8017edf278eb446ebcfb8ff44719e603896288aac33d5df682a32e71ca6920dc","category":"Environment"}
