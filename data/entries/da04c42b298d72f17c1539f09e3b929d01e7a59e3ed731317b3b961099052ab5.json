{"title":"Beyond Profit. Exploring the Motivators of Local Producers in Multiple Sub-regions in Western Hungary","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0986/v1","date":1723619271000,"content":"Most research on sustainable small-scale, local producer lifestyles emphasises healthy food production, lacking integration of mental and spiritual well-being into a holistic concept of a healthy lifestyle. This study explores the motives behind the production activity of producers engaged in sustainable food production in several Western Hungarian sub-regions, aiming to identify their attitudes and motivations. The small-scale entrepreneurial mindset encompasses needs beyond physical and ethical aspects, such as involvement, socio-cultural attachment to the past, tradition, nature, place, and local culture. An online questionnaire was conducted with 73 local producers in the second quarter of 2024. The results of the factor and cluster analyses were used to classify the producers into two clusters: the \"Value-Creator\" and the \"Proud\" clusters. The main features of these two clusters were illustrated in persona profiles. The \"Value-Creator\" cluster, mainly women, feel a strong connection to the local community and view sustainable production as a lifestyle choice. The \"Proud\" cluster, consisting of young men, focus on the quality and uniqueness of their products. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of sustainable production by exploring producers' intrinsic motivations and lifestyle choices. The findings could also inform other entrepreneurial projects, such as urban initiatives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da04c42b298d72f17c1539f09e3b929d01e7a59e3ed731317b3b961099052ab5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
