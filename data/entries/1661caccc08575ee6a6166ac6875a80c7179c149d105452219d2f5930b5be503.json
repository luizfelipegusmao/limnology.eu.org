Life cycle transitions are therefore important for development, and of these, plant biologists are most familiar with the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. The floral transition, as it is called, occurs in angiosperms to reach the reproductive stage and is regulated by florigen. The molecular identity of florigen was first identified in Arabidopsis as the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein, which has homologs in all other angiosperms that have been studied. Florigen is produced in the leaves in response to environmental and autonomous cues, then moves through the vascular system to cause the floral transition in the shoot apical meristem. Similarly, perennial plants must also use environmental cues to make decisions about when to produce storage organs that sequester the carbohydrates and nutrients necessary to survive dormant periods.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"1661caccc08575ee6a6166ac6875a80c7179c149d105452219d2f5930b5be503","category":"Environment"}
