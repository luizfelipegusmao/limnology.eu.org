{"title":"Application of Metagenomics Sequencing in a Patient with Dementia: A New Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2269/v1","date":1722236153000,"content":"(1) Background: The study of microbiome is being crucial for his role in major systemic diseases, in particular the oral and gut microbiota. In the last years the study of microorganism correlated for example with neurodegenerative disease is increasing the prospective of a possible link between gut microbiota and brain. Here we report a new case report about a patient evaluated genetically firstly for dementia and late-onset dyskinesia, and then tested with 16S metagenomics sequencing. (2) Methods: Starting from buccal swab, we extracted bacterial DNA and then we performed a NGS metagenomics sequencing based on the amplification of hypervariable regions of the 16S in bacteria. (3) Results: The sequencing revealed the presence of Spirochaetes Phylum, a pathogenic bacterium generally known to be able to migrate to the Central Nervous System and not only. (4) Conclusions: Oral infections as our results shows could be possible contributing factors to various neurodegenerative conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed988b68ed903367abb5e6e5d6fecfad998a74920dddc69893cc08059bf03e18","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
