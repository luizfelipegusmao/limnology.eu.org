Durán-Riveroll</p>\r\n\r\nInteractions between bacterial microbiota and epibenthic species of the dinoflagellate <i>Prorocentrum</i> may define the onset and persistence of benthic harmful algal blooms (bHABs). Chemical ecological interactions within the dinoflagellate phycosphere potentially involve a complex variety of organic molecules, metabolites, and toxins, including undefined bioactive compounds. In this study, the bacterial diversity and core members of the dinoflagellate-associated microbiota were defined from 11 strains of three epibenthic <i>Prorocentrum</i> species, representing three geographically disjunct locations within Mexican coastal waters. Microbiota profiles in stable monoclonal <i>Prorocentrum</i> cultures were obtained by sequencing amplicons of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Thirteen classes of bacteria were identified among dinoflagellate clones, where Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidia were consistently dominant. The bacterial community structure exhibited significantly different grouping by the location of origin of dinoflagellate clones. No significant diversity difference was found among free-living or unattached bacteria in the dinoflagellate culture medium (M) compared with those in closer association with the dinoflagellate host cells (H). Twelve taxa were defined as core members of the bacterial assemblage, representing the genera <i>Algiphilus</i>, <i>Cohaesibacter</i>, <i>Labrenzia</i>, <i>Mameliella</i>, <i>Marinobacter</i>, <i>Marivita</i>, <i>Massilia</i>, <i>Muricauda</i>, <i>Roseitalea</i>, and an unclassified member of the Rhodobacteraceae. The core members are inferred to significantly contribute to primary and secondary metabolic functions, but no direct correlation with dinoflagellate toxigenicity was apparent. Overall the bacterial profile and implied gene functionality indicated a suite of positive interactions, suggesting either mutualism or commensalism with the dinoflagellate. The further characterization and interpretation of specific gene functions and interactions between bacteria and dinoflagellates, such as epibenthic members of genus <i>Prorocentrum</i>, are key to understanding their role in toxigenesis and bHAB development.","author":"Miguel A.
