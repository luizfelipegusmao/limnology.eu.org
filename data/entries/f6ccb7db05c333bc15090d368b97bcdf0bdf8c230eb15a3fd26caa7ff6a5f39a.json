{"title":"Enhanced Control Strategies for Underactuated AUVs Using Backstepping Integral Sliding Mode Techniques for Ocean Current Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2412/v1","date":1727689662000,"content":"This paper examines the control challenges faced by underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) under ocean current disturbances. It proposes a Backstepping Integral Sliding Mode Control (BISMC) strategy to enhance their adaptability and robustness. The BISMC strategy integrates the system decomposition capability of the Backstepping Control method with the rapid response and robustness advantages of the Sliding Mode Control method, enabling the design of a heading controller and a double closed-loop depth controller. By introducing an integral component, the strategy eliminates steady-state errors caused by ocean currents, accelerating system convergence and improving accuracy. Furthermore, a saturation function is employed to mitigate output chattering issues. Simulation results demonstrate that the BISMC controller significantly enhances the control precision and anti-disturbance capabilities of AUVs under low-frequency ocean current disturbances, showcasing exceptional adaptive and self-disturbance rejection performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6ccb7db05c333bc15090d368b97bcdf0bdf8c230eb15a3fd26caa7ff6a5f39a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
