{"title":"A new distribution and host record for the rare moth, Callioratis millari (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), and some ecological observations","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/2/305/7604919?rss=1","date":1707523200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Callioratis millari</span> Hampson (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) is a Critically Endangered moth endemic to South Africa. Despite extensive searches, it was previously known only from the Entumeni Nature Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal, where its larvae exclusively feed on the cycad <span>Stangeria eriopus</span> (Kunze) Baill (Cycadales: Stangeriaceae). In July 2022, a new population of <span>C. millari</span> was discovered in the Kabouga section of Addo Elephant National Park in the Eastern Cape. Larvae of <span>C. millari</span> were feeding on the cycad <span>Encephalartos caffer</span> (Thunb.) Lehm (Cycadales: Zamiaceae), which also constitutes a new host record. In June 2023, we determined larval incidence and herbivory at this new locality, offering insights into the ecological requirements of <span>C. millari</span>. Known <span>C. millari</span> localities, although ecologically different, share low altitudes (700–950 m a.s.l.), moderate to high rainfall, and grassy habitats with sparse woody cover. A total of 59 larvae were counted in Kabouga, mostly in the fifth and sixth (final) instars. Herbivory incidence was lower on smaller plants and those covered by other vegetation. The flight period of adult <span>C. millari</span> likely occurs between mid-March and April in Kabouga, but further investigation is needed to clarify this. The peak period of larval occurrence in Kabouga occurs during the driest and coldest months of the year (May–July). Considering limited habitat availability, host plant poaching, and the risk of untimely fires, the species should be considered highly threatened. This study adds to our understanding of the biology of <span>C. millari</span> and provides information on its ecological requirements and may contribute to making informed management decisions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"41f76b10d65307d136546e45e229a8f968f9dc58672324655b2561c43d3ad774","category":"Environment"}
