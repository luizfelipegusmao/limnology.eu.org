{"title":"Physicochemical Characterization and Antimicrobial Properties of Lanthanide Nitrates in Dilute Aqueous Solutions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0386/v1","date":1720076330000,"content":"The work presents the results of studying dilute aqueous solutions of commercial Ln(NO3)3 路 xH2O salts with Ln=Ce-Lu using X-ray diffraction (XRD), IR spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS: EXAFS/XANES) and pH measurements. As a reference point, XRD and XAS measurements for characterized Ln(NO3)3 路 xH2O microcrystalline powder samples were performed. The local structure of Ln-nitrate complexes in 20 mM Ln(NO3)3 路 xH2O aqueous solution was studied under total external reflection conditions and EXAFS geometry was applied to obtain high-quality EXAFS data for solutions with low concentrations of Ln3+ ions. Results obtained by EXAFS spectroscopy showed significant contraction of the first coordination sphere during the dissolution process for metal ions located in the middle of the lanthanide series. It was established that in Ln(NO3)3 路 xH2O solutions with Ln=Ce, Sm, Gd, Yb (c=134, 100, 50 and 20 mM) there are coordinated and, to a greater extent, non-coordinated nitrate groups with bidentate and predominantly monodentate bonds with Ln ions, the number of which increases upon transition from cerium to ytterbium. Cross-relationships between the concentration of solutions, pH value and antimicrobial activity with the type of Ln = Ce, Sm, Gd, Yb were established, as well as the absence of biocidal properties of solutions with a concentration of 20 mM, except for Ln = Yb. The important role of experimental conditions in obtaining and interpreting the results was noted.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8ca90a86c8ccc54203f53f726204f6c858b87c5cb06b9d697d8086de0aaeec4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
