{"title":"The power of digital story in early mathematics education: Innovative approaches for children with intellectual disabilities","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302128","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Özlem Altindağ Kumaş</p>\r\n\r\nThis study explored the effectiveness of digital story interventions in improving early math skills in kindergarten children with mild intellectual disabilities. Digital stories are multimedia narratives that combine text, images, and audio to enhance learning experience. This experimental study used a pretest-posttest control group design. The intervention group consisted of 15 children who participated in an 8-week digital story intervention targeting early math skills. A matched control group was used to control for sex differences. Data were collected through the TEMA-3 test scores and teacher and child feedback. Post-intervention, the experimental group showed significant improvements in TEMA-3 test scores compared to the control group. Teachers and children reported a positive perception of the intervention’s social validity, highlighting enhanced engagement and understanding of math concepts. This study demonstrated that digital story-based education is a promising approach for improving early math skills in children with mild intellectual disabilities. These findings suggest potential implications for integrating digital storytelling into special education curricula and highlight avenues for future research in this field.","author":"Özlem Altindağ Kumaş","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"82d140b15b0bb27ec7ca625e1213ef4bf49b652449318669ce8292e9b4820e46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
