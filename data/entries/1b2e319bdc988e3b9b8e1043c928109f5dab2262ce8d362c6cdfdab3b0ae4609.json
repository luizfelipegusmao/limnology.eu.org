{"title":"Personalized 3D Printed Patches for Fast and Safe Radiation Therapy of Non Melanoma Skin Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1362/v1","date":1711114123000,"content":"This study addresses the challenge of treating skin cancer effectively, especially in visible areas like the face, where traditional methods may be undesirable. Current options, including surgery and radiation therapy, have limitations such as complexity, expense, and imprecise dose delivery. The proposed solution involves additively manufacturing personalized patches using diagnostic imaging data, offering a targeted and controlled dose of beta-emitting isotopes like Y-90. The patches, tailored to the tumor's shape and depth, aim to minimize damage to healthy tissues and structures. Through 3D printing technology we demonstrated the feasibility of creating individualized applicators filled with radioisotopes, that have the potential to deliver therapeutic doses while ensuring patient comfort and affordability. This innovative approach, based on radiation delivery simulations, offers a promising future alternative to conventional radiation therapy methods. Clinical trials are required to validate its efficacy and safety, but the potential for reduced radiation exposure and enhanced treatment precision positions this personalized and targeted therapy as a valuable advancement in skin cancer treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b2e319bdc988e3b9b8e1043c928109f5dab2262ce8d362c6cdfdab3b0ae4609","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
