{"title":"Assessing Ecosystem Service Protection and Strategies: A Case Study of Queensland&#039;s Ecosystem Services in Response to Climate Change","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1745/v1","date":1724452017000,"content":"The ecosystem plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change and protecting the environment. This study employs GIS technology to conduct an in-depth analysis of the current status of Queensland's ecosystem and develops a Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) model based on six sub-factors. These sub-factors include the Exposure Index (Mean surface temperature and precipitation), the Sensitivity Index (Population density, Building density, and Proximity to forests and nature reserves), and the Adaptive Capacity Index (Nighttime light radiation). The findings indicate that the CCVI value is lowest in the southeastern coastal region of Queensland, suggesting that this area is less vulnerable to climate change. However, other coastal areas and the far western inland regions exhibit higher CCVI values, indicating greater climate vulnerability. These areas require attention and the implementation of appropriate measures. By deepening our understanding of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, we can formulate effective policies and measures to promote sustainable development and mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on the region. This study holds significant practical implications for guiding ecological planning and management decisions in the area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22c05442e16d89ab7f937c8f7eaa95ed1b59790a52d6e8c4e89fb140ae1483e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
