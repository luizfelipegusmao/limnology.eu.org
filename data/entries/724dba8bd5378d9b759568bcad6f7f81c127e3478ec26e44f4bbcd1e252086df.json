{"title":"Mechanical Assessment of Denture Polymers Processing Technologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1053/v1","date":1715774619000,"content":"Background: Removable prostheses have seen a fundamental change recently because of advances in polymer materials, allowing improved durability and performance. Despite these advancements, notable differences still occur amongst various polymer materials and processing technologies, requiring a thorough grasp of their mechanical, physical, and therapeutic implications. Methods: Fours different processing techniques, all utilizing Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as the main material, were used to construct complete dentures. The specimens underwent a mechanical test. Results: All the specimens broke under the influence of a certain force, rather than yielding through flow, as is characteristic for plastic materials. For each specimen, the maximum force (N) was recorded (figure 4), as well as the breaking energy, Conclusions: The best results were obtained in the case of the thermoplastic injection system and, surprisingly and contrary to those in the specialized literature, the worst results were recorded in the case of 3D printed samples.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"724dba8bd5378d9b759568bcad6f7f81c127e3478ec26e44f4bbcd1e252086df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
