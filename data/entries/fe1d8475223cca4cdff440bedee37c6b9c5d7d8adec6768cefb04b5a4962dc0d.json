{"title":"Dynamic pathology and pathogen distribution of the yeast Metschnikowia bicuspidata in the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13993?af=R","date":1726037099000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In this study, the “milky disease” model of <i>Eriocheir sinhensis</i> was constructed via intramuscular injection with the pathogenic yeast <i>Metschnikowia bicuspidata</i>. The dynamic pathological changes of <i>E. sinensis</i> after injection were elucidated with two staining methods (haemotoxylin-eosin and alcian blue periodic acid-Schiff) and fluorescence in situ hybridization technology. Anatomical observation revealed three stages of the “milky disease”: no clinical signs (1–4 days after infection), the appearance of signs of disease (5–7 days), and significant liquefaction (10 days). Histological observation also revealed three stages of the disease: yeast diffusion (1–2 days after infection), yeast slow development (3–4 days), and yeast rapid proliferation (5 days). And FISH technique was suitable for the early detection of infection with <i>M. bicuspidata</i> in <i>E. sinensis</i>. We found that <i>M. bicuspidata</i> spread to the whole body of the crab through the haemolymph and developed into fungal septicaemia. These results elucidate the systemic pathological characteristics of “milky disease” in <i>E. sinensis</i> and suggest the pathogenic mechanism of <i>M. bicuspidata</i>.</p>","author":"Xinran Shi, \nNa Sun, \nJiannan Liu, \nSenting Pu, \nZhouling Chen, \nDong Sheng, \nKexin Hao, \nXiaodong Li, \nShigen Ye","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"fe1d8475223cca4cdff440bedee37c6b9c5d7d8adec6768cefb04b5a4962dc0d","category":"Environment"}
