WS<sub>2</sub> is a particularly useful TMD which exhibits several properties of scientific and technological interest, many of which exist in the monolayer to few-layer regime [<a href=\"#ozae044.602-B1\">1</a>]. At these limits, the surface area to volume ratio is high and it is critical to understand surface properties and modulation for potential applications. For any material exposed to atmosphere, oxidation (and reduction) reactions may occur. While WS<sub>2</sub> oxidation can occur spontaneously, oxidation of TMDs can also be introduced in a controlled manner [<a href=\"#ozae044.602-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.602-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.602-B4\">4</a>]. Reduction of tungsten oxide (WO<sub>x</sub>) has been observed after exposure to high-energy electrons in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.602-B5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.602-B6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.602-B7\">7</a>]. This chemical change has been exploited to perform electron-beam (e-beam) lithographic patterning of WO<sub>x</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.602-B8\">8</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.602-B9\">9</a>], but not at the resolution of modern e-beam lithography which can achieve nanometer-scale features with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) resists [<a href=\"#ozae044.602-B10\">10</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.602-B11\">11</a>]. Patterning of 2D materials at comparable spatial scales has been demonstrated via destructive milling with the e-beam [<a href=\"#ozae044.602-B12\">12</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.602-B13\">13</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.602-B14\">14</a>]. Negative resist materials also exhibit high-resolution patterning including epitaxial crystalline oxide growth, e-beam adatom manipulation, and AI-controlled TMD vacancy line creation [<a href=\"#ozae044.602-B15\">15</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.602-B16\">16</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.602-B17\">17</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e0293cf2f8813f0c22beaa3e626f66508ce8f19488569cecbbabcdf16c08bf01","category":"Environment"}
