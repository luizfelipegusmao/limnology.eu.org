Therefore, there is a need to explore alternative cryoprotectants with low sweetness and low-calorie content. The cryoprotective effects and possible mechanisms of soybean oligosaccharides (SBOS) on the frozen stability of grass carp (<i>Ctenopharyngodon idellus</i>) surimi were investigated during 120 days of frozen storage, comparing with commercial cryoprotectants (4% sucrose and 4% sorbitol, w/w).</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>6% ~ 8% (w/w) SBOS and commercial cryoprotectants could restrain water mobility and reduce thawing loss of frozen surimi by increasing non-freezable water content. SBOS could maintain the structural stability of proteins by preventing sulfhydryl groups from being rapidly oxidized to disulfide bonds, retarding the reduction of the solubility, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity and α-helix content of myofibrillar proteins (MP), and hindering the increasing surface hydrophobicity of MP of surimi during 120-day frozen storage. The introduction of SBOS increased the gel strength and water-holding capacity of frozen-stored surimi. Compared with commercial cryoprotectants, 8% SBOS was more effective in stabilizing protein structure, while slightly less effective in ice-forming inhibition.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The results suggested that 8% SBOS could be potentially developed as a new cryoprotectant for surimi due to its abilities of ice-forming inhibition and protein structure stability.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
