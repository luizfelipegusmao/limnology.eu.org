{"title":"Single-track magnetic tape absolute position sensor with self-adaptivity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1142/v1","date":1718619192000,"content":"A single-track magnetic code tape based absolute position sensor system is demonstrated. Unlike traditional dual-track systems, our method simplifies manufacturing and avoids crosstalk between tracks, offering higher tolerance to alignment errors. The sensing system employs an array of magnetic field sensing elements that recognize the bit sequence encoded on the tape. This approach allows for accurate position determination even when the number of sensing elements is fewer than the number of bits covered, and without the need for specific spacing between sensing elements and bit length. We demonstrate the system's ability to learn and adapt to various magnetic code patterns, including those that are irregular or have been altered. Our method can identify and localize the sensed magnetic field pattern directly within a self-learned magnetic field map, providing robust performance in diverse conditions. This self-adaptive capability enhances operational safety and reliability, as the system can continue functioning even when the magnetic tape is misaligned or has undergone changes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1f102fed7b955961eb820e25b0818dffcb84f767f7d4accc7943f7e4b266991","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
