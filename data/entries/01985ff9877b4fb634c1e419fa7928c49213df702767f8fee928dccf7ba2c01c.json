{"title":"CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutations in a sugar transporter gene reduce cassava susceptibility to bacterial blight","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2566/7664284?rss=1","date":1714694400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Bacteria from the genus <span>Xanthomonas</span> are prolific phytopathogens that elicit disease in over 400 plant species. Xanthomonads carry a repertoire of specialized proteins called transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors that promote disease and pathogen virulence by inducing the expression of host susceptibility (S) genes. <span>Xanthomonas phaseoli</span> pv. <span>manihotis</span> (<span>Xpm</span>) causes bacterial blight on the staple food crop cassava (<span>Manihot esculenta</span> Crantz). The <span>Xpm</span> effector TAL20 induces ectopic expression of the S gene <span>Manihot esculenta Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporter 10a</span> (<span>MeSWEET10a</span>), which encodes a sugar transporter that contributes to cassava bacterial blight (CBB) susceptibility. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate multiple cassava lines with edits to the <span>MeSWEET10a</span> TAL20 effector binding site and/or coding sequence. In several of the regenerated lines, <span>MeSWEET10a</span> expression was no longer induced by <span>Xpm</span>, and in these cases, we observed reduced CBB disease symptoms post <span>Xpm</span> infection. Because <span>MeSWEET10a</span> is expressed in cassava flowers, we further characterized the reproductive capability of the <span>MeSWEET10a</span> promoter and coding sequence mutants. Lines were crossed to themselves and to wild-type plants. The results indicated that expression of <span>MeSWEET10a</span> in female, but not male, flowers is critical to produce viable F1 seed. In the case of promoter mutations that left the coding sequence intact, viable F1 progeny were recovered. Taken together, these results demonstrate that blocking <span>MeSWEET10a</span> induction is a viable strategy for decreasing cassava susceptibility to CBB and that ideal lines will contain promoter mutations that block TAL effector binding while leaving endogenous expression of <span>MeSWEET10a</span> unaltered.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"01985ff9877b4fb634c1e419fa7928c49213df702767f8fee928dccf7ba2c01c","category":"Environment"}
