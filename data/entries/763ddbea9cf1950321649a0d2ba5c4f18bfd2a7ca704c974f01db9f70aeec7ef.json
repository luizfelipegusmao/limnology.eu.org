{"title":"Task Dependent Comfort Zone, a Base Placement Strategy for Mobile Manipulators based on Maniuplability Measures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0520/v1","date":1720397136000,"content":"The present contribution introduces the task dependent comfort zone as a base placement strategy for mobile manipulators using different manipulability measures. Four different manipulability measures depending on end-effector velocities, forces, stiffness, and accelerations are considered. By evaluating a discrete subspace of the manipulator workspace with these manipulability measures and by using image processing algorithms, a suitable goal position for the autonomous mobile manipulator was defined within the comfort zone. This always ensures a certain manipulator manipulablity value with a lower limit in respect to the maximum possible manipulability in the discrete subspace. Results are shown for three different mobile manipulators using the velocity dependent manipulability measure in a simulation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"763ddbea9cf1950321649a0d2ba5c4f18bfd2a7ca704c974f01db9f70aeec7ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
