{"title":"Altered interactions between cis-regulatory elements partially resolve BLADE-ON-PETIOLE genetic redundancy in Capsella rubella","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4637/7735998?rss=1","date":1724025600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Duplicated genes are thought to follow one of three evolutionary trajectories that resolve their redundancy: neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, or pseudogenization. Differences in expression patterns have been documented for many duplicated gene pairs and interpreted as evidence of subfunctionalization and a loss of redundancy. However, little is known about the functional impact of such differences and about their molecular basis. Here, we investigate the genetic and molecular basis for the partial loss of redundancy between the two <span>BLADE-ON-PETIOLE</span> genes <span>BOP1</span> and <span>BOP2</span> in red shepherd's purse (<span>Capsella rubella</span>) compared to Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). While both genes remain almost fully redundant in <span>A. thaliana</span>, <span>BOP1</span> in <span>C. rubella</span> can no longer ensure wild-type floral organ numbers and suppress bract formation, due to an altered expression pattern in the region of the cryptic bract primordium. We use two complementary approaches, transgenic rescue of <span>A. thaliana atbop1 atbop2</span> double mutants and deletions in the endogenous <span>AtBOP1</span> promoter, to demonstrate that several <span>BOP1</span> promoter regions containing conserved noncoding sequences interact in a nonadditive manner to control <span>BOP1</span> expression in the bract primordium and that changes in these interactions underlie the evolutionary divergence between <span>C. rubella</span> and <span>A. thaliana BOP1</span> expression and activity. Similarly, altered interactions between <span>cis</span>-regulatory regions underlie the divergence in functional promoter architecture related to the control of floral organ abscission by <span>BOP1</span>. These findings highlight the complexity of promoter architecture in plants and suggest that changes in the interactions between <span>cis</span>-regulatory elements are key drivers for evolutionary divergence in gene expression and the loss of redundancy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"e818d8cb7611762373cc173b0c1ee469ecf982391ce6ba4ca7c08689931486f9","category":"Environment"}
