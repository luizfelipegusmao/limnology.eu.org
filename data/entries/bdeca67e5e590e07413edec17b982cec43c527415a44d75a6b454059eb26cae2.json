Its treatment is conducted by lifestyle and behavioral changes, pharmacological therapy, and when correctly indicated, bariatric surgery. In recent years, the procedures for weight loss have been investigated due to their relationship with the development of many types of cancer. Although many studies have shown that bariatric surgery decreases cancer risk, other researchers observed an increase in this association. Carcinogenesis is affected by many factors, such as age, sex, type of cancer, and the bariatric surgery performed on each patient. This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol aims to clarify the association between the different modalities of bariatric surgery and the risk of cancer development in adult patients with metabolic syndrome.</p> Method and analysis <p>The proposed systematic review and meta-analysis will be reported conforming to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-P) guidelines. This research will include observational studies (case-control and cohort studies) about patients who undergo bariatric surgery due to metabolic syndrome. Will be accepted in any language and any year. Publications without peer review will be excluded from this review. Data will be entered into the Review Manager software (RevMan5.2.3). We extracted or calculated the OR and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes for each study. In case of heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>&gt;50%), the random-effects model will combine the studies to calculate the OR and 95% CI.</p> Ethics and dissemination <p>This study will review the published data; Thus, obtaining ethical approval is unnecessary. The findings of this systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p> Prospero registration number <p>CRD42023432079.</p>","author":"Isadora de Albuquerque Falcão Feitosa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bdeca67e5e590e07413edec17b982cec43c527415a44d75a6b454059eb26cae2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
