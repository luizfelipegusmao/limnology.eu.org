{"title":"Mevastatin‐Induced HO‐1 Expression in Cardiac Fibroblasts: A Strategy to Combat Cardiovascular Inflammation and Fibrosis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24429?af=R","date":1729512645000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Mevastatin (MVS) is known for its anti-inflammatory effects, potentially achieved by upregulating heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an enzyme involved in cytoprotection against oxidative injury. Nonetheless, the specific processes by which MVS stimulates HO-1 expression in human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) are not yet fully understood. In this study, we found that MVS treatment increased HO-1 mRNA and protein levels in HCFs. This induction was inhibited by pretreatment with specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK, JNK1/2, and FoxO1, and by siRNAs targeting NOX2, p47<sup>phox</sup>, p38, JNK1, FoxO1, Keap1, and Nrf2. MVS also triggered ROS generation and activated JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK, both attenuated by NADPH oxidase or ROS inhibitors. Additionally, MVS promoted the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and Nrf2, which was suppressed by p38 MAPK or JNK1/2 inhibitor. Furthermore, MVS inhibited TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression via the HO-1/CO pathway in HCFs. In summary, the induction of HO-1 expression in HCFs by MVS is mediated through two primary signaling pathways: NADPH oxidase/ROS/p38 MAPK, and JNK1/2/FoxO1 and Nrf2. This research illuminates the underlying processes through which MVS exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by modulating HO-1 in cardiac fibroblasts.</p>","author":"I‐Ta Lee, \nChien‐Chung Yang, \nYan‐Jyun Lin, \nWen‐Bin Wu, \nWei‐Ning Lin, \nChiang‐Wen Lee, \nHui‐Ching Tseng, \nFuu‐Jen Tsai, \nLi‐Der Hsiao, \nChuen‐Mao Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"1e6ff38759c09b8a21ceeed5763234452f161c7164191554fb715065ca7785fe","category":"Environment"}
