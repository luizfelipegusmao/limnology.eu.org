{"title":"Association between Perinatal Outcomes and Maternal Risk Factors: Age, Body Mass Index and Cigarette Smoking","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1245/v1","date":1716188159000,"content":"Objective: To analyse the association between maternal risk factors such as age, body mass index (BMI) and cigarette smoking, with perinatal outcomes. Materials and Methods: This a retrospective analysis from prospectively collected data performed at Hospital Universitario de Torrejón (Madrid, Spain), between September 2017 and December 2019. All pregnant women with singleton pregnancies and non-malformed live fetuses attending their routine ultrasound examination at 11+0 to 13+6 weeks' gestation were invited to participate. Association between preeclampsia, preterm birth, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), small for gestational age (SGA) or fetal growth restricted (FGR) neonates and type of delivery according to maternal age, BMI, and cigarrete smoking was studied. Logistic mixed models were used to analyze the data. Results: 1921 patients were included in the analysis. Women of 40 years old had a significantly higher risk of having GDM (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.61, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.08 to 2.36), and SGA neonates (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.37). Women with a BMI &amp;lt;18 had an increased rate of birth SGA and FGR neonates (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.51 to 7.05, and OR 3.73, 95% CI 1.54 to 8.37, respectively), whereas women with a BMI ≥35 had a higher risk of GDM (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.95 to 4.89). Smoking increased the risk of having SGA and FGR neonates (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.46, and OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.78). Conclusions: Advanced maternal age, low or high BMI, and smoking status are significant risk factors for pregnancy complications. Both clinicians and society should concentrate their efforts on addressing these factors to enhance reproductive health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be7ef2ba457859856797a5f47d610ab1239e182034c63b3f6f3fbec4491051b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
