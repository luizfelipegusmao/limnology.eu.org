{"title":"Elevated Temperature Effects on Protein Turnover Dynamics in Arabidopsis thaliana Seedlings Revealed by 15N-Stable Isotope Labeling and ProteinTurnover Algorithm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0780/v1","date":1715581129000,"content":"Global warming poses a threat to plant survival, impacting growth and agricultural yield. Protein turnover, a critical regulatory mechanism balancing protein synthesis and degradation, is crucial for cellular response to environmental changes. We investigated the effects of elevated temperature on proteome dynamics in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings using 15N-stable isotope labeling and ul-tra-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, coupled with the ProteinTurnover algorithm. Analyzing different cellular fractions from plants grown under 22°C and 30°C growth conditions, we found significant changes in the turnover rates of 571 proteins, with a median 1.4-fold increase, indicating accelerated protein dynamics under thermal stress. Notably, soluble root fraction proteins exhibited smaller turnover changes, suggesting tissue-specific adap-tations. Significant turnover alterations occurred with redox signaling, stress response, protein folding, secondary metabolism, and photorespiration, indicating complex responses enhancing plant thermal resilience. Conversely, proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and mito-chondrial ATP synthesis showed minimal changes, highlighting their stability. This analysis high-lights the intricate balance between proteome stability and adaptability, advancing our under-standing of plant responses to heat stress and supporting the development of improved thermo-tolerant crops.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de5094ca83d66528d465c180c251594b7128501e5b49825ed882f2c45ec42bf1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
