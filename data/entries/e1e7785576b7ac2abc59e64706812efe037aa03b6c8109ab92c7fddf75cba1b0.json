{"title":"Optimum Level of Essential Amino Acids-to-True Protein and Energy in Reduced Protein Diets Has the Potential to Enhance Broiler Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0650/v1","date":1728464723000,"content":"Supplementing essential amino acids (EAA), without considering non-EAA (NEAA) and energy contents in reduced crude protein (CP) diets may alter essential-to-total AA or true protein (E:T) and energy-to-protein ratios, potentially compromising growth. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of CP, E:T and net energy (NE) on broiler performance. Treatments were: T1— reduced CP (16%, RP), low NE (9.9 MJ/kg, LNE), low E:T (0.56, LE:T); T2—RP, LNE, high E:T (0.60, HE:T), with imbalanced EAA (excess Met and deficient Thr); T3—RP, high NE (10.4 MJ/kg, HNE), LE:T; T4—RP, HNE, HE:T; T5— normal CP (18%, NP), LNE, LE:T; T6—NP, LNE, HE:T; T7—NP, HNE, LE:T; and T8—NP, HNE, HE:T. The study employed as-hatched Cobb 500 broilers in two experiments. Exp.1 studied performance from d19 to 35, with 8 replicates per treatment and 16 birds per replicate (n=1024). Exp.2 measured NE values in respiration chambers from d25 to 28, with 6 replicates per treatment, and 2 birds (a male and a female) per replicate (n=96). The measured NE values were used to calculate NE intake (NEi) in Exp.1. The results showed that T4 improved (P &amp;lt; 0.001) weight gain (WG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and NEi relative to T1, T2 and T3, and protein efficiency (WG/CP intake) relative to all treatments. The live performance (feed intake, WG, FCR) and NEi of birds fed T4 reached a level equal to those of birds fed NP-diets (T5 to T8). These results suggest that a dietary E:T ratio of 0.60 is necessary to maximize nutrient utilization and to restore growth rate in broilers fed RP-diets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e1e7785576b7ac2abc59e64706812efe037aa03b6c8109ab92c7fddf75cba1b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
