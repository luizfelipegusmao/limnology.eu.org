Unlike seawater species such as those in family Anisakidae, freshwater species have not been well studied. In particular, the influences of these nematodes on the body condition of salmonids remain unclear. We studied the effects of <i>Salmonema</i> cf. <i>ephemeridarum</i> on the body condition of masu salmon <i>Oncorhynchus masou</i>. We found a positive relationship between the number of parasites and fish fork length. In contrast, we found a negative relationship between the body condition (condition factor) of fish and the number of parasites. These results suggest that nematode infection could affect host energy reserves for future growth.</p>","author":"Yuhei Ogura, \nKoh Hasegawa","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"c8608388381e953b878af82de9a4cbc1029993ed2806796f60849c1cd0c7f6a7","category":"Environment"}
