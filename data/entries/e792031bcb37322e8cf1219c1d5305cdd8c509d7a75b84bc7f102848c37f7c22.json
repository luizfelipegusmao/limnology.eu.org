Here we examine the role of plate tectonics in shaping the distribution of Palpimanidae. We perform molecular sequencing via target enrichment, which makes use of fragmented DNA, because most specimens are stored in natural history museum collections and were not properly preserved for molecular sequencing. We perform phylogenetic analysis, divergence dating, and ancestral range reconstructions to assess whether continental vicariance shaped the evolution of Palpimanidae. We also examine evolution of eye loss via ancestral character reconstruction. We report the first Palpimanidae phylogeny based on genomic data that samples the majority of Chediminae genera. Results suggest that Palpimanidae originated in the Triassic, with diversification spanning the Jurassic to the Cretaceous. Vicarance played a role in early diversification, with later range expansion out of Africa.
