{"title":"Advancements and Research in Coplanar Capacitive Sensing Techniques for Non-Destructive Testing and Evaluation: A State-of-the-Art Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0046/v1","date":1719826997000,"content":"In contrast to conventional non-destructive testing (NDT) and non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methodologies, including radiography, ultrasound, and eddy current analysis, the coplanar capacitive sensing technique emerges as a novel and promising avenue within the field. This paper endeavors to elucidate the efficacy of coplanar capacitive sensing, also referred to as capacitive imaging (CI), within the realm of NDT. Leveraging extant scholarly discourse, this review offers a comprehensive and methodical examination of the coplanar capacitive technique, encompassing its fundamental principles, factors influencing sensor efficacy, and diverse applications for defect identification across various NDT domains. Furthermore, this review deliberates on extant challenges and anticipates future trajectories for the technique. The manifold advantages inherent to coplanar capacitive sensing vis-Ã -vis traditional NDT methodologies not only afford versatility in application but also underscore its potential for pioneering advancements in forthcoming applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a497b2bb75c9455376f6adb0b163f9c93632f8caf2dccb53aa1c8b9439a04564","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
