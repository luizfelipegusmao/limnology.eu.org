{"title":"The Collatz Conjecture: A Resolution through Inverse Function Generative Completeness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0256/v7","date":1724057532000,"content":"This article presents a novel resolution of the Collatz Conjecture, centered on the concept of Generative Completeness of the inverse Collatz function. We introduce and rigorously prove that for all N ∈ ℕ+, there exists a minimal generator mN = 1 such that all positive integers up to N can be generated through successive applications of the inverse Collatz function G. This key property, which we term \"Generative Completeness\", forms the cornerstone of our proof. Building upon this foundation, we establish several crucial results: The boundedness of all Collatz sequences The existence and uniqueness of cycles in Collatz sequences The nature of the unique cycle as {1, 4, 2} We then present three distinct approaches to resolving the Collatz Conjecture, all fundamentally rooted in the Generative Completeness property. These diverse methods not only prove the conjecture but also provide deep insights into the structure of Collatz sequences.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4f84bae41e95878b3f40b67fd10cfef3d16192851c5b5b9b46699ceae06be5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
