{"title":"Inhibitory Effects of Nicotinic Acid against Streptococcus pneumoniae Biofilm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1020/v1","date":1713250736000,"content":"This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of nicotinic acid against Streptococcus pneumoniae biofilm. The experimental results indicate that S. pneumoniae forms biofilms, particularly at the liquid-air interface, as evidenced by the pellicle assay. Nicotinic acid demonstrated significant inhibition of S. pneumoniae biofilm formation at 6 h and 18 h, with higher concentrations leading to lower biofilm biomass, suggesting a concentration-dependent response. However, minimal biofilm inhibition was observed at 12 h. Treatment with nicotinic acid induced FTIR spectral changes in protein biomolecules of S. pneumoniae biofilm at 6 h and 18 h, evidenced by alterations in spectral peaks at 750 cm-1, 906 cm-1, 1540 cm-1, 1548 cm-1, and 1644 cm-1. Notably, no FTIR spectral changes were detected in 12 h S. pneumoniae biofilm following exposure to nicotinic acid. These findings suggest that nicotinic acid inhibits biofilm formation in a time and concentration-dependent manner, possibly by altering the structure of protein biomolecules within the biofilm.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be82bd09fd0a599c2011af2b85198b9d711863b61d3905600248f37058326c17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
