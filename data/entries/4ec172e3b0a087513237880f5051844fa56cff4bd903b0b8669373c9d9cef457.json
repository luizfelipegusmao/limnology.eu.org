{"title":"Early Responses to Crown Modification of California Black Oak Sprouts Initiated by High-Severity Wildfire","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jof/article/122/1/70/7243578?rss=1","date":1692230400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Hardwoods resprouting after wildfire or cutting develop as multistemmed clumps that gradually self-thin over time. There is increasing interest in thinning of sprouting species to accelerate the formation of tree characteristics important to indigenous cultural practices and wildlife such as large-diameter stems, large branches, broad crowns, and acorn production. We compared responses to three thinning treatments applied to black oak (<span>Quercus kelloggii</span>) resprouting after high-severity wildfire throughout northern California, USA. Basal area increment of the dominant stem was greatest after only one stem was retained, intermediate after three stems were retained, and lowest within unthinned oaks. Unwanted resprouting in response to the thinning was minimized by retaining three stems. Acorn production tended to increase as time elapsed since the fire (i.e., larger, older sprouts) but varied among sites and was noted as early as six years after fire at one site. More study is needed to test for the effects of thinning timing and intensity on the acceleration of acorn production as well as stem, branch, and crown size development over time.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Forestry Current Issue","siteHash":"f325018648ab04fba35e6e1191e9c9d953f9458bd233a7a41545c2e465328e3b","entryHash":"4ec172e3b0a087513237880f5051844fa56cff4bd903b0b8669373c9d9cef457","category":"Environment"}
