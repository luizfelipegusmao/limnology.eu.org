We explored relationships among crown size, principal cusp spacing, and accessory cusp expression in maxillary dental casts of nutritionally supplemented (n = 34) and non-supplemented (n = 39) individuals from Tezonteopan, Mexico. We hypothesized that the non-supplemented group would exhibit smaller molar crowns and reduced intercusp spacing. Since intercusp spacing is thought to be more sensitive to epigenetic influences than crown size, we predicted that the supplemented and non-supplemented groups would differ more in the former than the latter. Previous work suggests that molar accessory cusp expression may be elevated under conditions of stress. We therefore expected evidence of greater Carabelli and Cusp 5 trait expression in the non-supplemented group. We further hypothesized that anterior teeth would be affected by nutritional stress during development, with the non-supplemented group having smaller anterior tooth crowns and therefore limited space to form the tuberculum dentale. Finally, we tested whether the presence of molar accessory traits followed predictions of the Patterning Cascade Model of tooth morphogenesis in the entire sample. Our results supported the expectation that cusp spacing would differ more than molar crown size between the two groups. Carabelli trait showed little evidence of frequency differences between groups, but some evidence of greater trait scores in the non-supplemented group. The non-supplemented group also showed evidence of greater Cusp 5 frequency and expression. In the central incisors and canines, there was strong evidence for smaller crown sizes and reduced tuberculum dentale frequency in the non-supplemented group. With both groups pooled together, there was strong evidence of closer mesiodistal distances among principal cusps in molars with accessory cusps, a finding that is consistent with the PCM. Overall, our findings suggest that nutritional stress may affect accessory cusp expression.","author":"Erin C.
