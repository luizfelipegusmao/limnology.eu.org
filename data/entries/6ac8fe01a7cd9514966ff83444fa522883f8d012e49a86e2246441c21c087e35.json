{"title":"Non-Negative Decomposition of Multivariate Information: from Minimum to Blackwell Specific Information","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0285/v2","date":1714047505000,"content":"Partial Information Decompositions (PIDs) aim to categorize how a set of source variables provide information about a target variable redundantly, uniquely, or synergetically. The original proposal for such an analysis used a lattice-based approach and gained significant attention. However, finding a suitable underlying decomposition measure is still an open research question, even at an arbitrary number of discrete random variables. This work proposes a solution to this case with a non-negative PID that satisfies an inclusion-exclusion relation for any f-information measure. The decomposition is constructed from a pointwise perspective of the target variable to take advantage of the equivalence between the Blackwell and zonogon order in this setting. The zonogons correspond to the Neyman-Pearson region for an indicator variable of one target state and f-information is the expected value of quantifying its boundary. We prove that the decomposition satisfies the axioms of the original decomposition framework and guarantees non-negative partial information results. We highlight that our decomposition behaves differently depending on the used information measure, which can be utilized for different applications. We additionally show how our proposal can be used to obtain a non-negative decomposition of RÃ©nyi-information at a transformed inclusion-exclusion relation, and for tracing partial information flows through Markov chains.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ac8fe01a7cd9514966ff83444fa522883f8d012e49a86e2246441c21c087e35","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
