The application case is the composition DIAPHONIES of Michael Paouris. Sliding-window fractal analysis indicate areas of continuous fractality dipped in non-fractal areas of possibly deterministic and stochastic nature. Diverging cases of pronounced non-fractal areas are addressed and also areas of mixed fractality and non-fractality. Many segments exhibit persistency-P (2","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72f0887aa78424dec499e346a75c0aef466f98e14d51363728617f3a4be98e71","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
