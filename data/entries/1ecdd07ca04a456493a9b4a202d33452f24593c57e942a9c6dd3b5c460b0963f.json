{"title":"Layer-by-Layer-Processed All-Polymer Solar Cells with Enhanced Performance Enabled by Regulating the Microstructure of PYIT-OD Upper Layer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1115/v1","date":1715911965000,"content":"The layer-by-layer (LBL) fabrication method allows for controlled microstructure morphology and vertical component distribution, and also offers a reproducible and efficient technique for fabricating large-scale organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, polymer D18 and PYIT-OD are employed to fabricate all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) using the LBL method. Morphological studies reveal that the use of additives optimizes the microstructure of the active layer, enhancing the crystallinity and charge transport capability. The optimized device with 2% CN additive significantly reduces bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination. All-PSCs fabricated by the LBL method based on D18/PYIT-OD deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.07%. Our study demonstrates the great potential of additive engineering via LBL fabrication method in regulating microstructure of active layers, suppressing charge recombination, and enhancing the photovoltaic performance of devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ecdd07ca04a456493a9b4a202d33452f24593c57e942a9c6dd3b5c460b0963f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
