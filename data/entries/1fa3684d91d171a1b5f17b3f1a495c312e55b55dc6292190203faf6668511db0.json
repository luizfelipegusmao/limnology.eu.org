{"title":"Positive Selection Drives the Evolution of the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) Complex","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0076/v1","date":1722514424000,"content":"Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes are an evolutionary conserved protein family. In most eukaryotes, three SMC complexes have been characterized: cohesin, condensin, and SMC5-6 complexes. These complexes are involved in a plethora of functions and defects in SMC genes can lead to increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities, infertility, and cancer. To investigate th  evolution of SMC complex genes in mammals, we analyzed their selective patterns in an extended phylogeny. Signals of positive selection were identified for condensin NCAPG, for two SMC5/6 complex genes (SMC5 and NSMCE4A) and for all cohesin genes with almost exclusive meiotic expression (RAD21L1, REC8, SMC1B, and STAG3). For the latter, evolutionary rates correlate with expression during female meiosis and most positively selected sites fall in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Our results support growing evidence that IDRs are fast evolving and that most likely contribute to adaptation through modulation of phase separation. We suggest that the natural selection signals identified in SMC complexes may be the result of different selective pressures: a host-pathogen arms race in the condensin and SMC5/6 complexes, and an intragenomic conflict similar to that described for centromeres and telomeres for meiotic cohesin genes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1fa3684d91d171a1b5f17b3f1a495c312e55b55dc6292190203faf6668511db0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
