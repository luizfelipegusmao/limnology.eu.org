{"title":"Fabrication of Laminated Flooring Decorated by Resin Impregnated Paper with Improved Flame Retardant, High Wear-Resistant, Low Formaldehyde Emission","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0671/v1","date":1725876406000,"content":"A new type of laminated flooring decorated by resin impregnated paper was designed, with the advantages of high stability, low deformation, natural and beautiful surface texture, comfortable foot feeling, low formaldehyde emission, improved flame retardant, high surface hardness and high wear resistance. The structure of this engineered wood flooring is based on the ordinary laminated flooring, followed by a decorative layer of thin wood pieces, and then the transparent improved flame retardant, wear-resistant paper is added to the top. After main influencing factors analysis, the surface unevenness was seriously affect the flame-retardant performance. The wear-resistant paper pressing technology commonly affects the decorative effect of laminated flooring. The hot-pressing temperature is the most important factor affecting the adhesion of resin impregnated. The optimal hot-pressing parameters are selected as the hot-pressing pressure of 3.5 MPa, hot-pressing temperature of 180 ℃, and hot-pressing time of 40 s. The new laminated flooring was improved with high flame retardant, high wear-resistant, combined with the conventional advantages of both solid wood composite flooring and reinforced wood flooring. The new laminated flooring decorated by resin impregnated paper has broad application prospects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"48d74a9d11e8292f37f90a7b8c09f84acfe8a7f8f019d0a648c7076c46a2fa87","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
