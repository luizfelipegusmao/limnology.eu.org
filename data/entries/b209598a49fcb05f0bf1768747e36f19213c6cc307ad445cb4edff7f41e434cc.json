Additive manufacturing (AM) of NAB has revolutionized the production of intricate NAB components, promising unprecedented design flexibility and reduced material wastage [<a href=\"#ozae044.611-B2\">2-3</a>]. Here, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of NAB powder (specifically Cu-9.8Al-5.2Ni-4.6Fe-0.3Mn by wt. %), was optimized to manufacture dense AM specimens producing a net-shape component with very high cooling rates. As compared to conventional casting (0.1-100 K/s), the cooling rates during LBPF are significantly higher (10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>8</sup> K/s). Metals fabricated by LPBF can also be significantly stronger compared to their cast or wrought counterparts due to their refined microstructure [<a href=\"#ozae044.611-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b209598a49fcb05f0bf1768747e36f19213c6cc307ad445cb4edff7f41e434cc","category":"Environment"}
