{"title":"Design, Synthesis and In Vitro Analysis of New Vemurafenib Analogs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1757/v1","date":1714143538000,"content":"Metastatic melanoma patients have a poor prognosis with poor responsiveness to chemotherapy. BRAF V600E mutations have been detected in ~40% of melanoma patients. Vemurafenib is an oral agent licensed for patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive inoperable and metastatic melanoma, which already presents resistance that leads to patient relapse and the serious side effects. In our study, we synthesized 5 new vemurafenib analogs, RF-86A, RF-87A, RF-94A, RF-94B and RF-96B, with structural improve-ments, in order to increase the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effectâ€¯on human melanoma. We showed that the analogs were efficient in inducing cell death and reducing the migration of A375 cells, by inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity, indicating that this action may be longer lasting comparing to the action of Vemurafenib.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4db54a4f60bc2203c99a30e070b50427391472f20c11e35cc1629ee93b2f47a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
