{"title":"The Origin(s) of Luca: Computer Simulation of a New Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0599/v1","date":1728399477000,"content":"Carl Woese’s thesis of cellular evolution emphasized that the last universal common/cellular ancestor (LUCA) must have evolved by drawing from “global inventions”. Yet, existing theories regarding the origin(s) of LUCA have mostly centered upon scenarios that LUCA had evolved mostly independently. In an earlier paper, we have advanced a new thesis regarding the origin(s) of LUCA that extends Woese’s original insights. Our thesis centers upon the possibility that different vesicles and protocells can merge with and acquire each other as a form of variation, selection, and retention, driven by wet-and-dry cycles and other similar cyclical processes. In this paper, we use computer simulation to show that under a variety of simulated conditions, LUCA can indeed be produced by our proposed processes. We hope that our study can stimulate laboratory testing of some key hypotheses that vesicles’ absorption, acquisition, and merger has indeed been a central force in driving the evolution of LUCA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a39e7d1bfb18dd6d4aafabc70b2d0961ecbb669b0f29e9a82d5ed87bafd58270","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
