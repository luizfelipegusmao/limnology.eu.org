{"title":"Composite Dynamic Double Network Hydrogels with Rapid Self-healing, Stretchable, Moldable and Antibacterial Properties based on PVA/&epsilon;-Poly-L-lysine/Hyaluronic Acid","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0156/v1","date":1725350483000,"content":"Self-healing, stretchable and moldable hydrogels have a great potential application in tissue engineering and soft robotics. Despite great success in reported hydrogels, it is still a great challenge to construct the moldable hydrogels with an ultrafast self-healing performance. Herein, the dynamic double network (DN) composite hydrogels (PBLH) with ultrafast self-healing, stretchable and moldable were successfully constructed by poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA), borate, Îµ-poly-L-lysine (EPL) and hyaluronic acid (HA) based on an efficient one-pot method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction and rheological measurements confirmed the formation of dynamic double networks among PVA, B, EPL and HA through the cross-linking of dynamic borate bonds, electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding. Having fabricated the dynamic double network structure, the damage gap of the composite hydrogels can heal within 1 min, presenting an excellent self-healing ability. Simultaneously, the DN hydrogels can be molded to various shapes and the length of the DN hydrogels can be stretched to 15 times than original length. In addition, the DN hydrogels exhibited an excellent antibacterial property against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Our results illustrated that the DN composite hydrogels not only retain the advantages of traditional hydrogels, but also possess ultrafast self-healing, outstanding stretchable and antibacterial properties, presenting a prospective candidate for constructing biomedical materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"208223e4495546c394e4ee3565847328c07cbeee149e02db45fe7639fc289dca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
