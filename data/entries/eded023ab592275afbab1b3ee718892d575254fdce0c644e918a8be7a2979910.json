{"title":"Prophylactic Pattern Scanning Laser Retinal Photocoagulation for Diabetic Retinopathy in Spontaneously Diabetic Torii Fatty Rats: Preliminary Experimental Results","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0388/v1","date":1712238371000,"content":"The number of diabetic patients worldwide is increasing rapidly. Prevention of diabetic reti-nopathy (DR), a leading cause of blindness, is a serious issue. We examined the effects of prophy-lactic pattern scanning laser retinal photocoagulation on DR development in 16 Spontaneously Diabetic Torii (SDT) fatty rats. Photocoagulation was applied to the right eyes of 8-week SDT fatty rats, and the left eyes served as the untreated controls. Electroretinography at 9 and 39 weeks of age and pathological examination of the retinal thickness and number of retinal folds, and immunohistochemistry of vascular endothelial growth factor and glial fibrillary acidic pro-tein at 24 and 40 weeks of age were performed bilaterally. No significant differences were seen between the left and right eyes in the apex latency and the amplitude of the oscillatory potential wave in the SDT fatty rats at 9 and 39 weeks of age and in the pathology and immunohistochem-istry in the SDT fatty rats at 24 and 40 weeks of age. Prophylactic pattern scanning retinal laser photocoagulation did not affect the development of DR in SDT fatty rats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eded023ab592275afbab1b3ee718892d575254fdce0c644e918a8be7a2979910","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
