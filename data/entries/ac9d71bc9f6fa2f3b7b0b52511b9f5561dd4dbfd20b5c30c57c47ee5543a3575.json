{"title":"Determination of Crop Coefficients for Flood-Irrigated Winter Wheat in Southern New Mexico Using Three Contrasting ETo Estimation Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0673/v1","date":1720523302000,"content":"Crop coefficient (Kc), the ratio of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) to reference evapotranspiration (ETo), is used to schedule an efficient irrigation regime. This research was conducted to investigate variations of ETc and growth-stage-specific Kc in a flood-irrigated winter wheat as a forage crop from 2021 to 2023 in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of southern New Mexico, USA, and evaluate the performances of the two temperature-based ETo estimation methods of Hargreaves-Samani and Blaney-Criddle with the widely used Penman-Monteith method. Results indicated that the total ETc over the whole growth stage for flood-irrigated winter wheat was 556.4 mm on a two-year average, while the average deep percolation (DP) was 2.93 cm and 2.77 cm, accounting for 28.8% and 27.2% of applied irrigation water, respectively in the 2021-22 and 2022-23 growing seasons. The ETo over the growing season computed by Penman-Monteith, Hargreaves-Samani, and Blaney-Criddle equations were 867.0 mm, 1015.0 mm, and 856.2 mm in 2021-22, and 785.6 mm, 947.0 mm, and 800.1 mm in 2022-23, respectively. The Hargreaves-Samani method performed better than the Blaney-Criddle method with higher statistical indicators of model efficiency coefficient (CE), and smaller mean bias error (MBE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the root mean square error (RMSE) in both growing seasons. The result of a global sensitivity analysis showed that the mean temper-ature is main driving factor for estimated ETo based on Blaney-Criddle and Hargreaves-Samani, but the sensitivity percentage for Blaney-Criddle was 76.9%, which was much higher than that of 48.9% for Hargreaves-Samani, given that Blaney-Criddle method is less accurate in ETo estimation for this area especially during the hottest season from May to August. In contrast, wind speed and maximum temperature were the main driving factors for the Penman-Monteith method, with sensitivity percentages of 70.9% and 21.9%, respectively. The two-year average crop coefficient (Kc) values at the initial, mid, and late growth stage were 0.54, 1.1, and 0.54 based on Penman-Monteith, 0.51, 1.0 and 0.46 based on Blaney-Criddle, and 0.52, 1.2 and 0.56 based on Hargreaves-Samani. Results showed that the Hargreaves-Samani equation serves as an alternative tool to predict ETo when fewer meteorological variables are available. The calculated local growth-stage-specific Kc can help improve irrigation water management in this region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac9d71bc9f6fa2f3b7b0b52511b9f5561dd4dbfd20b5c30c57c47ee5543a3575","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
