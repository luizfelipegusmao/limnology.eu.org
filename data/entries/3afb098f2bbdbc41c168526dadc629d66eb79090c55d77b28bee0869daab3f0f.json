{"title":"The limits of the current consesus regarding the carbon footprint of photovoltaic modules manufactured in China: a review and case study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0793/v1","date":1720606131000,"content":"The transition to renewable energy sources is pivotal in addressing the escalating challenges of climate change and environmental degradation. Solar energy, particularly photovoltaic (PV) technology, stands out as a prominent solution due to its potential for clean and sustainable electricity generation with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. However, accurately assessing the carbon footprint of PV modules is essential for guiding policy, industry practices, and research. This paper reviews the state of current literature and highlights the difficulties in estimating the carbon footprint of PV modules manufactured in China. It emphasizes the inherent limitations of Process-Based Life Cycle Assessment (PLCA), including data collection challenges, dynamic environmental changes, and subjective methodological choices. The study underscores the need for improved transparency, standardization, and reproducibility in Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) to provide more accurate and reliable environmental impact evaluations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3afb098f2bbdbc41c168526dadc629d66eb79090c55d77b28bee0869daab3f0f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
