{"title":"Implications of SARS‐CoV‐2 Immunity in the Context of the Pathogenesis of COVID‐19, Immune Evasion of the Virus, and the Effectiveness of Vaccination","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1826/v1","date":1716878475000,"content":"Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 emerged in December 2019, significant research has been conducted around the world to understand the virus- and vaccine-generated immune response, and to identify the drivers of severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Although viral tropism is largely limited to the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to severe COVID-19 disease, which is characterized by multiorgan failure and permanent cognitive disorders. The combined effects of virus-mediated inhibition of host antiviral mechanisms and the recognition of pathogen-associated molecules by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are the main drivers in the pathogenesis of severe disease. The innate immune system constitutes the first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2 by limiting the entry of the virus into the host cell, suppressing viral replication, detecting virus-infected cells, and accelerating the formation of the adaptive immune response. The adaptive immune system is composed of two basic cells, B and T cells, which serve different but complementary functions in viral infections. Although the critical role of adaptive immunity in clearing SARS-CoV-2 infection is well known, its function in the development of virus-induced immunopathogenesis remains poorly understood. The basic characteristic of the humoral immune response is the creation of specific antibodies to each foreign antigen encountered. Antibodies that sense pathogens are classified as neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and non-neutralizing antibodies (non-nAbs) based on their capacity to neutralize pathogens and inhibit membrane fusion. While nAbs exert their activities by blocking ACE2-dependent viral entry into host cells and neutralizing pathogens, the functions of non-nAbs are often undetectable. The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum and mucosal tissues varies with the stage and severity of the COVID-19 infection. Although current COVID-19 vaccines elicit robust antibody responses, this effect decreases over time, due to the weakening of immunity and the emergence of novel variants that evade the antibody response, such as Delta and Omicron. SARS-CoV-2 may evade host innate immune surveillance by minimizing host recognition and interfering with cellular immune signaling. In this review article, the central role of host immune responses in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed in detail in the light of novel knowledge.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a2cd4703f64681e5e47ad7c13cbf9f1d361a19a8029859617970caaad9a6f4c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
