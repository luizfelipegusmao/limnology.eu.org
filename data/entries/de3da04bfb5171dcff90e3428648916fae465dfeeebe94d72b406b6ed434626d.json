Most flower strips are composed of perennial species. Despite their ecological benefits, perennial flower strips are not widely adopted. Barriers to adoption include the long-term commitment required and concerns about weeds. This study explores whether annual flower strips might be feasible for more farmers. We conducted an on-farm experiment on five commercial farms in New York, USA. On each farm, we established four treatments. At maize planting time, we seeded an early-established planting (EP) treatment with a commercial mix of annual flowers. An early-established control (EC) was set up at the same time with no seeding. Four weeks later, we prepared a new seedbed for late-established planting (LP) and late-established control (LC) treatments. We observed significant effects of planting on plant species richness and Shannon diversity (<i>F</i>-test, <i>p</i> &lt; .001). Planted treatments were more diverse than control treatments. However, there was no effect of establishment time on diversity. Both planting (<i>F</i>-test, <i>p</i> = .004) and establishment time (<i>F</i>-test, <i>p</i> = .04) affected the number of dicot species at the flowering stage, which was highest in the EP treatment. This flowering species richness was positively associated with spider abundance in sweep-net samples. Overall, our results demonstrate that annual flower strip establishment is possible even under weedy conditions. In addition, they show that a delay in planting date does not eliminate the benefits of this practice. This information could help farmers make informed, site-specific decisions about whether flower strips are a good fit for their farms.</p>","author":"Anna S. Westbrook, \nScott H.
