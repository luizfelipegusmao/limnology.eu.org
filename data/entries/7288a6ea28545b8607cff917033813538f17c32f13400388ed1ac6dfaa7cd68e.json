{"title":"Drastic changes in ground-dwelling beetle communities following high-intensity deer culling: insights from an island ecosystem","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/2/223/7613930?rss=1","date":1708819200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The overabundance of large herbivores can have detrimental effects on the local environment due to overgrazing. Culling is a common management practice implemented globally that can effectively control herbivore populations and allow vegetation communities to recover. However, the broader indirect effects of culling large herbivores remain relatively unknown, particularly on insect species such as ground-dwelling beetles that perform key ecosystem processes such as decomposition. Here we undertook a preliminary investigation to determine how culling sika deer on an island in North Japan impacted ground-beetle community dynamics. We conducted pitfall trapping in July and September in 2012 (before culling) and again in 2019 (after culling). We compared beetle abundance and community composition within 4 beetle families (Carabidae, Scarabaeidae, Geotrupidae, and Silphidae), across seasons and culling treatments. We found each family responded differently to deer culling. Scarabaeidae displayed the greatest decline in abundance after culling. Silphidae also had reduced abundance but to a lesser extent compared to Scarabaeidae. Carabidae had both higher and lower abundance after culling, depending on the season. We found beetle community composition differed between culling and season, but seasonal variability was reduced after culling. Overall, the culling of large herbivores resulted in a reduction of ground-dwelling beetle populations, particularly necrophagous species dependent on dung and carrion for survival. Our preliminary research highlights the need for long-term and large-scale experiments to understand the indirect ecological implications of culling programs on ecosystem processes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"7288a6ea28545b8607cff917033813538f17c32f13400388ed1ac6dfaa7cd68e","category":"Environment"}
