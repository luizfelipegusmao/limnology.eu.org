{"title":"Ethnobotanical Knowledge on Medicinal Plants Used For Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Northeastern Algeria: Application of Multivariate Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1333/v1","date":1729131685000,"content":"Algeria ranks second after Afghanistan for the incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis worldwide. As a result, it is critical to expand the traditional knowledge. Interviews were conducted with 21 herbalists in Annaba and El-Tarf provinces including 26 variables. The multiple correspondence analysis and the hierarchical clustering analysis were applied using the FactoMineR package. Nineteen species were reported and derived from thirteen plant families. Among them, the most important families were the Lamiaceae with five species. According to the Relative Frequency Citation value, the most famous species are the aerial parts of Teucrium polium L. (57.14%). Secondly, a data matrix for the species generated showed higher contribution values in the first dimension for the lack of the topical administration form, the presence of preparation’s mode by decoction and cataplasm, and the association of medicinal plants specifically with olive oil and honey, respectively. The analysis of the first dimension demonstrates a high association for three variables: Ta_F, Oa_F, and Dec_MP, with correlation ratios η2 of 6.261E-01, 5.501E-01, and 4.772E-01 (p&amp;lt;0.05), respectively. Finally, the cluster analysis of species identified three clusters discriminated by the administration form per os with a p-value of 7.49E-05 (p&amp;lt;0.05).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"522951135f60940902a3c7f5fbf26030b5ba029456b07ecc5c7a76aa56efea67","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
