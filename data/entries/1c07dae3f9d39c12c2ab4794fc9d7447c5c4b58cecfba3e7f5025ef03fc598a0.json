{"title":"Short-Term Follow-Up Results of Adolescent Mallet Finger Treated by Extension Block Technique","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0990/v1","date":1718704242000,"content":"Background: Pediatric mallet finger injuries lack specific treatment guidelines, necessitating an exploration of effective techniques. Our aim was to evaluate the outcomes of the extension block technique in adolescent mallet finger management. Methods: A comprehensive retrospective analysis was conducted involving 36 adolescents who underwent surgery between 2014 and 2022. Ishiguro’s extension block pinning technique was the primary method employed. Treatment outcomes were evaluated using Crawford's criteria, and complications were also assessed. Results: Bone union was achieved in all cases with a mean union time of 42 days (range: 30-92 days). According to Crawford's criteria, 27 cases (75%) were classified as excellent, 5 cases (14%) as good, and 4 cases (11%) as fair. Minimal complications were observed, including three cases (8%) of superficial infections, one case (3%) of dermal necrosis, and another rare instance (3%) of osteomyelitis. No cases of poor outcomes or significant long-term complications were noted. The average follow-up period was 8.6 months (range: 2-42 months). Conclusions: Ishiguro’s extension block technique is a promising surgical option for adolescent mallet fingers. Its adoption could enhance pediatric orthopedic care, offering a valuable child-friendly treatment alternative.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1c07dae3f9d39c12c2ab4794fc9d7447c5c4b58cecfba3e7f5025ef03fc598a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
