{"title":"Evolutionary history of Magnolia sect. Talauma (Magnoliaceae) in Cuba","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/140/3/413/7324800?rss=1","date":1697673600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Evolutionary biologists recognize that understanding the phylogenetic history of closely related species is challenging without considering their population genetics history. The taxonomy of <span>Magnolia</span> sect. <span>Talauma</span> in Cuba has long been debated, with several changes in taxon delimitations. All these taxonomic revisions were based exclusively on leaf morphological characteristics of a few individuals, limiting their ability to elucidate taxon boundaries. Recent studies have focused on conservation genetics and species delimitation of Cuban magnolias, based on ecological, morphological and genetic data. Here, we use full plastome sequences and microsatellite data to infer phylogenetic relationships and potential historical migration events among species in <span>Magnolia</span> sect. <span>Talauma</span> in Cuba. Bayesian phylogeny and TreeMix were used to understand the phylogenetic relationships. Based on this, <span>Magnolia</span> sect. <span>Talauma</span> in Cuba does not comprise a monophyletic group. The data continue to show a highly supported unresolved species complex in the taxa of <span>Magnolia</span> subsect. <span>Talauma</span> from north-eastern Cuba. From a taxonomic point of view, our results do not entirely support the most recent taxonomic review proposed for the family in Cuba.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"a562c38dba04069355c7094b5bcac39014c3294fe8c19bf1a881ce6708e23c4f","category":"Environment"}
