{"title":"Impact of Optimization Variables on Fuel Consumption in Large Four-Stroke Diesel Marine Engines with Electrically Divided Turbochargers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2310/v1","date":1727598639000,"content":"This study investigates the effect of different variables in the optimization of a hybrid air charging systems for marine diesel engines, exploring the potential for energy recovery and assistance using electric machines. The optimization parameters include turbine speed, compressor power, start of injection, turbomachine size, and valve timing. At low engine speeds, the larger improvements come from increasing compressor power, which increases air-to-fuel ratio compared with the baseline turbocharging. As free-floating turbocharged engines are known to have low air-to-fuel ratio at low engine speeds, the relative improvement of the hybrid architecture is large at low engine speeds, being near to 10% less BSFC. At high engine speeds, the largest influence is marked by the SOI, an early injection obtains a faster combustion, which improves gross efficiency. However, the relative improvement compared with baseline turbocharger is less than 1% at high engine speeds. Due to the distribution of relative improvement of BSFC, this architecture has a deeper impact on fuel consumption in vessel operating cycles that focus on low engine speeds and loads, such as those of tugboats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e839ecd7fbb4596f44c1547bc5fd7fe6fb85114298b976358c66dd153b5174c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
