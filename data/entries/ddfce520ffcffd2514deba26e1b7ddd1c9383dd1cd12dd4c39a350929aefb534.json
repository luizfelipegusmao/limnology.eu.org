{"title":"Interplay of Physical Exercise with Leptin and Ghrelin Alterations After Roux-en-Y-Gastric Bypass in Patients with Sarcopenic Obesity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1886/v1","date":1727163940000,"content":"Introduction: Leptin and ghrelin are two hormones that play a role in weight homeostasis. Leptin, which is produced primarily by adipocytes and is dependent on body fat mass, suppresses appetite and increases energy expenditure. Conversely, ghrelin is the “hunger hormone”, it stimulates appetite and promotes fat storage. Bariatric surgery significantly alters the levels and activity of these hormones, contributing to weight loss and metabolic improvements. Clarifying the interplay between bariatric surgery, weight loss, physical exercise, leptin, and ghrelin is essential for developing comprehensive strategies for optimizing long-term outcomes for candidates for bariatric surgery, especially sarcopenic patients.\nMethods: This was a randomized controlled study with two groups (n=22). The patients in both groups have obesity and sarcopenia. A Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass (RYGB) procedure was performed in all patients. The intervention group participated in a structured exercise program three times per week beginning one month after surgery and lasting 16 weeks. Patient assessment was performed before surgery (baseline) and after completion of the exercise program. The control group received the usual standard of care and was assessed similarly.\nResults: After surgery, weight, BMI and lean mass decreased significantly in both groups from baseline to the second assessment. Leptin was not significantly different from baseline to the second assessment in the physical exercise group but was significantly lower in the control group (p=0.05). Ghrelin increased over time in both groups, but the differences were not significant. When we associated leptin (the dependent variable) with weight (the independent variable), we found that lower weight was associated with lower leptin levels. A similar relationship was also observed between leptin and sarcopenia parameters (muscle strength and mass), as well as with bone health parameters (bone mineral density and t-score). Higher ghrelin levels were significantly associated with higher t-scores and z-score (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ddfce520ffcffd2514deba26e1b7ddd1c9383dd1cd12dd4c39a350929aefb534","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
