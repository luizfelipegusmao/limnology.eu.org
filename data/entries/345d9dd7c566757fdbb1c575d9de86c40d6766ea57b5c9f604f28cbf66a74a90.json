However, aquaculture of Asian seabass is limited by infectious diseases. One of the most serious diseases is photobacteriosis, caused by <i>Photobacterium damselae</i>. Vaccination is recognized as an efficient disease prevention and pathogen control method for strengthening the aquaculture industry. To promote vaccine development, the characterization of pathogenic bacteria and their pathogenesis is required. In this study, isolates of <i>P. damselae</i> were obtained from commercial aquaculture farms in Thailand during 2019–2021. Analyses of 16S rRNA and the urease subunit alpha genes identified the isolates as <i>P. damselae</i> subsp. <i>damselae</i> (<i>Phdd</i>). Antibiotic susceptibility analyses showed that all <i>Phdd</i> isolates were resistant to amoxicillin (10 μg). Haemolysis and phospholipase activities were used to categorize <i>P. damselae</i> into three groups based on their biological activities. The pathogenicity of four candidates (SK136, PD001, PD002 and T11L) was tested in Asian seabass. Isolate SK136 showed the highest virulence, with a lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) of 1.47 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/fish, whereas isolate PD001 did not show any virulence. Genotypic characterization, based on multi-locus sequence typing analysis, demonstrated that all candidates were novel strains with new sequence types (64, 65, 66 and 67). Preliminary vaccination using formalin-killed cells (FKCs) protected Asian seabass from artificial challenges. Taken together, these results provide fundamental knowledge for vaccine development against <i>Phdd</i> infection in Asian seabass.</p>","author":"Warisara Weawsawang, \nTheeyathart Homsombat, \nSaransiri Nuanmanee, \nNattakan Saleetid, \nJumroensri Thawonsuwan, \nAnsaya Pumchan, \nIkuo Hirono, \nHidehiro Kondo, \nSasimanas Unajak","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"345d9dd7c566757fdbb1c575d9de86c40d6766ea57b5c9f604f28cbf66a74a90","category":"Environment"}
