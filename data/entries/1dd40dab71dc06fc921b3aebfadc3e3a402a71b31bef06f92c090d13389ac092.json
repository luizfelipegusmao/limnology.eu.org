{"title":"Reply to Le&oacute;n et al. (2024): Interpretation and Use of In-Field Diagnostics for High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Antarctica&ndash; A Cautionary Tale","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1498/v1","date":1713843040000,"content":"High pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b continues to have a substantial impact on wildlife, globally. A recent study has described the putative detection of HPAI in clinically healthy penguins, and those which were fitted with satellite tags reportedly engaged in apparently normal foraging behaviour in the months following sample collection. Herein we investigate the diagnostic approach utilised, and reveal that while the authors likely did detect subtype H5 influenza A virus, the most parsimonious conclusion is that they detected low pathogenicity H5 rather than HPAI H5N1. In response, we have provided an overview key considerations when selecting a diagnostic and outline published diagnostic assays that should be considered for future studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1dd40dab71dc06fc921b3aebfadc3e3a402a71b31bef06f92c090d13389ac092","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
