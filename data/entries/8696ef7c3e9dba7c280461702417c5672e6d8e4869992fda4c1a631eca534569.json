Due to its combination of high mineral content (∼96 wt%) together with its complex three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure across length scales, enamel is the hardest tissue in the human body (∼2-6 GPa). Despite this remarkable hardness, loss and/or functional impairment of its structure with time still occurs, which has a significant impact on health and quality of life, in addition to the associated substantial costs to society.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8696ef7c3e9dba7c280461702417c5672e6d8e4869992fda4c1a631eca534569","category":"Environment"}
