{"title":"407 Transition from the ranch to the feedyard: Challenges and management strategies to improve calf health welfare and performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/97/7757086?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The health, welfare and performance of newly received feedlot calves is intricately connected to their pre- and post-weaning management as well as how they are transitioned from the ranch to the feedyard. Industry data suggest that despite prophylactic antimicrobial use in receiving calves the incidence of respiratory related morbidity and mortality has remained unchanged in Canadian feedyards for the past 4 decades. It is well established that any management practice causing stress or pain has an immunosuppressive effect thereby increasing the risk of calf morbidity and mortality and reducing performance efficiency. There are several factors that could contribute to this including, if and or how preconditioning is conducted, comingling at assembly yards or auctions and number of calf sources, and the distance calves are transported and the effects of rest. The impacts of other timely and relevant factors such as environmental conditions (rapid and extreme weather/temperature changes) and cattle type (dairy beef or dairy beef cross) will also be covered. Studies assessing these impacts on receiving calf health, welfare and performance as well as potential strategies for mitigating negative effects will be discussed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"5bc2e66b8f200b70eca3a22e886f57bbd8495f7013000765dd246e9365147006","category":"Environment"}
