{"title":"Laplace-Logistic Unit Distribution with Application in Dynamic and Regression Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0260/v1","date":1717575917000,"content":"This manuscript presents a new two-parameter unit stochastic distribution, obtained by transforming the Laplace distribution, using generalized logistic map, into a unit interval. The distribution thus obtained is named the Laplace-logistic unit (abbreviated LLU) distribution, and its basic stochastic properties are examined in detail. Also, the procedure for estimating parameters based on quantiles is provided, along with the asymptotic properties of the obtained estimates and the appropriate numerical simulation study. Finally, the application of the LLU distribution in dynamic and regression analysis of real-world data with accentuated \"peaks\" and \"fat\" tails is also discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"35e55b9ce29199320b62769f02a5683903a582d286ac7a2cc948b9d33c715172","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
