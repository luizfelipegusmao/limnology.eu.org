{"title":"Design and Characterization of a Wearable Inertial Measurement Unit","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2312/v1","date":1722251342000,"content":"The utilization of inertial measurement units (IMUs) as wearable sensors is proliferating 1 across various domains such as healthcare, sports, and rehabilitation. This expansion is driven by 2 the continuous improvement of sensor technology to accommodate specific operational demands. 3 This paper introduces the development of a configurable wearable device capable of capturing both 4 high-frequency and low-frequency signals, tailored for a wide range of monitoring applications.Our 5 focus is on a comprehensive evaluation of the device in terms of deviation, noise levels, and precision. 6 We present initial findings that demonstrate the deviceâ€™s robust performance, and put on the spotlight 7 the most critical optimizations needed to improve the device to reach the goal of a smart general-use 8 unit for human motion monitoring.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c610270f5b8f91809e500565c851430db1b1a7a9685afc985d820333c451673e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
