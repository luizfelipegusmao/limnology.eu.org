{"title":"Epidemiology and regional variance of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries in Sweden: A 15-year observational study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310988","date":1728482400000,"content":"<p>by Martin Magnéli, Michael Axenhus</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Traumatic peripheral nerve injuries pose significant challenges to healthcare systems and individuals, affecting sensory function, causing neuropathic pain, and impairing quality of life. Despite their impact, comprehensive studies on the epidemiology and regional variance of these injuries are scarce. Understanding the incidence, trends, and anatomical distribution of such injuries is essential for targeted interventions and resource allocation.</p> Methods <p>This observational study utilized register-based data from the Swedish National Patient Register covering the period from 2008 to 2022. Incidence rates, trends, and anatomical distribution of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Poisson regression modeling, and regional comparisons.</p> Results <p>Higher incidences of peripheral nerve injuries were observed among men compared to women across all age groups. The hand and wrist were the most commonly affected sites. Regional variations in incidence rates were evident, with some regions consistently exhibiting higher rates compared to others. Notably, a decreasing trend in injuries was observed over the study period.</p> Conclusion <p>This study underscores the importance of targeted interventions and preventive strategies, considering sex, age, and regional disparities. Further research incorporating individual patient-level data is warranted to enhance our understanding and inform tailored interventions to reduce the burden of these injuries.</p>","author":"Martin Magnéli","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2cac31f8ffb3344e1d4205dd22b01defda6bb5e43ff761c2feea7f5ca50097a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
