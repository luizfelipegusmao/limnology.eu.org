It is estimated by the UN that in 2050 the world’s populace may be as much as 9.8 billion global, yet, farmers still face several obstacles, which includes soil degradation, extreme temperatures, and drought which as increasingly becoming more severe with climate changes. Plant health monitoring is a method that will help to increase awareness about plant enhancing by studying how to increase crop yields while decreasing the environmental impacts. The use of low-cost, controlled environments, soil quality, water levels, and pathogenic and pests attacks can be regularly monitored. Currently, several diagnostic technologies and portable point-of-use methods and technologies are employed for detection of diseases, although, the current available lab-based methods used for plant’s diagnostics test are inadequate for plant point-of-use monitoring. The promotion of use of these point of use methods will enable pathogen detection, poor plant growth, unsuitable environmental conditions and nutrient use efficiency allowing for immediate and timely corrective actions to ensure minimal damage to the plants with maximal yield. Increase in the use of sustainable agri practices are required for ensuring higher yields with minimal inputs and that are non-destructive to the land and the use of improved methodologies and technologies will be useful tools for achieving sustainable agriculture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f2dad3f2bdc1432df2a537f28aaa2f7f6167baf7ebb1e5e79ee0e4cb0ac50a59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
