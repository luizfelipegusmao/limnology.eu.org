{"title":"Longitudinal Recovery of Suspended Sediment Downstream of Large Dams in the US","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036759?af=R","date":1718175600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Dams disrupt the natural flow of water and sediment along rivers. Reservoirs trap a significant amount of sediment, which substantially alters downstream hydrology, channel morphology, and sediment transport capacity. The longitudinal recovery of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) along rivers is potentially a new metric for estimating downstream responses to dams over space, rather than time, but is rarely quantified due to the lack of spatial SSC data. Satellites can estimate SSC along rivers where no field data exist and provide a high enough spatial resolution for assessing downstream recovery at the scale of tens to hundreds of kilometers. Here, we use a recently published database of spatially explicit SSC observations derived from Landsat to quantify if a river recovers or not, the SSC recovery percentage, and SSC recovery length downstream of large dams across the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Rivers recover SSC downstream of most dams (71%). The chance of a river recovering and the length of river required to recover SSC is associated primarily with the size of the reservoir (mean storage, km<sup>3</sup>) and the size of the river (mean discharge, m<sup>3</sup>/s). Rivers were more likely to recover SSC downstream of run-of-river, navigation dams compared to large storage or hydropower dams. Our results suggest that rivers typically recover suspended sediment downstream of dams, influenced by factors like dam storage, purpose, and river channel characteristics.</p>","author":"R.
