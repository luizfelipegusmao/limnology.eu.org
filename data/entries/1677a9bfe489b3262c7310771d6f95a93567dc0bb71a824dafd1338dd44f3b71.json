{"title":"Open-source-based Approach to Delineate the Shoreline from Space: A Case Study in Failaka Island, the State of Kuwait","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202212.0156/v2","date":1717667405000,"content":"Researchers need to delineate the shoreline for different applications with no access to costly resources such as topographic maps and high-resolution satellite images. With the increase of open source data, this study aims to present a methodology to use open source data in the best possible way to map the shoreline. Several methods have been tested using open source remote sensing data (Landsat and Aster), such as supervised classification, unsupervised classification, manual mapping, and by applying some spectral indices, among others. The accuracy of the extracted shoreline data was verified using high-resolution open database images (such as Google Earth basemap). The results showed that the manually mapped shoreline through applying spectral index (green- near infrared/green+ near infrared) is the most accurate, although it remains important to modify it using high-resolution images of open databases. Open-source data showed acceptable accuracy in mapping the shoreline.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1677a9bfe489b3262c7310771d6f95a93567dc0bb71a824dafd1338dd44f3b71","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
