{"title":"High inter-population connectivity and occasional gene flow between subspecies improves recovery potential for the endangered Least Bell’s Vireo","link":"https://academic.oup.com/condor/article/doi/10.1093/ornithapp/duae009/7754277?rss=1","date":1708905600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Increasingly, genomic data are being used to supplement field-based ecological studies to help evaluate recovery status and trends in endangered species. We collected genomic data to address 2 related questions regarding the Least Bell’s Vireo (<span>Vireo bellii</span>), an endangered migratory songbird restricted to southern California riparian habitat for breeding. First, we sought to delineate the range limits and potential overlap between Least Bell’s Vireo and its sister subspecies, the Arizona Bell’s Vireo, by analyzing samples from the deserts of eastern California, southwestern Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. Second, we evaluated genetic structure among Least Bell’s Vireo populations in coastal California and estimated effective population size. Clustering analyses based on 10,571 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 317 samples supported 2 major groups that aligned closely to the previously defined subspecies ranges. The first cluster included birds in the Central Valley, all coastal drainages, and westernmost deserts of California, with no further sub-structuring among coastal drainages. Almost all birds from the Amargosa River in eastern California and eastward assigned to the second cluster; however, low levels of gene flow were detected across the subspecies groups, with greater rates of gene flow from Arizona Bell’s Vireo to Least Bell’s Vireo than the reverse. Admixed individuals occurred in the California deserts; and although smaller than coastal populations, desert populations may be important for maintaining and replenishing genetic diversity and facilitating the movement of potentially adaptive genes between subspecies. Within Least Bell’s Vireo, local populations in coastal drainages comprised a single genetic population, with some evidence of close relatives distributed across drainages, suggesting that these could function as a well-connected metapopulation. These results are consistent with previous Least Bell’s Vireo banding studies that reported high rates of dispersal among drainages. Effective population size for both subspecies was high, suggesting that adaptive potential has been maintained despite previous declines.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Ornithological Applications Current Issue","siteHash":"0adf13706282b3ccfec74e0cd9d72c5688cecb6af30a6dfa64315dbe0b12427f","entryHash":"2e0d11604de815022fe834fd3fa4869399969b5c86ed5fc859864cf8ede48408","category":"Environment"}
