{"title":"Associations between Polish school principals’ health literacy and implementation of the Health Promoting School approach during the COVID-19 pandemic","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301055","date":1712066400000,"content":"<p>by Karina Leksy, Grzegorz Gawron, Rafaela Rosário</p>\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus pandemic has contributed to increasing the responsibility of school principals for the health of all school community members. Moreover, evidence confirms the significant role of school principals’ health literacy (HL) for health promotion in schools. Therefore, the presented study aims to evaluate the associations between Polish school principals HL and the implementation of the Health Promoting School (HPS) approach in Polish schools. The present study was conducted as part of an international survey on the global COVID-HL network (www.covid-hl.eu) between June 2021 and December 2021. Three subscales of the HPS were considered and an exploratory analysis were used in this study. Associations between the median split of each subscale of HPS (outcome) and health literacy (predictor) were performed using logistic regression. Research results showed that the highest level of HPS implementation was directed at pupils. Principals perceived themselves as having the highest HL on the ‘accessibility’ subscale and these respondents had significantly higher odds of implementing learning opportunities for students. The study suggests that principals with adequate HL may be more likely to effectively implement HPS strategies in schools. This research could provide insights into the complex interplay between HL and the HPS approach and inform the development of more effective strategies for promoting health and HL in schools.","author":"Karina Leksy","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"deb26692fb9287df8d7d16bde042efb9d692d2ceac8187541f09a82655e8ff21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
