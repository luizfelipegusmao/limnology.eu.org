{"title":"Impact of social network composition on cognitive decline: Digital Dementia Registry Bavaria (digiDEM Bayern)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306447","date":1720792800000,"content":"<p>by Lisa Laininger, Nikolas Dietzel, Elmar Graessel, Hans-Ulrich Prokosch, Peter L. Kolominsky-Rabas</p>\r\nBackground <p>Currently, there is no curative treatment for dementia. The implementation of preventive measures is of great importance. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and address individual and modifiable risk factors. Social isolation, defined through social networks, is a factor that may influence the onset and progression of the disease. The networks of older people are mostly composed of either family or friends. The aim of this study is to examine the influence of social isolation and network composition on cognition over the course of 12 months in people with cognitive impairment.</p> Methods <p>Data basis is the multicentre, prospective, longitudinal register study ‘Digital Dementia Registery Bavaria—digiDEM Bayern‘. The degree of social isolation was assessed using the Lubben Social Network Scale- Revised (LSNS-R) and the degree of cognitive impairment using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), conducted at baseline and after 12 months. Data were analysed using pre-post ANCOVA, adjusted for baseline MMSE, age, gender, education, living situation and Barthel-Index.</p> Results <p>106 subjects (78.9 ± 8.2 years; 66% female) were included in the analysis. The mean MMSE score at baseline was 24.3 (SD = 3.6). Within the friendship subscore, risk for social isolation was highly prevalent (42.5%). Though, there was no difference between individuals with higher/ lower risk of social isolation within the friendship-network after adjusting for common risk factors in cognitive decline over time, F (1,98) = .046, p = .831, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .000.</p> Conclusion <p>The results of this study showed that the risk of social isolation from friends is very high among people with cognitive impairment. However, social isolation does not appear to have a bearing influence on the course of cognition. Nevertheless, it is important for people with cognitive impairment to promote and maintain close social contacts with friends.</p>","author":"Lisa Laininger","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"350134f9fede1c596818724f75b6311f9fb03229a0afe89e9bbbcd4db30bc44b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
