{"title":"The Influence of Solid Heat Carrier Load of Char on Pyrolysis Characteristics of Pulverized Coal in a Fluidized Bed Reactor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0677/v1","date":1712712364000,"content":"Pulverized coal pyrolysis based on solid heat carrier has a huge advantage in high tar yield. In this study, pyrolysis experiments of pulverized coal were conducted in a lab-scale fluidized bed reactor at 650 â„ƒ, utilizing char as the solid heat carrier. The influence of mass ratio of char to coal (RATIO) was investigated. Results show that the incorporation of solid heat carrier of char significantly enhanced the initial reaction in coal pyrolysis, resulting in increasing yields of tar and gas but reducing one of char. The yield of tar maximally reached 148.80-262.22% of the Gray-King analysis value at the RATIO of 14.52 g/g. As the RATIO increased, the tar contained more light component content, indicating that incorporating solid heat carriers improved the tar quality. These findings offer significant insights for the design of fluidized bed pyrolysis unit utilizing char as solid heat carrier.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bcc6c0e2efc29972363c80dc4cfb657eccf09347a4ec8adeb2866578ed60d1ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
