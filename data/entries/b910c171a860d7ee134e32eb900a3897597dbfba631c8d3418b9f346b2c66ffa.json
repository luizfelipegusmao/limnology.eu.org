{"title":"Comparison of Model Systems for Emulating Human Tissue and Physiology in Psychiatric Research","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0270/v1","date":1722847127000,"content":"The modeling of psychiatric disorders poses significant challenges due to the complex nature of these conditions, which encompass a range of neuropsychiatric diseases such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression. The rising global prevalence of mental disorders and the urgency for more effective treatments have propelled the development of innovative in vitro models. This review presents a thorough examination of two-dimensional (2D) versus three-dimensional (3D) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of neuropsychiatric diseases, offering insights into their respective capacities to mimic neurodevelopment and cellular phenotypes observed in these conditions. Our comparative analysis reveals that while traditional 2D cultures have been instrumental in elucidating disease pathways and high-throughput drug screening, they fall short in replicating the intricate cellular architecture and environment of the human brain. On the other hand, 3D organoid models, including brain organoids, better recapitulate the spatial organization, cell-type diversity, and functional connectivity of brain tissue, offering a more physiologically relevant context for studying disease mechanisms and testing therapeutic interventions. We assess the progress in modeling ASD, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, PTSD, and depression, highlighting the advanced understanding of disease etiology and potential treatment avenues offered by 3D iPSC technologies. Challenges remain, including the scalability, reproducibility, and maturation of organoids, but the potential for personalized medicine and the elucidation of disease ontogeny is unparalleled. The review concludes with a perspective on the future directions of psychiatric disease modeling, emphasizing the integration of 3D iPSC models with high-throughput technologies and computational approaches to enhance our understanding and treatment of these debilitating conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b910c171a860d7ee134e32eb900a3897597dbfba631c8d3418b9f346b2c66ffa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
