{"title":"Three-Dimensional Exploding Light Wave Packets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1477/v1","date":1716451602000,"content":"We describe a family of paraxial and quasi-monochromatic optical wave packets with finite energy and smoothly shaped amplitude in space and time that develops a singularity in the intensity when spatiotemporally focused by imparting a converging spherical wave front and a negative temporal chirp. This singular behavior upon ideal focusing is manifested in actual focusing with finite apertures and in media with high-order dispersion in an \"exploding\" behavior featuring indefinitely increasing concentration of the energy when opening the aperture radius, thus exercising a continuous control on the focal intensity and spatial and temporal resolution. These wave packets offer a new way of focusing that outperforms what can be achieved with standard Gaussian wave packets in terms of focal intensity and resolution, and new possibilities in applications where energy concentration and its control are crucial.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"376594d8f0604e523c425ff06285f85132185d327db8820df813133580f61af2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
