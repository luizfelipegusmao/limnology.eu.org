{"title":"Diagnostic Investigations and Genetic Analysis of Coronavirus, Herpesvirus and Lyssavirus in Bats Located in Tuscany and Latium, Italy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0339/v1","date":1715062661000,"content":"Chiroptera includes of over 1,400 bat species with at least 35 of these present in Italy. Due to their role as lyssavirus reservoirs, in Italy, dead bats and oral swabs are routinely submitted to the laboratory network of the Istituti Zooprofilattici Sperimentali within in the framework of the rabies national passive and active surveillance programme. Carcasses and biological samples collected from January to December 2021 in Latium and Tuscany Regions were further screened for the presence of Coronaviruses (CoVs) and Herpesviruses, using pan-family virus PCR tests and relative PCR products were Sanger sequenced. Subsequent to the viral investigations, genetic bat species was also carried out. Viral characterization detected AlphaCoVs in Miniopterus schreibersii and Beta- and Gamma-Herpesviruses in Tadarida Teniotis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"677a72d7ae0113e76d8ed4c0d377f39d237f6dc6d34554f76b4a6ebd9d68f924","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
