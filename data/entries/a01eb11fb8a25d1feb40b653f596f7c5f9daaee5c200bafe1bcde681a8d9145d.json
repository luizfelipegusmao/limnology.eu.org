{"title":"Is It Useful to Repeat Blood Cultures in Endocarditis Patients? A Critical Appraisal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1034/v1","date":1718379812000,"content":"Background: for patients with endocarditis, guidelines recommend repeating blood cultures until they become negative, but with very limited evidence. Methods: a literature review was done on the incidence and duration of persistent bacteremia and persistent fever in endocarditis patients, compared to their associations with persistent infection at day 7. Results: persistent bacteremia and persistent fever are common in the first few days after starting antibiotic therapy, a normal duration for either at or around &lt; 3-7 days. Persistent bacteremia is more prevalent and longer lasting in Staphylococcus (especially MRSA) and Enterococcus species than in Streptococcus species. In one study the risk for persistent infection at day 7 was 50% in those with positive blood cultures at 48-72 hours while it was 32% in those with negativization of blood cultures. Both persistent bacteremia at 48-72 hours and persistent infection at day 7 are predictive of in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: persistent bacteremia after treatment for endocarditis is common and often accompanied by persistent fever. Persistent infection at 7 days (as indication for urgent surgery) cannot be reliably predicted by positive or negative blood cultures at 48-72 hours. The recommendation of performing survey blood cultures in all patients therefore needs to be reconsidered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a01eb11fb8a25d1feb40b653f596f7c5f9daaee5c200bafe1bcde681a8d9145d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
