{"title":"Candidiasis in Choloepus sp. &ndash; a Review of New Advances on the Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0375/v1","date":1720095490000,"content":"Candidiasis is a significant fungal infection caused by various species of the genus Candida, posing health challenges to a wide range of animals, including Choloepus species (two-toed sloths). This review article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of candidiasis in Choloepus sp., highlighting the etiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies.The article begins by examining the causative agents, primarily focusing on Candida albicans, which is the most commonly implicated species in candidiasis. The epidemiological aspects are discussed, emphasizing the prevalence of candidiasis in wild and captive Choloepus populations and identifying predisposing factors such as immunosuppression, stress, poor nutrition, and environmental conditions. Pathogenesis is explored, detailing the mechanisms through which Candida species invade host tissues and evade immune responses. Clinical manifestations in Choloepus sp. are described, including oral thrush, cutaneous lesions, and gastrointestinal infections, and their impact on the health and behavior of affected individuals. Diagnostic methods, including culture techniques, histopathology, and molecular assays, are reviewed to highlight their roles in accurately identifying Candida infections. The article also covers treatment options, focusing on antifungal therapies and supportive care tailored to the unique physiology of Choloepus sp. Finally, prevention and management strategies are discussed, emphasizing the importance of maintaining optimal husbandry practices, regular health monitoring, and early intervention to reduce the incidence and impact of candidiasis in Choloepus populations. This review underscores the need for further research to enhance our understanding of candidiasis and improve health outcomes for these unique and vulnerable animals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d376f0b221dd461f660895cf1d7ba53b6dc72073382c2ce72e0da957483f0dd1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
