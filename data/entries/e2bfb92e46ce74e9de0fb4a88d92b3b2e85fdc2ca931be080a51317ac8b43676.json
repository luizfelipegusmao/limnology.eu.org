{"title":"Salvage Logging and Secondary Succession Promote Spider Diversity in Post-disturbance Stands in Western Germany","link":"https://academic.oup.com/forestscience/article/70/3/202/7637457?rss=1","date":1711670400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Climate change and biodiversity loss strongly affect ecosystems. In recent years, forests have suffered substantially from climate-induced disturbances resulting in bark beetle outbreaks in coniferous forests. In forest plantations, such disturbances often cause large-scale diebacks, which are frequently salvage-logged. However, the consequences of natural disturbances and subsequent management for forest biodiversity and ecosystem services within plantations are largely unclear. Because they comprise good bioindicators for forest alterations, we here investigated epigeal spider diversity and community composition of three post-disturbance management approaches in former spruce plantations in western Germany. Taxonomic diversity of spiders was significantly enhanced on salvage-logged and secondary succession compared with standing deadwood sites. Nevertheless, the latter provided a refuge for forest specialists, moisture and shade-loving as well as smaller species, whereas the other two management categories were mostly inhabited by larger spiders associated with open habitats. Because all three post-disturbance management approaches harbored highly distinct spider communities and divergent functional guilds, we propose the application of a variety of management approaches for bark beetle-affected spruce plantations. The resulting habitat heterogeneity will likely enhance the biodiversity of spiders and other taxonomic groups.<strong>Study Implications</strong>: Bark beetle outbreaks became severe disturbances in spruce plantations. The management of affected stands usually aims at mitigating economic losses, but within the current biodiversity crisis, it is increasingly important to consider ecological consequences. This study shows that salvage logging or secondary succession can increase spider taxonomic diversity, although forest species preferred standing deadwood sites. All management categories harbored highly distinct spider assemblages characterized by different ecological and functional guilds. Our results indicated that spider communities were influenced by canopy openness, microclimate, and competition rather than post-disturbance management. Therefore, management practices should include diverse approaches to foster many different spider assemblages.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Forest Science Current Issue","siteHash":"05e2fee9ae6a27cd288c89ae75adf607539d339849a171c4fab1eaa2f11b4162","entryHash":"e2bfb92e46ce74e9de0fb4a88d92b3b2e85fdc2ca931be080a51317ac8b43676","category":"Environment"}
