In the United States, individuals living with diabetes represent over 17 million emergency department visits and 8 million admissions annually. The management of these patients in the hospital setting is complex and differs considerably from the outpatient setting. All patients with hyperglycemia should be screened for diabetes, as in-hospital hyperglycemia portends a greater risk for morbidity, mortality, admission to an intensive care unit, and increased hospital length of stay. However, the definition of hyperglycemia, glycemic targets, and strategies to manage hyperglycemia in the inpatient setting can vary greatly depending on the population considered. Moreover, the presenting illness, changing nutritional status, and concurrent hospital medications often necessitate thoughtful consideration to adjustments of home diabetes regimens and/or the initiation of new insulin doses. This review article will examine core concepts and emerging new literature surrounding inpatient diabetes management, including glycemic targets, insulin dosing strategies, noninsulin medications, new diabetes technologies, inpatient diabetes management teams, and discharge planning strategies, to optimize patient safety and satisfaction, clinical outcomes, and even hospital financial health.</p>","author":"Andrew P.
