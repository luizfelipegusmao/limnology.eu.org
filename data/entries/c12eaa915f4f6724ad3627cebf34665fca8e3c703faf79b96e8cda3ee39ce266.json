{"title":"Statuary qualities of white and black Göktepe identified in the Hispanic Valdetorres de Jarama marble collection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1355/v1","date":1721184834000,"content":"This paper focuses on the role of the most common mineralogical techniques applied to the identification of the different statuary qualities in white, grey and black Göktepe marble. For this purpose, a Roman case of sculpture marble collection from the rural villa of Valdetorres de Jarama (central Iberia), of the 4th century AD, is presented. The mythological statuary, combining white, grey and black marbles, are one of the most outstanding marble collections in Aphrodisian style found in Hispania. The analytical results (Petrography, Cathodoluminescence, C and O isotopes, and Sr and Mn concentration) support the identification of two varieties of “black” Göktepe, traditionally named as bigio morato and bigo antico, as well as the best statuary quality on white Göktepe. In addition, the analytical identification of other Asiatic marbles in Valdetorres collection, a white coarse-grained originally from the quarries of Aphrodisias city and one small piece identified as Carian red from Iasos, corroborates the already suggested strong connection existing between artists and the stone material they chose for their works. Finally, it is noteworthy the identification carried out on the marble of the bases that served as seats for the sculptures, as it is a white marble of lower quality whose analytical characteristics are consistent with the Microasiatic marble of Denizli. The use of these exotic and exceptional raw materials confirms the taste for luxury and decorative richness in Late Antique Hispanic rural villae and contributes to a better understanding of the distribution of Aphrodisian productions in the Western Roman provinces.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c12eaa915f4f6724ad3627cebf34665fca8e3c703faf79b96e8cda3ee39ce266","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
