{"title":"Optical Wireless Communication with Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0223/v1","date":1722819900000,"content":"Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) technology has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to provide high data rate wireless connections through the large license-free bandwidth available. A key challenge in OWC systems, similar to high-frequency Radio Frequency (RF) systems, is the presence of dead zones caused by obstacles like buildings, trees, and moving individuals, which can degrade signal quality or disrupt data transmission. Traditionally, relays have been used to mitigate these issues. Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) have recently emerged as a promising solution, enhancing system performance and flexibility by providing reconfigurable communication channels. This paper presents an overview of the application of IRS in OWC systems. Specifically, we categorize IRS into two main types: mirror array-based IRS and metasurfaces-based IRS. Furthermore, we delve into modeling approaches of mirror array-based IRS in OWC and analyze recent advances in IRS control, which are classified into system power or gain optimization oriented, system link reliability optimization oriented, system data rate optimization oriented, and system security optimization oriented approaches. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and potential future directions for integrating IRS with OWC systems, providing insights for further research in this promising field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d7893708c6fb8feb1fedee5b50a76ee29af09ee408cba25d346fff932d7b2cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
