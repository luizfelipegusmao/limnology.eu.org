{"title":"Temperature Measurement during Cryogenic Cooling of a Metal Object under Static Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0900/v1","date":1723537875000,"content":"In machining, there is a constant effort to achieve the expected roughness of the machined surface while maintaining the life of the cutting tool during its operation. The methods used for extending machinability characteristics can be applied due to cooling and lubrication. One of the latest, but not new, targeted cooling techniques have become cryogenic treatment, which uses substances that exhibit extremely low-temperature values of about 123 K. This is a very environmentally friendly technique compared to the current standardized cooling and lubricating fluids. The main task of such cooling is to change the properties of the workpiece so that it exhibits the properties of a brittle material. Bringing the workpiece structure in this way can result in easier material separation through the chip. In the article, the obtained test results can approximate the behavior of various materials during cryogenic cooling.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5823ff36b4b0fc6b93045c8a263e0a6ffc8efd6c61653fa67d2e11c8406afcb5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
