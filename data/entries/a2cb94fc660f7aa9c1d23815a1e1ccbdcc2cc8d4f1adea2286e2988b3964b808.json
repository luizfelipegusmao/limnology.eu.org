{"title":"Is malting an absolute must? Native triticale as a stand‐in for barley malt in the brewing process","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13959?af=R","date":1729245296000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>To remain competitive, brewers must innovate by incorporating novel elements beyond traditional styles. Thus, exploring triticale as a modern substitute for barley malt is promising, especially given its higher amylolytic activity compared to barley. This study aimed to assess the impact of substituting up to 50% of barley malt with unmalted triticale on green beer quality, encompassing multiple stages from wort production to primary fermentation at a laboratory scale.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Triticale-based worts (ratios 10–50%) had lower extract content than 100% barley malt. However, incorporating 10% of triticale led to only a 1% decrease in extract content compared to the all-malt wort. Shearzyme® 500L, an endo-1,4-<i>β</i>-xylanase with <i>β</i>-glucanase side activity, effectively addressed wort viscosity by breaking down arabinoxylans and <i>β</i>-glucans in triticale cell walls. All triticale-based beers exhibited lower ethanol content compared to reference beer, as is typical when using adjuncts. In green beer, a 50% triticale ratio lowered ethanol content by 16% (without enzyme) and 19% (with enzyme) compared to 100% malt beer. However, green beer with 10% triticale had satisfactory levels of total polyphenol and vicinal diketone content, among other parameters.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Commercial enzyme application significantly enhanced proteolytic activity within the grain. Fermentations of enzyme-treated worts showed higher amino acid levels, further confirming the increased proteolytic activity facilitated by the chosen enzyme. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the brewing process using native triticale. Building on this foundation, future studies will focus on optimizing mashing conditions to enhance the fermentation profile of the wort. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Milana Pribić, \nLuka Mejić, \nSaša Despotović, \nBojana Špirović‐Trifunović, \nSandra Bulut, \nJelena Pejin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a2cb94fc660f7aa9c1d23815a1e1ccbdcc2cc8d4f1adea2286e2988b3964b808","category":"Environment"}
