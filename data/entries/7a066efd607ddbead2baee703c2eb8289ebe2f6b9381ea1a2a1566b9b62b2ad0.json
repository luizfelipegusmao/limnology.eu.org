{"title":"Influence of sticky trap color, host plant species, and weather factors on the population dynamics of thrips species in Southern Ghana","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/3/326/7667048?rss=1","date":1715126400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>It is essential to correctly identify and keep track of the abundance of thrips species on infested host crops to understand their population dynamics and implement control measures promptly. The current study was conducted to evaluate the performance of sticky traps in monitoring thrips species in exporters’ eggplant and chili farms and to assess the impact of weather factors on thrips population dynamics. Thrips species were monitored using blue, yellow, and white sticky traps on chili and eggplant farms in Tuba, respectively, in 2020 and 2021. Each field was divided into 8 blocks, and in each replicate, all colors representing 3 treatments were randomly tied to stakes at the center of the respective crop. Data loggers were installed to record hourly weather variables. Three thrips species [<span>Thrips parvispinus</span> Karny (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), <span>Franklinella schultzei</span> Trybom (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), and <span>Thrips tabaci</span> Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae)] were identified from both farms and the different species showed varied attractiveness to trap color for both seasons, with white proving more attractive to <span>T. parvispinus</span>. The population dynamics of the species varied significantly with the season and weather but not with the crop. Optimum temperatures (28–31 °C) and relative humidity (60%–78%) showed a positive linear relationship between the trapped insects with temperature and RH, while extreme temperatures (35 °C) negatively affected their abundance. All sticky trap colors attracted several nontarget organisms; however, yellow colors had higher populations, including the predator, <span>Orius insidiosus</span>. White sticky traps are recommended for inclusion in the country-wide monitoring for thrips, especially <span>T. parvispinus</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"7a066efd607ddbead2baee703c2eb8289ebe2f6b9381ea1a2a1566b9b62b2ad0","category":"Environment"}
