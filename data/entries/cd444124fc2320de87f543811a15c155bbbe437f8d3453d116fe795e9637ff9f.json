{"title":"Unraveling insights in Feeding Experiences of Mothers of Very Low Birth Weight Infants in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Protocol for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1848/v1","date":1719391628000,"content":"Background: Breastfeeding is essential for optimal infant health, offering numerous benefits such as infection prevention and enhanced bonding. Despite its importance, challenges exist, particularly for mothers of preterm and very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, necessitating effective lactation support strategies. Initiatives like the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) and Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) aim to promote breastfeeding success, while donor human milk (DHM) serves as an alternative bridge while the mother is supported to build up her supply. Adequate lactation support, counseling, and education are vital antenatally, during NICU stays and after discharge to improve breastfeeding rates and infant health outcomes, ultimately contributing to global efforts to reduce neonatal mortality and achieve sustainable development goals. This study explores existing research on factors influencing mothers’ ability to produce breast milk and sustain breastfeeding, with the aim of enhancing lactation support and improving infant health outcomes.Methods/Design: A systematic review will be conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. Searches will be performed in the following databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE Ovid via EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, and WILEY online Library) to identify and incorporate primary research articles related to the topic published between 2014 and 2024. Authors will search peer-reviewed articles, gray literature sources, and reference lists to identify eligible studies. Independent abstract and full-text screening by two reviewers will follow the title screening. The analysis of data will be carried out using Review Manager software (version 5.3.5). The I2 test will be used to quantify the amount of unexplained heterogeneity. Potential biases related to study size (such as publication bias) will be examined through the application of several techniques, including funnel plots, Egger’s test, Begg’s test, and Trim and Fill analysis.Discussion: Our review represents a singular exploration into exclusive breastfeeding among very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), focusing on breastfeeding assistance methods. With VLBW defined as less than 1500 g, and most low birth weight (LBW) babies born in LMICs, there is a critical need to address feeding challenges and promote optimal nutrition. Despite updated WHO guidelines in 2022, there is still a lack of comprehensive advice for this vulnerable population. Peer support interventions and health worker counseling have shown promise in increasing breastfeeding continuation rates in LMICs, but challenges persist due to workforce shortages and inadequate documentation. Promoting early postpartum milk expression is crucial for milk production and infant health. Our review aims to fill the gap in understanding VLBW mothers’ breastfeeding experiences in LMICs, shedding light on the effectiveness of breastfeeding support methods and identifying areas for further research.
