{"title":"A Heterolepidoderma and Halichaetoderma gen. nov. (Gastrotricha: Chaetonotidae) riddle: integrative taxonomy and phylogeny of six new freshwater species from Central Europe","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/200/2/283/7260560?rss=1","date":1693872000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Heterolepidoderma</span> is a widely distributed gastrotrich genus encompassing 22 freshwater and 15 marine species. In the present study, two new <span>Heterolepidoderma</span> and four new <span>Heterolepidoderma</span>-like species were discovered in the inland waters of Central Europe. Although <span>Heterolepidoderma</span>-like species exhibited all the morphological features typical of <span>Heterolepidoderma</span>, both nuclear and mitochondrial genes robustly showed their sister-group relationship to the marine genus <span>Halichaetonotus</span>. Most <span>Heterolepidoderma</span> species, including the new ones, were grouped with some <span>Chaetonotus</span> and <span>Ichthydium</span> species in a strongly supported cluster (so-called <span>Heterolepidoderma s.l.</span> clade). Since statistical tree topology tests robustly refuted the close affinity of <span>Heterolepidoderma</span>-like species to the <span>Heterolepidoderma s.l.</span> clade, a new genus, <span>Halichaetoderma</span> gen. nov., was proposed for them. Stochastic mapping suggested that the last common ancestor (LCA) of the Chaetonotidae‒Neogosseidae‒Dasydytidae clade had scales carrying keels with spines. Scales became oblong in the LCA of the <span>Halichaetoderma </span>+ <span>Halichaetonotus</span> clade and three times independently within the <span>Heterolepidoderma s.l.</span> clade. Spines were lost in the LCAs of the <span>Halichaetoderma </span>+ <span>Halichaetonotus</span> and <span>Heterolepidoderma s.l.</span> clades convergently. State-by-state associations of cuticular characters suggested that particular scale morphologies tend to be correlated with particular numbers of keels and the presence/absence of spines during the chaetonotid phylogeny.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"4c90147f309ca8fc871e41fa7e91ba5b6af83e336d0459809370aca8a5e0d777","category":"Environment"}
