{"title":"Variations of VEGFR2 Chemical Space: Stimulator and Inhibitory Peptides","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0461/v1","date":1717738362000,"content":"The kinase pathway plays a crucial role in blood vessel function. Particular attention is paid to VEGFR-type 2 angiogenesis and vascular morphogenesis as the tyrosin kinase pathway is preferentially activated. In silico studies were performed on several peptides that affect VEGFR2 in both stimulating and inhibitory ways. This investigation aims to examine the molecular properties of VEGFR2, a molecule primarily involved in the processes of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. These relationships were defined by the interactions between vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the structural features of the systems. The chemical space of the inhibitory peptides and stimulators was described using topological and energetic properties. Furthermore, chimeric models of stimulating and inhibitory proteins (for VEGFR2) were computed using the protein system structures. The interaction between the chimeric proteins and VEGFR was computed. The chemical space was further characterized using complex manifolds and high-dimensional data visualization. The results show that a slightly similar chemical area is shared by VEGFR2 and is shared by stimulating and inhibitory proteins. On the other hand, the stimulator peptides and the inhibitors have distinct chemical spaces.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45cd3e8f019dcd482d41fb9969b2f12da1ff975f6855c1fe6d66940fb2b42b51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
