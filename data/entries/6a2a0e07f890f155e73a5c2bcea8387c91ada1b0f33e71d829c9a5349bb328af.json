Recent advances in polymer science and engineering resulted in development of advanced amorphous and semi-crystalline polyesters with exceptional performance compared to conventional polymeric films. Among these, 1,4-cycloheanedimethanol (CHDM) and cyclic monomer-based polyesters have gained considerable attention attention for their exceptional characteristics and potential applications in smart films. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the synthesis, characterization, and applications of CHDM and cyclic monomer based advanced polymers for smart film applications. It discussed the structure-property relationship of these innovative polyesters and highlights their unique characteristics including thermal, mechanical, and barrier characteristics. Furthermore, this article also emphases the solution, melt, and solid state polymerization of the polymers. Special emphasis is placed on the influence of the addition of 2nd diol or 2nd diacid on the performance characteristics of synthesized polyesters/copolyesters to explore their versatile industrial applications. Additionally, the impact of stereochemistry of the monomers is also explored to optimized the characterization of polyester, suitable for the industrial applications. Furthermore, this article explores the potential of these advanced polyesters to be considered as a potential materials for smart film applications, especially in the filed of flexible electronics. Finally, the article examines the challenges and future recommendations for the development CHDM and cyclic monomer-based polyesters for smart film applications. It discusses potential avenues for further research, including in-depth studies for the synthesis and characterization of polyesters, development of sustainable and biodegradable alternatives cyclic monomers, alternative green approaches for the synthesis of polymers etc. This review article provides a valuable insights for the researcher from academia and industry working in the field of polymer science and materials engineering.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a2a0e07f890f155e73a5c2bcea8387c91ada1b0f33e71d829c9a5349bb328af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
