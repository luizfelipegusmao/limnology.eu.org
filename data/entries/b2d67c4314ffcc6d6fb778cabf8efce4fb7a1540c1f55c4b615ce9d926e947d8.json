{"title":"Arthrocentesis of Temporomandibular Joints- a Clinical Comperative Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0947/v1","date":1726140207000,"content":"The objective of this study was to compare single-needle arthrocentesis with the conventional two-needle arthrocentesis, as well as, additional intracapsular injection of hyaluronic acid or platelet rich fibrin. 96 patients with established osteoarthritis (OA) (n= 48) or with internal de-arrangement (DD) (n= 48) were assigned for single-needle arthrocentesis with distension of the joint or conventional two-needle arthrocentesis with or without intracapsular injection of the medication (hyaluronic acid- HA or platelet-rich plasma- PRP) performed every month in the period of 6 months. The maximum mouth opening and pain as measured by the visual analog scale (VAS) were compared. Each group exhibited significant improvement: decrease of pain and in-creased mouth opening. Single- puncture technique provided similar pain reduction as two needle approach but provided significantly better results in maximum mouth opening. Reduction of pain was similar when comparing between the OA and DD cohorts, however patients with disc dis-placement reached significantly better mouth opening than OA. Intracapsular application of medication contributed to significant decrease of pain in both HA and PRP groups, with plate-let-rich fibrin being significantly superior in terms of mouth opening increase over HA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2d67c4314ffcc6d6fb778cabf8efce4fb7a1540c1f55c4b615ce9d926e947d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
