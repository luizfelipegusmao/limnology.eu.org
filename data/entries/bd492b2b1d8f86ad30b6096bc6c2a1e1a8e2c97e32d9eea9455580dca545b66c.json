{"title":"Probing Atomic Structure and Excitons in 2D Heterostructures Through Cryogenic STEM-EELS","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.674/7719588?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The exploration of two-dimensional (2D) materials and the ability to engineer atomically thin heterostructures have opened a fascinating platform for tailoring novel material properties and uncovering exotic quantum phenomena. Vertical stacking of atomically thin 2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), with a lattice difference/rotational alignment result in the formation of a moiré lattice, often inducing new properties not present in individual layers [<a href=\"#ozae044.674-B1\">1</a>]. For example, the emergence of tunable Mott insulators [<a href=\"#ozae044.674-B2\">2</a>], unconventional superconductivity [<a href=\"#ozae044.674-B3\">3</a>], moiré trapped valley excitons [<a href=\"#ozae044.674-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.674-B5\">5</a>] and recent observation of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.674-B6\">6</a>] have been revealed in such heterostructures. Control of the relative twist angle allows manipulation of interlayer interactions and the emergence of excitons, strongly bound electron-hole pairs localized by periodic moiré potentials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bd492b2b1d8f86ad30b6096bc6c2a1e1a8e2c97e32d9eea9455580dca545b66c","category":"Environment"}
