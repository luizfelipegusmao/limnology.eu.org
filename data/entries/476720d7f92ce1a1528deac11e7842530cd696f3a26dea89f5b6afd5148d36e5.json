{"title":"Mendelian randomization analysis reveals causal association of anthropometric measures on sepsis risk and mortality","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310898","date":1727704800000,"content":"<p>by Chu-Yun Liu, Yu-Shen Yang, Meng-Qin Pei, He-fan He</p>\r\n\r\nThe objective of this study was to explore the potential causalities of fat mass, nonfat mass and height (henceforth, ‘anthropometric measures’) with sepsis risk and mortality. We conducted the Mendelian randomization (MR) investigation using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of anthropometric measures, sepsis, and sepsis mortality. The GWAS summary data from the UK Biobank was used. Firstly, MR analysis was performed to estimate the causal effect of anthropometric measures on the risk of sepsis. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was utilized as the primary analytical approach, together with weighted median-based method. Cochrane’s Q test and MR-Egger intercept test were performed to assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy, respectively. Finally, we performed a series of sensitivity analyses to enhance the precision and veracity of our findings. The IVW method showed that genetically predicted weight-related measures were suggestively linked to an increased risk of sepsis. However, height displayed no causal association with sepsis risk and mortality. Furthermore, weight-related measures also displayed significant MR association with the sepsis mortality, except body nonfat mass and right leg nonfat mass. However, MVMR analysis indicated the observed effects for weight-related measures in the univariable MR analyses are more likely a bias caused by the interrelationship between anthropometric measures. According to the MR-Egger intercept assessment, our MR examination was not influenced by horizontal pleiotropy (all p&gt;0.05). Moreover, the reliability of the estimated causal association was confirmed by the sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, these findings provided vital new knowledge on the role of anthropometric-related measures in the sepsis etiology.","author":"Chu-Yun Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"476720d7f92ce1a1528deac11e7842530cd696f3a26dea89f5b6afd5148d36e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
