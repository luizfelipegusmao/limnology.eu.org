{"title":"Trajectory Analysis of 6-DOF Industrial Robot Manipulators by Using Artificial Neural Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0850/v1","date":1718229782000,"content":"Robot manipulators are robotic systems that are frequently used in automation systems and able to provide increased speed, precision and efficiency in the industrial applications. Due to their nonlinear and complex nature, it is crucial to optimize the robot manipulator systems in terms of trajectory control. In this study, positioning analysis based on artificial neural networks (ANN) were performed for robot manipulator systems used in the textile industry and the optimal ANN model for the high-accuracy positioning was improved. The inverse kinematic analysis of a 6 degree of freedom (DOF) industrial denim robot manipulator were carried out via 4 different learning algorithms of Delta-Bar-Delta (DBD), Online Back Propagation (OBP), Quick Back Propagation (QBP) and Random Back Propagation (RBP) for proposed neural network predictor. From the results obtained, it was observed that QBP based 3-10-6 type ANN structure produced the optimal results in terms of estimation and modelling of trajectory control. In addition, 3-5-6 type ANN structure was also improved and its Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and statistical R2 performances were compared to that of 3-10-6 ANN structure. Consequently, it can be concluded that the proposed neural predictors can successfully be employed in real-time industrial applications for robot manipulator trajectory analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95f4e21ffec47c9a3782667e19a699d85701e774e442a4ac808e7ec560abf7fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
