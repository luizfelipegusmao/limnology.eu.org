{"title":"Enhancing Heterogenous Traffic Flows with Additional Exclusive Two-Wheeled Vehicle Lanes using Reinforcement Learning Algorithm: A Case Study at One of Bandung Intersections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0969/v1","date":1723588497000,"content":"This paper investigates the impact of adding exclusive two-wheeled vehicle lane based on motorcycle data and using reinforcement learning at one of Bandung’s heterogeneous intersections which uses data collected from ATCS Bandung. The Kiaracondong-Ibrahim Adjie intersection in Bandung is notorious for severe congestion, especially during rush hours. Traditional traffic management methods often fall short, necessitating innovative solutions to mitigate long wait times and extensive queue lengths. This study leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically Deep Q-learning Network algorithm, combined with introduction of additional two-wheeled vehicle lanes to optimize traffic flow at this busy intersection. The research involved configuring the SUMO platform to accurately simulate the intersection’s traffic conditions, including parameters such as lane widths and vehicle dynamics. The RL model was trained over 100 episodes using quantitative real traffic data from ATCS Bandung city. The training process minimize vehicle waiting time and queue length by adjusting traffic light phases dynamically. Results from the simulations indicated significant improvements in traffic management. Queue lengths in regular lanes decreased by 64.89% under RL control, while two-wheeled vehicle lanes saw a 26.39% reduction. Waiting times in regular lanes dropped by 80.49%, and in two-wheeled vehicle lanes by 39.96%. The study demonstrated that integrating DQN with dedicated two-wheeled vehicle lanes could substantially enhance traffic flow and reduce congestion at critical urban intersections. The findings underscore the potential of advanced RL techniques in urban traffic management. However, the study acknowledges the need for further research with more extensive resources and time to develop even more efficient traffic control systems. Future work should focus on refining these methods for broader application and exploring other innovative technologies to sustainably address urban traffic challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5bcc88682f4a66f6a426dddead7ccc2596a661962c24ce809cdcbe012675070","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
