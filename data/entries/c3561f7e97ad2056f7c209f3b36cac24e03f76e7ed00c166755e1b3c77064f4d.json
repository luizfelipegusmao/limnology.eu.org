{"title":"Blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio in heart failure: Systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303870","date":1716904800000,"content":"<p>by Yichang Zhou, Qin Zhao, Zhitong Liu, Wen Gao</p>\r\n\r\nThe meta-analysis is to evaluate the predictive value of the blood urea nitrogen / creatinine ratio (BCR) for long-term outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies from inception to October 2023. STATA SE 14.0 software was used for statistical analysis. A total of 2036 reports were identified with 14 studies meeting pre-designed inclusion criteria. Three long-term outcomes were investigated. In patients with HF, the increase of BCR level indicated a greater risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.38–2.00; I2 = 90.8%, <i>P</i> = 0.000). The acute HF (AHF) subgroup demonstrated a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.15–2.79; I2 = 93.9%, <i>P</i> = 0.000) as did the non-AHF subgroup (HR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.34–1.71; I2 = 37.1%, <i>P</i> = 0.122). The subgroup (≤ 70 years old) demonstrated a lower risk of all-cause mortality in patients with HF (HR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.35–1.94; I2 = 68.3%, <i>P</i> = 0.004) as did the subgroup (&gt; 70 years old) (HR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.19–2.34; I2 = 88.3%, <i>P</i> = 0.000). In addition, this study did not support the predictive value of BCR in CVD mortality (HR = 1.48, 95% CI 0.91–2.43; I2 = 63%, <i>P</i> = 0.100) and HF hospitalization (HR = 1.28, 95% CI 0.73–2.24; I2 = 77.5%, <i>P</i> = 0.035). Sensitivity analysis showed that all the results were robust. In summary, the results showed that the blood urea nitrogen / creatinine ratio (BCR) had a significant predictive value for all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure and was a fairly promising predictor obviously. Moreover, more studies are needed to further determine the predictive value of BCR in other long-term outcomes such as CVD mortality, HF hospitalization or aborted cardiac arrest.","author":"Yichang Zhou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c3561f7e97ad2056f7c209f3b36cac24e03f76e7ed00c166755e1b3c77064f4d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
