{"title":"Effect of cinnamon essential oil/ γ‐cyclodextrin inclusion complex on papaya quality and shelf‐life","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13443?af=R","date":1709725209000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Papaya, a highly nutritious and economically significant fruit, is susceptible to infections caused by phytopathogenic fungi. Cinnamon essential oil, derived from <i>Cinnamomum cassia</i> (CC), shows promise in preserving papaya due to its antifungal properties. However, CC is volatile, sensitive to environmental factors, and carries a strong aroma. γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD) is known for encapsulating hydrophilic molecules, shielding them from environmental influences, reducing odor, and enabling controlled release due to its unique channel structure. This study aimed to tackle these challenges by preparing and characterizing an inclusion complex of CC with γ-CD (CC-γ-CD), subsequently evaluating its efficacy in preserving papaya fruits.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The characteristic analyses, including Fourier-infrared, powder X-ray diffraction, thermal gravity analysis, differential scanning calorimeter, and scanning electron microscopy, revealed successful encapsulation of CC components within the γ-CD cavity. Evaluations of the CC-γ-CD complex's impact on papaya fruit shelf-life and quality showed notable enhancements. Fruits treated with CC-γ-CD inclusion complex at a dose of 10 g kg<sup>−1</sup> exhibited a 55% extension in shelf-life, evidenced by reduced disease severity index compared to untreated fruit in the same storage conditions. Moreover, detailed physicochemical and bromatological assessments highlighted significant improvements, particularly in fruit treated with CC-γ-CD inclusion complex at a dose of 10 g kg<sup>−1</sup>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The application of CC-γ-CD inclusion complex at 10 g kg<sup>−1</sup> significantly extended the shelf-life of papaya fruit and markedly improved the overall quality. These findings underscore the potential of CC-γ-CD inclusion complex as an effective preservative for papaya, offering a promising solution for its postharvest management and marketability.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
