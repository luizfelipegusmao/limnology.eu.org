Thus, <i>Detarium</i> plant resources may face challenges in forests with different levels of protection status due to habitat fragmentation and the effects of climate change. Local strategies and solutions could contribute to the conservation of <i>Detarium</i> species.\n\n</p><br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Understanding local perceptions and the different uses of multipurpose plant species is essential for their sustainable management. Despite this, anthropogenic factors such as deforestation, overexploitation of natural resources, extension of agricultural lands, overgrazing, and bushfires, coupled with the adverse effects of climate change, are contributing to the loss of these species. This study analyses the perceptions of local communities in Burkina Faso regarding the threats to <i>Detarium microcarpum</i> and <i>Detarium senegalense</i> and their implications, aiming to contribute to the effective management and conservation of such species. Through individual semi-structured and focus group interviews with 465 local people, data were collected on sociodemographic characteristics, plant parts used, use categories, threats and their effects, proposed solutions, and perceived conservation strategies. Descriptive statistics (consensus for plant part and relative frequency of citation), component analysis, and non-parametric analyses were used for data analysis. Results indicated that ethnicity, age, education level, and occupation were the most influential sociodemographic factors in relation to the use of these species. Six plant parts from both <i>Detarium</i> species are used across seven use categories, with fruits (0.40), trunks (0.16), and bark (0.27) being the most exploited. There was consensus among local populations regarding areas of abundance. Threat factors, their effects, and conservation solutions varied significantly according to site status. This study highlights the multipurpose uses of <i>Detarium</i> species throughout Burkina Faso and reveals that threats to these species are linked to the occupation and the status of each site. Sustainable use, effective conservation, and domestication of <i>Detarium</i> species should be considered to promote and sustain the exploitation of non-timber forest products.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>了解当地人对多用途植物的认识与利用对这些植物的可持续管理至关重要。尽管如此，砍伐森林、过度开发自然资源、扩大农业用地、过度放牧和丛林火灾等人为因素，再加上气候变化的不利影响，正在导致这些物种的消失。本研究分析了布基纳法索当地社区对小果甘豆（<i>Detarium microcarpum</i>）和甘豆（<i>Detarium senegalense</i>）面临的威胁及其影响的认识，旨在为有效管理和保护此类物种做出贡献。通过对 465 名当地人进行个人半结构式访谈和集中小组访谈，收集了社会人口特征、植物利用部位、利用类型、威胁因子及其影响、建议的解决方案和认知保护策略认知等方面的数据。数据分析采用了描述性统计（植物部位共识和相对引用频率）、成分分析和非参数分析。结果表明，种族、年龄、教育水平和职业是对这些物种的使用最有影响的社会人口因素。2种甘豆属植物共有6个部位被用于七个用途类别，其中果实（0.40）、树干（0.16）和树皮（0.27）被利用最多。当地居民对主产区的认识是一致的，但是不同地区的威胁因素、人类的影响和保护方案有很大差异。这项研究强调了布基纳法索各地对甘豆属树种利用的多样性，并揭示了这些树种面临的威胁与每个原生地被占用情况和状态有关。为了促进和维持非木材森林产品（NTFPs）的开发利用，应考虑可持续利用、有效保护和驯化甘豆属物种。【审阅:朱仁斌】</p>","author":"Taonda Adama, \nZerbo Issouf, \nN'Guessan Anny Estelle, \nN'Dja K.
