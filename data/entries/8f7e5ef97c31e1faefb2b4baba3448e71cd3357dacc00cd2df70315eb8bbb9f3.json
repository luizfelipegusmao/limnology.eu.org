{"title":"Analysis of Building Conditions in Banjarmasin:Identification of Building Failures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1299/v1","date":1721111485000,"content":"This study investigates the compliance level with Regional Regulations (PERDA) on building construction in Banjarmasin, focusing on urban areas and riverbanks. The motivation behind this research is the observed low adherence to PERDA, which aims to ensure orderly and safe development. Key issues include unauthorized building modifications, inadequate drainage systems, and poor sanitation, resulting in environmental damage and reduced quality of life. The study employs both qualitative and quantitative methods, including surveys and interviews, to gather data from 100 building samples and various stakeholders. Findings reveal significant non-compliance with land use regulations, building coefficients (KDB, KLB), and green space requirements (KDH), with 27% of buildings lacking necessary permits (IMB, PBG, SLF). Main causes include lack of awareness, high costs, and administrative hurdles. Recommendations for improvement include enhanced public education, streamlined administrative processes, stronger enforcement of regulations, and increased community involvement in planning. Effective inter-agency coordination is also crucial. These measures aim to foster a more organized, safe, and sustainable urban development in Banjarmasin. Enhanced compliance with PERDA will mitigate negative impacts such as flooding and environmental degradation, contributing to the overall welfare of the community.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f7e5ef97c31e1faefb2b4baba3448e71cd3357dacc00cd2df70315eb8bbb9f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
