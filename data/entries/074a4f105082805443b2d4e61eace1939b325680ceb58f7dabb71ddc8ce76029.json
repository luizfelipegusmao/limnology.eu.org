{"title":"Diversity Management and WAI (Work Ability Index): A Cross-Sectional Study of Family and Community Nurses in Tuscany. Monitoring Organizational Wellbeing in the Workplace Context","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2183/v1","date":1722214849000,"content":"Age diversity in the workplace is a growing challenge. This study aimed to assess work ability among Family and Community Nurses (FCNs) in a large Local Health Authority (LHA) in Tuscany, Italy. The Work Ability Index (WAI) was administered to 178 FCNs, along with demographic and occupational data. Results showed a significant negative correlation between chronological age and WAI, indicating decreasing work ability with age. Moreover, work setting, educational attainment, and health conditions influenced work ability. Nurses working in home settings and those with higher educational levels reported better work ability. A high prevalence of health conditions, particularly musculoskeletal disorders, was observed. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to support FCNs' work ability and address age-related challenges. This study provides a foundation for developing strategies to optimize the nursing workforce and ensure high-quality care delivery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"074a4f105082805443b2d4e61eace1939b325680ceb58f7dabb71ddc8ce76029","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
