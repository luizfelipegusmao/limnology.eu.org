The acquisition of spectral data, conventionally performed on a grid, poses a question: Can we intelligently select points to converge on the desired property more efficiently? In this study, we present a constrained deep kernel learning (DKL) approach to optimize spectral data acquisition (Fig. 1) for exploring structure-property relationship.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4e22b82dbf486fc5cdcdfdf733acbc79ec66ca2eb910c9179636162e72c3beaa","category":"Environment"}
