{"title":"Uptake of COVID-19 vaccine among high-risk urban populations in Southern Thailand using the COM-B model","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300509","date":1710424800000,"content":"<p>by Charuai Suwanbamrung, Benchawan Srinam, Pakawan Promkool, Warissara Suwannakarn, Sangchom Siripanich, Md. Siddikur Rahman, Muhammad Haroon Stanikzai</p>\r\nBackground <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed unprecedented suffering on social and individual levels worldwide. Vaccines against COVID-19 have been prioritized as a crucial strategy for ending the pandemic as well as minimizing its consequences.</p> Objectives <p>This study aimed to determine the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine among high-risk urban populations in Southern Thailand using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) model.</p> Methods <p>We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study in the Hat Yai district, Songkhla province in Southern Thailand, in September and October 2021. The questionnaire was composed of sections on sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 vaccination status, and COM-B constructs. We employed a multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine factors associated with the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. We set statistical significance at <i>p &lt; 0</i>.<i>05</i>.</p> Results <p>In this study, females constituted 54.7% of the total participants (n = 358), and nearly half of the participants (45.8%) were in the younger age group (18–29). Of all the participants, 59.5% (95%CI: 54.2%-64.6%) received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Factors associated with the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine and their adjusted OR (95% CI) were being married: 3.59 (2.06–6.24), having a graduate degree: 2.34 (1.38–3.96), gainfully employed: 3.30 (1.91–5.67), having a high level of opportunity: 2.90 (1.48–5.66), and having a high level of motivation: 2.87 (1.17–17.08).</p> Conclusion <p>The uptake of COVID-19 vaccines was moderate in this population. Moreover, the results showed that the COM-B model is useful in predicting COVID-19 vaccine uptake. The findings of this study could be used to aid future public health interventions in any event of outbreaks similar to COVID-19 disease in Thailand and beyond.</p>","author":"Charuai Suwanbamrung","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"13f09f7df46c958ca1cc85f07664d33b117ec58596308e2f55106f3d122b410e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
