However, it has relatively low fracture toughness and limited performance at elevated temperature [<a href=\"#ozae044.1015-B1\">1</a>]. Presence of secondary phases formed within the matrix of alloy during heat treatment process can significantly impact their performance. Their quantification is essential for understanding the nature of Al alloys and designing its properties. Sample material Al 6061 is mainly utilized as aerospace structural components, which has magnesium (Mg) and silicon (Si) as its major alloying element with some manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) addition. Alloying Al with Mg can improve the strength and hardness of the material. The Si addition helps the alloy respond to heat treatment while prevents heat cracking [<a href=\"#ozae044.1015-B2\">2</a>]. Major intermetallic compounds in Al 6061 are Mg-Si and Al-Mn-Fe-Si, which will be analyzed quantitatively in this research. While there has already been research done on the size and amount distribution of the secondary phases and their effect on mechanical properties, only few studies on the topic of distance distribution towards grain boundaries.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"99c48937b2df4336263931f3a0947ca39e6770194bf89f03c3e78d1c27099cac","category":"Environment"}
