{"title":"Assessing the Effects of Citizen Climate Literacy and Attitudes on Their &lsquo;Greening&rsquo; Behaviour in a Climate Change Hotspot Region of the Eastern Mediterranean","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1481/v1","date":1724226445000,"content":"Climate change presents an urgent global challenge, manifesting in rising temperatures and extreme weather events with severe societal impacts. The Eastern Mediterranean, warming faster than the global average, faces immediate repercussions. Climate literacy emerges as pivotal, empowering individuals to comprehend climate science and act accordingly. This study delves into climate literacy, attitudes, and 'greening' behaviours in the Eastern Mediterranean hotspot of Greece, based on a survey of 1,962 citizens. Findings indicate high climate literacy but lower adoption of 'greening' behaviours, especially those involving financial costs. Regression analyses highlight the significant role of climate literacy, concerns about personal impacts, coping appraisal and trust in institutions in promoting 'greening' behaviours. The study underscores the need for multifaceted strategies emphasizing financial motivation, trust-building, and societal norm shifts. Socio-demographic disparities, including gender and occupation, highlight areas for targeted interventions. The emphasis on the mental health impacts of climate-related events underscores the need for holistic disaster management. Policy implications are discussed, highlighting the potential of expanded climate literacy to catalyze collective action toward sustainability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a1d9660fad9fbaadbfe8b46d779c0e99ffe2cd235db5a256077f232087d142d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
