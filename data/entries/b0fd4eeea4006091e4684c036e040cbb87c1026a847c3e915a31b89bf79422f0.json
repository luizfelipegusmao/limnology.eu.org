{"title":"Streamlining Acute Stroke Processes and Data Collection: A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0632/v1","date":1723190086000,"content":"Background: Acute ischemic stroke treatment has been thoroughly studied to identify strategies to reduce treatment times. However, many centers still do not meet the benchmark time metrics. Additionally, smaller centers often face longer treatment times, yet studies focus primarily on larger, more advanced centers.\nObjectives: The aim of this study is to analyze existing literature to understand the strategies implemented in primary and comprehensive stroke centers to reduce their treatment times, and categorize the studies based on methods used to improve their processes \nResults: Three main categories of improvements were identified in the literature: 1) standardization of processes, 2) resource management, and 3) data collection. Both primary and comprehensive stroke centers were able to reduce treatment times through standardization of processes. However, challenges such as variations in resources between hospitals and difficulties in integrating data collection software into workflow were highlighted. Additionally, many strategies to optimize resource management and data collection were conducted in comprehensive stroke centers, which can benefit primary stroke centers.\nConclusions: Many existing strategies to improve treatment times are viable for both primary and comprehensive stroke centers. However, while data collection is recognized as crucial for process improvement, challenges persist in integrating data collection methods into clinical workflow. Proposed solutions include the development of easy-to-use software tailored to clinician needs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0fd4eeea4006091e4684c036e040cbb87c1026a847c3e915a31b89bf79422f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
