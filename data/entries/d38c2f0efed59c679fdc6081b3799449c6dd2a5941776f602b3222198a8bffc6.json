The package includes well-paid scholarships, research aid, and health and retirement contributions (1, 2). However, the BTRP plan will likely exacerbate the present high unemployment rates (3, 4) among Brazil’s scientists.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"d38c2f0efed59c679fdc6081b3799449c6dd2a5941776f602b3222198a8bffc6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
