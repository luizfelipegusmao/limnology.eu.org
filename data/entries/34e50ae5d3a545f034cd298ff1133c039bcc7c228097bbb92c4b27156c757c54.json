{"title":"Harnessing Regression Models to Optimize Project Duration Estimation and Reduce Delays in South African Infrastructure Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0227/v1","date":1727945854000,"content":"Accurately estimating project duration is critical for the successful delivery of construction projects, particularly in the dynamic and resource-constrained environment of South Africa. This study aims to assess the key factors influencing construction project duration in the South African context through the development of a regression model. By analyzing data from a diverse range of construction projects, the research identifies significant variables such as project size, complexity, location, resource availability, and stakeholder involvement that contribute to delays or expedited completion. The regression model is designed to quantify the impact of these factors, offering a predictive tool that can enhance project planning and scheduling accuracy. The findings provide valuable insights for project managers, contractors, and policymakers, enabling them to make informed decisions that optimize project timelines and improve the overall efficiency of the construction industry in South Africa.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"34e50ae5d3a545f034cd298ff1133c039bcc7c228097bbb92c4b27156c757c54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
