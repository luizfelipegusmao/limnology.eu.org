{"title":"Mastering movement: A Cross-sectional investigation of motor competence in children and adolescents engaged in sports","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304524","date":1717077600000,"content":"<p>by Fábio Saraiva Flôres, Denise Paschoal Soares, Renata M. Willig, Ana Carolina Reyes, Ana Filipa Silva</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Motor Competence (MC) is related to the development of healthy lifestyles in children and adolescents, and many studies have compared it with different variables, including sports participation. This investigation aimed to characterize the components and total scores of MC regarding different physical activity practices, such as physical education (PE) classes, futsal, volleyball, and ballet, and to compare MC regarding sports, sex, and age-groups.</p> Methods <p>Using a cross-sectional study, 398 Portuguese children and adolescents (398 participants: 200 boys and 198 girls; 12.649±3.46 years) were conveniently chosen between 2022 and 2023. Four groups of different sports were created: PE classes (n = 187), futsal (n = 80), volleyball (n = 101) and ballet (n = 30), and four different age groups: 7 to 9 years old (n = 117); 10 to 12 years old (n = 65), 13 to 15 years old (n = 96) and, 16 to 19 years old (n = 120). All participants reported to participate in at least two training sessions per week (1 hour each) for at least two years. MC was assessed with Motor Competence Assessment (MCA) comprising three components with six tests (two tests for each component). Participants’ total MC was calculated as the average of the three components of the MCA. Data were analyzed by applying ANOVA one-way with LSD post-hoc.</p> Results <p>Differences were found in MC among groups, where futsal participants showed better scores in general. Sex comparison showed that boys have a higher MC when practicing futsal, especially compared to volleyball players. Age-group analysis showed that younger participants had better MC levels compared to older ones.</p> Conclusion <p>The whole group showed the 50th percentile of MC, but volleyball adolescents showed results below this reference. MC is intrinsically linked to an individual’s motor experiences and motivations rather than depending directly on the specific practice of the sport.</p>","author":"Fábio Saraiva Flôres","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b83e942628b9780ef6701b2d0a776719065841ebd4e1e50c0fab9a096492e662","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
