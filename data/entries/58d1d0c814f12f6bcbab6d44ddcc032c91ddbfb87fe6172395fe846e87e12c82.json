{"title":"Traces of collisional and transtensional processes between the Carpathia and the European platform in the geoelectric image (NE Slovakia and SE Poland)","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11600-023-01239-6","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>We present the latest magnetotelluric models on profiles in the northeastern part of Slovakia and the southeastern part of Poland. These models are focused on deciphering the tectonic structures at the contact of the Inner Carpathians with the European Platform in this area. For the Inner Carpathian block, we propose the term Carpathia. Profile SA-01 shows shallower structures and the parallel MT-05 profile shows deeper structures. These models are also correlated with the seismic profile CEL-05. All results are compatible and show an original subduction-collisional structure, which was later replaced by a transpressive-transtensional one. The most striking structures are thick highly conductive subhorizontal zones in the middle crust and a tectonically controlled deep vertical conductive structureâ€”the Carpathian conductive zone. Other significant structures, which also appear in the seismic section, are back thrusting of Flysch Belt and the Klippen Belt basement (Penninic crust) uplift.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"58d1d0c814f12f6bcbab6d44ddcc032c91ddbfb87fe6172395fe846e87e12c82","category":"Environment"}
