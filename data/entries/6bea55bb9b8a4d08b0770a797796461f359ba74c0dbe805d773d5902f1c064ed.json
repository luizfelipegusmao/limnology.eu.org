{"title":"Association between Dietary Saturated Fat and Telomere Length: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1942/v1","date":1716965371000,"content":"This study examines the association between dietary saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. Telomeres, protective repeats of DNA at the ends of chromosomes, play a crucial role in cellular aging. Their length is shortened over time and is influenced by various factors, one of which is diet. The present study's objective was to evaluate whether increased SFA consumption is associated with shorter LTL. The analysis, conducted on a large, nationally representative sample of 6646 adults, revealed an inverse association between dietary SFAs and LTL. When examined further, this association was found to be significant in women, but not in men. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were tested as a potential mediator in this relationship, but no such mediation was found. These findings support the role of dietary factors in modulating cellular aging. However, further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving the overall association, as well as the gender-specific effects observed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6bea55bb9b8a4d08b0770a797796461f359ba74c0dbe805d773d5902f1c064ed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
