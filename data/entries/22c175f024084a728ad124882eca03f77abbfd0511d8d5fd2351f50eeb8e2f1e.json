The subtropical fruit tree i.e lychee contains phytochemicals such as flavonoids, terpenoids, and polyphenolic compounds which act as reducing agents and convert the metal ions into metal atoms that coagulate to form mNPs. Methodology: Different methodologies adopted for the synthesis of lychee extract and its use in the fabrication of mNPs under different reaction conditions such as solvent, extract amount, temperature, and pH of the medium have also been discussed critically in detail. Techniques: Different techniques such as FTIR, UVâ€“visible, XRD, SEM, EDX, and TEM adopted for the analysis of biogenic synthesis of mNPs have also been discussed in detail.Applications of mNPs: Applications of these prepared mNPs in various fields due to their antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, anticancer, and catalytic activities have also been described in detail.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"22c175f024084a728ad124882eca03f77abbfd0511d8d5fd2351f50eeb8e2f1e","category":"Environment"}
