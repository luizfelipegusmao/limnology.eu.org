{"title":"Lindernia dubia (L.) Pennel as an Alien Weed in Central Spain: A Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0863/v1","date":1718268445000,"content":"Lindernia dubia (L.) Pennell is a species with invasive behavior outside of its native range of distribution (North America), linked mainly to aquatic habitats. This annual species has been acknowledged as a weed in rice paddies in Europe and Asia. Due to the impacts of this invasive plant, some authors have even listed this species as a global invader. The present work focused on spontaneous plant species occurring in cattail seedlings grown in central Spain for the establishment of constructed wetlands. Weed inventory revealed the presence of L. dubia as a dominant spontaneous species in this crop environment. A suite of mesocosm experiments were designed to study the distribution of L.dubia versus the distribution of the other dominant plant species, and to determine traits associated with its weedy potential. Results showed that L.dubia presents competitive attributes such as morphological variability, early flowering, long seeding time, short growth cycle, small and light seeds and high seed production and germination rate (25 ‚Å∞C), meaning a high reproductive capacity in a cycle of about three months, in non-limiting conditions for plant growth. Data from this work provide a basis for understanding the weedy potential of L.dubia, and for management decisions of a potentially invasive species, little investigated in Europe","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e7bd0f893b78903518c6d214c55a7976ac049cd730502826803fbf76634566f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
