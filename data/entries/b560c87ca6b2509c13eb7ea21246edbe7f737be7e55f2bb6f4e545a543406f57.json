Tuomisto, Panu Rantakokko</p>\r\n\r\nTime trends and regional differences of polychlorinated dibenzo-<i>p</i>-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), DDTs, polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and polybrominated diphenylethers (BDEs) were studied in unhatched osprey eggs collected by bird ringers in 1972–2017 from four areas in Finland. Two study areas were from Baltic Sea, Northern Quark and Finnish Archipelago Sea, while the two others were inland lake areas, eutrophicated Lake Vanajanselkä affected by industrial emissions, and Pristine SW Lake Area. The highest concentrations of most compound groups were in Lake Vanajanselkä consistent with high emissions, the predominance of bream as a prey, and higher concentrations in bream compared to other prey fish. Concentrations of all chlorinated compounds decreased significantly in all study areas. Average annual decreases were ∑PCDD/F 2.3–4.9%, ∑PCB 2.2–4.2%, ∑PCN 2.6–7.0% and ∑DDT 7.1–9.5%, primarily in line with decreased levels in prey fish. From 1972 PBBs and BDEs increased significantly until 1990s declining rapidly thereafter. PCDD/F congener profile was dominated by 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, except in Lake Vanajanselkä by 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD. PCB congener profile was dominated by PCB 153 in all study areas, followed by PCB 180 and PCB 138. Among dioxin-like compounds PCBs contributed 82%, PCDDs 14% and PCDFs 4% to toxic equivalent quantity (∑TEQ). PCB 126 contributed most to ∑TEQ, followed by 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD. BDE 47 being the dominant BDE congener, followed by BDE 100. ∑DDT concentrations were relatively similar across all study areas, with DDE contributing about 90%. Productivity of chicks per active nest was significantly decreased in Lake Vanajanselkä, and the likely explanation is embryotoxicity of dioxin-like compounds. It is plausible that dioxin-like compounds influenced embryonic survival among highly exposed ospreys prior to 2010, especially in Lake Vanajanselkä and Northern Quark. However, decreased survival due to DDE-induced eggshell thinning seems unlikely after 1985, and BDE levels were below those potentially causing adverse effects.","author":"Matti Viluksela","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b560c87ca6b2509c13eb7ea21246edbe7f737be7e55f2bb6f4e545a543406f57","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
