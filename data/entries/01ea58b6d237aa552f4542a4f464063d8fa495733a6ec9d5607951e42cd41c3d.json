{"title":"3a-(4-Chlorophenyl)-1-thioxo-2,3,3a,4-tetrahydroimidazo[1,5-a]quinazolin-5(1H)-one","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1562/v1","date":1719216783000,"content":"With the aim to produce new heterocycle molecules, the previously reported 2-(aminomethyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-one was converted efficiently by reacting with N,Nâ€™-dithiocarbonyldiimidazole (DTCI), to produce the substituted imidazolidine-2-thione moiety inserted in a three fused ring scaffold of the title compound. The molecular composition was confirmed by a high-resolution MS experiment, and its structure was elucidated by 1H, 13CNMR, and IR analyses. The thioacetamide form of the product was supported by density functional theory (DFT)-NMR analysis where 13C chemical shifts of thioacetamide form and of its iminothiol tautomer were calculated in chloroform at the BP86 /Jgauss-TZP2 level of theory. The very good linear correlation between 13C chemical shifts by experiment and by calculation for the NHC=S form confirmed the structure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"01ea58b6d237aa552f4542a4f464063d8fa495733a6ec9d5607951e42cd41c3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
