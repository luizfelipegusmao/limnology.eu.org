{"title":"Development and Comparative Evaluation of Traditional and Advanced MPPT Algorithms for PV Systems in Partial Shading Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0788/v1","date":1718172918000,"content":"The optimization of photovoltaic (PV) systems is vital for enhancing efficiency and economic viability, especially under Partial Shading Conditions (PSCs). This study focuses on the development and comparison of traditional and advanced algorithms, including Perturb and Observe (P&amp;O), Incremental Conductance (IC), Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), for efficient Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). Simulations conducted in MATLAB/SIMULINK evaluated these algorithmsâ€™ performance under various shading scenarios. The results indicate that while traditional methods like P&amp;O and IC are effective under uniform conditions, advanced techniques, particularly ANN-based MPPT, exhibit superior efficiency and faster convergence under PSCs. The study concludes that integrating AI and ML into MPPT algorithms significantly enhances the reliability and efficiency of PV systems, paving the way for broader adoption of solar energy technologies in diverse environmental conditions. These findings contribute to advancing renewable energy technology and support the green energy transition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"80f50e319a74ef00d6e9a806477561d43e8931f02f1405ff96da6b2766f0fef1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
