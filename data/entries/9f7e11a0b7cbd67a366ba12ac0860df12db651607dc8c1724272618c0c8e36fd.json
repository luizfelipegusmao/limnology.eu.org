{"title":"Creating Family-Centred Support for Children with Developmental Disabilities in Africa. Examples of Local Community Interventions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0454/v1","date":1715157261000,"content":"Preschoolers with disabilities and their family caregivers are missed out in many public health initiatives especially in low-income countries. Yet they can benefit from early intervention to promote their development from soon after birth and to provide a better quality of life for their families.  In this paper, we describe how a community-based approach has been implemented with minimal funding in two areas in Zimbabwe: a township in Harare and in rural areas of Manicaland Province.  Our aim in sharing this information – allied with references to research studies recently undertaken in Africa – is that it will enable similar supports to be replicated in other communities by local personnel.  A logic model is used to describe the situation in which the two projects work, the various inputs they have provided to their community and the different forms of support they have offered to the children and their caregivers.  The project outputs are listed in terms of the number of beneficiaries helped and activities undertaken.  The outcomes achieved for the children, the family and communities are reported.  The sustainability and extensions of community-based projects to address unmet needs are discussed. The main conclusion is that disadvantaged communities can be energized to address the needs of their most marginalized residents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f7e11a0b7cbd67a366ba12ac0860df12db651607dc8c1724272618c0c8e36fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
