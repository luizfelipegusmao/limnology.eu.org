{"title":"The Threat of Foreign Tilapia Species to the Ghanaian Aquaculture Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1722/v1","date":1724406152000,"content":"The Akosombo Nile tilapia is the only approved local strain for aquaculture production in Ghana. In this study, an exotic red tilapia sample suspected to be cultured in a fish farm within the Lower Volta River Basin of the Lake Volta was collected for species identification. A molecular screening using DNA barcoding sequencing was performed on the samples targeting the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial gene (COX1). We confirmed the identity of the red tilapia fish to be a non-native Oreochromis sp. recently introduced into the country. The data obtained clearly demonstrates a breach of biosecurity that potentially threatens Ghanaâ€™s native tilapia genetic resources and aquaculture development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a6b3a55b79c507f946fb2fcc5db111ff77e7d516690a12d91045dbcb9f1d495a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
