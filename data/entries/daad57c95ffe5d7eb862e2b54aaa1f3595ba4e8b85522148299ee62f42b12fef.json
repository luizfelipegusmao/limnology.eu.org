{"title":"Two Dark Clouds on the Space-Time Horizon","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0210/v1","date":1712190643000,"content":"(i) Investigations of stellar systems known as wide binaries suggest that Newtonâ€™s law of gravitation breaks down at low accelerations. This can be explained by proposing a fifth force with $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, whose corresponding gauge boson is  the sought for dark matter candidate. (ii) Relativistic causality (i.e. no faster than light signalling) permits nonlocal correlations stronger than those permitted by quantum mechanics. This can be explained if our universe possesses a second 4D spacetime with a signature opposite to ours. (iii) Such a fifth force, and a second spacetime, arise naturally in a recently proposed theory of unification based on an $E_8\\times E_8$ symmetry. Our spacetime arises from breaking of an $SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{YDEM}$ symmetry, and the second spacetime arises from broken electroweak symmetry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"daad57c95ffe5d7eb862e2b54aaa1f3595ba4e8b85522148299ee62f42b12fef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
