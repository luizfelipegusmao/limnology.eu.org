{"title":"Grover Disease Association with Cutaneous Keratinocyte Cancers: More than a Coincidence?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0585/v1","date":1723111642000,"content":"(1) Background: better mechanistic understanding of desmosome disruption and acantholysis in Grover disease (GD) may improve management of this disease. Recent molecular studies highlighted promising pathways to be explored, by directly comparing GD and selected features of associated skin diseases. The association between GD and cutaneous keratinocyte carcinomas, the most prevalent non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), is not completely characterized. (2) Objective: To review the medical literature regarding GD-associated cutaneous keratinocyte cancers, focusing on molecular features, pathophysiological mechanisms and disease associations, to help guide future research and patient management. (3) Result: GD has been associated with a variety of skin conditions, but its association with skin cancers has been rarely reported. Between 1983 and 2024 only 9 scientific papers presented data supporting this association. Interestingly, we found that GD may mimic multiple NMSCs, as few authors reported GD cases misdiagnosed as multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas for more than 4 years, or the presence of superficial basal cell carcinomaâ€“like areas associated with focal acantholysis. (4) Conclusions: (a) GD may be an imitator of multiple NMSCs and (b) the relationship between GD and NMSCs may reveal promising pathways for the mechanistic understanding of desmosome disruption and acantholysis in GD and may even lead to its reclassification as a distinctive syndrome.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92e88683479020bd661a4a2b88078a6b96191eedee559056f7a2f00fbc4b3d1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
