{"title":"Influence of Teacher Availability on Student Academic Achievement in Public Secondary Schools in Southwestern Nigeria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2605/v1","date":1722591225000,"content":"This study investigated the influence of Teacher Availability -TAV (Number of Available Teachers, Teacher Punctuality -TP, Teacher Promptness to Class -TPC) on Student Academic Achievement (SAA) in Public Senior Secondary Schools (PSSS) in Southwestern Nigeria. The descriptive survey research design of correlational type was adopted while the multi-stage sampling procedure was used in the study. A simple random sampling technique was used to select three (Oyo, Ogun, and Ekiti) states out of the six in Southwestern Nigeria, as well as one Senatorial District (SD) from each state. The proportionate-to-size sampling technique was used to select 40% of the Local Government Areas (LGAs) in each SD and 50% (101) of the schools in the sampled LGAs. A class of 3,030 PSSS II was used; 202 Mathematics and English Language teachers and 202 Heads of Department (101 each from Science and Arts) were purposively sampled, while 101 school administrators were enumerated. The instruments were TP ( =0.75); TPC ( =0.82); English Language Achievement Test-ELAT (KR-20=7.47) and Mathematics Achievement Test-MAT (KR-20=7.46). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Respondents’ ages were 46.5±5.20 years (teachers) and 17.60±1.60 years (students). There were 59.0% male teachers and 57.0% female students. The SAA (ELAT=45.7% and MAT=38.4%) was low. Also, TAV ( =3.36) was high against the threshold of 2.5, and TAV (ß=0.59, t=7.29) significantly contributed to SAA. Teacher availability influenced the student academic achievement in public senior secondary schools in Southwestern Nigeria. Hence, all the education stakeholders should pay attention to this for improved student academic achievement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc97d6b62f4f9b60000db6e27ad9c602c0f396388d147df0e310757bf4c99839","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
