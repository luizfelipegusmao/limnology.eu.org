{"title":"Unravelling the role of oceanographic connectivity in the distribution of genetic diversity of marine forests at the global scale","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13857?af=R","date":1721196440000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Aim</h2>\n<p>Genetic diversity of marine forests results from complex interactions of eco-evolutionary processes. Among them, oceanographic connectivity driven by dispersal through water transport is hypothesized to play a pivotal role, yet its relative contribution has not been addressed at the global scale. Here, we test how present-day oceanographic connectivity is correlated with the distribution of genetic diversity of marine forests across the ocean.</p>\n<h2>Location</h2>\n<p>Global.</p>\n<h2>Time period</h2>\n<p>Contemporary.</p>\n<h2>Major taxa studied</h2>\n<p>Marine forests of brown macroalgae (order: Fucales, Ishigeales, Laminariales and Tilopteridales).</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>Through literature review, we compiled a comprehensive dataset of genetic differentiation, encompassing 699 populations of 30 species. A biophysical model coupled with network analyses estimated multigenerational oceanographic connectivity and centrality across the marine forest global distribution. This approach integrated propagule dispersive capacity and long-distance dispersal events. Linear mixed models tested the relative contribution of site-specific processes, connectivity and centrality in explaining genetic differentiation.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>We show that spatiality-dependent eco-evolutionary processes, as described by our models, are prominent drivers of genetic differentiation in marine forests (significant models in 91.43% of the cases with an average <i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> of 0.50 ± 0.07). Specifically, we reveal that 18.7% of genetic differentiation variance is explicitly induced by predicted contemporary connectivity and centrality. Moreover, we demonstrate that long-distance dispersal is key in connecting populations of species distributed across large water masses and continents.</p>\n<h2>Main conclusions</h2>\n<p>Our findings highlight the role of present-day oceanographic connectivity in shaping the extant distribution of genetic diversity of marine forests on a global scale, with significant implications for biogeography and evolution. This understanding can pave the way for future research aimed at guiding conservation efforts, including the designation of well-connected marine protected areas, which is particularly relevant for sessile ecosystems structuring species such as brown macroalgae.</p>","author":"Térence Legrand, \nEliza Fragkopoulou, \nLauren Vapillon, \nLidiane Gouvêa, \nEster A.
