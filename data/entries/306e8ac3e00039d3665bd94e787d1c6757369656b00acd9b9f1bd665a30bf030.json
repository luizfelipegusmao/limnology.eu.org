{"title":"Humor in parenting: Does it have a role?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306311","date":1721224800000,"content":"<p>by Lucy Emery, Anne Libera, Erik Lehman, Benjamin H. Levi</p>\r\nBackground <p>Despite the widespread use of humor in social interactions and the considerable literature on humor in multiple fields of study, the use of humor in parenting has received very little formal study. The purpose of this pilot study was to gather preliminary data on the use of humor in the raising of children.</p> Materials and methods <p>We developed and administered a 10-item survey to measure people’s experiences being raised with humor and their views regarding humor as a parenting tool. Responses were aggregated into Disagree, Indeterminate, and Agree, and analyzed using standard statistical methods.</p> Results <p>Respondents (n = 312) predominantly identified as male (63.6%) and white (76.6%) and were (by selection) between the ages of 18–45 years old. The majority of participants reported that they: were raised by people who used humor in their parenting (55.2%); believe humor can be an effective parenting tool (71.8%) and in that capacity has more potential benefit than harm (63.3%); either use (or plan to use) humor in parenting their own children (61.8%); and would value a course on how to utilize humor in parenting (69.7%). Significant correlations were found between the use of humor and both i) the quality of respondents’ relationships with their parents and ii) assessments of how good a job their parents had done.</p> Conclusions <p>In this pilot study, respondents of childbearing/rearing age reported positive views about humor as a parenting tool.</p>","author":"Lucy Emery","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"306e8ac3e00039d3665bd94e787d1c6757369656b00acd9b9f1bd665a30bf030","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
