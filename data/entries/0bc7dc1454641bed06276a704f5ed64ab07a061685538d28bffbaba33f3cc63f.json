{"title":"DNA Aptamer raised against Advanced Glycation End Products Improves Sperm Concentration, Motility, and Viability by Suppressing RAGE-induced Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Testes of Diabetic Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1938/v1","date":1714402694000,"content":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for male infertility, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are pathogenic molecules for diabetic vascular complications. Here, we investigated the effects of DNA-aptamer raised against AGEs (AGE-Apt) on testicular and sperm abnormalities in a T2DM mouse model. KK-Ay (DM) and wild-type (non-DM) 4- and 7-week-old male mice were sacrificed to collect the testes and spermatozoa for immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, and histological analyses. DM and non-DM 7-week-old mice were subcutaneously infused with AGE-Apt or control aptamer for 6 weeks and then sacrificed. Plasma glucose, testicular AGEs, and RAGE gene expression in 4-week-old DM mice and plasma glucose, testicular AGEs, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory gene expressions in 7-week-old DM mice were higher than those in age-matched non-DM mice; the latter of which was associated with seminiferous tubular dilation. AGE-Apt did not affect glycemic parameters, but it inhibited the seminiferous tubular dilation, reduced the number of testicular macrophages and apoptotic cells, and restored the decrease in sperm concentration, motility, and viability of 13-week-old DM mice. Our findings suggest that AGEs-Apt may improve sperm abnormality by suppressing the AGEâ€“RAGE-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in the testes of DM mice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0bc7dc1454641bed06276a704f5ed64ab07a061685538d28bffbaba33f3cc63f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
