{"title":"ANN Learning, Attention, and Memory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0757/v1","date":1718183279000,"content":"The learning equations of an ANN are presented, giving an extremely concise derivation based on the principle of backpropagation through the descendent gradient. Then, a reflection is developed on the dual attention network that applies the learning equations and coordinates subnetworks toward purposeful behaviors. Speculation is made on possible developments of functionalities that could provide additional skills and at the same time shed light on competencies typical of ``natural intelligence\".","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc851594e9e2a6531cbe0fee732bfb0eb14ec7dface4a44bed4e850bd78612d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
