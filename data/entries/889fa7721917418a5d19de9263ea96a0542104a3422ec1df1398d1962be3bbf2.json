{"title":"Renewable Energy Produced by Agricultural Farms in 2014-2022","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1007/v1","date":1726277942000,"content":"The objective of this research is to show the family farms as an energy consumers and producers from renewable sources. It is a possibility for them to reduce operating costs. Time scope of the study covers the period 2014-2022. The data source is the Farm Accountancy Data Network. On the basis of the value of energy output and energy costs the rankings were prepared. After the ranks were awarded, the strong position of the Netherlands and Germany was indicated. It has been shown that the production and consumption of energy depend on the economic size of the farm, and do not depend on the type of production. As such, panel models were built for energy output and costs. The determinants that affect them were indicated. Energy output depends on total inputs â€“ the higher they are, the higher the output. The energy costs are related to utilized agricultural area, total output and family farm income. The results obtained are discussed within the framework of recommendations of the European Commission.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"889fa7721917418a5d19de9263ea96a0542104a3422ec1df1398d1962be3bbf2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
