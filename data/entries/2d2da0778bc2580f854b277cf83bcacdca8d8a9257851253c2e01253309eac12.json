{"title":"Placental Homeostasis of Oxytocin and Its Ability to Affect the Biological Activity of Retinal Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1238/v1","date":1726488582000,"content":"The development of fetal organs can be impacted by systemic changes in the mother's circulation, and the placenta is essential for pregnancy homeostasis and feeding. In clinical obstetrics, oxytocin (OXT) is used to induce labor. To further explore the placental homeostasis of OXT, we compared OXT levels in neonatal cord blood among newborns whose mothers either received OXT prenatally or underwent natural labor. Our previous study revealed that the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), a vital component of the neural retina that forms the blood-retina barrier, is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We hypothesized that. \nthe formation of the neural retina and vessels within it may be impacted by perinatal OXT injection, which suggests that it may be used as a therapeutic intervention for developing eye illnesses such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).  We first studied the amounts of OXT in neonatal cord blood. To investigate this subcellular activity, we administered OXT to mature RPE cells. With the aid of network analysis, our results suggest that perinatal administration of OXT may affect the growth of the neural retina and its corresponding retinal vessels, making it a potential therapeutic intervention for developmental eye diseases such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d2da0778bc2580f854b277cf83bcacdca8d8a9257851253c2e01253309eac12","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
