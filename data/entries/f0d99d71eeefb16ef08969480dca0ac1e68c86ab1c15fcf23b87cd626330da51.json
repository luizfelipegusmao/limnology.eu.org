{"title":"Prevention and Management of Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Palsy in Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy, Current Status and Future Perspectives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1509/v1","date":1729258236000,"content":"Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy remains a significant complication following minimally invasive esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Despite advancements in surgical techniques and lymphadenectomy precision, the incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy has not been improved. Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy predominantly affects the left side and may lead to unilateral or bilateral vocal cord paralysis, resulting in hoarseness, dysphagia, and an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia. While most cases of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy are temporary and resolve within 6 to 12 months, some patients may result in permanent nerve dysfunction, severely impacting patient quality of life.\nPrevention strategies, such as nerve integrity monitoring, robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy, and advanced dissection techniques, aim to minimize nerve injury, though their effectiveness varies. Management of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy includes voice and swallowing rehabilitation, reinnervation techniques, and, in severe cases, surgical interventions such as thyroplasty and intracordal injection. As recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy can lead to significant postoperative respiratory complications, a multidisciplinary approach involving surgical precision, early detection, and comprehensive rehabilitation is crucial to improving patient outcomes and minimizing long-term morbidity in minimally invasive esophagectomy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0d99d71eeefb16ef08969480dca0ac1e68c86ab1c15fcf23b87cd626330da51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
