It is known that patients with end-stage renal disease during active standing have few changes in HRV dynamics, which are improved after hemodialysis. However, it is unknown whether the response to active standing is recovered after definitive treatment with kidney transplantation. This work aims to assess the change in HRV dynamics in the supine position and active standing through time and frequency-based metrics, as well as recurrence plot quantitative analysis (RQA). We studied HRV dynamics by obtaining 5-minute electrocardiographic recordings from kidney transplant recipients who underwent an active standing test. The mean duration of heartbeats and their standard deviation diminished in active standing, compared with the supine position. Also, the low-frequency component of HRV and the presence of diagonal and vertical structures in RQA were predominant. A larger estimated glomerular filtration rate was significantly correlated with broader HRV in the supine position and during active standing. The narrower HRV during active standing may indicate a sympathetic response to external stimuli, which is expected in a functional cardiovascular system, and may be influenced by renal function.","author":"Amara Hazel Solorio-Rivera","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b0bcdfa085ca3d586abcf3423048158634a672e1d12b3f5312f097406d16a9c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
