{"title":"Emotional Intelligence Increases Nurses&rsquo; Work Performance: Evidence from Greece","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0237/v1","date":1722838704000,"content":"Emotional intelligence may help nurses to cope with demanding work environments. Although it is well known that emotional intelligence is positively related to work performance literature on nurses is limited. The aim of our study was to examine the impact of emotional intelligence on work performance in a sample of nurses in Greece. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Greece. We collected data from a convenience sample of nurses during January 2024. We measured emotional intelligence with the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form (TEIQue-SF), and work performance with the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire (IWPQ). We created multivariable linear regression models adjusted for sex, age, educational level, and work experience. We found that the four streams of emotional intelligence (i.e. well-being, self-control, emotionality, sociability) increases nurses’ work performance. In particular, we found a positive relationship between well-being and task performance and contextual performance. Similarly, there was a positive relationship between self-control and task performance. Additionally, sociability increased task performance and contextual performance. Moreover, emotionality and sociability reduced counterproductive work behavior. Our multivariable models identified a positive impact of emotional intelligence on nurses’ work performance. Nurses managers and healthcare organizations should adopt appropriate interventions to improve nurses’ emotional intelligence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fcb818bd45b2b3e9c9a07f79474e52a0a96a6851e5aa1c46c86e676046a6bb30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
