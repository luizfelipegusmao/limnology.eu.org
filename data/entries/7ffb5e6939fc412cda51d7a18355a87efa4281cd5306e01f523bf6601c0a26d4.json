{"title":"Complete mitochondrial genomes of patients from Thailand with cardiovascular diseases","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307036","date":1720706400000,"content":"<p>by Wipada Woravatin, Rattanasak Wongkomonched, Wichittra Tassaneeyakul, Mark Stoneking, Pattarapong Makarawate, Wibhu Kutanan</p>\r\n\r\nSeveral previous studies have reported that both variation and haplogroups of mitochondrial (mt) DNA were associated with various kinds of diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, in different populations, but such studies have not been carried out in Thailand. Here, we sequenced complete mtDNA genomes from 82 patients diagnosed with three types of cardiovascular disease, i.e., Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) (<i>n</i> = 26), Long Q-T Syndrome (LQTS) (<i>n</i> = 7) and Brugada Syndrome (BrS) (<i>n</i> = 49) and compared these with 750 previously published mitogenome sequences from interviewed normal individuals as a control group. Both patient and control groups are from the same geographic region of northeastern Thailand. We found 9, 2, and 5 novel mutations that were not both damaging and deleterious in HCM, LQTS, and BrS patients, respectively. Haplogroup R9c was significantly associated with HCM (<i>P</i> = 0.0032; OR = 62.42; 95%CI = 6.892–903.4) while haplogroup M12b was significantly associated with LQTS (<i>P</i> = 0.0039; OR = 32.93; 95% CI = 5.784–199.6). None of the haplogroups was found to be significantly associated with BrS. A significantly higher density of mtDNA variants in the rRNA genes was found in patients with HCM and BrS (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) than in those with LQTS or the control group. Effects of detected SNPs in either protein coding or tRNA genes of all the mitogenome sequences were also predicted. Interestingly, three SNPs in two tRNA genes (<i>MT-TA</i> m.5618T&gt;C and m.5631G&gt;A heteroplasmic variants in two BrS patients and <i>MT-TQ</i> m.4392C&gt;T novel homoplasmic variant in a HCM patient) were predicted to alter tRNA secondary structure, possibly leading to abnormal tRNA function.","author":"Wipada Woravatin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7ffb5e6939fc412cda51d7a18355a87efa4281cd5306e01f523bf6601c0a26d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
