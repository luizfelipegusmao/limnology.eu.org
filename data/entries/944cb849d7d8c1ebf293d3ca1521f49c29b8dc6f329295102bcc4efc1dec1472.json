{"title":"Analysis of Ecosystemic Cultural Services as Factors in Urban Landscape Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0997/v1","date":1713258343000,"content":"Ecosystemic services are those that provide material or immaterial benefits to the inhabitants of a landscape from its water, food, medicines and raw materials. They are classified into four types: provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural. The latter can be defined as those non-material benefits that humans obtain through ecosystems. They include educational value, cultural diversity, sources of inspiration, spirituality and religious values, aesthetic value, social relations, rootedness or belonging, cultural heritage, recreational and ecotourism services, and scientific knowledge, among others. Characterising such diverse factors requires a systematisation in study facets for their management. We propose three: memory, image and socio-system, as differentiated spheres of approach to the urban landscape. The memory facet would include the ecosystemic services of belonging, cultural heritage and, in certain themes, cultural diversity, sources of inspiration and religious values. The image facet includes the aesthetic value and perceptual aspects of ecotourism. In the socio-system we would study the educational value, scientific knowledge and recreational or spirituality services, reflected in the endowments; but also social relations, rootedness and another vision of ecotourism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"944cb849d7d8c1ebf293d3ca1521f49c29b8dc6f329295102bcc4efc1dec1472","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
