{"title":"Terahertz Dielectric Metasurface for Reconfigurable Multifunctional Holographic Imaging with Dual-Mode Controlled by Graphene","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2254/v1","date":1722234328000,"content":"Metasurface constitutes one of the most promising technologies for holographic imaging; however, the work for terahertz (THz) metasurface holographic imaging is relatively limited. Here, we propose a THz dielectric geometric-propagation phase metasurface, which can operate dual-mode (reflection and transmission) and reconfigurable multifunctional holographic imaging. The dual-mode is realized by controlling the Fermi energy level (Ef) of the graphene integrated into the metasurface unit, and the reconfigurable three-channel holographic imaging in reflection or transmission mode are achieved by switching the feed polarization among left-handed circular polarization (LCP), right-handed circular polarization (RCP) and linear polarization (LP). The metasurface is designed based on the transmission mode, and a physical model for switching to the reflection mode is established. For the first time to the best of our knowledge, a reflection-transmission dynamic modulation THz holographic imaging metasurface has been developed. The holographic metasurface operates in transmission mode at Ef = 0.1 eV, and in reflection mode at Ef = 0.9 eV. Compared with recently published holographic imaging metasurfaces, the proposed metasurface offers the following advantages: high holographic efficiencies (42.5% to 49%), more holographic imaging channels, dynamic modulation dual-mode operations, and reconfigurability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ef2697b06c54b92378fff14d5fcfabaef5fbcc0012e9f50319ed677df9533d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
