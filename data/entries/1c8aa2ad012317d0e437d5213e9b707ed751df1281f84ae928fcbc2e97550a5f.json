{"title":"Primordial Axion Stars and Galaxy Halos Formation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0033/v1","date":1722571073000,"content":"Primordial axion stars, hypothetical stars formed from axions, could play an essential role in forming galaxy halos. These stars could have originated in the early universe shortly after the Big Bang. We show that while “normal” axions coalesce into a gravitationally bound Bose-Einstein condensate, forming a dense object - an axion star, the ultralight axions could act as the initial seeds for galaxy halos.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1c8aa2ad012317d0e437d5213e9b707ed751df1281f84ae928fcbc2e97550a5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
