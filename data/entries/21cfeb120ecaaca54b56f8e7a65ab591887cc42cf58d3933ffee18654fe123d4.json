{"title":"Strategies for Solving the Issue of Malachite Green Residues in Aquatic Products: A Review","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/8578570?af=R","date":1675670400000,"content":"<p>Malachite green (MG) residue in aquatic products is a widely concerning issue, and the possible source of MG contamination includes its illegal usage and environmental pollution. A variety of strategies for solving such a problem have been proposed, and the research about them is summarized in this review. The MG contamination in aquaculture environments can be eliminated by adsorption, degraded by advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), or biodegraded by microbes or enzymes. The illegal usage of MG can be prevented by screening novel anti-<i>Saprolegnia</i> sp. agents from current available agricultural antibiotics, plant extracts, or antagonistic microbes. Nevertheless, deficiencies also existed in these proposed solving strategies. Therefore, further research opportunities in such areas were provided. This includes developing effective combinatorial methods (adsorption + AOPs or biodegradation) for eliminating MG from the aquaculture environment; systematically considering the impact of practical conditions on the efficiency of MG elimination; screening more efficient anti-<i>Saprolegnia</i> sp. agents; and systematically evaluating both the in vivo activities and safety of these agents.</p>","author":"Jiang He, \nPing Mo, \nYu-Shuang Luo, \nPin-Hong Yang, \nHamed Ghafarifarsani","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"21cfeb120ecaaca54b56f8e7a65ab591887cc42cf58d3933ffee18654fe123d4","category":"Environment"}
