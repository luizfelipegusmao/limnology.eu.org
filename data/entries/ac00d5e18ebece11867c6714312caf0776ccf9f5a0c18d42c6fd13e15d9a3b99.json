{"title":"Electrogeneration and Characterization of Poly(methylene Blue) Thin Films on Stainless Steel Electrodes. Effect of the pH.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0460/v1","date":1720099173000,"content":"Methylene blue has been electropolymerized on the surface of a stainless steel 316. The addition of sodium oxalate and working at a pH near 11 has allowed to obtain steel electrodes coated with electroactive polymer. This polymer shows electrochromic properties similar to those of the monomer, but also appears electroactivity at more positive potentials which is associated to the active centers in the bridges between monomeric units. The study by means of digital video electrochemistry has allowed on the one hand, to quantify the color changes on the entire surface of the stainless steel simultaneously and by means of the mean color intensities to separate the contribution to the overall polymer response of the active centers of the phenothiazine ring and of the inter-monomer bonds. A reduction mechanism for the polymer compatible with the pH variation of the observed electrochemical behavior is proposed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac00d5e18ebece11867c6714312caf0776ccf9f5a0c18d42c6fd13e15d9a3b99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
