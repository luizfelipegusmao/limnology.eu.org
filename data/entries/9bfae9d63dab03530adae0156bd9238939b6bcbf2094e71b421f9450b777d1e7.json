{"title":"International Cooperation and Indonesia&#039;s Food Diplomacy in Facing Global Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1360/v1","date":1721204331000,"content":"International cooperation and food diplomacy play a pivotal role in addressing global challenges to food security. This study explores the effectiveness of Indonesia's international partnerships and diplomatic strategies in bolstering its food security amidst global uncertainties. The research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative analysis of policy documents and interviews with key stakeholders, alongside quantitative data on food production and trade. Our findings indicate that Indonesia has benefited significantly from technical and financial assistance through collaboration with organizations such as FAO, ASEAN, and bilateral agreements with countries like Japan and China. These partnerships have facilitated the adoption of advanced agricultural technologies, improved infrastructure, and enhanced human resource capacities. However, challenges remain, including bureaucratic inefficiencies and dependency on food imports, which pose risks to sustainable food security. The study concludes that while international cooperation has provided critical support, Indonesia must further streamline its policy implementation processes and reduce its reliance on imports by fostering local production. Strengthening research and development collaborations and actively participating in global forums are also recommended to ensure long-term resilience and food sovereignty. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders aiming to develop effective strategies to navigate the complexities of global food diplomacy and cooperation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9bfae9d63dab03530adae0156bd9238939b6bcbf2094e71b421f9450b777d1e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
