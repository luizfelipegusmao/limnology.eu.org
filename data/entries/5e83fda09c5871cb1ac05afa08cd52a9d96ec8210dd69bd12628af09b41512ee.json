{"title":"Unlocking the mergers and acquisitions puzzle in the United Arab Emirates: Investigating the impact of corporate leverage on target selection and payment methods","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299717","date":1710338400000,"content":"<p>by Moataz Elmassri, Tariq Z. Elrazaz, Yousry Ahmed</p>\r\n\r\nFollowing a long stream of literature on the drivers of Mergers and Acquisition (M&amp;A) activities, this study examines the effect of corporate leverage on several decisions of M&amp;A deals in the context of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Using M&amp;A data from the Thomson One database for the period between 2005 and 2022, we find that corporate leverage significantly influences the type of M&amp;A target. This study further adds to the prior literature on the contradictory behaviours of high and low leverage firms by examining whether acquisition decisions differ amongst them in M&amp;A deals in the UAE context. Results indicate that high (low) leverage firms are less (more) likely to acquire private targets and more (less) inclined to acquire a target from a different (same) industry. Furthermore, our results show that the relationship between the method of payment used in M&amp;A deals and corporate leverage is insignificant. We control for endogeneity using Heckman’s two-stage method. In brief, this paper extends the literature with conclusive evidence that considerations of capital structure can significantly anticipate and explain firms’ behaviour toward M&amp;A choices. The implication of findings may include a call to reform some aspects of the Competition Law in the UAE by requiring private firms to enhance their disclosure practices similar to their public counterparts.","author":"Moataz Elmassri","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5e83fda09c5871cb1ac05afa08cd52a9d96ec8210dd69bd12628af09b41512ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
