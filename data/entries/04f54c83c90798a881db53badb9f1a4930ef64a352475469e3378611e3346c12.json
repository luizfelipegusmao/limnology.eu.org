{"title":"The propagation of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi with Trap Plants: A Proposal For Sustainable Management of Coffee Plantations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1452/v1","date":1713852491000,"content":"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are soil microorganisms that provide various benefits, such as increasing soil fertility and enhancing plant growth. The present study aimed to propagate arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spores in trap plants. Soil sampling was carried out in October 2021 on five coffee farms in the central area of Veracruz, Mexico. Soil from coffee plantations and sterile sand were mixed in pots and used for the propagation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and Sorghum vulgare was used as a trap plant. The plants were kept in a greenhouse for 120 days. The abundance of spores in the sorghum trap plants increased significantly (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04f54c83c90798a881db53badb9f1a4930ef64a352475469e3378611e3346c12","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
