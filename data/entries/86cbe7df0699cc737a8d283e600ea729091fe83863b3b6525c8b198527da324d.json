This article introduces the clinical technique and outcomes of using Kirschner wire tension band combined with anchor screw cross-stitch fixation for comminuted inferior patellar pole fractures.</p> Methods <p>This retrospective case series study included 14 patients with comminuted inferior patellar pole fractures treated at our institution from September 1, 2020, to April 30, 2022. All patients underwent surgery using the Kirschner wire tension band with anchor screw cross-stitch technique. Follow-up assessments involved postoperative X-rays to evaluate fracture healing, as well as clinical parameters such as healing time, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, range of motion (ROM), and Bostman scores.</p> Results <p>All patients were followed for an average of over 12 months, with no cases of internal fixation failure. Knee joint stability and function were excellent. X-rays revealed an average healing time of approximately 10.79 ± 1.53 weeks, hospitalization lasted 5.64 ± 1.15 days, surgery took approximately 37.86 ± 5.32 minutes, and intraoperative blood loss was 33.29 ± 8.15 ml. One patient experienced irritation from the internal fixation material. At the final follow-up, the Bostman score averaged 28.29 ± 0.83, knee joint flexion reached 131.07° ± 4.88°, all patients achieved full knee extension, and the VAS score was 0.36 ± 0.63.</p> Conclusion <p>Kirschner wire tension band with anchor screw cross-stitch fixation for comminuted inferior patellar pole fractures delivered satisfactory clinical outcomes. This surgical method, characterized by its simplicity and reliability, is a valuable addition to clinical practice.</p>","author":"SiYu Duan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"86cbe7df0699cc737a8d283e600ea729091fe83863b3b6525c8b198527da324d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
