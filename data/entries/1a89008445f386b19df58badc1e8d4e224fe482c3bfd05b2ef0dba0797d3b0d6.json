This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of using phytoplankton diversity as a water quality indicator in wetlands, and find out the main environmental variables affecting the distribution of phytoplankton. From 2020 to 2021, we examined phytoplankton assemblages and water environmental variables in spring, summer, and autumn at eight sampling sites from Hulanhe Wetland, Northeast (NE) China. The results showed that Bacillariophyta was the dominant species. Phytoplankton composition and abundance differed among sampling sites in each season; the abundance in summer (613.71 × 10<sup>4</sup> ind. L<sup>–1</sup>) was higher than that in autumn and spring. The water quality assessment of the trophic state index (<i>TSI</i>) based on the four physicochemical indicators was compared with phytoplankton diversity indices, which indicated that the phytoplankton community was stable, and these two indices were significantly lower in summer than in spring and autumn. According to redundancy analysis (RDA), total phosphorus (TP) and nitrogen (TN) were the main environmental variables affecting the distribution of phytoplankton. Temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) changes also played a role, and their impact on the community was discussed. This work can provide relevant scientific references on the usefulness of phytoplankton diversity structure in assessing water quality in cold regions, in which the succession can be significantly affected by nutrients and temperatures.","author":"Hongkuan Hui","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1a89008445f386b19df58badc1e8d4e224fe482c3bfd05b2ef0dba0797d3b0d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
