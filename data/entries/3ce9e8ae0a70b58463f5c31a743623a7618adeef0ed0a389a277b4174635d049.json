{"title":"Genetic Diversity and Population Dynamics of Lobodon carcinophaga in Danco Coast, Antarctica","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4246?af=R","date":1725001200000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The crabeater seal (<i>Lobodon carcinophaga</i>) is the most common Antarctic seal; however, it remains understudied regarding genetic aspects. This research examined the genetic diversity and population dynamics of the Danco Coast population in the Antarctic Peninsula and compared it with the Western Antarctica population. Twenty novel haplotypes were identified, revealing a stable population phase and a brief expansion. The high genetic diversity aligns with those found in similar species and environments. Historical population dynamics correlate with Pleistocene climate shifts, shedding light on climate change's impact on Antarctic ecosystems. This study increases our understanding of Antarctic seal species, contributing to the region's guidelines to improve environmental conservation policies in the Antarctic sector.</p>","author":"Laura Prosdocimi, \nEzequiel Alejandro Ibañez, \nMaría Constanza Gariboldi, \nJavier Negrete, \nMagalí Bobinac, \nHumberto Luis Cappozzo, \nJuan Ignacio Túnez","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems: Table of Contents","siteHash":"53f1a0c472ad7591633d0b281e1df2834126145a77ec9c0585f4049ad3e52c8f","entryHash":"3ce9e8ae0a70b58463f5c31a743623a7618adeef0ed0a389a277b4174635d049","category":"Environment"}
