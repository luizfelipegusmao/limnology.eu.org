It only comes in one style: white and silver, with a 1 meter (about 3 foot) USB-C cable. That is way too short and you’ll need a separate USB-C power adapter to go with it, but it works as advertised: Plug it into a 20W Apple charger and you’ll get the maximum MagSafe charging speeds (15W on the iPhone 12, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max, and 12W on the iPhone 12 mini). The charger is too small and light to stay on the desk when you pick up your iPhone, making it a poor wireless charging pad. The cable is far too short to comfortably charge and use your iPhone at the same time. </p> </section></article><p></p>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Clear Case with MagSafe\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/11/apple-clear-magsafe-case-100866707-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHLN3ZM/A/iphone-12-pro-max-clear-case-with-magsafe&amp;subid1=1-1-234834-0-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">US$49 at Apple</a> | <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5NRTRR?tag=macworld05-20&amp;#038;linkCode=ogi&amp;#038;th=1&amp;#038;psc=1&amp;ascsubtag=1-1-234834-0-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">$49.00 at Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p></p><article><section><p><br />If you want to show off your iPhone 12’s natural color and still keep it in an Apple case, this is your only option. It’s a fine case in that it’s sturdy and should protect your phone from bumps and bruises, but it’s very hard to remove your phone, very easy to smudge, and has a giant MagSafe target on the back surrounding the Apple logo. The buttons are a little stiff, particularly the power button. Overall, it doesn’t add all that much bulk or weight to the iPhone 12. However, even with the MagSafe component, it’s still a very simple case with a pretty high price tag.</p> </section></article><p></p>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Silicone Case with MagSafe\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/11/apple-silicone-magsage-case-100866709-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHL33ZM/A/iphone-12-12-pro-silicone-case-with-magsafe-cyprus-green&amp;subid1=1-1-234834-0-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">US$49 at Apple</a> | <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5N7JKJ?tag=macworld05-20&amp;#038;linkCode=ogi&amp;#038;th=1&amp;#038;psc=1&amp;ascsubtag=1-1-234834-0-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">$49.99 at Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p></p><article><section><p><br />If you want a thin case that offers a bit of protection and a slew of color options, the Silicone Case with MagSafe is your best bet. It comes in eight varieties and is thin enough to easily slip on and off with nice cutouts for the speakers and Lightning port on the bottom edge. There are no visible MagSafe markings and the charger and other accessories easily connect to the back. The buttons aren’t as stiff as the clear case, too. It’s not the cheapest silicone case you can buy, but if you want an Apple case that’s sure to work with MagSafe and keeps your iPhone free from scratches, this is the case to get.</p> </section></article><p></p>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Leather Case with MagSafe\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/11/apple-leather-magsafe-case-100866708-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHKE3ZM/A/iphone-12-12-pro-leather-case-with-magsafe-baltic-blue&amp;subid1=1-1-234834-0-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">US$59 at Apple</a> | <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5QJPLB?tag=macworld05-20&amp;#038;linkCode=ogi&amp;#038;th=1&amp;#038;psc=1&amp;ascsubtag=1-1-234834-0-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">$59.00 at Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p></p><article><section><p><br />If you’ve owned an Apple leather iPhone case in the past, you know that they’re very well made and come in a variety of colors.

The large mounting area is adorned with the MagSafe logo so you know where to put your phone, and the magnet is strong enough to hold it extremely well.

It’s a lot less expensive than Apple’s but without 15W charging on iPhone 12 it’s not that much of a bargain.</p>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnker PowerCore Magnetic 5K\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anker-powercore-magnetic-5k.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TW7BRTJ?tag=macworld05-20&amp;#038;linkCode=ogi&amp;#038;th=1&amp;#038;psc=1&amp;ascsubtag=1-1-234834-0-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">$39.99 at Amazon</a> | <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://us.anker.com/products/a1619&amp;xcust=1-1-234834-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">US$39.99 at Anker</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>This diminutive battery pack—a little smaller than a deck of cards—holds 5,000mAh of power. But it doesn’t fully deliver that total amount. Rather, you’ll get enough to fully charge an iPhone 12 or 12 Pro about once. The magnetic attachment is quite secure, so it’s not likely to fall off while you’re using your phone. The charging rate, unfortunately, is only 5W so it will take <em>hours</em> to fully recharge your iPhone 12. The USB-C port is a bit faster (10W), but for the price, you’re probably better off just getting a faster, higher-capacity compact portable battery that has no wireless charging. The slower speed takes a lot away from the wireless convenience.</p>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>There are several other accessories available from Apple as well, including a <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHLR3ZM/A/iphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-black&amp;subid1=1-1-234834-0-0-0\"></a><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHLR3ZM/A/iphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-black&amp;subid1=1-1-234834-0-0-0\">Leather Wallet</a> for $59, and a <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHYD3ZM/A/iphone-12-12-pro-leather-sleeve-with-magsafe-baltic-blue&amp;subid1=1-1-234834-0-0-0\"></a><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHYD3ZM/A/iphone-12-12-pro-leather-sleeve-with-magsafe-baltic-blue&amp;subid1=1-1-234834-0-0-0\">Leather Sleeve</a> with a hangtag for $129, as well as other third-party options from OtterBox and Belkin.
