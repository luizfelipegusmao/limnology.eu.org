{"title":"Synthesis, Structural Characterization and Electrochemical Properties of Copper(II) Complexes with Functionalized Thiosemicarbazones Derived from 5-Acetylbarbituric Acid","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1405/v1","date":1713783366000,"content":"The reaction between 5-acetylbarbituric acid and 4-dimethylthiosemicarbazide or 4-hexamethyleneiminyl thiosemicarbazide produces 5-acetylbarbituric-4-dimethylthiosemicarbazone (H2AcbDM) and 5-acetylbarbituric-4N-hexamethyleneiminyl thiosemicarbazone (H2Acbhexim). Eight new complexes with different cooper (II) salts have been prepared and characterized using elemental analysis, molar conductance, UV–vis, ESI-HRMS, FT-IR, magnetic moment, EPR and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, three-dimensional molecular structures of [Cu(HAcbDM)(H2O)2](NO3)·H2O (3a), [Cu(HAcbDM)(H2O)2]ClO4 (4), and [Cu(HAcbHexim)Cl] (6) were determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography, and was carried out an analysis of their supramolecular structure. The H-bonded assemblies were further studied energetically using DFT calculations, MEP surface and QTAIM analyses. In these complexes, the thiosemicarbazone coordinates to the metal ion in an ONS-tridentate manner, in the O-enolate/S-thione form. The electrochemical behavior of the thiosemicarbazones and their copper(II) complexes has been investigated at room temperature using the cyclic voltammetry technique in DMFA. The Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox system was found to be consistent with the quasi-reversible diffusion-controlled process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ffb06f4644abb78d335460ab129485d6bacd3591e7b2e0455613a3194520fd16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
