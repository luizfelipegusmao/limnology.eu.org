The UV-induced fluorescence images of FWRT at the wavelength of 365 nm were acquired by self-developed fluorescence image acquisition system. In total, 169 color and texture features based on RGB, hue-saturation-intensity and <i>L</i>*<i>a</i>*<i>b</i>* color spaces and gray level co-occurrence matrix were extracted, respectively. Successive projections algorithm (SPA) was employed to select the optimal 16 features to achieve feature dimension reduction modeling. With full and extracted features as input, the models of partial least squares regression (PLSR), least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) were established for TVB-N prediction.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Results indicated that the full features-based CNN performed better than SPA based prediction models (SPA-PLSR and SPA-LSSVM). The CNN model was determined to be the optimal with an RP2 value of 0.9779, RMSEP value of 1.1502 × 10<sup>−2</sup> g N kg<sup>−1</sup> and RPD value of 6.721 for TVB-N content predictiin.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The CNN method based on UV fluorescence imaging technology has potential for quality and safety detection of FWRT. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Huihui Wang, \nZhonglin Du, \nYule Li, \nFanyi Zeng, \nXinjing Qiu, \nGaobin Li, \nChunpeng Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"61d24c9860b5daa4c550c17e7cba74ca0cd2312a7d72f6961de8e998d658abaf","category":"Environment"}
