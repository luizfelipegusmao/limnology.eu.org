{"title":"Tensile Properties of Ex-Situ Ti-TiC Metal Matrix Composites Manufactured by Laser Powder Bed Fusion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0490/v2","date":1728896651000,"content":"Titanium-based Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) manufactured by additive manufacturing offer tremendous lightweighting opportunities. However, processing the high reinforcement contents needed to substantially improve elastic modulus while conserving significant ductility remains a challenge. Ti-TiC MMCs fabricated in this study report fracture strains in tension up to 1.7% for a Young’s modulus of 149 GPa. This fracture strain is 30% higher than previously reported values for Ti-based MMCs produced by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) displaying similar Young’s moduli. The heat treatment used after the LPBF process leads to the doubling of the fracture strain due to the conversion of TiCx dendrites into equiaxed TiCx grains. As-built microstructure shows both un-dissolved TiC particles and sub-stoichiometric TiC dendrites resulting from a partial dissolution of TiC particles. Reduction of the C/Ti ratio in TiC during the process results in an increase in the reinforcement content, from a nominal 12 vol% to an effective 21.5 vol%. The variation of the TiC lattice constant with its stoichiometry is measured, and an empirical expression is proposed for its effect on TiC’s Young’s modulus. The lower TiC initial powder size distribution displayed the best mechanical performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd992fee278900ea31fa70aa9162da53fa234595e015df825ab376a51e2c8d6a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
