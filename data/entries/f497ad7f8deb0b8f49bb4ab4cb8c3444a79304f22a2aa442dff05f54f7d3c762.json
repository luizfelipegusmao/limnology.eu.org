{"title":"Collaborative attitudes and trust among medical and dental professionals in Saudi Arabia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309744","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Khalid Aboalshamat, Emad Alzahrani, Anas Maqlan, Adel Almatrafi, Abdulaziz Alsulami</p>\r\nBackground <p>Interprofessional collaboration involves coordinated efforts by individuals from different professions. Trust is defined as an individual’s willingness to be vulnerable within a relationship, while expecting the other party to act in their best interests. This study aimed to assess the attitudes of collaboration and trust among dental and medical professionals in Saudi Arabia.</p> Materials and methods <p>This cross-sectional study evaluated the attitudes of collaboration and trust among dental and medical professionals in Saudi Arabia using an online self-reported questionnaire distributed via social media. Data analysis was performed using SPSS.</p> Results <p>The overall mean score for collaborative attitude was 6.2 (SD  =  1.52), with 69.23% of participants exhibiting a positive attitude about collaboration. Participants rated family medicine (76.67%) and pediatric medicine (76.41%) as the medical specialties most relevant to dentistry, while obstetrics/gynecology was rated the lowest (32.31%). Dental professionals had a significantly higher mean score for collaborative attitude (m  =  6.46, SD  =  1.48) than did medical professionals (m  =  5.93, SD  =  1.51; p &lt; 0.001). The score for dental professionals’ trust in medical professionals (DTM) (m  =  36.94, SD  =  8.06) was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than the score for medical professionals’ trust in dental professionals (MTD) (m  =  33.81, SD  =  8.20). The collaborative attitude scores among dental and medical professionals were not statistically significant when tested against the MTD score (p  =  0.777) and DTM score (p  =  0.419).</p> Conclusions <p>There is a high level of collaborative attitude and trust between dental and medical professionals in Saudi Arabia. Dentists exhibit a higher degree of these attributes than medical professionals. These findings support the implementation of a collaborative medical–dental education framework in Saudi Arabia, where both specialties can train together during their undergraduate years.</p>","author":"Khalid Aboalshamat","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f497ad7f8deb0b8f49bb4ab4cb8c3444a79304f22a2aa442dff05f54f7d3c762","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
