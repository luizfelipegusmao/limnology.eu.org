{"title":"Invertebrates from naturally brackish areas are less impacted by road salt and alternative deicers","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ivb.12423?af=R","date":1718687161000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Road salt (NaCl) is the most common deicer used to melt snow and ice from roadways in cold climates, but its use results in runoff of sodium and chloride ions into sewers and into soil and freshwater ecosystems. Road salt causes harmful effects on wetland habitats, which host an abundance of macroinvertebrate species. Alternatives to road salt, such as beet juice, are commercially available, but their impact on invertebrates is less well studied. We examined the impact of road salt alternatives on four invertebrate species (<i>Daphnia pulex</i>, <i>Eisenia fetida</i>, <i>Heterocypris</i> sp., and <i>Culicoides</i> sp. larvae), some of which come from a naturally brackish area. Our expectation was that road salt alternatives (beet salt, molasses, pickle juice, and sand) would be less toxic to the animals than traditional road salt. This study comprised two experiments: the first exposed individuals of the four invertebrate species to road salt alternatives, and the second exposed the invertebrates to a range of road salt concentrations. Only individuals of <i>D. pulex</i> were negatively impacted by road salt. The other invertebrates were not significantly affected by any salt alternative, demonstrating interspecific differences in response to salt. Species found in naturally salty environments were more tolerant of both road salt and alternatives. This research shows species- and habitat-specific responses to road salt alternatives, which has implications for municipalities looking to salt roads without negatively impacting freshwater ecosystems.</p>","author":"Rachel M.
