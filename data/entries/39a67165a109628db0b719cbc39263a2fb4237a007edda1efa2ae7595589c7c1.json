Loftus</p>\r\n\r\nHyperthyroidism is the most common feline endocrinopathy. In hyperthyroid humans, untargeted metabolomic analysis identified persistent metabolic derangements despite achieving a euthyroid state. Therefore, we sought to define the metabolome of hyperthyroid cats and identify ongoing metabolic changes after treatment. We prospectively compared privately-owned hyperthyroid cats (n = 7) admitted for radioactive iodine (I-131) treatment and euthyroid privately-owned control (CON) cats (n = 12). Serum samples were collected before (T0), 1-month (T1), and three months after (T3) I-131 therapy for untargeted metabolomic analysis by MS/MS. Hyperthyroid cats (T0) had a distinct metabolic signature with 277 significantly different metabolites than controls (70 increased, 207 decreased). After treatment, 66 (T1 vs. CON) and 64 (T3 vs. CON) metabolite differences persisted. Clustering and data reduction analysis revealed separate clustering of hyperthyroid (T0) and CON cats with intermediate phenotypes after treatment (T1 &amp; T3). Mevalonate/mevalonolactone and creatine phosphate were candidate biomarkers with excellent discrimination between hyperthyroid and healthy cats. We found several metabolic derangements (e.g., decreased carnitine and Î±-tocopherol) do not entirely resolve after achieving a euthyroid state after treating hyperthyroid cats with I-131. Further investigation is warranted to determine diagnostic and therapeutic implications for candidate biomarkers and persistent metabolic abnormalities.","author":"Molly A.
