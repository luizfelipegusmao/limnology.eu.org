{"title":"Atomistic Simulations of Defect Structures in Rare Earth Doped Magnesium Oxide","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1699/v1","date":1711623623000,"content":"Point defects induced by doping rare earth elements RE (Nd, Er) into the magnesium oxide host were investigated by classical atomistic simulations utilising the General Utility Lattice Program (GULP). Formation and association energies were calculated for the potential defect structures. Both isolated defects and defect complexes were considered. The most energetically favourable structures of defect complexes were found for rare earth doped and Li co-doped systems. The correlation between the association energy and the structure of the defect complex was investigated. The influences of Li were revealed with respect to energy and structure. The simulation results contribute to the understanding of the point defects of doped MgO and how Li influences the doping of rare earth elements in the MgO host.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3fb9b36094f7e196791dd87576b94e22478c2dd7bc78912e481e1d81120689ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
