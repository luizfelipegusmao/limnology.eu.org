{"title":"Sputum Induction in Pediatric Lung Disease: Are We There Yet?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1771/v1","date":1727169972000,"content":"Sputum induction (SI) is a non-invasive technique to obtain lower airway samples from people who do not spontaneously produce sputum. Since its introduction in 1958, its use has significantly increased for various respiratory conditions, especially with the establishment of standardized techniques. It has been used in pediatric research since 2002, starting with asthma studies. It is a safe and repeatable procedure for non-expectorating children. The ability to analyze both cellular and fluid components of sputum provides valuable information about lung diseases. This work reviews the utility of sputum induction in pediatric respiratory research and its potential clinical applications. We also discuss the safety, tolerability, and side effects profile of the procedure, emphasizing its significance in pediatric respiratory research. Despite the valuable insights gained from SI studies, challenges remain for widespread clinical utilization, requiring further refinement of the technique and increased accessibility in clinical settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b1f97c6b945e78de2442cbc7c0ac1e89075509fdfd137df4217c574d1768dde","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
