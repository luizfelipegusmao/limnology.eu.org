{"title":"Molecular Markers and Regulatory Networks in Solventogenic Clostridium Species: Metabolic Engineering Conundrum","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1100/v1","date":1710832005000,"content":"Solventogenic Clostridium species are important for establishing sustainable industrial bioproduction of fuels and important chemicals. The inherent versatility of these species in substrate utilization and the range of solvents produced during acetone butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation make solventogenic Clostridium an attractive choice for biotechnological applications such as production of fuels and chemicals. The functional qualities of these microbes have thus been identified to be due to complex regulatory networks that play essential roles in modulating the metabolism of this group of bacteria. Genomes of solventogenic Clostridium species have relatively greater prevalence of genes that are intricately controlled by various regulatory molecules than most other species. Consequently, the use of genetic or metabolic engineering strategies that do not consider the underlying regulatory mechanisms will not be effective. Several regulatory factors involved in substrate uptake/utilization, sporulation, solvent production, and stress responses (Carbon Catabolite Protein A, Spo0A, AbrB, Rex, CsrA) have been identified and characterized. In this review, the focus is on newly identified regulatory factors in solventogenic Clostridium species, the interaction of these factors with previously identified molecules, and potential implications on substrate utilization, solvent production, and resistance/tolerance to lignocellulose-derived microbial inhibitory compounds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0de00b43b5c49ee6532ed2fd0c16e18bd670c67e84d8bbbb015ae35bea21d7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
