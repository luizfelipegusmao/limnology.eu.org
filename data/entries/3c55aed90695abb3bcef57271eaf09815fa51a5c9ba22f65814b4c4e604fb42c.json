{"title":"Adenomyosis: A Call for Awareness, Early Detection and Effective Treatment Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1679/v1","date":1716786738000,"content":"Adenomyosis, a benign gynecological condition characterized by the infiltration of endometrial tissue into the myometrium, poses significant challenges to women's reproductive health. Recently, the landscape of adenomyosis diagnosis transformed significantly, thanks to advancements in imaging technologies such as transvaginal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. This lead to a noticeable shift in the demographic profile of patients diagnosed with adenomyosis, including younger women of reproductive age who frequently present with a diverse array of symptoms. Approximately 20% of women are affected by adenomyosis. Adenomyosis manifests with various subtypes, distinct epidemiological profiles, symptomatology, and treatment responses, necessitating tailored approaches for optimal management. Despite its clinical significance, adenomyosis remains understudied, resulting in a significant disparity in research and literature compared to other gynecological conditions. The severity of adenomyosis is compounded when coexisting with endometriosis, particularly deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), leading to exacerbated fertility issues and severe symptomatology. The wide range of symptoms, including adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, highlights its wider impact and emphasizes the need for increased awareness of the condition. Furthermore, Adenomyosis is frequently associated with treatment failure in endometriosis, contributing to dienogest resistance, elevated discontinuation rates, and persistent pain post endometriosis surgery. Additionally, the lack of specific treatments tailored to adenomyosis poses a considerable challenge in clinical management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c55aed90695abb3bcef57271eaf09815fa51a5c9ba22f65814b4c4e604fb42c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
