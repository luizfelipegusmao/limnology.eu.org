Multiple stressors can independently or interactively impact organisms; however, few studies have examined how they interact when they overlap spatially but occur asynchronously. Fluctuations in salinity have been found in freshwater habitats worldwide. Meanwhile, heatwaves have become more frequent and extreme. High salinity pulses and heatwaves are often decoupled in time but can still collectively impact freshwater zooplankton. The time intervals between them, during which population growth and community recovery could happen, can influence combined effects, but no one has examined these effects. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to examine how different recovery times (0-, 3-, 6-week) between salt treatment and heatwave exposure influence their combined effects. We hypothesized that antagonistic effects would appear when having short recovery time, because previous study found that similar species were affected by the two stressors, but effects would become additive with longer recovery time since fully recovered communities would respond to heatwave similar to undisturbed communities. Our findings showed that, when combined, the two-stressor joint impacts changed from antagonistic to additive with increased recovery time between stressors. Surprisingly, full compositional recovery was not achieved despite a recovery period that was long enough for population growth, suggesting legacy effects from earlier treatment. The recovery was mainly driven by small organisms, such as rotifers and small cladocerans. As a result, communities recovering from previous salt exposure responded differently to heatwaves than undisturbed communities, leading to similar zooplankton communities regardless of the recovery time between stressors. Our research bolsters the understanding and management of multiple-stressor issues by revealing that prior exposure to one stressor has long-lasting impacts on community recovery that can lead to unexpected joint effects of multiple stressors.</p>","author":"Xinyu Sun, \nShelley E.
