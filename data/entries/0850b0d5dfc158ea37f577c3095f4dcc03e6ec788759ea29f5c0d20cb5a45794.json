The homogeneity of the captured images and their large sizes present a challenge to even the most advanced computer vision methods, which limits the possibilities of analyzing them automatically. We present a new approach of analyzing EM data, which utilizes Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) imaging. We demonstrate the effective recognition and localization of biological structures using hyperspectral analysis of EDX data. This is illustrated by a diverse set of large-scale EDX acquisitions of a multi-cell biosamples, as well as a volumetric single cell acquisition. The richness of the acquired data, along with the proposed method of analysis, create new possibilities for the automated analysis of life science EM data.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0850b0d5dfc158ea37f577c3095f4dcc03e6ec788759ea29f5c0d20cb5a45794","category":"Environment"}
