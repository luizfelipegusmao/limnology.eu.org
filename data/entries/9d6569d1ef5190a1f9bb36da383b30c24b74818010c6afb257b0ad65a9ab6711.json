{"title":"Targeting Plasmodium Population Bottlenecks with Parasite Ligands as Vaccine Antigens","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0801/v1","date":1712827754000,"content":"WHO reported an estimated 249 million malaria cases and 608,000 malaria deaths in 85 countries in 2022. A total of 94% of malaria deaths occurred in Africa, 80 % of which were children under 5. In other words, one child dies every minute from malaria. The RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine, that uses the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) to target sporozoite infection of the liver, achieved modest efficacy. The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Program (MVIP), coordinated by the WHO and completed at the end of 2023, found that immunization reduced mortality by only 13%. To further reduce malaria death, development of a more effective malaria vaccine is a high priority. Three major malaria vaccine targets being considered are the level of sporozoite liver infection, merozoite red blood cell (RBC) infection, and mosquito midgut infection. These targets involve specific ligand-receptor interactions. However, current malaria vaccine candidates that target two major parasite population bottlenecks, liver infection and mosquito midgut infection, do not focus on such parasite ligands. Here we evaluate the potential of newly identified parasite ligands as novel malaria vaccine antigens.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d6569d1ef5190a1f9bb36da383b30c24b74818010c6afb257b0ad65a9ab6711","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
