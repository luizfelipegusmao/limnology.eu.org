Various stimuli like heating or biasing in gaseous environments have been employed to study materials synthesis [<a href=\"#ozae044.1089-B1\">1</a>], catalyst [<a href=\"#ozae044.1089-B2\">2</a>], ferroelectrics[<a href=\"#ozae044.1089-B3\">3</a>], resistive switching [<a href=\"#ozae044.1089-B4\">4</a>] and more. The majority of the commercial in situ (S)TEM sample holders, however utilize only four electrical contacts that limit the combination of stimuli that the user can simultaneously apply. Real life applications, like proton exchange membranes, fuel cells, and non-volatile memory, etc, on the other hand, require combined application of thermal and electrical stimuli at ambient environmental conditions and thus, higher number of electrical signals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0dc86d62e442beff78b37aa5f109100c7ddc3565c7e2275c845a25a5415dfe9c","category":"Environment"}
