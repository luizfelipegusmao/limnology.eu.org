{"title":"Evo-Devo Mechanobiology: The Missing Link","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/63/6/1455/7165756?rss=1","date":1684195200000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>While the modern framework of evolutionary development (evo-devo) has been decidedly genetic, historic analyses have also considered the importance of mechanics in the evolution of form. With the aid of recent technological advancements in both quantifying and perturbing changes in the molecular and mechanical effectors of organismal shape, how molecular and genetic cues regulate the biophysical aspects of morphogenesis is becoming increasingly well studied. As a result, this is an opportune time to consider how the tissue-scale mechanics that underlie morphogenesis are acted upon through evolution to establish morphological diversity. Such a focus will enable a field of evo-devo mechanobiology that will serve to better elucidate the opaque relations between genes and forms by articulating intermediary physical mechanisms. Here, we review how the evolution of shape is measured and related to genetics, how recent strides have been made in the dissection of developmental tissue mechanics, and how we expect these areas to coalesce in evo-devo studies in the future.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative and Comparative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"715dd1b0fb4f45600bceadb227e9b7fdf8bd9d1d7a2fd3d5e0399d2c1f410646","entryHash":"f7d1423761a466e3386bd9b8a65039e55a2413624b30ec653132b4a0d67443cf","category":"Environment"}
