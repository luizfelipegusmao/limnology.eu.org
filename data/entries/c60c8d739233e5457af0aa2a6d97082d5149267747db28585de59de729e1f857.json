{"title":"Evaluation of the energy consumption of hybrid desalination RO‐MED‐FD to reduce rejected brine","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14312?af=R","date":1709812904000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The escalating global capacity of desalination plants has posed a significant environmental threat due to the discharge of brine. Consequently, urgent treatment of these hypersaline brines has become imperative. This article provides an overview of a novel hybrid model for water desalination. Energy consumption and brine discharge of three desalination configurations, namely freeze desalination (FD), multi-effect desalination (MED), and reverse osmosis (RO), are compared. The configurations encompass FD, MED-FD, and RO-MED-FD, with FD utilizing the brine from MED and RO desalination. The hybrid desalination system integrates with combined power and cooling CO<sub>2</sub> system (CPCS-CO<sub>2</sub>) for energy supply. This hybridization offers enhanced operational flexibility, increased desalination capacity, and reduced brine discharge. Optimal gas heater pressure exists for different temperatures and salt concentrations in saline water. The findings demonstrate a noteworthy 47% and 50% reduction in energy consumption and brine discharge, respectively, in RO-MED-FD compared to simple FD.</p>","author":"Maryam Salajeghe, \nMehran Ameri","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"c60c8d739233e5457af0aa2a6d97082d5149267747db28585de59de729e1f857","category":"Environment"}
