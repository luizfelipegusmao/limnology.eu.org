{"title":"Exploring the impact of OSA on short-term survival in patients with AECOPD admitted to the ICU","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301646","date":1712844000000,"content":"<p>by Liangfeng Liu, Yang Chen, Guanwen He, Bingbang Lin, Zhongshou Zhu, Rifu Wei, Yangbin Xu</p>\r\nBackground <p>Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is characterized by a sudden worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms, which significantly contributes to hospitalizations related to COPD symptoms. Previous research has mainly focused on the correlation between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and COPD. However, there were few studies that investigated the short-term mortality rate of AECOPD patients with or without OSA.</p> Methods <p>Data for our research was taken from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database IV. A total of 1332 patients were included in the study based on well-defined criteria for selection and exclusion. By analyzing the characteristics of AECOPD patients, we compared those with and without OSA.</p> Results <p>There were 1122 AECOPD patients without OSA, 210 patients with OSA. In comparison to those without OSA, patients with OSA exhibited lower 30-day and 90-day ICU mortality with unadjusted HR, as well as lower hospital mortality with unadjusted OR. However, after adjustments were made, there were no significant associations observed between OSA and short-term mortality, including 30-day ICU mortality, 90-day ICU mortality, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality in AECOPD patients. Subgroup analysis revealed that OSA may act as a risk factor for AECOPD patients with a BMI lower than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p> Conclusions <p>There is no impact on short-term survival in AECOPD patients with OSA under intensive care unit (ICU) management and nursing.</p>","author":"Liangfeng Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0005abb386278641aca58c43467f4cd4c8d217156ae561a965541fbeaba5c89a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
