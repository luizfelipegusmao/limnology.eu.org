The platform allows users to share photos, videos, and stories and connect with friends and followers. Instagram has become a significant part of youth culture, with many young people spending a considerable amount of time on the app. According to Enterprise (2012:02), Instagram is a community shared among one member with other members from all over the world. This study examines the impact of Instagram on the physical and mental well-being of Indian youth. With the rapid proliferation of social media platforms in India, Instagram has emerged as a prominent influence on the lives and perceptions of young individuals. Studies have shown that using Instagram among youth can have positive and negative effects.  On the positive side, Instagram can be a way for young people to express themselves, connect with others, and discover new interests. However, excessive use of the platform can also lead to negative outcomes, such as social comparison, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Instagram addiction among youth is a growing concern. Some young people may feel compelled to check their accounts frequently and may experience negative emotions if they are unable to do so. In extreme cases, excessive use of the platform can interfere with daily activities and relationships, leading to a negative impact on mental health. Parents and educators can play a role in helping young people manage their Instagram use. This can include setting limits on screen time, encouraging healthy online habits, and promoting offline activities and social interaction. Additionally, mental health professionals can offer support to young people who are struggling with addiction or other negative effects of Instagram use. This study explores the prevalence of Instagram dependency among Indian youth.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94f74a56cb9ab50f834072921aeaae07e00bdb2acc681e114ea2eb6c6f961343","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
