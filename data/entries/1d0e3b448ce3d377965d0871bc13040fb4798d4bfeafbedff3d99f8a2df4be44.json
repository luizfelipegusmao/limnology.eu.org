{"title":"The Intersection of Child&rsquo;s Demographics, and Household Socioeconomic Status in the Multimorbidity of Malaria, Anaemia, and Malnutrition among Children 6&ndash;59 Months of Age in Nigeria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1309/v1","date":1713507133000,"content":"Background/Purpose: Multimorbidity of malaria, anaemia, and malnutrition (MAMM) is a condition in which an individual cohabits with two or more of these health outcomes and is becoming an emergent public health concern in sub-Saharan African countries. The independent associations of a child’s demographic variables and socioeconomic disparities with a child’s health outcomes have been established in literature. However, the effects of the intersection of these factors on MAMM, while accounting for other covariates have not been studied. Therefore, this study aimed to determine how children’s sex, age and socioeconomic status interact to explain the variations in MAMM among children aged 6-59 months in Nigeria. Methods: Data from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey and the 2018 National Human Development Report (NHDR) were used. The study includes weighted samples of 10,184 children aged 6-59 months in Nigeria. A three-level multilevel mixed effect ordinal logistic regression model such that individual characteristics at level 1 are nested in communities at level 2 and nested in states at level 3 was used. Subsequently, predictive probability charts and average adjusted probability tables were used to interpret the intersectional effects. Five models were created in this scenario. Model 1 is the interaction between the child's sex and wealth status; model 2, child's sex and age; model 3 is between child's age and wealth status; model 4 has the three 2-way interactions of child's sex, age, and household wealth status, and model 5 includes model 4 and the 3-way interactions between a child's sex, age, and wealth quintiles. Results: The prevalence of children with ‘none of the three diseases’ outcomes was 17.3% (1767/10,184), while, 34.4% (3499/10,184) had ‘only one of the diseases’, and 48.3% (4,918/10,184) cohabit with ‘two or more’ of MAMM. However, in the multivariate analyses, model 3 was the best fit compared with other models, so, that the two-way interaction effects of a child's age and wealth status are significant predictors in the model. Children aged 36-47 months living in the poorest households have the probability of 0.11, 0.18, and 0.32 of contracting MAMM above the probability of children of the same age and live in the middle, more prosperous and richest households, respectively, while all other covariates are held constant. Thus, the variation in MAMM over a child's age differs depending on the household wealth quintile. In other words, as the children grow older, variations in MAMM become more evident between the rich and the poor household. Conclusion: Therefore, it is recommended that policies that are geared toward economic redistribution will help bridged the disparities observed in multiple diseases among children aged 6-59 months in Nigeria","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d0e3b448ce3d377965d0871bc13040fb4798d4bfeafbedff3d99f8a2df4be44","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
