{"title":"Give-and-take of gustation: the interplay between gustatory neurons and taste buds","link":"https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjae029/7724124?rss=1","date":1722297600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Mammalian taste buds are highly regenerative and can restore themselves after normal wear and tear of the lingual epithelium or following physical and chemical insults, including burns, chemotherapy, and nerve injury. This is due to the continual proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of taste progenitor cells, which then must reconnect with peripheral gustatory neurons to relay taste signals to the brain. The turnover and re-establishment of peripheral taste synapses are vital to maintain this complex sensory system. Over the past several decades, the signal transduction and neurotransmitter release mechanisms within taste cells have been well delineated. However, the complex dynamics between synaptic partners in the tongue (taste cell and gustatory neuron) are only partially understood. In this review, we highlight recent findings that have improved our understanding of the mechanisms governing connectivity and signaling within the taste bud and the still-unresolved questions regarding the complex interactions between taste cells and gustatory neurons.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"31fed8c684f1ad596b8e39ecb56fd73881b1949bd9f5bc755e40d692d772ad30","category":"Environment"}
