{"title":"Infection-Simulator, Immunostimulatory and Immunomodulatory Effects of Interferons I and III in Biological Systems: A New Era in Vaccinology and Therapeutics Possible?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202212.0155/v6","date":1720597709000,"content":"The severe acquired respiratory coronavirus–2 (SARS–CoV-2) infection has initiated both acute and chronic COVID–19 disease between 2020 and 2023, currently evolving with other homologous prior coronavirus strains of the Nidoviridae order, which encompasses other prevalent alpha/ beta coronaviruses, but also the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-1, with recent SARS–CoV–2 variants, increasing demands for effective immunogens and therapeutic approaches that will reduce global disease burden and further infection from SARS–CoV-2 affected individuals that may experience post acute sequelae (PASC) or “Long COVID”. Following a worldwide programme of prophylactic vaccination, there is still a dilemma in the efforts to find prophylactic and early therapeutic approaches that would treat novel SARS-CoV-2 variants and prevent future epidemics or pandemics within host human and animal populations, where zoonotic or cross species transfer naturally occurs. Concerns about viral immune escape intersect at a specific point; a gained evolutionary ability of several viruses to co–infect and compete against previous scientific advances since 1796 that remain undetected or asymptomatic during the early stages of infection progressing to symptomatic and severe disease via the double methylation of the 5' end of eukaryotic DNA or RNA-based viral genomes, the 7-MeGpppA2’-O-Me cap, and its double methylation capping process is performed by the activated viral 2’ - O - Methyltransferase (MTase) enzyme, a complex of two viral non-structural proteins (NSPs) joined together through an activation process (NSP10/16) and by N7-Methyltransferase (N7-MTase/NSP14), respectively. Moreover, it was discovered that polymorphic viruses translate NSP1, which prevents the activation of various Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), and consequently, detection of Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) and Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) alike. NSP1 also silences important interferon-encoding genes (INGs) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), is signalled in a paracrine manner to neighbouring cells, and that induces the apoptosis of host cells, inducing an effect of “trace erase” effect and making the viral infection as immunologically “invisible” as possible during the initial, key stages of viral replication and distribution, all such mechanisms occurring independently of the viruses in cause. Another important viral NSP is NSP14, as it plays two functional roles that are independent of each other; to produce new viral genetic material for the purpose of maintaining the validity of the viral genome as well, and not just transfer a methyl group to the 5’ end of the viral genome. Other viral NSPs share a role with NSP1, 10, 14 and 16 in directly suppressing the activation of PRRs and ISGs, and all such viral proteins help the virus in its process of self-camouflaging against first- and second-line immunity, thereby often severely impacting the quality of the produced adaptive immune responses. The outcome of all such phenomena is the sharp decrease in the host Type I and Type III interferons' (IFNs) rate of synthesis by the host cells, that would usually occur and affect homeostatic cellular pathways, resulting in further viral replication and induced apoptosis. Nonetheless, effects of microbial immune evasion during the development of other viral or carcinogenic pathologies are not widely known. In short, polymorphic viruses developed a proportionate evolutionary response against developed adaptive immune responses, by currently relying on gaps mostly situated in the natural immune system in their process of molecular self-camouflaging. Scientists developed numerous approaches of early treatment that generally showed good success rates and fewer risks of adverse events, and the still early present stages of COVID-19 research should also be taken into consideration whilst filtering for the most appropriate solutions. For example, the administration of recombinant human interferons I and III into the nasal mucosa cellular layer, as key mediators of anti–viral activity, can simulate intracellular infection and stimulate cellular activity in a timely manner, training the innate and adaptive immune system cells to develop and appropriately stimulate an adequate immune response through B and T cells. Another example could involve the treatment of natural and adaptive lymphocytes with a low dose of IFNs I and possibly III, prior to their insertion into the host lymphatic system, possibly alongside additional recruitment of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) as further interferon “factories”, all with the purpose of early infection management. It might be that focusing on directly offering the immune system the information about the genetics and protein structure of the pathogen, rather than training its first-line mechanisms to develop faster, excessively increases its specificity, making it reach a level that brings the virus the opportunity to evolve and escape previously-developed host immune mechanisms. It is until the scientific community realises this potentially crucial aspect that large proportions of the world population will probably continue to face serious epidemics and pandemics of respiratory diseases over the coming several decades, evidenced with dengue fever and more recently, monkeypox and possibly avian flu. Of note, it has been indicated that IFN I and / or III display significant immunising, early therapeutic and clinical disease onset-attenuating effects for many other microbial evoked diseases, as well as for a number of oncological diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"974828d17fe71541cba052e0bf3d747060d9d6cf049e7a4e5466433786afaa78","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
