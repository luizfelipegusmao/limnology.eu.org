{"title":"Size Effects in Polycarbonate and TPU 3D-Printed via Fused Filament Fabrication","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1649/v1","date":1714036539000,"content":"This paper investigates the influence of sample size and layer height on the elastic modulus of samples 3D printed by fused filament fabrication (FFF). Cubic samples of different sizes from either a stiff thermoplastic polymer (polycarbonate (PC)) or a soft polymer (thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)) were printed at three different layer heights: 0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, and 0.4 mm. The samples were imaged using micro-computed tomography to visualize porosity and tested under compression. The results indicate that the elastic modulus of TPU varied with sample size, demonstrating size effects due to high porosity. In contrast, PC samples had a low void volume fraction and did not demonstrate statistically significant size effects on the elastic modulus. The variations in elastic modulus due to layer height were statistically significant for both materials. The highest elastic modulus was observed at 0.2 mm layer height for both materials across different sample sizes, which can be attributed to low void volume fractions. The study develops process-structure-property relations for PC and TPU samples manufactured by FFF. It provides new insights into the design guidelines for FFF based on the size effects. The results indicate that variations in mechanical properties due to size effects must be considered during the design stage for TPU to accurately predict the materialâ€™s behavior. Additionally, the locations of the printed parts that are subjected to higher loads should be printed closer to the heated print bed due to the lower void volume fraction observed in the section of the samples printed adjacent to the heated print bed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"370b5d6ad75f222f756833d3057c9f401931f585d4ec970279305840dcc8fc8f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
