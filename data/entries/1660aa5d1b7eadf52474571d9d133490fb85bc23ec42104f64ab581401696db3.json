{"title":"Evaluating the Role of Telemonitoring in Detecting COPD Ex-acerbations: Results from a Multinational Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1977/v1","date":1724776743000,"content":"Purpose: This study was designed to investigate the ability of telemonitoring involving a secure elec-tronic database called “Alsayed System for Applied Medical-Care Improvement” (ASAMI) to detect at least 95% of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Methods: This prospective observational study, which took place over 16 months in 2022-2023, was based at a medi-cal center in Jordan. The study group participants were patients with COPD (from seven countries) with mixed levels of airflow limitation severity, and every participant was followed for six months. A customized, password-protected version of ASAMI was used to collect data during the study. The implemented diary included questions on daily symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, sputum, and daily physical activities. The detection of AECOPD events was initially based on daily questionnaires com-pleted by patients, followed by the assessment of a healthcare practitioner. Results: 87 participants were monitored for AECOPD. During the study, 78/87 (89.7%) patients presented with one or more exacerbation episodes. The mean (range) age was 59.7 (45-81) years, predominantly male (66%), with moderate airflow limitation (n=42, 48%). Compliance with the provision of daily symptom data was very high, 98% over the entire study period. A total of 189 confirmed AECOPD episodes were reported. Almost all patients and practitioners showed favorable satisfaction with the role of the ASAMI-related service (96% reported a score of 10 satisfaction). The telemonitoring tool was able to detect 99% of AECOPD episodes. Conclusion: The novel ASAMI software was effective as a telemonitoring tool to detect the episodes of AECOPD. The tool was suggested for daily, continuous reporting of respiratory symptoms, with the key benefits being ease of use, patient acceptance, and collation of supplementary data when exacerbations occur. The effects of its widespread use on decision-making can be clarified by evaluating its impact on routine clinical decision-making.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1660aa5d1b7eadf52474571d9d133490fb85bc23ec42104f64ab581401696db3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
