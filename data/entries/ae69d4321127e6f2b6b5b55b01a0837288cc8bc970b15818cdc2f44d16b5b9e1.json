{"title":"Effects of different slaughtering methods on the energy metabolism, apoptosis process and quality of grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus) during cold storage at 4 °C","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13862?af=R","date":1726057218000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The aquatic processing industry is increasingly aware of the need to ensure that slaughtering is carried out under high welfare standards, so there is a need to explore the impact of slaughter methods on fish fillets. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different slaughtering methods (M<sub>1</sub>, lethality by hammering; M<sub>2</sub>, gas mixture causing death; M<sub>3</sub>, lethality by clove oil anesthesia + ice slurry; M<sub>4</sub>, lethality by ice slurry; M<sub>5</sub>, lethality by gradient cooling) on the energy metabolism, apoptosis and flesh mass in grouper (<i>Epinephelus fuscoguttatus</i>).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Therefore, 120 fish (24 per treatment) were slaughtered by the five methods. The results showed that the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme activity of M<sub>5</sub> sample was higher. The serum glucose level of M<sub>2</sub> samples and DAPI staining fluorescence of M<sub>2</sub> samples were the highest, indicating that the stress response of M<sub>2</sub> was strong. In addition, the texture, pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and <i>K</i> value results showed M<sub>5</sub> samples had better flesh quality.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Gradient cooling lethality had the least effect on oxidative damage and apoptosis in grouper during cold storage as the gradient cooling lethality had the least effect on antioxidant enzyme activities. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xin Zhao, \nZhilong Xu, \nYu Liu, \nJun Mei, \nJing Xie","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"ae69d4321127e6f2b6b5b55b01a0837288cc8bc970b15818cdc2f44d16b5b9e1","category":"Environment"}
