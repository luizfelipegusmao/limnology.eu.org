{"title":"159 Concentrations of energy in pistachio shell powder fed to gestating sows and lactating sows","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/90/7664701?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Two experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of gross energy (GE), digestible energy (DE), and metabolizable energy (ME) in pistachio shell powder are not different from those in soybean hulls when fed to gestating sows. The second hypothesis was that the ATTD of GE and DE in pistachio shell powder are not different from those in soybean hulls when fed to lactating sows. In Exp. 1, gestating sows (n = 24) were housed in metabolism crates and were fed a corn-based control diet or two diets that included corn and 20% pistachio shell powder or 20% soybean hulls. Sows were fed the experimental diets for 13 d with feces and urine being quantitatively collected for 4 d, after a 6 d of adaptation. Concentrations of DE and ME were calculated. In Exp. 2, lactating sows (n = 24) were housed in farrowing crates and fed a diet based on corn and soybean meal (SBM) or two diets that contained corn, SBM and 20% of either pistachio shell powder or soybean hulls. All diets contained corn and SBM at a ratio of 2.87:1.00 and 0.40% TiO<sub>2</sub> as the digestibility marker. Lactating sows were allowed ad libitum access to the experimental diets and feces were collected for 6 d after a 7 d of adaptation to the diets. The DE in each diet and in pistachio shell powder and soybean hulls was calculated. Each experiment was conducted as a randomized complete block design and each experiment used two blocks of 12 sows, with 4 sows per diet in each block. The statistical model in both experiments included diet or ingredient as the fixed effect and block and replicate within block as the random effects. Results from Exp. 1 indicated that the ATTD of GE and DE and ME on an as-fed basis as well as on a dry matter basis were less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) in pistachio shell powder compared with corn and soybean hulls and DE and ME in soybean hulls were less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) than in corn (Table 1). Results from Exp. 2 indicated that the ATTD of GE and DE in pistachio shell powder were less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) than in soybean hulls. In conclusion, pistachio shell powder has a high concentration of fiber and energy digestibility and concentrations of energy in pistachio shell powder were, therefore, less than in soybean hulls when fed to gestating or lactating sows, but gestating sows appear to be better at digesting pistachio shell powder than lactating sows. This is likely due to the restricted feed intake of gestating sows that allows more time for nutrient and energy digestion and absorption in the intestinal tract compared with lactating sows.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"ce1275b79971f35f166e39c9b567c328a89c72c042e7f7dbdfbb9b74b84bd6c5","category":"Environment"}
