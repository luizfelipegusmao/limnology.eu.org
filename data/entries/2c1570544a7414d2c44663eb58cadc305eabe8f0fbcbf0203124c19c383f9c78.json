Nonetheless, the advent of fault-tolerant operation has been constrained by insufficient lifetime T<sub>1</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.766-B1\">1</a>]. The structural and chemical defects at the interfaces and surfaces of SQC, arising from the established semiconductor fabrication techniques, such as thin film deposition and lithography, negatively affect device coherence [<a href=\"#ozae044.766-B2\">2</a>]. Therefore, it is essential to understand the micro and chemical structural features at the atomic scale that may act as sources of decoherence factors in both superconducting qubits and coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators, which are key components of SQC.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2c1570544a7414d2c44663eb58cadc305eabe8f0fbcbf0203124c19c383f9c78","category":"Environment"}
