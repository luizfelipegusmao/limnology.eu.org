{"title":"24-Hour Glucose Profiles and Glycemic Variability during Intermittent Religious Dry Fasting and Time-Restricted Eating in Subjects without Diabetes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0303/v1","date":1719993232000,"content":"Intermittent religious fasting increases a risk of hypo- and hyperglycemia in individuals with diabetes, but its impact in those without diabetes is poorly investigated. The study aim was to examine the effects of religious Bahá'í fasting (BF) on glycemic control and variability and compare these effects with time-restricted eating (TRE). In a three-arm randomized controlled trial, 16 subjects without diabetes were assigned to a BF, 16:8 TRE or control group. Continuous glucose monitoring and food intake documentation was conducted before and during the 19 days of intervention, and 24-hour mean glucose, glycemic variability indices, and glucotypes were assessed. BF and TRE groups, but not the control group, markedly reduced the daily eating window while maintaining macronutrient composition. Only the BF group decreased caloric intake (-677.8 ± 357.6 kcal, p=0.013), body weight (-1.92 ± 0.95 kg, p=0.011) and BMI (-0.65 ± 0.28 kg, p=0.006). Higher maximum glucose values were observed during BF in the within-group (+1.41 ± 1.04, p=0.039) and between-group comparison (BF vs. Control: p= 0.010 and TRE vs. BF: p= 0.022). However, there were no alterations of 24-hour mean glucose, intra- and inter-day glycemic variability indices, or glucotypes in any group. Proportions of time above and below range (70-180mg/dl) and HbA1c values remained unchanged. BF and TRE do not exhibit negative effects on glycemic control and variability in subjects without diabetes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"afd5618e76491fcbca7223d33920dae2eec388a8480cdbadf903b1786b305bf8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
