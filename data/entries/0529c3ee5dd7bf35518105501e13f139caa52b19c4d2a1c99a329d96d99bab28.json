{"title":"Boosting agricultural green development: Does socialized service matter?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306055","date":1719237600000,"content":"<p>by Yongqi Yu, Zexin Chi, Yanfeng Yu, Junjie Zhao, Liulin Peng</p>\r\n\r\nAgricultural socialized service is gradually emerging as a new stimulus for enhancing the agricultural production environment. However, their precise impact on improving the agricultural ecological environment and promoting the green development of agriculture remains incompletely understood. Therefore, leveraging panel data spanning from 2003 to 2020 across 31 provinces in China, this study utilizes the bidirectional fixed effect model, moderating effect model, and spatial Durbin model to systematically assess the influence of agricultural socialized services on agricultural green development and its spatial ramifications. The findings show that (I) agricultural socialized services significantly contribute to promoting agricultural green development, particularly in regions with lower aging demographics. (II) The application of the spatial Durbin model reveals that this promotional effect does not exhibit significant spatial spillover effect. (III) The role of agricultural socialized services in fostering agricultural green development can be significantly enhanced by advancements in land transfer, agricultural technological innovations, and the improvement of rural human capital. In conclusion, the study provides a set of policy recommendations that include government financial support, facilitating land transfer, improving rural education and technical training, and promoting green production technologies to effectively promote agricultural green development.","author":"Yongqi Yu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0529c3ee5dd7bf35518105501e13f139caa52b19c4d2a1c99a329d96d99bab28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
