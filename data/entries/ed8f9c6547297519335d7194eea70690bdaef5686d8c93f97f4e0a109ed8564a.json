We conducted presence/absence surveys in the South West of England using footprint tunnels, and show dormice frequently use understudied hedge and scrub habitats. We identify a number of characteristics for each habitat that were associated with more frequent dormouse presence. Greater understanding of how dormice use alternative habitats offers more opportunities for restoration at a landscape scale.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\n\nHabitat restoration at a landscape scale is key to reversing the loss of biodiversity arising from habitat destruction. In landscapes that are intensively used by people, such as for agriculture, valuable restoration efforts might be applied not just to ‘prime’ habitats that are known to have strong associations with target species, but also to ‘sub-prime’ habitats that might nevertheless provide sufficient resources to support populations.\n\nHazel dormouse (<i>Muscardinus avellanarius</i>) populations are in chronic decline in the UK. The species is typically associated with broadleaf woodland but restoration of this habitat at scale in agricultural landscapes is difficult. Other habitats used by dormice might, therefore, provide opportunities for restoration. We investigated the use by hazel dormice of hedgerow and scrub habitats in southwest England. From June–November 2022, using footprint-recording tunnels, we surveyed 38 hedges and 21 scrub patches in the vicinity of 18 sites known to contain established dormouse populations.\n\nWe found that dormice were frequently present in scrub (9.3 detections per 100 tunnel checks, 95% confidence interval 6.6–12.0) and less frequently in hedges (4.5 detections, 95% CI 3.2–5.8).\n\nIn scrub patches, dormice were present more frequently as the abundance of dormice in the closest population increased, and less frequently where bracken (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>) was dominant.\n\nIn hedges, dormice were detected more frequently where there was abundant hazel (<i>Corylus avellana</i>) and honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera periclymenum</i>), as frequency of intersections with other hedges increased, and where an earthen bank was not present.\n\nUnderstanding hazel dormouse association with a wide range of habitats, particularly scrub, offers more opportunities for habitat restoration as part of species conservation strategies.\n</p>","author":"Eleanor R.
