{"title":"Influence of river channel typology on aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages in tropical streams","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05419-9","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>River typology is determined by a set of hydrological and geomorphological characteristics, which can determine the structure of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities throughout a watershed. In this study we aim to address the gap of knowledge in the classification of the typology of Neotropical rivers and determine their association with macroinvertebrate assemblages. In total, 138 sites from 107 rivers were sampled in Costa Rica, between years 2015 and 2020. Rivers were classified into V, Tr and U typologies based on the shape of the riverbed, substrates, current velocity and contact with riparian forest. The affinity of aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa to each typology was determined. The results confirmed a clear separation of the aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages between the typologies, and we observed that some genera showed affinity to a specific typology: <em>Macrobrachium</em> and <em>Caenis</em> are related to U-type; <em>Simulium</em> and <em>Anacroneuria</em> to V-type, while <em>Americabaetis</em> and <em>Thraulodes</em> to Tr-type. This separation was related to in-stream habitat supply and substrate characteristics, yet there was an overlap of shared taxa between the V and Tr-type, and between the Tr and U-type. Our study linked 238 taxa to three river typologies, highlighting the importance of river hydrogeomorphology as a robust factor structuring the macroinvertebrate assemblages in tropical streams. River channel typology should be considered a relevant explanatory variable when studying macroinvertebrate responses, not only within ecological studies, but also for biomonitoring and risk assessment related to land use changes, pollution, or watershed management.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"4091c2dbb5977cfc68fa7590eb7cd98895e4031b3f8372f2fd33aabbdeafd66e","category":"Environment"}
