As there are very low genetic divergences and no morphological differences between the Australian and Japanese materials referable to <span>N. serrata</span> and <span>N. hamadai</span>, these two names are now confirmed to be synonyms.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Crustacean Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"8ca07ea220dbc7082c62912ab6b47a7a5a309f6e19a7257844b27bf0267b5f04","entryHash":"9c44ee43ae180d7cc8369ad1b22938d837f86ec98ee96fe9f891bf41919db590","category":"Environment"}
