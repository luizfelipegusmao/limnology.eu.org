This paper critically reviews the concept of green marketing from environmental, consumer, corporate, and regulatory perspectives, highlighting both its opportunities and challenges. From the environmental standpoint, green marketing aims to mitigate the negative impacts of industrial activities by promoting products that are less harmful to the environment. On the consumer side, increasing environmental awareness drives demand for sustainable products, though challenges such as greenwashing often undermine consumer trust. Corporately, green marketing offers opportunities for enhancing brand image and competitiveness, though balancing profitability and sustainability goals remains a challenge for businesses. Regulatory frameworks play a crucial role in shaping green marketing practices, ensuring transparency and accountability, and preventing deceptive practices like greenwashing. The paper also discusses emerging trends such as digital transparency, the role of social media in green marketing, and the incorporation of circular economy principles into corporate strategies. The review concludes with recommendations for businesses to enhance their green marketing efforts, emphasizing the need for transparency, stakeholder collaboration, and interdisciplinary approaches to address complex sustainability challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"377706b4da74ee5f7fe1ed2581cd48c4c21e1e1ed2b68d26c0229ce57a704a5b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
