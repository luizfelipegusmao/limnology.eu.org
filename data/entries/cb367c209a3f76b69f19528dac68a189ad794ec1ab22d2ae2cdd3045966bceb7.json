{"title":"Practical Considerations of Remote Care in Thoracic Aortopathy in India","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2003/v1","date":1714471478000,"content":"Thoracic aortopathy encompasses a spectrum of conditions affecting the aorta, ranging from aneurysms to dissections, posing significant challenges in management and care. In recent years, remote care, facilitated by telemedicine and digital health technologies, has emerged as a promising approach to overcome barriers in delivering timely and efficient healthcare services. This paper explores the practical considerations and challenges associated with implementing remote care strategies in the management of thoracic aortopathy in India with the largest population in the world. By evaluating existing literature and drawing upon clinical experiences, we discuss the potential benefits, limitations, and best practices for incorporating remote care into the management of patients with thoracic aortopathy. Additionally, we address important factors such as patient engagement, technology integration, privacy concerns, and regulatory requirements to optimize the delivery of remote care in this specialized field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cb367c209a3f76b69f19528dac68a189ad794ec1ab22d2ae2cdd3045966bceb7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
