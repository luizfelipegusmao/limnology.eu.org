{"title":"AINTEGUMENTA and redundant AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE6 are required for bract outgrowth in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/13/3920/7636947?rss=1","date":1711584000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants consist of fundamental units of growth called phytomers (leaf or bract, axillary bud, node, and internode), which are repeated and modified throughout shoot development to give plants plasticity for survival and adaptation. One phytomer modification is the suppression or outgrowth of bracts, the leaves subtending the flowers. The floral meristem identity regulator <span>LEAFY</span> (<span>LFY</span>) and the organ boundary genes <span>BLADE-ON-PETIOLE1</span> (<span>BOP1</span>) and <span>BOP2</span> have been shown to suppress bract development in Arabidopsis, as mutations in these genes result in bract outgrowth. However, much less is known about the mechanisms that promote bract outgrowth in Arabidopsis mutants such as these. Further understanding of this mechanism may provide a potential tool for modifying leaf development. Here, we showed that the MADS-box genes <span>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1</span> (<span>SOC1</span>), <span>FRUITFUL</span> (<span>FUL</span>), and <span>AGAMOUS-LIKE24</span> (<span>AGL24</span>) play more important roles than <span>BOP1/2</span> and <span>LFY</span> in bract suppression, and that <span>AINTEGUMENTA</span> (<span>ANT</span>) and the partially redundant <span>AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE6</span> (<span>AIL6</span>) are necessary for bract outgrowth in these mutant backgrounds. We also demonstrated that misexpression of <span>AIL6</span> alone is sufficient for bract outgrowth. Our data reveal a mechanism for bract suppression and outgrowth and provide insight into phytomer plasticity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"0cbf6325140cff477b000a6f387db1bc4cee5fe6a7e5750c26e876a517e9e36b","category":"Environment"}
