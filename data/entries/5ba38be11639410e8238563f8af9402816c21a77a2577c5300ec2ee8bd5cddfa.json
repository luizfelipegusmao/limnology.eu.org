The introduction of new cryo-EM grids, such as graphene grids [<a href=\"#ozae044.462-B1\">1</a>], shows great promise for enhancing sample quality and resolution. Recent publications have highlighted the advantages of graphene grids in various applications, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize cryo-EM techniques. Moreover, graphene grids are becoming more commercially available in many countries and regions. Our newly established LLC, <a href=\"GrapheneGrids.com\">GrapheneGrids.com</a>, is now offering high-yield graphene grids to the cryo-EM community at an efficient cost, specifically catering to labs in North America. While introducing graphene cryo-EM grids hold potential for improving sample quality, a comprehensive guide detailing grid types, graphene transfer compatibility, and potential transfer issues and solutions is currently unavailable.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5ba38be11639410e8238563f8af9402816c21a77a2577c5300ec2ee8bd5cddfa","category":"Environment"}
