{"title":"Taurine Neuroprotection and Neurogenesis Effect in Chronic Ethanol Induced Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1879/v1","date":1714379654000,"content":"The ingestion of ethanol presents a significant global public health challenge. Chronic alcohol consumption is associated with the development of conditions such as cancer, cirrhosis, hepatic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes, as well as neurological impairments that may predispose individuals to dementia, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders such as violence and suicide. Alcohol-related fatalities constitute 5.3% of worldwide deaths annually, totaling approximately 3 million. Notably, alcohol consumption is implicated in 25% of cirrhosis-related deaths and 4.1% of cancer-related deaths. Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is a non-protein Î²-amino acid essential for cellular homeostasis, possessing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective properties crucial for life maintenance. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of taurine administration on hippocampal neurogenesis, neuronal preservation or reverse damage in rats exposed to forced ethanol consumption. Results demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of taurine on ethanol-treated rats, promoting tissue regeneration and suggesting its pivotal role in this process. However, this aminoacid failed to induce neurogenesis in the tissues of healthy rats, implying that its activity may be contingent upon post-injury stimuli.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f2b236abef3cfbd2e0c284ad576d2498c9270664642ea8c564ea8a16b0a90bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
