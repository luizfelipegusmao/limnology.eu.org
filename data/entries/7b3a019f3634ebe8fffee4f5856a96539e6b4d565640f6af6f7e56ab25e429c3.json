The use of deep learning (DL) models enables the extraction of atomic-level features from image data, seamlessly integrating them into simulation environments. Nevertheless, there are challenges in orchestrating an autonomous instrument-computing ecosystem, addressing issues related to deployment infrastructure and the exploration of novel physics. This process also requires refining parameters in both the experimental and theoretical realms, establishing a continuous feedback loop. Key challenges include addressing instrument specificity, managing implementation complexity, and handling information transferability, particularly considering the fundamentally different latencies [<a href=\"#ozae044.162-B1\">1-5</a>] of imaging and simulations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7b3a019f3634ebe8fffee4f5856a96539e6b4d565640f6af6f7e56ab25e429c3","category":"Environment"}
