{"title":"PSIII-27 Blood biochemistry, histology, and metabolomic profiling of contaminated with mycotoxin: A repeated dose oral toxicity study in rats","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/460/7757707?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Mycotoxins causes diseases and physiological responses in humans and livestock. This study was performed to estimate the effects of binary mixtures mycotoxin {e.g., deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisin (FB)] on blood biochemistry, histology, and metabolic profiles in rats fed with different toxin concentrations. Experimental animals were administered by oral gavage with 0.9% saline, DON (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg BW), FB (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg) at 8 wk of age. Histological changes, metabolomic profiling, and blood biochemical analysis were performed Massonâ€™s trichrome stain kit, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, and VetTest chemistry analyzer, respectively. The final BW of the rats contaminated with mixtures mycotoxin significantly decreased compared with the control group. Biochemistry results and fibrosis were also significantly differentially regulated according to mycotoxin concentrations. Additionally, we observed collagen fibers in the liver and kidney showed blue staining after toxin contamination. For metabolomic profiling, data were analyzed using MetaboAnalyst 4.0. Results were analyzed by multivariate analysis to elucidate the potential compounds. The toxin-treated groups observed discriminating metabolites in the liver and kidney tissue but no differences in ileum. The profiling revealed potential metabolites such as glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. Phosphatidylethanolamine and tryptophan were identified with high sensitivity as candidate biomarkers via variable importance in the projection plot in piglets fed with mycotoxin (FDR &lt; 0.05; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). The differently treated groups showed discriminating metabolites in different concentrations. In conclusion, these findings suggest that mycotoxin exposure disturbs histological changes and metabolites. Dietary toxins in rats may better understand the physiological effects consistent with metabolism, which are commonly reported in animals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"b9793d072cbbf734d8370e1516f155264ee7b1eb6db9b6476dbd67e4f818b5ad","category":"Environment"}
