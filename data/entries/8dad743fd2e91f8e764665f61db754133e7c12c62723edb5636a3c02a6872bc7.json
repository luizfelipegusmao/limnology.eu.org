{"title":"ern: An R package to estimate the effective reproduction number using clinical and wastewater surveillance data","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305550","date":1718978400000,"content":"<p>by David Champredon, Irena Papst, Warsame Yusuf</p>\r\n\r\nThe effective reproduction number, R t, is an important epidemiological metric used to assess the state of an epidemic, as well as the effectiveness of public health interventions undertaken in response. When R t is above one, it indicates that new infections are increasing, and thus the epidemic is growing, while an R t is below one indicates that new infections are decreasing, and so the epidemic is under control. There are several established software packages that are readily available to statistically estimate R t using clinical surveillance data. However, there are comparatively few accessible tools for estimating R t from pathogen wastewater concentration, a surveillance data stream that cemented its utility during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present the R package ern that aims to perform the estimation of the effective reproduction number from real-world wastewater or aggregated clinical surveillance data in a user-friendly way.","author":"David Champredon","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8dad743fd2e91f8e764665f61db754133e7c12c62723edb5636a3c02a6872bc7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
