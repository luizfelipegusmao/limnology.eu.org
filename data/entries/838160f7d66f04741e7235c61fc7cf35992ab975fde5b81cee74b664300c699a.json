Abundant populations are causing conservation conflicts, as they may affect agricultural production and biodiversity negatively.\n\nManagement strategies involving provisioning of attractive diversionary fields where birds are tolerated can be used to reduce negative impact to growing crops. To improve such strategies, knowledge of how the birds interact with the landscape and respond to current management interventions is key.\n\nWe used GPS locations from tagged common cranes (<i>Grus grus</i>) and greylag geese (<i>Anser anser</i>) to assess how they use and select differentially managed habitats, such as diversionary fields to decrease impact on agriculture and wetlands protected for biodiversity conservation.\n\nOur findings show a high probability of presence of common cranes and greylag geese in the protected area and in the diversionary field, but also on arable fields, potentially causing negative impact on agricultural production and wetland biodiversity.\n\nWe outline recommendations for how to improve the practice of diversionary fields and complementary management to reduce risk of negative impact of large grazing birds in landscapes tailored for both conservation and conventional agriculture.\n</p>","author":"Lovisa Nilsson, \nJohan Månsson, \nJohan Elmberg, \nNiklas Liljebäck, \nIngunn Tombre","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecological Solutions and Evidence: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2d59a3492421ff8dc6c930252c6b4149e9691eaa8596381f5a50d8e1d8243fb4","entryHash":"838160f7d66f04741e7235c61fc7cf35992ab975fde5b81cee74b664300c699a","category":"Environment"}
