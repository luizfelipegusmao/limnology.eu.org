{"title":"Sub‐high amylose maize starch: an ideal substrate to generate starch with lower digestibility by fermentation of Qu","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13514?af=R","date":1713967091000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The fermentation of Qu (FQ) is a novel method to modify the properties of starch to expand its application and especially to increase the resistant starch (RS) content. Using waxy maize starch (WMS) as a fermentation substrate can increase the RS content significantly but it may be time consuming and not cost effective due to the almost negligible RS content of WMS. To solve this problem, we hypothesized that sub-high amylose starch (s-HAMS), with an amylose content close to 50% could be an ideal substrate for FQ.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that FQ did not change the shape and the particle size of starch granules, the gelatinization peak (<i>T</i>\n<sub>p</sub>), or the conclusion temperature (<i>T</i>\n<sub>c</sub>), but the slowly digested starch content declined. Rapidly digested starch content fluctuated during FQ and the amylose content decreased within 36 h and then increased. Within 24h, FQ significanlty increased these values: the RS content, relative crystallinity (RC), the ratio of FTIR absorbances at 1047/1022cm-1, the diffraction peak at 19.8° in X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the gelatinization onset temperature (<i>T</i>\n<sub>o</sub>) increased significantly, within 24 h of FQ. However, after 24 h of fermentation, the RS content, RC, the ratio of FTIR absorbances at 1047/1022 cm<sup>−1</sup>, and gelatinization enthalpy (<i>ΔH</i>) decreased significantly.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Sub-high amylose starch is more suitable for FQ to produce low digestibility starch, and the increase in RS may be due to the formation of ‘amylose-lipid’ complexes (RS5). © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Wenhao Wu, \nWenjing Tian, \nYiheng Li, \nQiqi Zhao, \nNa Liu, \nChenggang Huang, \nLiangjia Zhu, \nDongwei Guo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"757ea447d631d5030a8ad577f21720b798b536f72811f2a6bbc509023941f8f8","category":"Environment"}
