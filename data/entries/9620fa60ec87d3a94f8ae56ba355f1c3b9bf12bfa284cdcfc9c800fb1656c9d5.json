{"title":"Comparative nutrient drawdown capacities of farmed kelps and implications of metabolic strategy and nutrient source","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13442?af=R","date":1718080861000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Seaweed aquaculture, particularly kelp farming, is a popular topic as a potential solution for mitigating anthropogenic pollutants and enhancing coastal drawdown of carbon and nitrogen. Using a common garden approach, this study evaluated nutrient drawdown capacities of <i>Alaria marginata</i> (ribbon kelp) and <i>Saccharina latissima</i> (sugar kelp) across four commercial kelp farms in Southeast and Southcentral Alaska. Our findings show that <i>A. marginata</i> exhibited ~30% more carbon and 21% more nitrogen content compared to <i>S. latissima</i>. These results demonstrate the potential for <i>A. marginata</i> to serve as a more efficient species for nutrient drawdown into farmed kelp tissues (per unit biomass) for consideration of potential mitigative actions. The efficacy of this drawdown is likely to be driven by the careful pairing of kelp species with farming environment. Temporally, there was a noted increase in carbon content and a decline in nitrogen content from March to May for both species, consistent with known seasonal nutrient dynamics in coastal waters. Notably, differences in the carbon stable isotope signatures (δ<sup>13</sup>C) between the kelps may hint at variations in metabolic pathways and nutrient sourcing, particularly concerning the preferential assimilation of CO<sub>2</sub> versus HCO3−, and highlight the need for further work on this topic for applied macroalgal research.</p>","author":"Tiffany Stephens, \nSchery Umanzor","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"9620fa60ec87d3a94f8ae56ba355f1c3b9bf12bfa284cdcfc9c800fb1656c9d5","category":"Environment"}
