{"title":"Evaluation of Antenna Designs for Wearable Technology: A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0563/v1","date":1715238978000,"content":"Research into improving the functionality and capacities of wearable technology has surged as a result of its fast progress. The functioning of wearable technology is largely dependent on antenna design, which provides wireless connectivity and communication. This study of the literature searches many online sources for pertinent research on the various antenna designs for wearable technology. The findings verified that the materials vary based on the design being employed. An analysis was conducted on the gain, frequency, materials, and sizes. The review excels at synthesizing research and literature despite its restricted resources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c69dff3f86a73ee3acd7144a72f2664e4f05fc1fa7a0e7323dd2f631eb7d073","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
