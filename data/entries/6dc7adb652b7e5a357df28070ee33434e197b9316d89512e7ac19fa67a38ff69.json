{"title":"Amygdalin prevents <i>multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus</i>-induced lung epithelial cell injury by regulating inflammation and oxidative stress","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310253","date":1726495200000,"content":"<p>by Zhaolei Wang, Haixia Du, Haofang Wan, Jiehong Yang, Haitong Wan</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause severe bacterial pneumonia. Amygdalin is the main active pharmaceutical ingredient of bitter almond, which has broad-spectrum antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation and immunomodulatory effects. It is also the main ingredient of Yinhua Pinggan granule, which is commonly used to moisten the lung and relieve cough. However, little is known about the effects of amygdalin on MRSA. In this study, we found that amygdalin exhibited good antimicrobial activity in <i>vitro</i> against MRSA. Amygdalin has a protective effect on MRSA infected cells, and the effect is better when combined with levofloxacin. It also can reduce the adhesion and invasion of MRSA to cells. Amygdalin has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which can significantly reduce the increase of inflammatory factors and the production of ROS caused by infection. The protective mechanism of amygdalin on cells may be related to inhibiting the expression of NLRP3, ASC and IL-1Î² pyroptosis pathways. Taken together, our study suggests that amygdalin exerts antibacterial effects by affecting biofilm formation, the expression of virulence factors, and drug resistance genes. Amygdalin combined with levofloxacin has a protective effect on A549 cells infected with MRSA, and the mechanism may be related to the inhibition of inflammatory response, oxidative damage and pyroptosis.","author":"Zhaolei Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6dc7adb652b7e5a357df28070ee33434e197b9316d89512e7ac19fa67a38ff69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
