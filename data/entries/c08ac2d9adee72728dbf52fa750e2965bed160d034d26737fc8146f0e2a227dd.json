Vaccine hesitancy/resistance can undermine the beneficial impact of RSV vaccination. The aim of this study was to assess the willingness of pregnant women in Jordan to receive RSV vaccination and its associated determinants. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in obstetrics/gynecology clinics in Jordan during January-February 2024, with convenience sampling. Attitude to RSV vaccination was assessed using the previously validated ABCDEF scale. A total of 404 pregnant women participated in the study with a mean age of 30 years. A majority of the participants showed willingness to receive RSV vaccination (n=313, 77.5%), with hesitancy among 25 participants (6.2%), and resistance among 66 participants (16.3%). Variables that were signifi-cantly associated with a higher RSV vaccine acceptance in multivariate analysis were: age","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c08ac2d9adee72728dbf52fa750e2965bed160d034d26737fc8146f0e2a227dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
