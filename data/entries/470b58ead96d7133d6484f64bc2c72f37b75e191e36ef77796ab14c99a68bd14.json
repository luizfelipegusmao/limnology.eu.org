{"title":"CT Imaging Findings of Pulmonary Artery Stenosis: A Pictorial Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0278/v1","date":1719996024000,"content":"Pulmonary artery stenosis represents a group of disorders involving main, branch or peripheral pulmonary arteries resulting either in pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis or even no symptoms. Early diagnosis and timely intervention are crucial for reducing mortality, while timely diagnosis is challenging due to the nonspecific symptoms. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is useful in the diagnosis because it can provide more details about the abnormal changes in the lumen, vessel wall and adjacent mediastinal structures. Congenital and acquired pulmonary artery anomalies have some characteristics on CTPA, which can be useful for differential diagnosis. Awareness of these conditions and is important for the radiologists. This pictorial review provides an overview of CTPA imaging features of pulmonary artery stenosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"470b58ead96d7133d6484f64bc2c72f37b75e191e36ef77796ab14c99a68bd14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
