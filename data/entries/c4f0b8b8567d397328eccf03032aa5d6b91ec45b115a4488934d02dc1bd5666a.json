{"title":"Evaluation of Dairy Supply Chain Performance: A Fuzzy Inference System-Based Reliability Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0547/v1","date":1720182241000,"content":"The present study is to address performance of the dairy supply chain and emphasizes the significance of reliability of the chain as a fundamental and critical attribute for fulfilling the safety requirements. In order to evaluate the performance of the dairy supply chain, the present study utilizes the reliability attribute, which is an essential and informative system performance indicator. The study considers not only the inputs and outputs but also internal activities and relationships between customers, manufacturers, and suppliers. To minimize calculations and resolve uncertainties and vagueness that may be experienced in the performance evaluation process, this study proposes the use of the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) approach and evaluates the reliability at each level of the supply chain: supply, manufacturing, and distribution. Combining the reliability of different levels, the study finally calculates the reliability of the entire supply chain. The proposed methodology offers a practical approach for evaluating the reliability performance of a dairy supply chain and can be easily extended to other industries as well. To verify the proposed methodology, a real case in the Iranian dairy industry is chosen to be studied. Results indicate that the proposed methodology can effectively identify bottlenecks or weaknesses in the dairy supply chain and help develop effective strategies to address them. Analyzing factors influencing supply chain reliability can optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve the overall quality of dairy product quality delivered to consumers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4f0b8b8567d397328eccf03032aa5d6b91ec45b115a4488934d02dc1bd5666a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
