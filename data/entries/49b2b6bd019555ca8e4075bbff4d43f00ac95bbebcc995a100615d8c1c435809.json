{"title":"Enhanced Antibacterial Activity of Vancomycin Loaded on Functionalized Polyketones","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1370/v1","date":1718809420000,"content":"Today, polymeric Drug Delivery Systems (DDS) appear as an interesting solution against bacterial resistance, having great advantages such as low toxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. In this work, two polyketones (PK) have been post-functionalized with taurinate (PKT) or sulfanilate (PKSK) and employed as biocompatible carriers for Vancomycin against bacterial infections. Mod-ified PKs were easily prepared by Paal-Knorr reaction and loaded with Vancomycin at variable pH. All polymers were characterized by FT-IR, DSC, TGA, SEM and elemental analysis. Antimicrobial activity was tested against Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and correlated to the different pH used for its loading (between 2.3 and 8.8). Distinctively, minimum inhibitory con-centrations achieved with PKT and PKSK loaded with Vancomycin are similar, 0.23μg/mL and 0.24μg/mL respectively, i.e. six times lower that Vancomycin alone. The use of post-functionalized aliphatic polyketones has thus been demonstrated to be a promising way to obtain very efficient polymeric DDS.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49b2b6bd019555ca8e4075bbff4d43f00ac95bbebcc995a100615d8c1c435809","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
