{"title":"Peripheral Eosinophil Count May Be the Prognostic Factor for Overall Survival in PDAC Patients Undergoing Surgical Resection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2368/v1","date":1727679348000,"content":"(1) Background: Eosinophils importance as T2 inflammation markers is known to be fundamental in asthma, chronic sinusitis, vasculitis. In cancer, despite their potential antiproliferative effect, their role remains unclear. Our purpose was to describe the relation between baseline blood eosinophil count (EOS) and overall survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. (2) Methods: We have analyzed retrospectively the data of 137 adult patients, who underwent surgical treatment of PDAC between years 2012-2019 with no history of systemic steroid use directly before surgical treatment and no metastases found intraoperatively. (3) Results: EOS&amp;lt;0,1 G/l (vs. ≥0,1 G/l) was an independent prognostic factor for OS both the uni- and multivariate Cox regression (respectively: HR=1,48, p=0,035 and HR=1,57, p=0,021). According to EOS and PDAC stage, median OS were: in stage I-III, EOS ≥0,1 G/l group: 14,5 months, in stage I-III, EOS &amp;lt;0,1 G/l group: 8,0 months, in stage IV, EOS ≥0,1 G/l group: 7,0 months, in stage IV, EOS &amp;lt;0,1 G/l group: 5,0 months. (4) Conclusions: Peripheral eosinophilia seems to be a potential independent prognostic factor. Further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis, since our findings suggest that T2 inflammation may be the factor directly or indirectly lengthening survival of PDAC patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04f6db4f89bb6c2620926fc19311309ac0e27a29f0547b5a5a86c2cffd8ea8c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
