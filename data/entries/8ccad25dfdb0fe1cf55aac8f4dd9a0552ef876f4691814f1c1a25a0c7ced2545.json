Unlike single particle analysis, which requires collecting individual 2D projections of isolated particles, cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) can directly image complexes within intact cells or thin sections by collecting unique projection views at different tilt angles [<a href=\"#ozae044.346-B3\">3</a>]. Once aligned, the acquired tilt images can be used to reconstruct the 3D macromolecular organization. This preservation of cellular context provides valuable insights into the spatial organization and interactions of macromolecular assemblies within their native environment.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8ccad25dfdb0fe1cf55aac8f4dd9a0552ef876f4691814f1c1a25a0c7ced2545","category":"Environment"}
