{"title":"Discovery of A Novel Cyclopeptide as Tyrosinase Inhibitor for Skin Lightening","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1006/v1","date":1728985610000,"content":"Melanin content significantly influences the skin-lightening effects of active ingredients, with inhibition of melanin synthesis contributing to skin-lightening effects. This study evaluates the effects of novel cyclopeptide CHP-9 as a safe and potent human tyrosinase inhibitor. CHP-9 showed a significant inhibition rate of approximately 28.57% at 1% concentration. The melanin formation assay, upon exposure to CHP-9 alone, resulted in a reduction of cellular melanin content from 30.90±1.13 μg/mL to 23.51±1.14 μg/mL. Additionally, in silico molecular docking experiments were conducted to verify the tyrosinase inhibitory activity of the cyclopeptide CHP-9 on tyrosinase and it was observed that hydrogen bonding is pivotal in the binding affinity of CHP-9 with the target enzyme in docking. These results suggest that the cyclopeptide CHP-9 may serve as a valuable bioactive compound for skin-lightening agents in cosmetics applications, specifically in reducing melanin production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4bb08b1116350d942bd283c90923a802daec20030e85a48ca723fa44c82fa34a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
