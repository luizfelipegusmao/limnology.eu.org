This can then be used to recover the complex specimen object function using either iterative or non-iterative algorithms. Importantly, ptychography is an inherently dose efficient technique, enabling effective the reconstruction of the exit wavefunction of radiation sensitive objects.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0c63fc9868d5201fe4f9be4a47e9b2cbca12e29292e99f5cfa024336c842be41","category":"Environment"}
