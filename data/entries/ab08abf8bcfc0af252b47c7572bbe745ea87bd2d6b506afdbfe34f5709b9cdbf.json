{"title":"Dynamic Simulation of the Leaf Mass Per Area (LMA) in Multilayer Crowns of young Larix principis-rupprechtii","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1081/v1","date":1710838140000,"content":"Leaf mass per area (LMA) is a key structural parameter that reflects the functional traits of leaves and plays a vital role in simulating the material and energy cycle of plant ecosystems. In this study, vertical whorl-by-whorl sampling of LMA was conducted in a young Larix principis-rupprechtii plantation during the growing season at the Saihanba Forest Farm. The vertical and seasonal variations in LMA were analysed. Subsequently, a predictive model of LMA was constructed. The results revealed that the LMA varied significantly between different crown whorls and growing periods. In the vertical direction of the crown, the LMA decreased with increasing crown depth, but the range of LMA values from the tree top to the bottom was, on average, 30.4 g/m2, which was approximately 2.5 times greater in the fully expanded phase than in the early leaf-expanding phase. The LMA exhibited an allometric growth trend that increased during the leaf-expanding phase and then tended to stabilize. However, the range of LMA values throughout the growing period was, on average, 40.4 g/m2. Among the univariate models, the leaf dry matter content (LDMC) performed well (Ra2=0.45, RMSE=13.48 g/m2) in estimating the LMA. The correlation between LMA and LDMC significantly differed at different growth stages and at different vertical crown whorls. The dynamic predictive model of LMA constructed with the RDINC and DOY as independent variables was reliable in both the assessments (Ra2=0.68, RMSE=10.25 g/m2) and the validation (MAE=8.05 g/m2, FI=0.682). Dynamic simulations of crown LMA provide a basis for elucidating the mechanism of crown development and laying the foundation for the construction of an ecological process model..","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab08abf8bcfc0af252b47c7572bbe745ea87bd2d6b506afdbfe34f5709b9cdbf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
