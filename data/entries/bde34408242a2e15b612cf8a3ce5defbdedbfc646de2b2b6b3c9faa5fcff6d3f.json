{"title":"Comparison of Croup Management Patterns between Pediatricians and Emergency Medicine Physicians: A Single Pediatric Emergency Department Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2253/v1","date":1727448429000,"content":"Background/Objectives: This study aimed to compare croup management patterns between pediatricians and emergency medicine (EM) physicians to enhance pediatric emergency care and inform the training of future specialists. Methods: A retrospective review of medical records was conducted for 1,676 children diagnosed with croup who visited a single pediatric emergency department (PED) from March 2019 to February 2023. Patient characteristics, management patterns, and the impact of physician specialty on emergency care were analyzed. Results: EM physicians used injected dexamethasone monotherapy more frequently, whereas pediatricians favored combined use of nebulized epinephrine and dexamethasone. Pediatricians also prescribed oral antibiotics and corticosteroids at discharge more often. The appropriate use of nebulized epinephrine based on the Westley Croup Score was significantly higher in the EM physician group. Despite these differences, there were no significant disparities in PED length of stay or revisit rates within 48 hours. Conclusions: EM physicians adhered more closely to clinical guidelines for croup management. These findings underscore the need for standardized, evidence-based pediatric emergency care and provide valuable insights for training programs in this field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bde34408242a2e15b612cf8a3ce5defbdedbfc646de2b2b6b3c9faa5fcff6d3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
