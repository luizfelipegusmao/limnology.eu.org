{"title":"Leveling Up the Mission: HBCUs&rsquo; Potentials towards a Global U.S. Study Abroad","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1632/v1","date":1719209770000,"content":"The effort to expand the U.S. study abroad programs to have a global impact has never been fully expressed by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and study abroad administrators. Study Abroad since its inception has not been a truly global platform. This article constructively points out the existing potential of Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to make the U.S. study abroad a truly global program capable of defending U.S. national interest in this era of inter-dependence among nations, especially as the global knowledge economy and cultural competence advantage take center stage. Study abroad is at a crossroads at the moment, new ideas must be developed for study abroad to justify the true potential of education abroad. Over two decades, four countries in Western Europe have been hosting the highest number of U.S. students in study abroad. There is no evidence that this trend will reach the entire globe as a reciprocity of international students in U.S. colleges and universities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee01ed220b65fe03f83262f7f03bfc74a1350aa4e466dd6d88b271e11abe49e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
