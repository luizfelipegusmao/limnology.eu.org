{"title":"Optical Properties of Aluminum Oxide Compared with Asymptotic Giant Branch Environments from Amorphous to Crystalline Structures","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.245/7719933?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Although it is a minor component by mass, cosmic dust plays an outsized role in the universe, contributing to star and planet formation, stellar evolution, and molecule formation to name but a few [<a href=\"#ozae044.245-B1\">1-3</a>]. Optical response is the main mechanism to determine the chemical composition and crystal structure of this cosmic dust. However, many of the dust analogs studied in the laboratory uses materials that are generated in environments very unlike those in space, e.g. [<a href=\"#ozae044.245-B4\">4</a>]. Here we investigate materials created as smoke condensates in systems similar to those expected to generate dust in space to understand their initial structure and how they evolved with annealing. One of the major sources of cosmic dust is Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars [<a href=\"#ozae044.245-B5\">5</a>]. These stars have been well studied in infrared spectroscopy over the past several decades, but several spectral features remain mysterious or at least controversial. One of the important compounds expected to form around AGB stars in alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). Alumina is a major player in dust condensation mechanisms [<a href=\"#ozae044.245-B6\">6-9</a>]; and is found in presolar grains; meteoritic grains whose isotopic compositions indicate the stellar sources from which they originate [<a href=\"#ozae044.245-B10\">10</a>]. However, since Al is much less abundant than Fe, Si or Mg, alumina’s contribution is often overlooked, with the assumption being that its contribution is negligible. Understanding the optical response of Al-O compounds, and how these evolve with annealing is the key to fully understanding dust formation and evolution. The tetrahedron illustrated in figure 1 shows the multiple class of compounds in which oxygen is combined in different forms such as Mg-Al-O, Mg-Al-O-Si, Fe-Al-O, Mg-O-Si, Ca-Al-O, etc. Figure 1B shows the laboratory with sections of precursor used on vapor phase condensates to produce aluminum oxide compound smokes prepared at the Astrochemistry Branch at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"09abd81725d41e7ec69d0e75e19908bd265eb5f6209addc051cc83cf97b4f179","category":"Environment"}
