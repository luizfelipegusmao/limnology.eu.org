Understanding the level of awareness about CRC screening among the Syrian pop-ulation is crucial public health interventions. A cross-sectional study was conducted from Sep-tember 22, 2023, to October 15, 2023, involving 928 participants from six major governorates in Syria. An online questionnaire containing socio-demographic, knowledge, and attitude sections was used to collect data. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were employed for data analysis using (SPSS) v28.0. The survey revealed a lack of awareness regarding CRC screening among the Syrian population, with only 499(53%) of the proportion demonstrating adequate knowledge about the disease and its screening methods. Significant associations were observed between the level of knowledge and socio-demographic factors including gender, work status, and economic status (p &lt; 0.05). The findings emphasize the need for public health initiatives to enhance awareness and knowledge about CRC and its early screening methods in Syria. Education is essential for improving early detection and reducing the burden of colorectal cancer in the region. Efforts to increase public understanding of CRC screening are critical for reducing the incidence and mortality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b7d4ca6c250160da61ca62e35f17437432872c0fc6d800cff54e244778b5b979","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
