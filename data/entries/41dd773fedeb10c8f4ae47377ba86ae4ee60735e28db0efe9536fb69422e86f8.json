{"title":"Impact of source, packaging and presence of food safety management system on heavy metals levels in spices and herbs","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307884","date":1724421600000,"content":"<p>by Layale Moussa, Hussein F.

Our study aimed to quantify the levels of lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (As), and cadmium (Cd) in 96 composite samples of 13 herbs and spices frequently consumed in Lebanon. Twenty percent (19/96) and 4% (4/96) of the samples exceeded the permissible levels of Pb and Cd, respectively and all the samples met the permissible levels of As and Hg according to Codex Alimentarius standards. For Pb and Cd, unpackaged samples had the highest levels of unacceptable samples of 31% (8/26) and 8% (2/26), respectively. The samples locally packaged in companies with and without Food Safety Management System (FSMS) had the same levels of unacceptable samples of 12% (3/26) and 4% (1/26) for Pb and Cd, respectively. Imported packaged samples had unacceptable levels of Pb (28% (5/18)) and were acceptable for the three other heavy metals.","author":"Layale Moussa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"41dd773fedeb10c8f4ae47377ba86ae4ee60735e28db0efe9536fb69422e86f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
