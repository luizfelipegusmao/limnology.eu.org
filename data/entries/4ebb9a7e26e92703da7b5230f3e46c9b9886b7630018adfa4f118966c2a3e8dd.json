In addition to affecting carbon-nutrient exchanges, plants that associate with distinct mycorrhizal types often differ in several traits, with consequences for myriad below-ground processes.\n\nWe used two common gardens planted with <i>Populus fremontii</i>, a tree species that can simultaneously associate with both arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, to examine the degree to which mycorrhizal-type dominance influences root traits and trait relationships across the root economic space.\n\nWhile <i>P. fremontii</i> formed AM and ECM associations simultaneously, individuals displayed a dominant mycorrhizal type driven primarily by garden location. Trees in the low-elevation garden, regardless of provenance, were colonized primarily by AM fungi, whereas trees in the high-elevation garden were colonized primarily by ECM fungi. In root systems at the low-elevation garden, AM colonization rates were negatively related to specific root length indicating trade-off with investment in foraging roots. In contrast, root systems at the high-elevation garden, ECM colonization was negatively related to root tissue density, demonstrating a potential trade-off between resource acquisition and root growth/defence. All other root economic traits remained similar between mycorrhizal types.\n\nWhile root traits varied little between AM- and ECM-dominated trees (and gardens), their relationships with one another differed in each garden, suggesting unique strategies and trait trade-offs in a single species. As global change continues to alter environments, species like <i>P. fremontii</i>, which experience a range of abiotic conditions, could signal how other tree species might modify root traits and strategies in response.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/07/17/cottonwood-roots-change-their-carbon-investment-strategies-over-environmental-extremes/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Elena A.
