{"title":"Microwave-Assisted Synthesis of TiO2 Nanoparticles: Optimization and Characterization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0295/v1","date":1714992971000,"content":"The goal of this research is to determine the optimal microwave-assisted sol-gel synthesis pa-rameters of TiO2 nanoparticles with the achievement of the crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles with the highest specific surface area and the lowest energy band gap. Titanium isopropoxide was used as a precursor to prepare the sol (colloidal solution) of TiO2, isopropanol as a solvent, acetylacetone for complexation, and nitric acid as a catalyst. Four samples of titanium dioxide were synthesized from the prepared colloidal solution in a microwave reactor at a temperature of 150 °C for 30 minutes and at a temperature of 200 °C for 10, 20, and 30 minutes. The phase composition of the prepared samples was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were used to determine the spe-cific surface area and pore size distributions by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The band gap energy values of the TiO2 samples were determined by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). CrystallineTiO2 nanoparticles with the highest specific surface area and the lowest energy band gap were obtained for the TiO2 sample synthesized at 200 °C for 10 minutes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e750c562dbc3a3d42e1427f655e23d8a32004740710857179c2d994393923cde","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
