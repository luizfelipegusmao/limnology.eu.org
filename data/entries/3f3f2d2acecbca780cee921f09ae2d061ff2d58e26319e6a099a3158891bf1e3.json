{"title":"Revision of the Terrain Openness Index Method for Extracting Depressions from Karst Peak Areas Based on Slope Mutation Points","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1331/v1","date":1713768615000,"content":"Karst peaks and depressions are scattered in karst zones with strong spatial heterogeneity and fragile ecological environments and are crucial for determining the degree of karst geomorphologic development. However, realizing automatic depiction and extracting depressions with high accuracy is difficult because of their complex morphology. Herein, based on 12.5-m resolution DEM data, six typical karst peaks from depressions in southwest China were selected as the study areas and a revised terrain openness index method based on slope mutation points (ROBSMPs) was used to determine the degree of karst geomorphologic development and the boundary of karst depressions. The extent of depressions extracted by ROBSMPs and the terrain openness index method with the extent of depressions hand-drawn based on remote sensing images was compared and analyzed. The results show that compared with the topographic openness index method, the overall accuracy of karst depression extracted by ROBSMPs was improved and the perimeter, area, and raster displacement error indexes were reduced. ROBSMPs realized high-precision extraction of depressions, thereby strengthening the applicability of the topographic openness index method to karst peak zones. This study offers a new perspective and path toward the expansion of digital terrain analysis technology in karst mountainous areas and is expected to play a vital role in the extraction of similar geomorphic units in karst zones.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f3f2d2acecbca780cee921f09ae2d061ff2d58e26319e6a099a3158891bf1e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
