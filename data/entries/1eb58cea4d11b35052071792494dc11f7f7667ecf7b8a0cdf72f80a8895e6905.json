{"title":"Exploring the Link Between Malignant Melanoma and Urological Cancers: A Path Towards Personalized Medicine. Review of the Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0644/v1","date":1728464337000,"content":"Malignant melanoma and urological cancers originate from different tissues and organs, yet several studies highlight connections between these malignancies, including common risk factors, genetic predispositions, and immunological pathways. Research indicates that individuals with a history of melanoma have an elevated risk of developing renal cell carcinoma (RCC), while those with RCC are more likely to develop melanoma. Shared factors such as a personal or family history of cancer, UV radiation exposure, smoking, and obesity have all been linked to an increased incidence of various cancer types. A major link between malignant melanoma and urological cancers is the presence of shared genetic mutations and familial cancer syndromes. Key mutations, including germline mutations in BRCA1, MITF, CDKN2A, TP53, and alterations in the PI3K/AKT pathway, significantly contribute to the risk of both types of malignancies. Personalized medicine, which tailors prevention and treatment strategies to an individualâ€™s genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, has significantly improved cancer care. The primary aim is to select the most effective treatment for each patient, maximizing therapeutic outcomes, reducing side effects, and minimizing the risk of drug resistance. Advances in genomics and immunology are driving the development of personalized therapies that target specific molecular pathways and immune responses common to both melanoma and urological cancers. Angiogenesis inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated notable success in treating these cancers, with tumor mutational burden serving as a valuable biomarker for predicting the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1eb58cea4d11b35052071792494dc11f7f7667ecf7b8a0cdf72f80a8895e6905","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
