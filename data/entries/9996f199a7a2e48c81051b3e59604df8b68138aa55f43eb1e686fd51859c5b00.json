{"title":"Aluminum‐Modified Plasma Nitriding with High Efficiency and Enhanced Performances","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1492/v1","date":1724228127000,"content":"In order to enhance the efficiency and combined performances of nitriding layer, aluminum-modified plasma nitriding (Al-PN) was developed in this research by adding some FeAl particles around the samples during plasma nitriding (PN) for 42CrMo steel. The results show that the efficiency is dramatically enhanced almost 6 times comparing with traditional PN, with the effective hardening layer increasing from 224 μm to 1246 μm at 520℃/4h. More importantly, the compound layer increased just a little bit from 11.64 μm to 14.32 μm, which remarkably reduces the ratio of the compound layer thickness to effective hardening layer thickness, thus being quite beneficial to decrease the brittleness level, making the brittleness level decreasing from Level 4 to Level 1. Meanwhile, ultra-high surface hardness and excellent wear behaviors are obtained by aluminum-modified plasma nitriding (Al-PN) due to the formation of dispersed strengthening phased of AlN and FexAl in the nitriding layer, with the surface hardness increasing from 755 HV0.025 to 1251 HV0.025, wear rate decreasing from 8.15 x10-5g N-1 m-1 to 4.07 x10-5g N-1 m-1. In other words, comparing with PN, the wear resistance has been almost doubled by Al-PN. Therefore, the research can provide comprehensive insights into the surface characteristics and combined performances of the aluminum-modified plasma nitriding layer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9996f199a7a2e48c81051b3e59604df8b68138aa55f43eb1e686fd51859c5b00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
