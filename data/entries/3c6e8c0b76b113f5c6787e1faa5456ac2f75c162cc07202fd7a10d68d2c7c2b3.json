{"title":"Impact of Utilizing Visual Stimuli (BlazePod) on Agility, Vertical jump, and Visual Reaction Time Speed in Under-19 Volleyball Players","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0980/v1","date":1710751896000,"content":"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Blazepod technology when incorporated with various training regimens on the essential elements of physical fitness in volleyball, such as agility, speed, visual response time, and vertical leap.\nThirty-six participants (age :17.33±0.48 y, height: 183.78±6.34 cm, weight: 77.14±5.16 kg) were in-volved in this study. In randomized design, three equal groups with two experimental groups and one control group were involved in the study over a period of six weeks: (GE1) used Blazepod technology to workout at a low level; (GE2) used Blazepod technology to workout at a higher intensity; (CG) did not employ Blazepod technology, but it adhered to the same fundamental training curriculum. We conducted agility, speed, reaction time, and vertical jump tests before, midway and after the study to determine optimal training volume, intensity, and frequency. A significant main effect of time (P0.01), and time×group interaction (P&gt;0.001) were found for all tests. Post hoc test showed that the two experimental groups gadget significantly improved in all performance variables (P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c6e8c0b76b113f5c6787e1faa5456ac2f75c162cc07202fd7a10d68d2c7c2b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
