{"title":"Genetic regulation of self-organizing azimuthal canopy orientations and their impacts on light interception in maize","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1600/7584950?rss=1","date":1705881600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The efficiency of solar radiation interception contributes to the photosynthetic efficiency of crop plants. Light interception is a function of canopy architecture, including plant density; leaf number, length, width, and angle; and azimuthal canopy orientation. We report on the ability of some maize (<span>Zea mays</span>) genotypes to alter the orientations of their leaves during development in coordination with adjacent plants. Although the upper canopies of these genotypes retain the typical alternate-distichous phyllotaxy of maize, their leaves grow parallel to those of adjacent plants. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) on this parallel canopy trait identified candidate genes, many of which are associated with shade avoidance syndrome, including <span>phytochromeC2</span>. GWAS conducted on the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted by canopies also identified multiple candidate genes, including <span>liguleless1</span> (<span>lg1</span>), previously defined by its role in ligule development. Under high plant densities, mutants of shade avoidance syndrome and <span>liguleless</span> genes (<span>lg1</span>, <span>lg2</span>, and <span>Lg3</span>) exhibit altered canopy patterns, viz, the numbers of interrow leaves are greatly reduced as compared to those of nonmutant controls, resulting in dramatically decreased PAR interception. In at least the case of <span>lg2</span>, this phenotype is not a consequence of abnormal ligule development. Instead, <span>liguleless</span> gene functions are required for normal light responses, including azimuth canopy re-orientation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"cf1b560d42dfd666b64fe85f362ca66174032a83b38e2631e2920a97a828fdb5","category":"Environment"}
