{"title":"Kinship assessment and insights into reproductive behaviour of the Critically Endangered green sawfish Pristis zijsron in Western Australia","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4213?af=R","date":1719221399000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nIn this study, single nucleotide polymorphisms were used to investigate kinship and philopatry for the Critically Endangered green sawfish, <i>Pristis zijsron</i>, in Western Australia.\nSampling was conducted in an important nursery area: the Ashburton River estuary and adjacent tidal creeks. Kinship was inferred from the genotypes of 104 sawfish sampled between 2011 and 2014 (<i>n</i> = 31), and 2020 and 2022 (<i>n</i> = 73).\nThe total number of dams contributing across all sites and time periods was estimated to be between 50 and 56.\nFifty-two full sibling dyads, 90 half sibling dyads and 72 third-degree dyads were detected, involving 58, 67, and 46 <i>P. zijsron</i>, respectively. Of these, 34 half sibling dyads were related maternally and 56 related paternally, including multiple maternal and paternal half siblings pupped in different years, suggesting both female and male philopatry. Catch data indicated that two groups of maternal half siblings were littermates, demonstrating multiple paternity. A high degree of relatedness was found across the study area, with 88% of <i>P. zijsron</i> related to at least one other individual up to the third-degree.\nEvidence for female philopatry in <i>P. zijsron</i> highlights the importance of protecting nursery areas for this species. The occurrence of philopatric behaviour in male and female <i>P. zijsron</i> suggests that dispersal might be limited in both sexes of this species, highlighting the need to investigate the amount of genetic diversity and incidence of inbreeding within remaining populations.\n</p>","author":"Jack Ingelbrecht, \nKarissa O.
