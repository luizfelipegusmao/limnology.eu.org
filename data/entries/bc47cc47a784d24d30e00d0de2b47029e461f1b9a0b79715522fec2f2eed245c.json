{"title":"Efficacy of wooden toy training in alleviating cognitive decline in elderly individuals with cognitive impairment: A cluster randomized controlled study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309685","date":1729000800000,"content":"<p>by Qiuping Cheng, Hanqian Wang, Mengni Cui, Qunlong Wang, Lu Li</p>\r\nBackground <p>With the increasing global aging population, the health and welfare of elderly individuals, especially individuals with prevalent mild cognitive impairment (MCI) living in nursing homes, have become critical concerns. These concerns highlight the urgency of developing effective interventions to address the cognitive and psychological needs of elderly individuals, ensuring their well-being and alleviating the burden on their caregivers.</p> Objective <p>This study investigates the impact of wooden toy training on mitigating cognitive decline in elderly individuals with cognitive impairment. It evaluates how this training influences cognitive functions and psychological well-being, exploring whether it can slow or reverse the progression of cognitive decline. This outcome will be assessed in a randomized controlled trial, in which changes in cognitive ability and psychological health indicators among the participants will be measured.</p> Design <p>A two-arm, open-label, cluster-randomized controlled trial.</p> Setting(s) <p>The study was conducted in two nursing homes, which served as both the recruitment sites for participants and the intervention locations. These nursing homes were selected for their ability to facilitate the intervention and for their representative demographic characteristics of the elderly population. The settings provided a controlled environment that was conducive to implementing the wooden toy training program and observing its effects on the participants.</p> Participants <p>A total of 76 elderly participants with mild cognitive impairment but functional independence were recruited.</p> Methods <p>Participants were randomized into an intervention group and a control group. The intervention group engaged in an 8-week wooden toy training program, whereas those in the control cohort received customary nursing care. Standardized cognitive and psychological well-being measures were used to assess improvements in cognitive performance and mental health.</p> Results <p>Significant improvements were observed in the cognitive functions of the intervention group from a baseline score of M = 13.11 to M = 16.29 postintervention (95% CI [-4.44, -1.93]), along with reductions in depressive symptoms from a baseline score of M = 8.63 to M = 7.18 (95% CI [0.38, 2.51]). Additionally, engagement in activities with wooden toys significantly satisfied their need for competence, increasing from a baseline of M = 16.29 to M = 20 postintervention (95% CI [-5.92, -1.51]), and relatedness, which improved from a baseline of M = 20.32 to M = 22.95 (95% CI [-4.73, -0.53]).</p> Conclusions <p>This study underscores the potential of a wooden toy intervention in nursing homes that combines cognitive challenges with traditional cultural elements to improve cognitive functions in elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest a novel method of promoting the cognitive and psychological health of nursing home residents through emotional comfort and social interaction.</p>","author":"Qiuping Cheng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bc47cc47a784d24d30e00d0de2b47029e461f1b9a0b79715522fec2f2eed245c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
