{"title":"The assessment of water quality by macroinvertebrate and water quality indices in small reservoir (Damsa, Türkiye)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2658?af=R","date":1722317571000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The composition and spatial distribution of macroinvertebrates in the Damsa reservoir have been analysed. Also, reservoir water was evaluated with water quality index (WQI). Damsa reservoir is significant for both biodiversity and recreation in the region. Except for the winter season, the lake water is of good quality for WQI. There is pollution in the lake in terms of phosphorus, especially for winter. In terms of phosphate, all of the stations are mezotrophic for the OECD; however, Stations 4 and 5 are eutrophic for the Türkiye Surface Water Quality Management Regulation (the others are mezotrophic). Community variation and status of benthic macroinvertebrate were evaluated with Ecological Status Class Assessment Tools (ESCATs) indices which have been widely used in the literature. In the present study, 1062 individual benthic macroinvertebrates from 11 orders and 17 families were collected. A total of 46 macroinvertebrates taxa were identified. The first three dominant groups are Oligochaeta (42.66%), Hemiptera (<i>Micronecta scholtzi</i>, 23.07%) and Chironomidae (19.67%).</p>","author":"Özlem Fındık, \nSeval Aras","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"ce5556fd54ab791e04e8adddc6f1dcb69e76402ec2fab79f7dc88451b581aa77","category":"Environment"}
