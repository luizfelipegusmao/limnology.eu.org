{"title":"Glass Ceramic Materials with Luminescent Properties in the System ZnO-B2O3-Nb2O5-Eu2O3","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1315/v1","date":1718774686000,"content":"In this paper glass crystallization behavior of 50ZnO:47B2O3:3Nb2O3:0.5Eu2O3 (G-0h) glass has been investigated in detail by DSC, XRD and TEM analysis. The luminescent properties of resulted glass-ceramics were also investigated. By XRD and TEM analysis crystallization of several crystalline phases have been proved (α-Zn3B2O6, β-Zn3B2O6 and ZnNb2O6). By calculating of crystal parameters it was found that europium ions are successfully incorporated in the β-Zn3B2O6. Photo-luminescent spectra show an increased emission in the resulting glass-ceramic samples as compared with the parent glass sample because of the higher asymmetry of Eu3+ ions in the crystalline phases obtained. It was established that the optimum emission intensity is registered for glass-ceramic sample obtained after 25 hours heat treatment of the parent glass.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be2ac3eb37d514cb0f5d80f0702cfae9bee96adc7d79d2ae5c5125f0794cea38","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
