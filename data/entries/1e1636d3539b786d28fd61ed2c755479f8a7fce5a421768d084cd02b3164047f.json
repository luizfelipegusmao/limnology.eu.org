{"title":"Consent Considerations for Generation and Sharing of Genomic Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1671/v1","date":1719300407000,"content":"It is important to consider both requirements and limitations for the generation and sharing of genomic data. For example, human genomic sequence data should typically not be deposited publicly without the appropriate \"explicit consent\" to do so. This includes genetic identifying data that may exist within raw reads for bulk RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data and genomic data from cell lines that are available to purchase. At the same time, data sharing is important for re-analysis and reproducibility/replication in the scientific community. A review of known rules and guidelines for genomic data sharing is provided. This includes specific rules for NIH-funded data for controlled access deposit of HeLa cell line data, including bulk RNA-Seq data. The ability to create “partial” Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public deposits with only processed data is described, with search criteria that can identify many “partial” GEO deposits for a variety of data types where reads were not made public for patient privacy concerns. However, it is the opinion of the author that this should be considered a short-term solution, and additional considerations and action should be carried out for genomic data generated in future experiments. Information about how to learn more about what is known for consent for cell line samples is also briefly provided, along with search results for genomic data from widely available cell lines that is deposited in controlled access databases. Finally, it should be made clear that this article presents some amount of opinion. Additionally, open feedback for this preprint is encouraged to further enhance knowledge and communication.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e1636d3539b786d28fd61ed2c755479f8a7fce5a421768d084cd02b3164047f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
