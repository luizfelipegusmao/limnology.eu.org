{"title":"Overexpression of MPV17/PMP22‐like protein 2 gene decreases production of radical oxygen species in Pyropia yezoensis (Bangiales, Rhodophyta)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13474?af=R","date":1724695876000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The northward shift of <i>Pyropia yezoensis</i> aquaculture required the breeding of germplasms with tolerance to the oxidative stress due to the high light conditions of the North Yellow Sea area. The MPV17/PMP22 family proteins were identified as a molecule related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Here, one of the <i>MPV17</i> homolog genes designated as <i>PyM-LP2</i> was selected for functional identification by introducing the encoding sequence region/reverse complementary fragment into the <i>Py. yezoensis</i> genome. Although the photosynthetic activity, the respiratory rate, and the ROS level in wild type (WT) and different gene-transformed algal strains showed similar levels under normal conditions, the overexpression (OE) strain exhibited higher values of photosynthesis, respiration, and reducing equivalents pool size but lower intracellular ROS production under stress conditions compared with the WT. Conversely, all the above parameters showed opposite variation trends in RNAi strain as those in the OE strain. This implied that the PyM-LP2 protein was involved in the mitigation of the oxidative stress. Sequence analysis revealed that this PyM-LP2 protein was assorted to peroxisomes and might serve as a poring channel for transferring malate (Mal) to peroxisomes. By overexpressing <i>PyM-LP2</i>, the transfer of Mal from chloroplasts to peroxisomes was enhanced under stress conditions, which promoted photorespiration and ultimately alleviated excessive reduction of the photosynthetic electron chain. This research lays the groundwork for the breeding of algae with enhanced resistance to oxidative stresses.</p>","author":"Yujie Li, \nJiali Yang, \nZhenjie Sun, \nJianfeng Niu, \nGuangce Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"d7a4d6ac3e41fff30fdd85bc59f042b45e4611927ecc4b517b572be58e84074f","category":"Environment"}
