{"title":"Sterility Mosaic Disease of Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth): Current Status, Disease Management Strategies, and Future Prospects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0897/v1","date":1718255451000,"content":"Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) is one of the important grain legume crops cultivated in the semi-arid tropics, playing a crucial role in the economic well-being of subsistence farmers. India is the major producer of pigeonpea, accounting for over 75 per cent of the world's production. Sterility mosaic disease (SMD), caused by Pigeonpea sterility mosaic virus (PPSMV) and transmitted by the eriophyid mite (Aceria cajani), is a major constraint to pigeonpea cultivation in the Indian subcontinent, leading to potential yield losses of up to 100 per cent. The recent characterization of another Emaravirus associated with SMD has further complicated the etiology of this challenging viral disease. This review focuses on critical areas, including the current status of the disease, transmission and host-range, rapid phenotyping techniques, as well as available disease management strategies. The review concludes with insights into the future prospects, offering an overview and direction for further research and management strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ad6fee27e52a1f297cb86c180aab590afb9c7fc8fb3df955d5f5293b65adfe2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
