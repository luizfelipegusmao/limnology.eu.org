{"title":"Bacterial Thrombolytic Enzyme Synthesis and Screening from Several Egyptian Soil Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0919/v1","date":1713168181000,"content":"Thromboembolic conditions, such as stroke and myocardial infarction [MI], are the primary causes of mortality globally. High efficiency was demonstrated by fibrinolytic enzymes isolated from microbial sources in dissolving various blood clots. The study aimed to investigate and produce bacterial fibrinolytic enzymes from various Egyptian soil conditions using recombinant DNA technology. Fifty soil samples were examined to determine the production of fibrinolytic enzymes. The plasmin plate technique assessed the thrombolytic activities of the strong fibrinolytic enzyme-producing bacterial isolates. In addition to determining the molecular mass using a mass spectrometer and the western blot method, the activity and thermostability of the enzymes were characterized. An affinity chromatography approach was used to purify the fibrinolytic enzymes. However, bacterial recombinant DNA technology produced the pure bacterial fibrinolytic enzyme. Several dosage formulations for the formulation of fibrinolytic enzymes were tested. By using affinity chromatography and the SDS-PAGE test, the isolated bacterial fibrinolytic enzyme in this investigation was almost 83% pure. Bacillus cereus ATCC 4342 was identified as the predominant bacterial isolate secreting fibrinolytic enzymes. It was discovered that the fibrinolytic enzyme activity of fifty soil samples ranged from 0.167 U/ml to 1.853 U/ml. The extracellular enzyme extracted from Bacillus cereus culture supernatant demonstrated a relatively stable fibrinolytic activity over 18 hours at a pH range of 7.4–10, as well as stability with maximum productivity at 43℃ for over 60 minutes. In this investigation, the enzyme was referred to as Fibrin-proteinase[ FP]. The fibrin clots were directly thrombolyzed by the FP. The calculated values for the specific activity and molecular mass of the FP were approximately 40.71 units/mg of protein and approximately 30 KDa, respectively. It was observed that the presence of Fe+3 marginally boosted protease activity, but the presence of EDTA decreased it. On the other hand, adding monovalent cations like K+1 and Na+1 significantly increased the fibrinolytic activity of FP. The enzyme exhibited activity throughout the temperature range of 20 to 65℃, peaking at 55℃. The ideal range for the generation of protease was 35–43℃ and 8.0–10. The thermostable fibrinolytic enzyme FP, which was isolated from Bacillus cereus ATCC 4342 in various soil environments in Egypt during the current study, was a promising fibrinolytic enzyme because it demonstrated a more extensive and effective fibrinolytic activity and fewer side effects than the fibrinolytic enzymes that are currently available worldwide. It is advised that further research be done on optimizing the right formulation of bacterial fibrinolytic enzymes in the future to help dissolve different types of blood clots and, as a result, lower the high death rate that exists worldwide.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"018cfd4e75ab17deeacf3e238782d4cba40a0d8e3777f8874cd0b3c54a848105","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
