{"title":"X Corp Has Updated Their Mobile Apps, Finally, But the iOS App Is Still ‘Twitter’ in the App Store","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271","date":1690576980000,"content":"\n<p>Any normal company planning a product name change would have everything sorted out with the iOS App Store and Android Play Store ahead of time. Needless to say, X Corp is not a normal company and so of course they didn’t have anything sorted out. Yesterday an update to the Twitter app <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1\">appeared in Google’s Play Store</a>, with a new icon and new app name: “X”.</p>\n\n<p>Today, an update to the Twitter app finally appeared on Apple’s App Store. It has the new icon, but the app’s name in the store is still “Twitter”. The app’s description calls it X, though:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The X app is the trusted digital town square for everyone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the name of the app installed on your device is “X”. What gives? On <s>Twitter</s> X, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickjsheriff/status/1684935759529480192\">Nick Sheriff points to a rule</a> I heretofore wasn’t aware of. Apple doesn’t allow single-character app names:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On iOS, the situation is distinct as Apple does not permit any app\nto have a single character as their app name.</p>\n\n<p>If they manage to obtain approval, it would mark the first\ninstance since the inception of the iOS App Store that such a\npermission has been granted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The rule Sheriff is referencing is about an app’s <em>title</em> in the App Store, not the name of the app as it appears on your device. So who’s going to budge? Will Apple grant a unique exemption allowing X Corp to have the first and only single-character app name in the entire App Store, or will X name the iOS app something longer (<em>X App</em>? <em>X: Everything</em>? <em>X 69</em>? <em>XXX</em>? <em>𝕏 (💦✊🍆)</em>?)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I’ve rewritten this post significantly. I was confused, at first, by the different rules for app names (on device) and app titles (listed on the App Store).</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/28/x-app-android-ios\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"71177f0d10f81720be71b2245602f0d07258026ecbc5fd63811aaa8112a874f5","category":"Tech"}
