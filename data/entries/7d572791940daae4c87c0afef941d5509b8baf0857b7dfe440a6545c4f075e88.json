{"title":"Consumptive Water Use and Efficiency of Irrigated U.S. Corn: Learning From Hundreds of Site‐Management‐Year Observations","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024WR037434?af=R","date":1723786813000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Grain yield response to consumptive water use a.k.a. evapotranspiration (ET<sub>c</sub>) is a critical dimension of food-water nexus in irrigated agroecosystems. With the largest water footprint, irrigated corn production in the U.S. must be assessed for its ET<sub>c</sub> and water use efficiency (WUE) at a scale meaningful for producers and water managers. Field experiments significantly inform our understanding of how corn yield responds to ET<sub>c</sub> at the field/plot-level, but their collective synergism remains untapped. This analysis uses a literature synthesis of existing measured data from nationwide experiments that measured corn ET<sub>c</sub>, to build models that elucidate and predict corn ET<sub>c</sub> and WUE under diverse environment and on-farm management. The resulting synthesis (<i>n</i> = 1,362) captured wide ranging conditions of mean aridity, environmental variability, management, and crop outcomes, providing an unprecedented opportunity to train data-driven models. Random forest models effectively predicted seasonal total ET<sub>c</sub> and seasonal mean WUE using a handful of environmental and management-based predictors, demonstrating RMSEs of 33 mm (5.1%) and 0.28 kg m<sup>−3</sup> (10.4%), respectively. Irrigation depth was the most important followed by total precipitation received during the growing season in determining ET<sub>c</sub> and WUE. Trained on the largest compilation of experimental data sets of corn ET<sub>c</sub>, these data-driven models represent nuanced corn water production functions that also account for weather and agronomy besides describing economic yield-ET<sub>c</sub> response.</p>","author":"Meetpal S.
