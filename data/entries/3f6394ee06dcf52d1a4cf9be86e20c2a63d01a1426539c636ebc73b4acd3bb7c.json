{"title":"Effectiveness of Sensors-Based Augmented Feedback in Ergonomics to Reduce Adverse Biomechanical Exposure in Work-Related Manual Handling â€“ A Rapid Review of the Evidence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1496/v1","date":1724220548000,"content":"Manual handling is a major risk factor for work-related musculoskeletal disorders and one of the leading causes of disability-adjusted life years globally, necessitating multifaceted risk reduction measures. One potential intervention for manual handling tasks is work technique training assisted by augmented feedback on biomechanical exposures. However, there is a research gap regarding its effectiveness specifically for manual handling tasks in both real work environments and controlled settings, as well as its ability to induce retained reductions in biomechanical exposure. The gap was investigated using a rapid review comprising a literature search using two databases and 11 reviews/overviews to identify studies from the past 20 years, up to studies published by June 1, 2024. Sixteen studies were identified, with 14 of them being of high or moderate methodological quality and were included. Three studies were conducted in real work environments and eleven in controlled settings. Most studies (n = 9) used auditory feedback, followed by vibration feedback (n = 6). In real work environments, the evidence for the effectiveness of sensor-based augmented feedback in reducing biomechanical exposure during administration was considered to be inconsistent and very limited directly after administration. For longer periods after administration, ranging from one week to more than six months, there is currently no evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of the feedback. In controlled settings, there was strong evidence for its effectiveness during and immediately after administration, and limited evidence for effectiveness up to six months post-administration when considering the tasks included in the training. Future research needs are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f6394ee06dcf52d1a4cf9be86e20c2a63d01a1426539c636ebc73b4acd3bb7c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
