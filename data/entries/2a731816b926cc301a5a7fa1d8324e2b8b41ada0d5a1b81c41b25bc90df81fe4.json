Although four different topologies of single-resistor damped double-tuned filters (DDTFs) have been studied before in the literature, the effectiveness of two different DR-DDTF configurations has not been examined. This work redresses this gap by demonstrating that via comprehensive simulations on two power systems, DR-DDTF provides better harmonic suppression and resonance mitigation than single-resistor alternatives. When it comes to optimizing the DR-DDTF for maximum hosting capacity and minimum system active power losses, the multi-objective artificial hummingbird outperformed six other algorithms in the benchmark. To allow for higher penetration of distributed generation without requiring grid upgrades, this newly developed harmonic mitigation filter provides a good alternative.","author":"Mohammed M.
