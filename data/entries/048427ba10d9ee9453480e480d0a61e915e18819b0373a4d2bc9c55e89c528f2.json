{"title":"Evaluation of C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 5 (CCR5) as a Sample Adequacy Control in HPV Molecular Diagnostics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0376/v1","date":1725488760000,"content":"Background: Reliable HPV testing and genotyping are essential for quality assurance in HPV-based primary screening, disease management and for monitoring the impact of HPV vaccination. The clinical validation of HPV molecular diagnostic assays has significantly contributed to these objectives, however little emphasis has been placed in assuring sample quality. This study aims to assess the accuracy of sample cellularity assessment using C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 5 (CCR5) gene target as a marker of sample adequacy in molecular diagnostics. Methods: Jurkat cell line samples were counted both using Thoma cell-counting chamber and Fluorescent-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Jurkat cell line samples at three different concentrations were subsequently evaluated using the OncoPredict HPV Quality Control (QC) real-time PCR assay, employing CCR5 for molecular cellularity quantification. Results: Cellularity values obtained were comparable across the 3 different methods for all dilutions of the cell line tested. Conclusions: The results obtained from this study show that CCR5 represents a promising molecular marker for the accurate quantification of sample cellularity, confirming its use as a reliable sample adequacy control, thus reducing the risk of “false negative” results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"048427ba10d9ee9453480e480d0a61e915e18819b0373a4d2bc9c55e89c528f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
