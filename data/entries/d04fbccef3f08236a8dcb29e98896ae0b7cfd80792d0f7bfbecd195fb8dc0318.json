In Ethiopia, the outcome of burn injuries and associated factors among burn patients were not clearly described. To assess the outcome of burn injuries and its associated factors among burn patients attending public hospitals in the North, showa Zone, Ethiopia. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 420 burn patients in public hospitals of the North showa, zone. Systematic random sampling was used to select study participants. Structured checklists were used to extract data from burn patients’ medical records. Data was entered using Epi-Data version 4.6. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25. A p- value of ≤ 0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression was used to declare a significant association. In this study, the prevalence of discharges with complications was 40.9% (95% CI: 36.5–45.6). The odds of developing complications among patients having pre-hospital intervention were nearly four times the odds of not having the intervention (AOR = 3.8, 95% CI, 1.11–13.25). The odds of developing complications among patients having scalds were four times the odds of not having scalds (AOR = 4.3, 95% CI, 1.52–12.32). A patient who received fluid and electrolytes was 76% less likely to develop the outcome of burn injury discharged with burn complications. Patients with TBSA less than 20% were 66% less likely to be discharged with complications compared to patients with TBSA greater than 20%.: This study demonstrates a significantly higher level of outcome for patients with burn injuries who were discharged with complications, leading to death and other bad outcomes. Therefore, stakeholder would more emphasis in health education on prevention of burn injuries, first aid treatment of burn, treatment of the cause of burns, and providing fluid and electrolytes.","author":"Ejigu Mulugeta Shewaye","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"d04fbccef3f08236a8dcb29e98896ae0b7cfd80792d0f7bfbecd195fb8dc0318","category":"Environment"}
