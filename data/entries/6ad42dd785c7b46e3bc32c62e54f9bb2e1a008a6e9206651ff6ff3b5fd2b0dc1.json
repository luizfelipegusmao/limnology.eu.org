{"title":"Correcting misinformation about the Russia-Ukraine War reduces false beliefs but does not change views about the War","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307090","date":1727100000000,"content":"<p>by Ethan Porter, R. Bailey Scott, Thomas J. Wood, Raushan Zhandayeva</p>\r\n\r\nWe report results from simultaneous experiments conducted in late 2022 in Belarus, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine. The experiments focus on fact-checking misinformation supportive of Russia in the Russia-Ukraine War. Meta-analysis makes clear that fact-checking misinformation reduces belief in pro-Kremlin false claims. Effects of fact-checks are not uniform across countries; our meta-analytic estimate is reliant on belief accuracy increases observed in Russia and Ukraine. While fact-checks improve belief accuracy, they do not change respondents’ attitudes about which side to support in the War. War does not render individuals hopelessly vulnerable to misinformation—but fact-checking misinformation is unlikely to change their views toward the conflict.","author":"Ethan Porter","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6ad42dd785c7b46e3bc32c62e54f9bb2e1a008a6e9206651ff6ff3b5fd2b0dc1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
