{"title":"Functional Overview on Mads Box: A Meta-Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1691/v1","date":1716786215000,"content":"Majority of the studied MADS box members are linked with flowering and fruit traits. However, higher volumes of studies on the type II of their two types so far suggest that florigenic effect of the gene members could just be tip of the iceberg. In current study we used a systematic approach to have general overview on the MADS box members their cross-trait and multifactor associations as well as their pleiotropic potentials based on local reference database curated for MADS box members. While doing so, we screened for the co-occurrence of the terms of interest within the title or abstract of each reference with threshold of 3 hits. Analysis results showed that our approach can retrieve multi-faceted information on the subject of study (MADS box gene members in current case) which could otherwise have been skewed depending on the authorsâ€™ expertise and/or volume of literature reference base. Overall, our study discusses on the roles of MADS box members in association with plant organs and traits-linked factors among plant species. Our assessment showed that plants with majority of the MADS box member studies include tomato, apple, rice etc., after Arabidopsis. Furthermore, based on the degree of their multi-trait associations, FLC, SVP, SOC1, etc. are suggested to have relatively higher pleiotropic potential among others in plant growth, development and flowering process. The approach devised in this study is expected applicable for having basic understanding on any study subject of interest regardless of depth prior knowledge.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a5e465bb62197602c6758fda9c271859c3edd1cc1a649339cbbb6ad570765e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
