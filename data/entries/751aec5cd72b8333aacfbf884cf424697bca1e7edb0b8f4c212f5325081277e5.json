{"title":"Identification of miRNA858 long-loop precursors in seed plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1637/7480121?rss=1","date":1702944000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of nonprotein-coding short transcripts that provide a layer of post-transcriptional regulation essential to many plant biological processes. MiR858, which targets the transcripts of MYB transcription factors, can affect a range of secondary metabolic processes. Although miR858 and its 187-nt precursor have been well studied in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), a systematic investigation of miR858 precursors and their functions across plant species is lacking due to a problem in identifying the transcripts that generate this subclass. By re-evaluating the transcript of miR858 and relaxing the length cut-off for identifying hairpins, we found in kiwifruit (<span>Actinidia chinensis</span>) that miR858 has long-loop hairpins (1,100 to 2,100 nt), whose intervening sequences between miRNA generating complementary sites were longer than all previously reported miRNA hairpins. Importantly, these precursors of miR858 containing long-loop hairpins (termed <span>MIR858L</span>) are widespread in seed plants including Arabidopsis, varying between 350 and 5,500 nt. Moreover, we showed that <span>MIR858L</span> has a greater impact on proanthocyanidin and flavonol levels in both Arabidopsis and kiwifruit. We suggest that an active <span>MIR858L</span>-MYB regulatory module appeared in the transition of early land plants to large upright flowering plants, making a key contribution to plant secondary metabolism.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"751aec5cd72b8333aacfbf884cf424697bca1e7edb0b8f4c212f5325081277e5","category":"Environment"}
