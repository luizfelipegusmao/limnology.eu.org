Lung ultrasound performed in dogs and cats with different types of consolidations. Characteristic of bronchogram: air dynamic and static bronchogram, fluid bronchogram or absence of bronchogram. Types of vascularisations in consolidation: tree like type, residual, chaotic vascularisation and penetrating from the chest wall to consolidation and “vascular sign”.\nConclusion and Clinical Importance:  Analysis of bronchogram and type of vascularisation in consolidation is possible to perform in dogs and cat. The analysis of mentioned criteria had an impact on subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic decisions","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a735939326e61d0f427a51cad699e5b9c60bd7db55b40485cceb28fc6339951","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
