The aim of the study is to identify relevant research topics based on pooled bibliometric data of International Journal of Hydrogen Energy publications from 2022-2024, collected from The Lens and ScienceDirect platforms. Data source. Bibliometric records of International Journal of Hydrogen Energy articles published in 2022-2024 from The Lens and ScienceDirect platforms were used. Programs and utilities used. VOSviewer, Scimago Graphica, Inkscape, FP-growth utility. Results. The study showed the feasibility of merging bibliometric records from the open platforms ScienceDirect and The Lens, which complement each other. The 'Fields of Study' data of The Lens can be rationally interpreted as system keywords similar to Scopus Index Keywords. The possibility of using 'Fields of Study' data in a method similar to bibliographic coupling is shown. The practicality of using an Alluvial diagram to show the co-occurrence of the four terms was demonstrated. The study also emphasizes the advisability of joint use of VOSviewer and Scimago Graphica programs for complex visualization of bibliometric analysis results. The study identified two dominant publication topics in International Journal of Hydrogen Energy for 2022-2024, which can be described in terms of: 'Catalysis, Hydrogen, Physical_chemistry, Chemical_engineering, Nanotechnology, Electrochemistry, Organic_chemistry, Materials_science' and 'Electrical_engineering, Hydrogen_production, Renewable_energy, Environmental_science, Hydrogen_economy, Hydrogen, Engineering'.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"140c038d9143b281061b1ecc19e590c1a13b3c4cd265abf79adefc8647600669","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
