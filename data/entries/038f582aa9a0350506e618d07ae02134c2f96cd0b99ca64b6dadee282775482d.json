{"title":"The evolutionary history and biogeographical distribution of the Mesozoic relic genus Chilelimnophila (Diptera, Limoniidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlae119/7796650?rss=1","date":1727654400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study presents novel findings that expand our understanding of the evolutionary history and diversity of the Limoniidae subfamily Limnophilinae, with a specific focus on the relict genus <span>Chilelimnophila</span>. The family Limoniidae is well documented in the fossil record, with many species considered relicts in the modern fauna. Our study is based on the discovery of the first fossil specimens of <span>Chilelimnophila</span> in both Cretaceous Spanish and Kachin amber. The new materials have allowed the establishment of a new subgenus <span>Chilelimnophila</span> (<span>Ribeironia</span>) Krzemiński, Kania-Kłosok et Arillo, subgen. nov. and three new species: <span>Chilelimnophila</span> (<span>Ribeironia</span>) <span>amorimi</span> Krzemiński, Kania-Kłosok et Arillo, sp. nov., <span>Chilelimnophila</span> (<span>Chilelimnophila</span>) <span>wangi</span> Krzemiński, Kania-Kłosok et Arillo, sp. nov., and <span>Chilelimnophila</span> (<span>Chilelimnophila</span>) <span>parva</span> Krzemiński, Kania-Kłosok et Arillo, sp. nov. This research also significantly extends the stratigraphic range of the genus, providing evidence of its existence dating back to the Early Cretaceous period. The morphology and phylogenetic analysis of <span>Chilelimnophila</span> and related genera within the Limoniidae subfamily Limnophilinae provide valuable insights into the evolutionary relationships of these organisms. Furthermore, our research highlights the unique environmental conditions of Cretaceous Spanish and Kachin amber formations, which differ significantly from the current habitat of these organisms.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"038f582aa9a0350506e618d07ae02134c2f96cd0b99ca64b6dadee282775482d","category":"Environment"}
