{"title":"Symmetry-Engineered Dual Plasmon-Induced Transparency via Triple Bright Modes in Graphene Metasurfaces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1258/v1","date":1718705960000,"content":"Dynamical manipulation of plasmon-induced transparency (PIT) in graphene metasurfaces is promising for optoelectronic devices such as optical switching and modulating, however, previous design approaches are limited within one or two bright/dark modes, and the realization of dual PIT windows through triple bright modes in graphene metasurfaces is rare and urgently needed. Here we demonstrate that dual PIT can be realized through a symmetry-engineered graphene metasurface, which consists the graphene central cross (GCC) and graphene rectangular ring (GRR) arrays. The GCC supports a bright mode from electric dipole (ED), the GRR supports two nondegenerate bright modes from ED and electric quadrupole (EQ) due to the C2v symmetry breaking, and the resonant coupling of these three bright modes induces the dual PIT windows. A triple coupled-oscillator model (TCM) is proposed to evaluate the transmission performances of the dual PIT phenomenon, and the results are in good agreement with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. In addition, the dual PIT windows are robust to the variation of the structural parameters of the graphene metasurface except the y-directioned length of the GRR. By changing the carrier mobility of graphene, the amplitudes of the two PIT windows can be effectively tuned. The alteration of the Fermi level of graphene enables the dynamic modulation of the dual PIT with good performances for both modulation degree (MD) and insertion loss (IL).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f174a76b2a3e4aa7d56dd8236ff8f1c127d3ff51da3f2729ff18964198d5342","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
