{"title":"Underground trees inhabit varied environmental extremes across the Afrotropics","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/133/5-6/757/7252959?rss=1","date":1693267200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>Geoxyles, a distinctive feature of Afrotropical savannas and grasslands, survive recurrent disturbances by resprouting subshrub branches from large below-ground woody structures. Underground trees are a type of geoxyle that independently evolved within woody genera of at least 40 plant families in Africa. The environmental limits and determinants of underground tree biogeography are poorly understood, with the relative influence of frost and fire debated in particular. We aim to quantify variability in the niche of underground tree species relative to their taller, woody tree/shrub congeners.<div>Methods</div>Using occurrence records of four Afrotropical genera, <span>Parinari</span> (Chrysobalanaceae), <span>Ozoroa</span> (Anacardiaceae), <span>Syzygium</span> (Myrtaceae) and <span>Lannea</span> (Anacardiaceae), and environmental data of nine climate and disturbance variables, the biogeography and niche of underground trees are compared with their open and closed ecosystem congeners.<div>Key Results</div>Along multiple environmental gradients and in a multidimensional environmental space, underground trees inhabit significantly distinct and extreme environments relative to open and closed ecosystem congeners. Niche overlap is low among underground trees and their congeners, and also among underground trees of the four genera. Of the study taxa, <span>Parinari</span> underground trees inhabit hotter, drier and more seasonal environments where herbivory pressure is greatest. <span>Ozoroa</span> underground trees occupy relatively more fire-prone environments, while <span>Syzygium</span> underground trees sustain the highest frost frequency and occur in relatively wetter conditions with seasonal waterlogging. <span>Lannea</span> underground trees are associated with the lowest temperatures, highest precipitation, and varying exposure to disturbance.<div>Conclusions</div>While underground trees exhibit repeated convergent evolution, varied environments shape the ecology and biogeography of this iconic plant functional group. The multiplicity of extreme environments related to fire, frost, herbivory and waterlogging that different underground tree taxa occupy, and the distinctiveness of these environments, should be recognized in the management of African grassy ecosystems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"cad8c88e7255d7c89f37c454bc7c1cf19ef0cc322b24bee779e089ab02529440","category":"Environment"}
