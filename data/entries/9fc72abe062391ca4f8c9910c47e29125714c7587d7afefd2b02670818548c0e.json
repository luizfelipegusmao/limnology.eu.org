{"title":"Vermicomposting in Semi Arid Soil: A Regional and Seasonal Approach for Transforming Trash to Treasure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0313/v1","date":1715044124000,"content":"This study explores the potential of Eisenia fetida (Savigny) in vermicompost production within vermipits during winter months in the Rampur region of Uttar Pradesh, India. The vermipits were inoculated with 0.33 kg of E. fetida per pit, against the recommended rate of inoculation for assessment of real-time potential of earthworm on seasonal and regional grounds. The results revealed a significant increase in earthworm population, with three times production (4.1 kg) of the inoculated number (1.0 kg). The productivity dynamics of compost vs E. feida revealed a notable threefold and fourfold effectiveness, respectively. This dual advantage signifies the success of composting process, with the increased worm population indicating enhanced decomposition. The study attributes the combination of regional and edaphic factors viz., sandy loam soil with high humus content and good water passage, facilitating earthworm survival, reproduction and decomposition of agricultural waste. The loose and perforated soil structure allowed easy penetration of earthworms, transforming the soil into fertile compost. The research emphasizes the importance of soil moisture of semi-arid ecosystems thus highlighting the seasonal significance governing earthworm activity. The study provides insights into the mechanical ability of earthworms, its sensitivity to soil compaction and the influence of high hydration of the region. Inoculation during the winter period indicates increased earthworm activity setting the stage for enhanced compost production in the upcoming hot periods of summer months. The findings suggest that optimizing vermicomposting practices with altered feeding stocks, could further improvise compost and earthworm production and productivity in subsequent seasons. The study contributes for sustainable utilization of E. fetida in composting, its regional and seasonal efficacy turns trash to treasure for enhanced agricultural efficacy","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9fc72abe062391ca4f8c9910c47e29125714c7587d7afefd2b02670818548c0e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
