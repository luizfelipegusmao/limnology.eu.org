{"title":"The Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Architectural Visualization Enhances Augmented Realism and Interactivity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1048/v1","date":1723637712000,"content":"The construction industry is an important part of the national economic market of various countries; since 2013, the construction industry's added value in the gross domestic product has been more than 6%, reaching 6.89% in 2022, and is a pillar industry of the national economy. Intelligent construction is the realistic demand to promote the high-quality development of China's construction industry. It is the key focus of transforming and upgrading the traditional construction industry to information, digital, and intelligent. As a new production factor, construction robots have become the key to promoting intelligent construction. Under the guidance of various national and industry policies, thanks to China's huge construction market volume and rich application scenarios, many innovative and entrepreneurial entities have entered the field of construction robots. Architectural visualization is a crucial aspect of architectural design and communication. With the development of science and technology, artificial intelligence (AI) technology is increasingly becoming an essential tool for architectural visualization and communication. The emergence of AI technology has provided architects with more flexible and creative ways to present design ideas. All along, designers who love architecture have been passionate about exploring better solutions for architecture, but there is never an optimal solution for architectural design; AI is the fire of the future era; it brings us more opportunities but also forces us to face new challenges from the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c8c2acff97e5bfbb42efc8757826a4f9748ad4f1fc429045402b906bff16f016","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
