{"title":"Deciphering molecular events behind Systemin-induced resistance to Botrytis cinerea in tomato plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/13/4111/7641769?rss=1","date":1712361600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant defence peptides are paramount endogenous danger signals secreted after a challenge, intensifying the plant immune response. The peptidic hormone Systemin (Sys) was shown to participate in resistance in several plant pathosystems, although the mechanisms behind Sys-induced resistance when exogenously applied remain elusive. We performed proteomic, metabolomic, and enzymatic studies to decipher the Sys-induced changes in tomato plants in either the absence or the presence of <span>Botrytis cinerea</span> infection. Sys treatments triggered direct proteomic rearrangement mostly involved in carbon metabolism and photosynthesis. However, the final induction of defence proteins required concurrent challenge, triggering priming of pathogen-targeted proteins. Conversely, at the metabolomic level, Sys-treated plants showed an alternative behaviour following a general priming profile. Of the primed metabolites, the flavonoids rutin and isorhamnetin and two alkaloids correlated with the proteins 4-coumarate-CoA-ligase and chalcone-flavanone-isomerase triggered by Sys treatment. In addition, proteomic and enzymatic analyses revealed that Sys conditioned the primary metabolism towards the production of available sugars that could be fuelling the priming of callose deposition in Sys-treated plants; furthermore, PR1 appeared as a key element in Sys-induced resistance. Collectively, the direct induction of proteins and priming of specific secondary metabolites in Sys-treated plants indicated that post-translational protein regulation is an additional component of priming against necrotrophic fungi.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"d322c69f8141205fc9d425f0e402d9505ce599a873c91700e3f17e89e82f6dce","category":"Environment"}
