{"title":"Vehicle to Vehicle Communication with LoRa network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1291/v1","date":1716217346000,"content":"The primary objective of this experiment is to enhance road safety and mitigate the occurrence of accidents by leveraging Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN), specifically focusing on the Long Range (LoRa) network. Through comprehensive research into LPWANs and their various applications, we have designed and implemented a novel approach employing two mobile robots. These robots are utilized to emulate a typical traffic scenario, with one robot leading the way, skillfully maneuvering around obstacles, while the other robot closely follows behind, tracing the same path. The leading robot is tasked with collecting data from its internal environment, the external surroundings, and its operator through an array of sensors. Subsequently, this data is transmitted to the trailing robot. The follower robot's role is to analyze the data received and formulate decisions based on this information. Its objective is to mimic safe driving behavior, particularly when the received data deviates from the expected norms. In such instances, the follower robot will opt to decelerate significantly, thereby minimizing the risk of collision. By implementing this innovative system, we aim to significantly enhance driving safety and reduce the occurrence of accidents on the road.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56c2888404c9bb3b5373586ff8d936314c668a541700a5742d5ed99a7185c899","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
