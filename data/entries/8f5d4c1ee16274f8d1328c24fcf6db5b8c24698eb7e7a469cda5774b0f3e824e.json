{"title":"Exploring the Key Attributes Influencing University Students&rsquo; Domestic Accommodation Choice: A RIDIT Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0001/v1","date":1717568686000,"content":"This study aims to provide an understanding of the preferences of student tourists regarding service attributes related to domestic accommodation. To clarify how lodging firms formulate policies for the student travel market, a “Relative to an Identified Distribution” (RIDIT) analysis in which responses are treated as ordinal data instead of equally spaced data is performed to examine the Likert-scale data obtained from 296 university students in Taiwan. In our RIDIT analytical results, respondents’ preferences are sorted in a descending importance. Of the examined attributes, “Cleanliness of rooms” is the attribute most prioritized by the students, followed by “Located in a safe neighborhood/feeling safe in the room,” and “Close to scenic area for meeting the trip requirement.” The attribute least prioritized by the students is “Interaction with other guests.” This analysis provides conclusions that differ from those obtained through commonly used techniques including the arithmetic average and exploratory factor analysis. The preference rankings indicate that managers should focus on the most prioritized service attributes and implement the necessary measures to enhance their service quality and maximize customer satisfaction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f5d4c1ee16274f8d1328c24fcf6db5b8c24698eb7e7a469cda5774b0f3e824e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
