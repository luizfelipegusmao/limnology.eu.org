{"title":"Mind the gap: Spatiotemporal patterns of airspace formation in duckweeds are regulated by hormones","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2480/7651146?rss=1","date":1713398400000,"content":"<span>The diversity of plant forms we see in nature is thanks to the adaptation of plant anatomy to many different environments and habitats. One of these adaptations is the aerenchyma, air spaces in plant leaves, shoots, and roots. These air spaces help facilitate gas conductivity, which is especially needed in waterlogged situations to facilitate oxygen transport from leaves to submerged roots. As such, aerenchyma formation can be a temporary adaptation to waterlogging in dryland species or a constitutive part of plant anatomy in wetland species (<a href=\"#kiae222-B2\">Evans 2003</a>). As a temporary adaptation, other than hypoxia under water submergence, it can also be activated in response to other stresses such as nutrient deficiency and drought, and is precisely regulated through mechanisms such as ethylene signalling (<a href=\"#kiae222-B2\">Evans 2003</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"b2e2ba2c5e688193b9859865baa08f570962af80f00bbb28c7acd4926a426969","category":"Environment"}
