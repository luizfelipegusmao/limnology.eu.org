{"title":"Beneficial role of amygdalin extracts against animal growth regulator Boldjan induced cardiac toxicity, injury and oxidative stress in male rats","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae042/7633998?rss=1","date":1711152000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Millions of individuals have used illicit anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), but the long-term cardiovascular associations of these drugs remain incompletely understood. Boldjan is AAS medication which is used in veterinary medicine and by young adults aiming to have a better appearance improving their self-esteem. Therefore; the objective of the current investigation was to examine any potential preventative effects of amygdalin extract against anabolic steroid Boldjan induced cardic toxicity, injury and oxidative stress in male rat. Forty adult male Wistar rats were classified into five groups (Gp1, Control Gp; Gp2, Amygdalin Gp in which rats treated with amygdalin (100 mg/kg body weight/day) daily for 2 weeks; Gp3, <span>Boldjan</span> Gp in which rats treated with <span>Boldjan</span> (10 mg/Kg BW/week) for 4 weeks; Gp4, <span>Boldjan</span> + Amygdalin). <span>Boldjan</span> induced a significant rises in serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase MB (CK MB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and very-low-density lipoprotein–cholesterol (VLDL-C), cardiac injury, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and a significant depletion in serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), cardiac reduced glutathione (GSH), Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (Cat) activities as compared to control Gp. In contrast, Amygdalin significantly reversed the <span>Boldjan</span> induced cardiac toxicity in post treated rats Gp (<span>Boldjan</span> + Amygdalin). Amygdalin could be an efficient preventive supplement for mitigating <span>Boldjan</span> induced cardiac toxicity, possibly via controlling oxidative stress events.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"b591e4ea4198a5bfbabef991769a0619e85886cf9a76f208318f600df49a7a02","category":"Environment"}
