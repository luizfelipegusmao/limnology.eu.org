In addition to inhibiting insect growth, they are endowed with several pharmacological properties including antimicrobial and antitumorigenic activity. However, their potential as immunomodulators remains unexplored. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether argentatins can modulate the function of the immune system. Human mesenchymal stem cells were treated with argentatins and the production of several anti- and proinflammatory cytokines was evaluated. The effect of argentatins on the polarization of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and macrophages was also assessed. Results demonstrated that argentatins can modulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the polarization of cellular phenotypes, including Th2 lymphocytes and M1 macrophages. These findings suggest that argentatins are promising therapeutic agents in autoimmune or allergic diseases, and open new perspectives for the investigation of argentatins in immune response and in the development of more targeted and effective immunomodulatory therapies.","author":"Aniela M.
