{"title":"Handheld lidar as a tool for characterizing wood‐rich river corridors","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4239?af=R","date":1709626003000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Wood accumulations influence geomorphic, hydraulic, and ecologic functions within a river corridor, but characterizing these accumulations presents challenges across a range of field and remote sensing methodologies. We evaluate the ability of handheld lidar scanners, specifically lidar-scanning capabilities of a fourth-generation iPad Pro, to collect three-dimensional wood accumulation data, which can be used to inform measurements of wood volume, porosity, complexity, and roughness. We discuss the potential and limitations of this novel methodology for river research and management. We found that handheld lidar presents a cost-effective input for data-processing workflows that field measurements of wood accumulation dimensions cannot as easily replicate including (1) a user-friendly means of data collection and visualization; (2) accurate comparisons of wood volume over time; (3) integration into workflows to measure porosity parameters; and (4) potential use in informing hydraulic and morphodynamic models. Consideration of study area constraints and intended use of scans are prerequisites to using handheld lidar as an effective tool. We identified some specific limitations of using handheld lidar scanners in wood-rich river corridors, including (1) scanners perform poorly when wood is under water or surrounded by dense vegetation; (2) scanners require physical access to areas of interest at distances less than 5 m; (3) scans need to be manually georeferenced; and (4) scans require manual measurements for any dimensional data, which still have associated user time and error. Handheld lidar as a scientific tool is rapidly developing and there is substantial room for expansion of applications, utilization, and advances in the use of this tool in river research and management.</p>","author":"Anna Marshall, \nRyan R.
