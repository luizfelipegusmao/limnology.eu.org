{"title":"Directional Vibro-Tactile Hazard Warnings for Drivers with Vision Impairments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0659/v1","date":1710177262000,"content":"Vision impairment may delay responses to hazards when driving. In a proof-of-concept driving simulator study, we evaluated a hazard warning device designed for vision impaired drivers. Three groups participated: 11 persons with central vision loss (CVL; median age 60 years), 12 with homonymous field loss (HFL; 52 years) and 11 with normal vision (NV; 60 years). CVL is characterised by impaired visual acuity and contrast sensitivity while HFL is a loss of vision in the same half of the visual field (blind side) in both eyes.  Participants completed drives with and without the device which gave a directional vibro-tactile warning for an approaching pedestrian hazard when collision risk exceeded a pre-defined threshold. Warnings significantly (p&lt; 0.001) reduced brake response times for CVL (∆= 0.54s) and HFL (∆= 0.30s), but not NV participants. For HFL participants, the reduction was greater (p = 0.02) for hazards on the blind (∆= 0.57s) than seeing side (∆= 0.10s). The warnings significantly reduced collision rates for CVL participants from 11 to 0% (all hazards) and for HFL participants from 30 to 1.7% (blind side hazards). Thus, hazard warnings may be beneficial in improving safety of vision impaired drivers; further research is warranted.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4da0e5bcf7c4e749ee117b3077640a930b5cfbbc500bee74ba481592568f7e20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
