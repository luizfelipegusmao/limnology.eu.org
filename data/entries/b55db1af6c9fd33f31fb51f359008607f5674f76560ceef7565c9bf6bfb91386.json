{"title":"Effects of Impurities and Deformations on Electronic Effective Mass in Quantum Revival Time within the Infinite Square Well","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0819/v1","date":1715595294000,"content":"Quantum revival phenomena, wherein the wave function of a quantum system periodically returns to its initial state after evolving in time, are investigated in this study. Focusing on electrons confined within a quantum box with an impurity, both weak and strong coupling regimes are explored, revealing intricate relationships between impurity parameters and temporal dynamics. The investigation considers the influence of impurity position, impurity strength, and external factors such as aluminum concentration, temperature, and hydrostatic pressure on classical periods and revival times. Through analytical derivations and graphical analyses, the study elucidates the sensitivity of quantum revivals to these parameters, providing valuable insights into the fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics. While no specific physical applications are discussed, the findings offer implications for quantum heat engines and other quantum-based technologies, emphasizing the importance of understanding quantum revivals in confined quantum systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b55db1af6c9fd33f31fb51f359008607f5674f76560ceef7565c9bf6bfb91386","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
