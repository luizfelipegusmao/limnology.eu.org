{"title":"Leaching thermodynamic of low-grade copper oxide ore from [(NH4)2SO4]-NH3-H2O solution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1568/v1","date":1719207431000,"content":"In this paper, a low-grade copper oxide ore with highly alkaline was treated. The thermodynamic model of CuO-(NH4)2SO4-NH3-H2O was established in the leaching system of tenorite (CuO) under the condition of double conservation of mass and charge. The fitting function of MATLAB and the diff and solve functions were used to calculate the optimal ammonia concentration and total copper ion concentration of tenorite under different ammonium sulfate concentrations. The effects of different ammonia-ammonium salt (ammonium sulphate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium chloride) solution on copper leaching rate were investigated. Results show that under the conditions of ammonia concentration of 1.2 mol/L, ammonia-ammonium ratio of 2:1 and liquid-solid ratio of 3:1, the copper leaching rate from the ammonium sulphate and ammonium chloride solution reaches 70%, slightly higher than that of ammonium carbonate. Therefore, ammonia ammonium sulfate system is selected to leach low-grade copper oxide due to its lower corrosion to the equipment than the chlorination system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10ad7706e2cede343c889e9f98e7563c720ced85a11dc7fdbb4336c9de80ba38","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
