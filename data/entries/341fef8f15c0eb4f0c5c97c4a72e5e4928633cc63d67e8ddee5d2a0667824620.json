{"title":"Chemical Synthesis of a Polyvinylpyrrolidone‐Capped Silver Nanoparticle and Its Antimicrobial Activity against Two Multidrug‐ResistantAeromonas Species","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/3641173?af=R","date":1679382000000,"content":"<p>This study investigated the antimicrobial activity of polyvinylpyrrolidone-capped silver nanoparticles (PVP-AgNPs) <i>in vitro</i> against two antibiotic-resistant isolates of <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i> and <i>A. caviae</i>. Solid crystal silver nanoparticles were synthesized by the chemical reduction approach employing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a neutral stabilizer, glucose as a reducing agent, and sodium hydroxide as a catalyst. The crystallinity and purity of the prepared PVP-AgNPs were investigated using the X-ray diffraction spectrometer (XRD). Transmission electron micrograph analysis demonstrated the formation of irregular spherical shapes PVP-AgNPs with average crystallite size diameters ranging from 5.07 to 9.74 nm. By phenotypic and gene sequence analysis, <i>A. hydrophila</i> and <i>A. caviae</i> isolates were identified from diseased Nile tilapia. Our findings showed that all <i>A. hydrophila</i> and <i>A. caviae</i> isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR) and showed resistance to four antimicrobial classes. The PVP-AgNPs displayed 15 mm and 14 mm clear inhibition zones for <i>A. hydrophila</i> and <i>A. caviae</i>, respectively. In addition, the minimum inhibitory concentrations for PVP-AgNPs were estimated to be 6.25 <i>μ</i>g/ml and 7.5 <i>μ</i>g/ml for <i>A. hydrophila</i> and <i>A. caviae</i>, respectively. The chemically synthesized PVP-AgNPs were found to possess a strong antimicrobial effect against <i>A. hydrophila</i> and <i>A. caviae</i> with the possibility to be used as a commercialized antimicrobial agent in the aquaculture industry.</p>","author":"Omnia A.
