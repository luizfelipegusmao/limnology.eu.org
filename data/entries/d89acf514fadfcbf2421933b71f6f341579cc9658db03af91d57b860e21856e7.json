A pilot ozonator based on a special high-frequency electric discharge has been developed for disinfection and cleaning of harmful microorganisms found in surface water. In order to conduct practical tests on scientific research work, special water was taken from the Ili floodplain and an examination of the water composition was carried out. According to the results of the examination, various painful microorganisms were found in the composition of the source water that do not meet the maximum permissible concentration (MPC). Effective economic indicators of ozone content (mg/l), contact time (t, minutes) and the like were determined for disinfection and removal of microorganisms from the water composition. In addition, an algorithm for theoretical calculations for the destruction of harmful microorganisms in 1m3 surface water was compiled and a mathematical model was given.</div>\n<h3>Keywords</h3>\n<p><span>Ozonator; ozone; surface water; water field; primary water; ozonated water; ozone content; decontamination process</span></p>\n<h3><strong>1. INTRODUCTION</strong></h3>\n<div>\n<p>The most effective and appropriate is the use of ozone for water purification and disinfection when using water sources that are heavily contaminated with microbiological indicators (Orlov, V.А., 1996). Ozone is used not only to destroy natural and anthropogenic organic pollutants, but also to neutralize the necessary harmful bactericidal microorganisms that chlorine-based reagents cannot remove (Alekseev et al., 2001; Draginsky et al., 2007).</p>\n<p>Ozonation has the following advantages over decontamination of water by chlorine, namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>high oxidizing potential of ozone, as a result of which the bactericidal effect of ozone in water is stronger than that of other chemical reagents;</li>\n<li>ozone affects not only the redox system of bacteria, but also directly on the protoplasm;</li>\n<li>ozone acts 15 – 20 times faster than chlorine. For example, while ozone at a dose of 0.45 mg/l kills the polio virus in 2 minutes, chlorine at a dose of 2 mg/l kills after 3 hours.</li>\n<li>the required amount of ozone is about 2.5 times less than chlorine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bactericidal effect of ozone is less dependent on the value of the pH = 6 – 10 range at a water temperature of 0 – 37OC. The effectiveness of the bactericidal effect of ozone is influenced by the presence in the composition of floating and dissolved organic substances, non-ferrous and chemical pollutants ( Draginsky et al., 2007).</p>\n<p>Improvement of surface water disinfection methods is currently being developed in the following main areas (Figure 1):</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"857\" height=\"253\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-01.jpg 857w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-01-300x89.jpg 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-01-768x227.jpg 768w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Water disinfection processes</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>Currently, methods of water disinfection using ozone and UV radiation are quite common in Europe and America (Percival, 1991; Smith and Clark, 1995). For this purpose, a pilot ozonator device was developed in the laboratory, based on a high-frequency electric discharge.</p>\n<h3><strong>2.MATERIALS AND METHODS.</strong></h3>\n<p>Disinfection methods are used to remove microorganisms and viruses from the water composition during the process. If the content of viruses and microorganisms is higher than the maximum permissible concentration (MPC), the water will be unsuitable for drinking, domestic use or industrial purposes. Therefore, it is imperative to disinfect the waters that carry out such infectious diseases (WHO, 1994; Alekseeva, 1986).</p>\n<p>Currently, tactics there are the most common methods of disinfection and disinfection using strong oxidants such as chlorine, sodium and calcium hypochlorite, ozone. Also in practice, a physical method is widely used – disinfection with ultraviolet rays. Table 1 below presents the results of the analysis of the use of various methods of water disinfection processes in foreign countries (Sehested et al., 1991; Leszczynski, 2013).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"504\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02-1024x504.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02-1024x504.jpg 1024w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02-300x148.jpg 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02-768x378.jpg 768w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02.jpg 1055w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>Ozone has a high redox potential – 2.07 V (for comparison: Cl2 -1.36 V, O2 – 1.23 V), which is the main reason for its activity in relation to various types of water pollution, including microorganisms (Orlov and Stroyizdat, 1984). In the absence of bromides, by-products are not formed in distilled water (Battino, 1981). In addition, ozone is a toxic and corrosive substance, so the exposure time for disinfection is very fast.</p>\n<p>Among the methods of water disinfection, according to foreign experience, the use of ozonator installations as one of the stages of water purification is increasing from year to year. For example, there are more than 1,200 ozonator plants in Europe and the United States, which use ozonation technology as one of the steps in water purification and decontamination processes (Sedlak David, 2011; Von Sonntag and Von Gunten, 2012).</p>\n<p>When using chlorine-containing substances and ozone in water treatment processes, you need to pay attention to the following important points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>water solubility of ozone;</li>\n<li>corrosive activity of disinfectant solutions on materials of water treatment stations;</li>\n<li>efficiency of inactivation of microorganisms when using various disinfectant solutions in working conditions;</li>\n<li>processing parameters of networks and water supply facilities;</li>\n<li>environmental impact;</li>\n<li>feasibility study of the application of the proposed substances and technology.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The advantages of different disinfectants and chemical oxidizers to compare the efficiency of killing bacteria and different viruses contained in water are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chlorine and chlorine dioxide;</li>\n<li>Ozone;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The properties and effectiveness of disinfection using UV light can be observed in Figure 2 below (Abdykadyrov et al., 2023).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"960\" height=\"632\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-03.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-03.jpg 960w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-03-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-03-768x506.jpg 768w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 2: </strong>Efficiency of surface water disinfection methods (Abdykadyrov et al., 2023).</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>During the process of decontamination and purification of water, ozone dissolves relatively more slowly than chlorine. To increase the solubility of ozone in water, the contact time and contact surface area must be increased. Or it is necessary to use special devices that ensure the intensive mixing of ozone with water. As a rule, the ozone-air mixture is dispersed and given in the form of small bubbles (0.1-1 mm). In scientific research works, some literature (Punmia, 1995) provides data on the solubility of ozone in water depending on temperature, as well as in the W. B. Kogan’s (Kogan, 1961) solubility handbook using the Bunsen coefficient. The conditions given in the definitions make it possible to theoretically predict the equilibrium concentration of ozone. However, the dissolution of ozone in natural water is influenced by many factors, such as the presence of oxidizing agents, the concentration of ozone in the gas mixture, pressure, the size of the gas bubbles created by the aerator, and a number of other factors are not taken into account in the basic formulas. Thus, (Romanovskii, 2015) experimental research work related to processing parameters such as processing time, gas mixture flow rate, ozone concentration in gas mixture, and liquid layer are considered in the following sections.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS.</strong></h3>\n<p>To assess the necessary parameters of the ozonator, an approach based on the assessment of the effect of a disinfectant in a water treatment reactor is often used – the Ct factor. Where C is the concentration of the disinfectant, t is the contact time (reduced microorganisms in order of their number). During the process of ozone disinfection of drinking water, it is usually taken 1.6 mg/l (taking into account the maintenance of a residual concentration of 0.4 mg/l for 4 minutes). Table 2 shows ozone disinfection values of various microorganisms up to 99% percent at pH = 6 – 7 (Draginsky, 2007).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05-1024x192.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05-1024x192.jpg 1024w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05-300x56.jpg 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05-768x144.jpg 768w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05.jpg 1057w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>As can be seen from the table, during the process of ozonation of water, it reacts to various mechanisms in the composition of water, including microorganisms, as well as processes of oxidation of heavy and light metals in the chemical composition of water, decomposition of organic compounds, i.e. fats.

ОН − – ions have a faster tendency to dissolve in self – water in the region of a value up to рН = 7 ÷ 10. Most often, at such pH values, the time of ozone propagation in water is taken into account as about 10 – 25 minutes (Orlov, 1996; Draginsky e2007 (Orlov, 1996; Draginsky et al., 2007).</p>\n<p>The solubility and decay rate of ozone in water depends on temperature, the active reaction of the medium and the salt content. With a decrease in temperature and an increase in PH, the solubility of ozone increases, while base salts reduce its solubility, while neutral salts increase the solubility of ozone (EPA, 1999). The rate of decay of ozone increases with increasing temperature, pH and oxidizing substances. It should be noted that the dissolution of ozone in water at different pH values has been cited in many studies (Gurol, and Singer, 1982; Olah, 1976 ), although the results of the kinetics of ozone decay are different their value under experimental conditions is completely different.</p>\n<p>Thus, it was found that the buffer additives used (phosphates, boric acid, etc.) are not indifferent to ozone and its decay products (Yoneda and Olah, 1977). They can also react with hydroxyl radicals, which are formed during the decomposition of ozone in water. In some scientific research papers, the mechanism of the chain reaction of ozone interaction with impurities in water is given (Yoneda et al., 1984). As for the dissolution of ozone in an acidic environment, research on this topic adequately demonstrates the increase in the reactivity of ozone in these scientific works (Jacquesy et al., 1997). The mechanism by which ozone interacts with organic compounds leads to the formation of protonated ozone, an intermediate product with very strong electrophilic properties in the presence of peroxide acids (Hoigne, 1983; Razumovsky, 1974). It is known that the O3 molecule in aqueous solutions interacts much more slowly with protonated types of compounds (Hoffman et al., 1995). Therefore, the specific acid catalysis of reactions with ozone is higher than with conventional ozone (Hoigne, 1983).</p>\n<p>As shown by studies to determine the kinetics of ozone decay by the height of the liquid column (Romanovskii et al., 2015). (in the experiment, water was used directly from the Ili Water Valley), about 96% percent of it decomposes in 20 minutes (Figure 3).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"621\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-10.jpg 621w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-10-300x223.jpg 300w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 3: </strong>Decomposition of dissolved ozone in water at the top of the column</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>One of the most important practical problems with the use of ozone in water disinfection and purification processes is the comparison of its corrosive activity with solutions of chlorine-containing substances.</p>\n<p><strong>3.2 Practical Testing of The Device.</strong></p>\n<p>For practical study and analysis of the process of disinfection and purification of surface water from harmful micro-organisms, a pilot ozonator based on an electric discharge was specially developed at the Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and space technologies of the Kazakh National Research Technical University named after K.

Water in the load made of this zeolite is cleaned mechanically in advance. The purified water passes through the activated carbon, adsorbed from toxic substances (4), and through a quartz filter, the color of the water is reduced, and it comes into contact with Ozone (8). Ozone is supplied to the tank (8) through the ozonator (7) using a compressor (6). After 30 minutes, ozonated water is filtered through a membrane filter (9) and sent to consumers. The residual ozone deposited on the surface of the tank is decomposed using a destructor (10) and released into the atmosphere. The general image of the upper-frequency corona discharge-based ozonator (7) can be seen in the figure below (Figure 5).Based on the results of Experimental Studies, a regression equation describing the concentration of ozone in water (Gv mg/dm3) was obtained from the studied parameters:<p></p>\n<p>Gv = 3,9436 – 27,2356·D + 0,0339·Gг + 0,0286·Т – 0,0456·Н + 0,0247·Q – 155.3858·D2–</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"460\" height=\"32\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-12.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-12.jpg 460w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-12-300x21.jpg 300w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>Where Gv is the ozone concentration in water, mg/dm3; D is the column diameter, m (D = 0,1 – 0,3 m); GG is the ozone concentration in the gas mixture, dm3/minute (Gg = 4 – 13 dm3/minute); T is the water saturation time, min (t = 0.5 – 10 minutes); H is the sampling height, M (H = 0 – 4 m); Q is the ozone – air mixture flow rate, dm3/min (Q = 3.3 – 700 dm3/min).Ozone has a higher efficiency compared to the chlorine-containing method of calcium hypochlorite and sodium hypochlorite.

The total number of microbes in water is 1 ml of Koe, CCB (100 ml of KOE), OCB (100 ml of KOE), coliphages (100 ml of BOE), Escherichia coli, slostridium sp., it was found that microbiological indicators such as rseudomonas fluorescens do not come to the size of the MPC. The results of the study of the effectiveness of the process of destruction of bacteria in water by ozone are presented in Tables 4 and 5 below.<p></p>\n<p>As can be seen in the table, it was found that as the amount of ozone increased by 4 – 13 DM3/minute, the content of TCB (100 ml of COE), OCB (100 ml of COE) and coliphages (100 ml of BOE) in water decreased. With an ozone content of about 13 DM3/minute, it can be seen that the water content of TKB, OCD and coliphages is destroyed by 100% percent (Figure 5).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<h3><strong>4. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSIONS</strong></h3>\n<p>The research investigated the use of locally available carbon-activated materials (i.e., OP) in water treatment with MB. The OP was prepared with two different materials: H3PO4 and H2SO4. Various researchers investigated the use of carbon-activated materials in treating water pollutants to find a more economical and eco-friendly approach using locally available materials (Ahmad et al., 2012; Hassan et al., 2020). The results were in line with those of researchers, where the adsorption improved noticeably. This result is attributed to the increase in porosity surface due to the loss of volatile matter. The results indicated clearly that using H3PO4 achieved better results than using H2SO4.</p>\n<p>The findings of this research confirmed the importance of particle size, which reflects the porous surface area. The results confirmed that for both activating agents, using a larger size would enhance the adsorption rate. Besides, the results showed that using H3PO4 would enhance the adsorption rate, regardless of the activating agent used. In addition, the results demonstrated clearly that increasing temperature would enhance the adsorption rate for both activating agents, especially when using the H3PO4 activating agent.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the pH results indicated a similar pattern, where the adsorption rate was higher when using the H3PO4 agent. However, increasing the pH value would enhance the adsorption noticeably for both agents, especially at pH 8.06.</p>\n<p>Finally, the results emphasized the importance of water purity, where distilled water achieved a higher adsorption rate in both agents, which is attributed to the dissolved minerals in spring water (e.g., Na, K, Li, Ca, and Ba), which compete with the pollutant on the surface of the adsorbent, leading to a decreased adsorption capacity of the selected pollutant. Regardless, the results confirmed the benefit of using H3PO4 over H2SO4, where higher adsorption rates were achieved when using H3PO4.</p>\n<p>The findings of this research contribute valuable insights into the potential of locally sourced OP as an alternative to CAC for water treatment. The notable adsorption capacities observed under specific conditions indicate the efficacy of this low-cost adsorbent in addressing water pollution, particularly in the removal of MB. The linear relationship between equilibrium concentration and adsorption for H3PO4-activated samples suggests a predictable and controllable adsorption process.</p>\n<p>This research represents a pioneering effort in exploring the potential of OP as an activated carbon source for water treatment, adding to the growing body of knowledge on low-cost adsorbents. The identified optimal conditions provide practical insights for the application of OP-AC in water purification technologies. However, further research is warranted to scale up the production process and assess the material’s long-term performance under real-world conditions. Overall, this study lays the foundation for the development of sustainable and cost-effective solutions for water treatment using locally available resources.</p>\n<h3><strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</strong></h3>\n<p>This research was financially supported by ABDUL HAMEED SHOMAN FOUNDATION, Deanship of Academic Research at The University of Jordan, and the Jordanian Higher Council for Science and Technology (HCST) under CYCLOLIVE PRIMA II projects.</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<h3><strong>REFERENCES</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ahmad, T., Danish, M., Rafatullah, M., Ghazali, A., Sulaiman, O., Hashim, R., and Ibrahim, M.
