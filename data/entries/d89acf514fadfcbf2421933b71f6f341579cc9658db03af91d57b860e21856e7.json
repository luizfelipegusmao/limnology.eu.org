A pilot ozonator based on a special high-frequency electric discharge has been developed for disinfection and cleaning of harmful microorganisms found in surface water. In order to conduct practical tests on scientific research work, special water was taken from the Ili floodplain and an examination of the water composition was carried out. According to the results of the examination, various painful microorganisms were found in the composition of the source water that do not meet the maximum permissible concentration (MPC). Effective economic indicators of ozone content (mg/l), contact time (t, minutes) and the like were determined for disinfection and removal of microorganisms from the water composition. In addition, an algorithm for theoretical calculations for the destruction of harmful microorganisms in 1m3 surface water was compiled and a mathematical model was given.</div>\n<h3>Keywords</h3>\n<p><span>Ozonator; ozone; surface water; water field; primary water; ozonated water; ozone content; decontamination process</span></p>\n<h3><strong>1. INTRODUCTION</strong></h3>\n<div>\n<p>The most effective and appropriate is the use of ozone for water purification and disinfection when using water sources that are heavily contaminated with microbiological indicators (Orlov, V.А., 1996). Ozone is used not only to destroy natural and anthropogenic organic pollutants, but also to neutralize the necessary harmful bactericidal microorganisms that chlorine-based reagents cannot remove (Alekseev et al., 2001; Draginsky et al., 2007).</p>\n<p>Ozonation has the following advantages over decontamination of water by chlorine, namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>high oxidizing potential of ozone, as a result of which the bactericidal effect of ozone in water is stronger than that of other chemical reagents;</li>\n<li>ozone affects not only the redox system of bacteria, but also directly on the protoplasm;</li>\n<li>ozone acts 15 – 20 times faster than chlorine. For example, while ozone at a dose of 0.45 mg/l kills the polio virus in 2 minutes, chlorine at a dose of 2 mg/l kills after 3 hours.</li>\n<li>the required amount of ozone is about 2.5 times less than chlorine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bactericidal effect of ozone is less dependent on the value of the pH = 6 – 10 range at a water temperature of 0 – 37OC. The effectiveness of the bactericidal effect of ozone is influenced by the presence in the composition of floating and dissolved organic substances, non-ferrous and chemical pollutants ( Draginsky et al., 2007).</p>\n<p>Improvement of surface water disinfection methods is currently being developed in the following main areas (Figure 1):</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"857\" height=\"253\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-01.jpg 857w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-01-300x89.jpg 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-01-768x227.jpg 768w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Water disinfection processes</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>Currently, methods of water disinfection using ozone and UV radiation are quite common in Europe and America (Percival, 1991; Smith and Clark, 1995). For this purpose, a pilot ozonator device was developed in the laboratory, based on a high-frequency electric discharge.</p>\n<h3><strong>2.MATERIALS AND METHODS.</strong></h3>\n<p>Disinfection methods are used to remove microorganisms and viruses from the water composition during the process. If the content of viruses and microorganisms is higher than the maximum permissible concentration (MPC), the water will be unsuitable for drinking, domestic use or industrial purposes. Therefore, it is imperative to disinfect the waters that carry out such infectious diseases (WHO, 1994; Alekseeva, 1986).</p>\n<p>Currently, tactics there are the most common methods of disinfection and disinfection using strong oxidants such as chlorine, sodium and calcium hypochlorite, ozone. Also in practice, a physical method is widely used – disinfection with ultraviolet rays. Table 1 below presents the results of the analysis of the use of various methods of water disinfection processes in foreign countries (Sehested et al., 1991; Leszczynski, 2013).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"504\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02-1024x504.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02-1024x504.jpg 1024w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02-300x148.jpg 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02-768x378.jpg 768w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02.jpg 1055w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>Ozone has a high redox potential – 2.07 V (for comparison: Cl2 -1.36 V, O2 – 1.23 V), which is the main reason for its activity in relation to various types of water pollution, including microorganisms (Orlov and Stroyizdat, 1984). In the absence of bromides, by-products are not formed in distilled water (Battino, 1981). In addition, ozone is a toxic and corrosive substance, so the exposure time for disinfection is very fast.</p>\n<p>Among the methods of water disinfection, according to foreign experience, the use of ozonator installations as one of the stages of water purification is increasing from year to year. For example, there are more than 1,200 ozonator plants in Europe and the United States, which use ozonation technology as one of the steps in water purification and decontamination processes (Sedlak David, 2011; Von Sonntag and Von Gunten, 2012).</p>\n<p>When using chlorine-containing substances and ozone in water treatment processes, you need to pay attention to the following important points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>water solubility of ozone;</li>\n<li>corrosive activity of disinfectant solutions on materials of water treatment stations;</li>\n<li>efficiency of inactivation of microorganisms when using various disinfectant solutions in working conditions;</li>\n<li>processing parameters of networks and water supply facilities;</li>\n<li>environmental impact;</li>\n<li>feasibility study of the application of the proposed substances and technology.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The advantages of different disinfectants and chemical oxidizers to compare the efficiency of killing bacteria and different viruses contained in water are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chlorine and chlorine dioxide;</li>\n<li>Ozone;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The properties and effectiveness of disinfection using UV light can be observed in Figure 2 below (Abdykadyrov et al., 2023).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"960\" height=\"632\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-03.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-03.jpg 960w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-03-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-03-768x506.jpg 768w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 2: </strong>Efficiency of surface water disinfection methods (Abdykadyrov et al., 2023).</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>During the process of decontamination and purification of water, ozone dissolves relatively more slowly than chlorine. To increase the solubility of ozone in water, the contact time and contact surface area must be increased. Or it is necessary to use special devices that ensure the intensive mixing of ozone with water. As a rule, the ozone-air mixture is dispersed and given in the form of small bubbles (0.1-1 mm). In scientific research works, some literature (Punmia, 1995) provides data on the solubility of ozone in water depending on temperature, as well as in the W. B. Kogan’s (Kogan, 1961) solubility handbook using the Bunsen coefficient. The conditions given in the definitions make it possible to theoretically predict the equilibrium concentration of ozone. However, the dissolution of ozone in natural water is influenced by many factors, such as the presence of oxidizing agents, the concentration of ozone in the gas mixture, pressure, the size of the gas bubbles created by the aerator, and a number of other factors are not taken into account in the basic formulas. Thus, (Romanovskii, 2015) experimental research work related to processing parameters such as processing time, gas mixture flow rate, ozone concentration in gas mixture, and liquid layer are considered in the following sections.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS.</strong></h3>\n<p>To assess the necessary parameters of the ozonator, an approach based on the assessment of the effect of a disinfectant in a water treatment reactor is often used – the Ct factor. Where C is the concentration of the disinfectant, t is the contact time (reduced microorganisms in order of their number). During the process of ozone disinfection of drinking water, it is usually taken 1.6 mg/l (taking into account the maintenance of a residual concentration of 0.4 mg/l for 4 minutes). Table 2 shows ozone disinfection values of various microorganisms up to 99% percent at pH = 6 – 7 (Draginsky, 2007).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05-1024x192.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05-1024x192.jpg 1024w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05-300x56.jpg 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05-768x144.jpg 768w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05.jpg 1057w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>As can be seen from the table, during the process of ozonation of water, it reacts to various mechanisms in the composition of water, including microorganisms, as well as processes of oxidation of heavy and light metals in the chemical composition of water, decomposition of organic compounds, i.e. fats.

ОН − – ions have a faster tendency to dissolve in self – water in the region of a value up to рН = 7 ÷ 10. Most often, at such pH values, the time of ozone propagation in water is taken into account as about 10 – 25 minutes (Orlov, 1996; Draginsky e2007 (Orlov, 1996; Draginsky et al., 2007).</p>\n<p>The solubility and decay rate of ozone in water depends on temperature, the active reaction of the medium and the salt content. With a decrease in temperature and an increase in PH, the solubility of ozone increases, while base salts reduce its solubility, while neutral salts increase the solubility of ozone (EPA, 1999). The rate of decay of ozone increases with increasing temperature, pH and oxidizing substances. It should be noted that the dissolution of ozone in water at different pH values has been cited in many studies (Gurol, and Singer, 1982; Olah, 1976 ), although the results of the kinetics of ozone decay are different their value under experimental conditions is completely different.</p>\n<p>Thus, it was found that the buffer additives used (phosphates, boric acid, etc.) are not indifferent to ozone and its decay products (Yoneda and Olah, 1977). They can also react with hydroxyl radicals, which are formed during the decomposition of ozone in water. In some scientific research papers, the mechanism of the chain reaction of ozone interaction with impurities in water is given (Yoneda et al., 1984). As for the dissolution of ozone in an acidic environment, research on this topic adequately demonstrates the increase in the reactivity of ozone in these scientific works (Jacquesy et al., 1997). The mechanism by which ozone interacts with organic compounds leads to the formation of protonated ozone, an intermediate product with very strong electrophilic properties in the presence of peroxide acids (Hoigne, 1983; Razumovsky, 1974). It is known that the O3 molecule in aqueous solutions interacts much more slowly with protonated types of compounds (Hoffman et al., 1995). Therefore, the specific acid catalysis of reactions with ozone is higher than with conventional ozone (Hoigne, 1983).</p>\n<p>As shown by studies to determine the kinetics of ozone decay by the height of the liquid column (Romanovskii et al., 2015). (in the experiment, water was used directly from the Ili Water Valley), about 96% percent of it decomposes in 20 minutes (Figure 3).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"621\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-10.jpg 621w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-10-300x223.jpg 300w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 3: </strong>Decomposition of dissolved ozone in water at the top of the column</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>One of the most important practical problems with the use of ozone in water disinfection and purification processes is the comparison of its corrosive activity with solutions of chlorine-containing substances.</p>\n<p><strong>3.2 Practical Testing of The Device.</strong></p>\n<p>For practical study and analysis of the process of disinfection and purification of surface water from harmful micro-organisms, a pilot ozonator based on an electric discharge was specially developed at the Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and space technologies of the Kazakh National Research Technical University named after K.

Water in the load made of this zeolite is cleaned mechanically in advance. The purified water passes through the activated carbon, adsorbed from toxic substances (4), and through a quartz filter, the color of the water is reduced, and it comes into contact with Ozone (8). Ozone is supplied to the tank (8) through the ozonator (7) using a compressor (6). After 30 minutes, ozonated water is filtered through a membrane filter (9) and sent to consumers. The residual ozone deposited on the surface of the tank is decomposed using a destructor (10) and released into the atmosphere.

To quickly check the sanitary condition of Water Treatment Systems, a Bacteriological Analysis of water is carried out, in which dynamic values are taken into account in the first place.Also, the analysis is often used when it is necessary to quickly check the operation of disinfection and water treatment systems. To carry out this procedure, not their absolute indicators are used, but the dynamics of values at certain points of the selected water samples. Comparison of the total number of microbes installed at a temperature of 22 and 37 degrees allows you to determine the state of the processes of self – purification of natural reservoirs. In the course of scientific research, according to the results of laboratory examination, the total number of microbes in the surface water of the Ili floodplain – 200 (1 ml of Koe 200mg/l) was met (Table 4).

If the concentration of ozone in water is higher than 100 mg/dm3, the recommended treatment time of at least 5-10 minutes is sufficient. In experimental conditions, it can be seen that the CT criterion for active chlorine is several times less than for ozone.However, in water that has passed the entire complex of classical treatment plants, including water disinfection, after the decomposition of ozone, there is an increase in the activity of bacteria and an increase in their number. It has been observed that under the influence of ozone, the amount of biodegradable compounds increases as a result of the destruction of organic matter in the water. For the same reason, it promotes the re-growth of microorganisms in the water supply network. Therefore, when transporting water over long distances, it is correct to disinfect with reagents containing ozone and additional chlorine (chlorine, chloramines, chlorine dioxide) (Abdykadyrov et al., 2023).</p>\n<p>In order to evaluate and compare the use of chlorine-containing substances and ozone in water treatment processes, it is necessary to first analyze and consider methods for assessing their costs and negative impact on the environment. For example, it is necessary to conduct an analysis on disinfection technologies at water supply facilities.</p>\n<p>Mathematical model of the technological process. The total number of harmful microbes in water is 1 ml of Koe, CCB (100 ml of COE), OCB (100 ml of COE), coliphages (100 ml of BOE), Escherichia coli, slostridium sp. special programs Mathcad and SMath Solver were used to create a mathematical model of the process of destruction of microbiological bacteria and microorganisms, such as rseudomonas fluorescens [28,29].

DISCUSSION OF RESEARCH WORK IN TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT.</strong></h3>\n<p>A comparative analysis of the properties of the main oxidants, which are often used in production, was carried out on the process of decontamination and purification of surface water from harmful micro-organisms. A comparative analysis of the corrosive activity of chlorine – containing disinfectant solutions, such as sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, chloramine with an active chlorine concentration of 50, 100 and 150 mg/dm3, as well as a saturated solution of ozone in water, was carried out.</p>\n<p>The research was carried out by gravimetric and indirect electrochemical methods. In the above scientific works, it was found that sodium hypochlorite has the highest oxidative activity of a saturated solution of ozone in water compared to chlorine-containing disinfectant solutions. Therefore, it is noted that, for example, in the processes of disinfection of water supply facilities, there is a significant reduction in ozone treatment time and a significantly lower corrosion mass index compared to chlorine-containing reagents.</p>\n<p>According to the scientific research work, the categories of ozone effects on the environment (carcinogenic, effects on the respiratory organs, ozone depletion, ecotoxicity to water and land resources, etc.) were identified. The comparative results of various disinfectants in the category of exposure, except ozone, which are currently used in water management, were discussed (Figure 11).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"525\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-26.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-26.jpg 624w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-26-300x252.jpg 300w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 11: </strong>Comparative results of various disinfectant oxidants by category of action</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>On the graph, it can be observed that the most dangerous for the environment and humanity is calcium hypochlorite, a disinfectant with chlorine.The research paper also presents the results of a comparison of three strong decontamination methods such as calcium hypochlorite, sodium hypochlorite and ozone in terms of capital and current costs between 2013 and 2023 (figure 12,13).</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"439\" height=\"286\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-27.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-27.jpg 439w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-27-300x195.jpg 300w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 12: </strong>Comparison of the three selected methods of disinfection by Capital and current costs without taking into account the time factor</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"472\" height=\"286\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-28.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-28.jpg 472w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-28-300x182.jpg 300w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 13: </strong>Installation costs between 2013 and 2023</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>When calculating the sum of costs during the general technological process, the following values should be taken into account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cost of raw materials and materials;</li>\n<li>salary expenses;</li>\n<li>depreciation charges;</li>\n<li>cost of technological energy;</li>\n<li>equipment maintenance cost;</li>\n<li>costs of current equipment repairs;</li>\n<li>costs for maintaining the working area;</li>\n<li>the cost of moving the unit to the processing site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taking into account these issues, a comparison of current cost items for each version of the disinfectant was considered.</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"619\" height=\"321\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-29.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-29.jpg 619w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-29-300x156.jpg 300w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 14: </strong>Comparison of three selected disinfection methods by current costs</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>According to the results of the calculation of technical and economic indicators, disinfection technology using ozone is more economical than using disinfectant solutions containing chlorine. In general, ozone technology has a lot of capital costs, and current costs are very small. At the same time, the largest share of current costs when using chlorine – containing reagents is the cost of raw materials and materials, and when using ozone-depreciation costs.Among the considered options, the most effective chlorine-containing reagents are sodium hypochlorite. However, if we compare chlorine-containing reagents with ozone, ozone technology is the most effective. It can be noted that the use of ozone facilitates the process, improves the efficiency of disinfection, reduces the processing time, reduces the corrosive effect on metal parts of water pipes and is environmentally safe. Another feature of ozone is that water does not contain residual ozone, such as chlorine ozone, which decomposes into oxygen in water for a short time.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. CONCLUSIONS</strong></h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In order to study the process of disinfection and purification of surface water from harmful micro-organisms, the Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and space technologies of the Kazakh National Research Technical University named after K. I. Satpayev developed a pilot ozonator installation based on a special electric discharge. For practical testing of the plant, the main advantages of ozone in comparison with other oxidizing agents were revealed when performing ozonation work with the removal of water from the Ili floodplain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>During the decontamination process, it was found to be a stronger oxidizing agent than chlorine. For example, water has been found to oxidize and clean chemical pollutants in addition to micro-organisms. In particular, the effectiveness of color, smell, taste, removal of iron, manganese, phenols, petroleum products, surfactants was noted;</li>\n<li>High biocidal activity, including the effect against viruses and cysts, and microbiological indicators found in water, including the complete disappearance of thermotolerant coliform bacteria, in general coliform bacteria, were found;</li>\n<li>It has been found to improve the efficiency of filter and coagulation work during water treatment work;</li>\n<li>The proposed design simplicity of the ozonator installation based on a pilot electric discharge and an automation system for the process of water disinfection have been created;</li>\n<li>The main feature of the device was found to reduce the harmful effect of drinking water on human health in sanitary and hygienic conditions;</li>\n<li>It was found that the process of ozone purification and disinfection of water in surface reservoirs and water areas, which are subject to environmental problems, does not have a negative impact on the environment;</li>\n<li>It was found that there are no compounds such as indirectly toxic organochlorine reaction products.</li>\n<li>Scientific results on research work were made on a pilot ozonator installation based on an electric discharge. Scientific and practical research work was carried out in 2018-2023 at the training and drilling training ground of the Kazakh National Research Technical University named after K. I. Satpayev.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<h3><strong>REFERENCES</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Abdykadyrov, A., Marxuly, S., Kuttybayeva, A., Almuratova, N., Yermekbayev, M., Ibekeyev, S., and Bagdollauly, Y., 2023.
