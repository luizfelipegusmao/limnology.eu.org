A pilot ozonator based on a special high-frequency electric discharge has been developed for disinfection and cleaning of harmful microorganisms found in surface water. In order to conduct practical tests on scientific research work, special water was taken from the Ili floodplain and an examination of the water composition was carried out. According to the results of the examination, various painful microorganisms were found in the composition of the source water that do not meet the maximum permissible concentration (MPC). Effective economic indicators of ozone content (mg/l), contact time (t, minutes) and the like were determined for disinfection and removal of microorganisms from the water composition. In addition, an algorithm for theoretical calculations for the destruction of harmful microorganisms in 1m3 surface water was compiled and a mathematical model was given.</div>\n<h3>Keywords</h3>\n<p><span>Ozonator; ozone; surface water; water field; primary water; ozonated water; ozone content; decontamination process</span></p>\n<h3><strong>1. INTRODUCTION</strong></h3>\n<div>\n<p>The most effective and appropriate is the use of ozone for water purification and disinfection when using water sources that are heavily contaminated with microbiological indicators (Orlov, V.А., 1996). Ozone is used not only to destroy natural and anthropogenic organic pollutants, but also to neutralize the necessary harmful bactericidal microorganisms that chlorine-based reagents cannot remove (Alekseev et al., 2001; Draginsky et al., 2007).</p>\n<p>Ozonation has the following advantages over decontamination of water by chlorine, namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>high oxidizing potential of ozone, as a result of which the bactericidal effect of ozone in water is stronger than that of other chemical reagents;</li>\n<li>ozone affects not only the redox system of bacteria, but also directly on the protoplasm;</li>\n<li>ozone acts 15 – 20 times faster than chlorine. For example, while ozone at a dose of 0.45 mg/l kills the polio virus in 2 minutes, chlorine at a dose of 2 mg/l kills after 3 hours.</li>\n<li>the required amount of ozone is about 2.5 times less than chlorine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bactericidal effect of ozone is less dependent on the value of the pH = 6 – 10 range at a water temperature of 0 – 37OC. The effectiveness of the bactericidal effect of ozone is influenced by the presence in the composition of floating and dissolved organic substances, non-ferrous and chemical pollutants ( Draginsky et al., 2007).</p>\n<p>Improvement of surface water disinfection methods is currently being developed in the following main areas (Figure 1):</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"857\" height=\"253\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-01.jpg 857w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-01-300x89.jpg 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-01-768x227.jpg 768w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Water disinfection processes</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>Currently, methods of water disinfection using ozone and UV radiation are quite common in Europe and America (Percival, 1991; Smith and Clark, 1995). For this purpose, a pilot ozonator device was developed in the laboratory, based on a high-frequency electric discharge.</p>\n<h3><strong>2.MATERIALS AND METHODS.</strong></h3>\n<p>Disinfection methods are used to remove microorganisms and viruses from the water composition during the process. If the content of viruses and microorganisms is higher than the maximum permissible concentration (MPC), the water will be unsuitable for drinking, domestic use or industrial purposes. Therefore, it is imperative to disinfect the waters that carry out such infectious diseases (WHO, 1994; Alekseeva, 1986).</p>\n<p>Currently, tactics there are the most common methods of disinfection and disinfection using strong oxidants such as chlorine, sodium and calcium hypochlorite, ozone. Also in practice, a physical method is widely used – disinfection with ultraviolet rays. Table 1 below presents the results of the analysis of the use of various methods of water disinfection processes in foreign countries (Sehested et al., 1991; Leszczynski, 2013).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"504\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02-1024x504.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02-1024x504.jpg 1024w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02-300x148.jpg 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02-768x378.jpg 768w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-02.jpg 1055w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>Ozone has a high redox potential – 2.07 V (for comparison: Cl2 -1.36 V, O2 – 1.23 V), which is the main reason for its activity in relation to various types of water pollution, including microorganisms (Orlov and Stroyizdat, 1984). In the absence of bromides, by-products are not formed in distilled water (Battino, 1981). In addition, ozone is a toxic and corrosive substance, so the exposure time for disinfection is very fast.</p>\n<p>Among the methods of water disinfection, according to foreign experience, the use of ozonator installations as one of the stages of water purification is increasing from year to year. For example, there are more than 1,200 ozonator plants in Europe and the United States, which use ozonation technology as one of the steps in water purification and decontamination processes (Sedlak David, 2011; Von Sonntag and Von Gunten, 2012).</p>\n<p>When using chlorine-containing substances and ozone in water treatment processes, you need to pay attention to the following important points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>water solubility of ozone;</li>\n<li>corrosive activity of disinfectant solutions on materials of water treatment stations;</li>\n<li>efficiency of inactivation of microorganisms when using various disinfectant solutions in working conditions;</li>\n<li>processing parameters of networks and water supply facilities;</li>\n<li>environmental impact;</li>\n<li>feasibility study of the application of the proposed substances and technology.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The advantages of different disinfectants and chemical oxidizers to compare the efficiency of killing bacteria and different viruses contained in water are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chlorine and chlorine dioxide;</li>\n<li>Ozone;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The properties and effectiveness of disinfection using UV light can be observed in Figure 2 below (Abdykadyrov et al., 2023).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"960\" height=\"632\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-03.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-03.jpg 960w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-03-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-03-768x506.jpg 768w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 2: </strong>Efficiency of surface water disinfection methods (Abdykadyrov et al., 2023).</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>During the process of decontamination and purification of water, ozone dissolves relatively more slowly than chlorine. To increase the solubility of ozone in water, the contact time and contact surface area must be increased. Or it is necessary to use special devices that ensure the intensive mixing of ozone with water. As a rule, the ozone-air mixture is dispersed and given in the form of small bubbles (0.1-1 mm). In scientific research works, some literature (Punmia, 1995) provides data on the solubility of ozone in water depending on temperature, as well as in the W. B. Kogan’s (Kogan, 1961) solubility handbook using the Bunsen coefficient. The conditions given in the definitions make it possible to theoretically predict the equilibrium concentration of ozone. However, the dissolution of ozone in natural water is influenced by many factors, such as the presence of oxidizing agents, the concentration of ozone in the gas mixture, pressure, the size of the gas bubbles created by the aerator, and a number of other factors are not taken into account in the basic formulas. Thus, (Romanovskii, 2015) experimental research work related to processing parameters such as processing time, gas mixture flow rate, ozone concentration in gas mixture, and liquid layer are considered in the following sections.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS.</strong></h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To assess the necessary parameters of the ozonator, an approach based on the assessment of the effect of a disinfectant in a water treatment reactor is often used – the Ct factor. Where C is the concentration of the disinfectant, t is the contact time (reduced microorganisms in order of their number). During the process of ozone disinfection of drinking water, it is usually taken 1.6 mg/l (taking into account the maintenance of a residual concentration of 0.4 mg/l for 4 minutes). Table 2 shows ozone disinfection values of various microorganisms up to 99% percent at pH = 6 – 7 (Draginsky, 2007).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05-1024x192.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05-1024x192.jpg 1024w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05-300x56.jpg 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05-768x144.jpg 768w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4wcm2024-420-429-05.jpg 1057w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>As can be seen from the table, during the process of ozonation of water, it reacts to various mechanisms in the composition of water, including microorganisms, as well as processes of oxidation of heavy and light metals in the chemical composition of water, decomposition of organic compounds, i.e. fats. Water destroys microbacteria, oxidizing the chemical elements it contains. Ozonation of water has the following advantages over chlorination:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>as a result of the high oxidizing potential of ozone, the bactericidal effect in water is stronger than that of other chemical reagents;</li>\n<li>ozone affects not only the redox system of bacteria, but also directly on the protoplasm;</li>\n<li>ozone acts 15 – 20 times faster than chlorine.

These two processes occur simultaneously and depend on the temperature of the water, in the pH environment, and the types of ions dissolved by the Ionic force.</p>\n<p>In general, the rate of ozone propagation in water can be written as(Draginsky et al., 2007).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<h3><strong>4. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSIONS</strong></h3>\n<p>The research investigated the use of locally available carbon-activated materials (i.e., OP) in water treatment with MB. The OP was prepared with two different materials: H3PO4 and H2SO4. Various researchers investigated the use of carbon-activated materials in treating water pollutants to find a more economical and eco-friendly approach using locally available materials (Ahmad et al., 2012; Hassan et al., 2020). The results were in line with those of researchers, where the adsorption improved noticeably. This result is attributed to the increase in porosity surface due to the loss of volatile matter. The results indicated clearly that using H3PO4 achieved better results than using H2SO4.</p>\n<p>The findings of this research confirmed the importance of particle size, which reflects the porous surface area. The results confirmed that for both activating agents, using a larger size would enhance the adsorption rate. Besides, the results showed that using H3PO4 would enhance the adsorption rate, regardless of the activating agent used. In addition, the results demonstrated clearly that increasing temperature would enhance the adsorption rate for both activating agents, especially when using the H3PO4 activating agent.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the pH results indicated a similar pattern, where the adsorption rate was higher when using the H3PO4 agent. However, increasing the pH value would enhance the adsorption noticeably for both agents, especially at pH 8.06.</p>\n<p>Finally, the results emphasized the importance of water purity, where distilled water achieved a higher adsorption rate in both agents, which is attributed to the dissolved minerals in spring water (e.g., Na, K, Li, Ca, and Ba), which compete with the pollutant on the surface of the adsorbent, leading to a decreased adsorption capacity of the selected pollutant. Regardless, the results confirmed the benefit of using H3PO4 over H2SO4, where higher adsorption rates were achieved when using H3PO4.</p>\n<p>The findings of this research contribute valuable insights into the potential of locally sourced OP as an alternative to CAC for water treatment. The notable adsorption capacities observed under specific conditions indicate the efficacy of this low-cost adsorbent in addressing water pollution, particularly in the removal of MB. The linear relationship between equilibrium concentration and adsorption for H3PO4-activated samples suggests a predictable and controllable adsorption process.</p>\n<p>This research represents a pioneering effort in exploring the potential of OP as an activated carbon source for water treatment, adding to the growing body of knowledge on low-cost adsorbents. The identified optimal conditions provide practical insights for the application of OP-AC in water purification technologies. However, further research is warranted to scale up the production process and assess the material’s long-term performance under real-world conditions. Overall, this study lays the foundation for the development of sustainable and cost-effective solutions for water treatment using locally available resources.</p>\n<h3><strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</strong></h3>\n<p>This research was financially supported by ABDUL HAMEED SHOMAN FOUNDATION, Deanship of Academic Research at The University of Jordan, and the Jordanian Higher Council for Science and Technology (HCST) under CYCLOLIVE PRIMA II projects.</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<h3><strong>REFERENCES</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ahmad, T., Danish, M., Rafatullah, M., Ghazali, A., Sulaiman, O., Hashim, R., and Ibrahim, M.
