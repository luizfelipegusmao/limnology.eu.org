{"title":"Changes in the Transcriptome Profile in Young Chickens after Infection with LaSota Newcastle Disease Virus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0697/v1","date":1712728726000,"content":"Understanding gene expression changes in chicks after vaccination against Newcastle Disease (ND) can reveal vaccine biomarkers. There is limited data on chicksâ€™ early immune response after ND vaccination. Two trials aimed into this knowledge gap. In experiment one, forty-two 13 days-old specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks were used. Harderian glands (Hg) and tracheas (Tc) from five birds per group were sampled at 12, 24, and 48 hours post-vaccination (hpv) to evaluate the gene transcription levels by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and RT-qPCR. Results of RNA-seq were compared by glmFTest, while results of RT-qPCR were compared by t-test. With RNA-seq, significant up-regulation of interferon related genes along with JAK-STAT signaling pathways regulation was observed in the Hg at 24- hpv. None of the DEGs identified by RNA-seq were positive for RT-qPCR. Experiment 2 used one-hundred and twelve SPF and commercial chickens at 1 day-old and 14 days-old. Only the commercial birds had maternal antibodies for NDV. By RNA-seq, twenty core DEGs associated with innate immunity and viral genome replication inhibition were identified. Genes previously unlinked to NDV response, such as USP41, were identified. This research present genes with potential as immunity biomarkers for vaccines, yet further investigation is needed to correlate the core gene expression with viral shedding post-vaccination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f37e83162d484c9a8af862b01979632e0e8236a6cae43099b85ce453f2850a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
