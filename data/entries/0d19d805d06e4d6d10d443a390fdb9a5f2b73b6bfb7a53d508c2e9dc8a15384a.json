{"title":"Analysis of Livestock Tick Distribution and Host Preferences Based on Sex Ratio in Tehran Province","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0261/v1","date":1717575119000,"content":"Ticks are one of the most dominant forced ectoparasites of vertebrates, belonging to the arthropods, which transmit pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites to humans and animals in Iran and worldwide. Given that, sex ratio factors can affect the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases, this study aimed to identify and determine the ticks' sex ratio and host type (camels, sheep, cattle, dogs, chickens, and pigeons) in different areas of Tehran province. This descriptive cross-sectional study took samples from different animal body parts in four seasons from 20 villages in 2019, in which 685 hard ticks and 121 soft ticks were caught from 1623 studied livestock and poultry. Regarding sex segregation among all caught ticks, 42.01% were male, and 57.99% were female. It is noteworthy that in both mountain and plain environments, R. sanguineus species of hard ticks had the most elevated sex ratio. Most ticks were collected from sheep hosts with 60.04% and the lowest from cattle hosts with 0.62% in tick infestation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d19d805d06e4d6d10d443a390fdb9a5f2b73b6bfb7a53d508c2e9dc8a15384a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
