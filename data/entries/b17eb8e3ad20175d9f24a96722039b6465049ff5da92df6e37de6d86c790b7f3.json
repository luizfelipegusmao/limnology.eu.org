{"title":"Systematic Implications of Palynomorph Diversity Using Microscopic Trends Among Asteraceous Flora From the Drylands of Baluchistan, Pakistan","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/3/594/7683459?rss=1","date":1716854400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pollen micromorphological traits with taxonomic implications are first reported from the study area for 50 Asteraceous taxa belonging to nine tribes. Cichorieae (21 taxa), Cardueae (11 taxa), Inuleae (six taxa), and Anthemideae (four taxa) are the leading tribes. The research included <span>Cousinia haeckeliae</span>, <span>Himalaiella afghana, Pterachaenia stewartii</span> (endemic to Afghanistan and Pakistan), and <span>Xylanthemum macropodum</span> (endemic to Baluchistan). Light and scanning electron microscopy were employed for the visualization of pollen photomicrographs. The data was analyzed statistically via SPSS, PAST, and Origin. Significant diagnostic qualitative and quantitative palynological traits were explored for discrimination down to the species level within the tribes. All the investigated taxa possessed radial symmetry, isopolarity, and monad form (characters for distinction at the subdivision level). The aperture types were trizonocolporate, tetrazonocolporate, and tricolporate with number position and character (NPC) formulas N<sub>3</sub>P<sub>4</sub>C<sub>5</sub>, N<sub>4</sub>P<sub>4</sub>C<sub>5</sub>, and N<sub>3</sub>P<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3.</sub> Goniotreme, peritreme, and ptychotreme types of amb were recognized. Echinate, echinate lophate, scabrate, and gemmate sculpturing were present with and without perforated surface patterns. Variations in the shapes in polar and equatorial views and lacuna shapes further assisted the separation of taxa. The observed shape classes were perprolate, prolate spheroidal, prolate, subprolate, oblate spheroidal, suboblate, and oblate. Principal component analysis, correlation, standard probability plots, and ridge line paired features plot for quantitative variables determined the positive correlation between the length and width of colpi in equatorial and polar view with polar axis and equatorial diameter and number of spines between colpi with the number of spines per pollen. The number of spines per pollen was negatively correlated with the width and length of colpi in the polar view. Multiple sample analysis of variance (ANOVA) concluded that a high statistically significant difference exists among the means of analyzed traits. The examined qualitative and quantitative palynological traits revealed noticeable variations, thus providing the source for species discrimination in Asteraceous tribes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b17eb8e3ad20175d9f24a96722039b6465049ff5da92df6e37de6d86c790b7f3","category":"Environment"}
