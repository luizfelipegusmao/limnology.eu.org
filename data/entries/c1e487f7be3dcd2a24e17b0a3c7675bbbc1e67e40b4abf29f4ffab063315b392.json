{"title":"Thermal phenomena and size effects of Mg powder in combustion process","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310185","date":1726495200000,"content":"<p>by Ki-Hun Nam, Jung Kyu Park, Jun-Sik Lee</p>\r\n\r\nMagnesium is a combustible metal that poses various safety risks, including fires and explosions. However, there are limited safety measures available to prevent and respond to potential fires and explosion incidents in the metal industry. In this study, the combustion process of Mg fires was closely examined using infrared thermal imaging, focusing on the effects of Mg powder size. For the experiment, Mg powder was burned by increasing the temperature to approximately 967.4 K using an ignition unit and controller equipped with a tungsten heater. Moreover, combustion velocity measurement experiments for Mg particle sizes of 75, 100, and 150 <i>μ</i>m were conducted using the combustion velocity measurement device presented in the NFPA 484 standard. On combustion of Mg, flames are observed; smoke is emitted as demonstrated by thermal and flow visualization experiments. The combustion velocity measurement experiment results demonstrated that the greater the slope value (combustion velocity) for the combustion length over time, the faster is the combustion velocity, with the 75 <i>μ</i>m particle size having the fastest combustion velocity. The results of this experiment can be utilized as references for Mg fire control design and to gain a better understanding of the scope of smoke and fire hazard investigation measures.","author":"Ki-Hun Nam","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c1e487f7be3dcd2a24e17b0a3c7675bbbc1e67e40b4abf29f4ffab063315b392","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
