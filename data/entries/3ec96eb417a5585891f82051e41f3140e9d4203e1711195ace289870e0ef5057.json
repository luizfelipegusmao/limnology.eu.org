{"title":"Solving the Hubble Tension Using the Union2 Supernova Database","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0421/v1","date":1712299256000,"content":"We demonstrate how a rigorous mathematical approach can be used to extract a current CMB temperature of 2.7276 ±0.0723 K from the 580 type Ia supernova data points in the Union2 database. Using redshift formula: z = Sqrt(Rh/R_t) − 1, incorporated into our new CMB redshift prediction redshift formula, we find that the above current CMB temperature value is a remarkably good match for this particular data set. In addition, we can alternatively start out with the measured current CMB temperature and extract the Hubble constant from all 580 supernovae. We then get an estimated Hubble constant of H0 = 66.8711+0.0019 km/s/Mpc when using the CMB temperature from the recent Dhal et al study [1] in combination with redshifts from all 580 supernovae. Furthermore, we get an estimated Hubble constant value of H_0 = 66.8943+0.0287 km/s/Mpc when using the CMB temperature measured by Fixsen [2]. In summary, our simple model essentially perfectly matches all 580 type Ia supernova redshifts while extracting H_0 or T_0 values. The Hubble constant we extract by this method fits very well with the Hubble constant extracted from the CMB by other studies. We believe that our new approach likely solves the Hubble tension problem, at least inside R_h = ct  cosmology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ec96eb417a5585891f82051e41f3140e9d4203e1711195ace289870e0ef5057","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
