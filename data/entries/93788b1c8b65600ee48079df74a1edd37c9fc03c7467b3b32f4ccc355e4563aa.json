{"title":"The Role of Multigene Panel Next-Generation Sequencing Techniques in Managing Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0432/v1","date":1715168095000,"content":"The efficacy and cost-effectivness of Multigene Panel Next-Generation Sequencing\n(NGS) in directing patients towards genomically matched therapies remains uncertain. This study\ninvestigated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients who underwent NGS analysis on\nformalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples. Data from 179 patients were analyzed, revealing\nno mutations in 39 patients (21.8%), one mutation in 83 patients (46.4%), and two or more\nmutations in 57 patients (31.8%). KRAS mutations were found in 87 patients (48.6%), including\nKRAS G12C mutations in 5 patients (2.8%), PIK3CA mutations in 40 patients (22.4%), BRAF\nmutations in 26 patients (14.5%). Less common mutations were identified: ERBB2 in 5 patients\n(2.8%) and SMO in 4 patients (2.2%). Additionally, MAP2K1, CTNNB1, and MYC were mutated in\n3 patients (2.4%). Two mutations (1.1%) were observed in ERBB3, RAF1, MTOR, JAK1, and\nFGFR2. No significant survival differences were observed based on mutation numbers. 40% of\npatients had druggable molecular alterations, but only 1.1% received genomically guided\ntreatment, suggesting limited application in standard practice. Despite this, expanded gene panel\ntesting can identify actionable mutations, aiding personalized treatment strategies in metastatic\nCRC, although current eligibility for biomarker-guided trials remains limited.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93788b1c8b65600ee48079df74a1edd37c9fc03c7467b3b32f4ccc355e4563aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
