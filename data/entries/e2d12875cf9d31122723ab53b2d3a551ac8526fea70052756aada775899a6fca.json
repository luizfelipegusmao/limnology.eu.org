A comparative analysis of angular velocity estimates using the Boer formula, the derivative of the induction vector of the Earth's magnetic field and direct measurements of the components of the angular velocity vector using a gyroscopic sensor for the ISOI small spacecraft (SXC3-219) is carried out. The results obtained make it possible to investigate the accuracy of estimates of the angular velocity of a small spacecraft in various ways to improve the quality of its target tasks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e2d12875cf9d31122723ab53b2d3a551ac8526fea70052756aada775899a6fca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
