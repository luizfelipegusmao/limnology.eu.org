{"title":"A Literature Survey on Performance Enhancement for Very-High-Cycle Fatigue of Additively Manufactured Titanium Alloys","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0014/v1","date":1722503048000,"content":"Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing is a promising industrial technology that enables rapid prototyping of complex configurations. Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) is one of the most popular AM techniques for metallic materials. Until today, only a few metals and alloys are available for AM, e.g. titanium alloys, the most common of which is Ti-6Al-4V. After optimization of the PBF parameters, with or without post processing such as heat treatment or hot isostatic pressing, the printed titanium alloy can easily reach tensile strengths of over 1100 MPa due to the quickly cooling of AM process. However, attributed to the unique features of metallurgical defects and microstructure introduced by this AM process, their fatigue strength has been low, often only not less than 30% of the tensile strength, especially in very-high-cycle regime, i.e. failure life beyond 107 cycles. Here, we have reviewed the current state of research on the very-high-cycle fatigue (VHCF) of additively manufactured (AMed) titanium alloys, refined the basic quantities of AMed microstructure and metallurgical defects, summarized the main factors limiting their VHCF strengths, and suggested possible ways to improve VHCF performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"edc52b5a262f2acf0554d88153e81c77cd9a916db2de0ea442eddc07023fb9ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
