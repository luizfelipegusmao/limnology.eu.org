{"title":"People at Risk of, or with Cardiovascular Diseases&rsquo; Perspectives and Perceptions of Physiotherapist-Led Health Promotion in Cameroon: A Mixed-Methods Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0020/v1","date":1725276446000,"content":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and their risk factors are a major cause of illness and death worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries like Cameroon.  Physiotherapist-led health promotion (PLHP) has proven effective in improving health and reducing CVD risks.  Understanding patient perspectives is crucial for designing effective, context-specific PLHP interventions.  This study explored patients' views, experiences, perceived usefulness, acceptability, and preferred methods of PLHP through a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach.  The quantitative data highlights a significant burden of CVD conditions and risk factors among patients seen in physiotherapy services.  Qualitatively, three themes were identified and included: 1) perspectives and experiences of people at risk or with CVDs (pwCVDs) on PLHP; 2) Perceived usefulness and acceptability of PLHP; 3) Preferred delivery methods of PLHP.  Participants reported positive feedback on PLHP and physiotherapy services.  Barriers to effective PLHP included high workloads for physiotherapists, limited service access in rural areas, and prohibitive costs.  Despite these challenges, participants expressed strong confidence in physiotherapists' competence, though they also called for improved regulation and ongoing professional development.  PLHP components, especially physical treatment and dietary advice, were deemed highly useful and acceptable.  Patients suggested various delivery methods, including peer support groups, home visits, and mass media interventions.  This study highlights the need to improve the scope of practice, competence of physiotherapists and accessibility of physiotherapy services in Cameroon for pwCVDs.  It is necessary to adopt multidisciplinary approaches to achieve better outcomes for risk factors like diabetes and hypertension in context.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37ffc615c6807b1db12c8c4e6980f551438108f7aa762043656de3253aa0f41a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
