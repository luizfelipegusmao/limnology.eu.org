{"title":"Transcription factors PuPRE6/PuMYB12 and histone deacetylase PuHDAC9-like regulate sucrose levels in pear","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1577/7450981?rss=1","date":1700870400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The improvement of fruit quality, in particular sugar content, has been a major goal of plant breeding programmes for many years. Here, 2 varieties of the Ussurian pear (<span>Pyrus ussuriensis</span>), Nanguo, and its high-sucrose accumulation bud sport, Nanhong, were used to study the molecular mechanisms regulating sucrose transport in fruits. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that in Nanhong fruit, an MYB transcription factor, <span>PuMYB12</span>, and a sucrose transporter protein, <span>PuSUT4-like</span>, were expressed at higher levels, while a paclobutrazol resistance transcription factor, <span>PuPRE6</span>, and a histone deacetylase (HDAC), <span>PuHDAC9-like</span>, were expressed at lower levels in Nanguo fruit. <span>PuSUT4-like</span> silencing and overexpression experiments in Nanguo pear showed that PuSUT4-like is essential for sucrose transportation. PuPRE6 and PuMYB12 act as antagonistic complexes to regulate <span>PuSUT4-like</span> transcription and sucrose accumulation. The histone deacetylation levels of the <span>PuMYB12</span> and <span>PuSUT4-like</span> promoters were higher in Nanguo fruit than in Nanhong fruit, and Y1H assays showed that HDAC PuHDAC9-like bound directly to the promoters of <span>PuMYB12</span> and <span>PuSUT4-like</span>. Our results uncovered transcription regulation and epigenetic mechanisms underlying sucrose accumulation in pears.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"d5bc16169de59afdcde15774caefd0e8770d00cadf5124cca698c4bb46848b50","category":"Environment"}
