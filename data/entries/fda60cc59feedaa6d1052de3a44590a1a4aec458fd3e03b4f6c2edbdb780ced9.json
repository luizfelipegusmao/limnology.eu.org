{"title":"A Bioinformatic Assay of Quercetin in Gastric Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1766/v1","date":1719353010000,"content":"Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant global health challenge, with high mortality rates, especially in developing countries. Current treatments are invasive and have considerable risks, necessitating the exploration of safer alternatives. Quercetin (QRC), a flavonoid present in various plants and foods, has demonstrated multiple health benefits, including anticancer properties. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of QRC in the treatment of GC. We utilized advanced molecular techniques to assess the impact of QRC on GC cells, examining its effects on cellular pathways and gene expression. Our findings indicate that QRC significantly inhibits GC cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a safer therapeutic option for GC treatment. Further research is required to validate these results and explore the clinical applications of QRC in cancer therapy","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fda60cc59feedaa6d1052de3a44590a1a4aec458fd3e03b4f6c2edbdb780ced9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
