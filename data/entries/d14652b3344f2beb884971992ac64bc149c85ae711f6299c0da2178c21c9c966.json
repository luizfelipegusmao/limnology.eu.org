{"title":"Effect of dietary C‐Phycocyanin on growth, survival, haematology, immune response, gut microbiome and disease resistance of Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16102?af=R","date":1667394512000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>C-Phycocyanin (CPC) was extracted from <i>Arthrospira</i> sp. and isolated from an estuarine ecosystem in southern India. A 45-day feeding trial was conducted to unravel the effect of dietary CPC in <i>Penaeus vannamei</i>. Seven iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic experimental diets were prepared with different levels of CPC at 0 (CPC<sub>0</sub>), 50 (CPC<sub>50</sub>), 100 (CPC<sub>100</sub>), 200 (CPC<sub>200</sub>), 400 (CPC<sub>400</sub>), 800 (CPC<sub>800</sub>) and 1600 (CPC<sub>1600</sub>) mg per kg diet. The results revealed that the survival percentages in CPC<sub>200</sub>, CPC<sub>400</sub>, CPC<sub>800</sub> and CPC<sub>1600</sub> were significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) higher than in other treatments. Moreover, <i>P. vannamei</i> fed with CPC<sub>800</sub> and CPC<sub>1600</sub> showed a significantly higher percentage (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) of weight gain compared to other treatments. Similarly, compared to other treatments, average body weight, average daily gain, specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio improved significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in CPC<sub>800</sub> and CPC<sub>1600</sub>. Differential gene expression of selected immune genes (<i>ProPO</i>, <i>SOD</i> and <i>HSP70</i>) indicated enhanced immunity in <i>P. vannamei</i> fed with CPC<sub>400</sub> and higher CPC doses. The enhanced health of <i>P. vannamei</i> fed with diets containing CPC was further corroborated by the gut <i>Vibrio</i> counts, haematology, gut microbiome and histopathological analyses, and the results showed the addition of CPC at 800 mg per kg of feed enhanced the health of shrimps. The results also give the baseline information about the utilization of CPC in <i>P. vannamei</i> grow-out feed at an inclusion level of 800 mg per kg of feed to get better growth, survival and health. The results would help in developing functional feeds for shrimps to act against bacterial diseases.</p>","author":"Sandeep Kizhakkekarammal Puthiyedathu, \nJesudhas Raymond Jani Angel, \nSivaramakrishnan Thirugnanamurthy, \nSudhin Suresh, \nSuganya Nathamuni, \nRamalingam Ananda Raja, \nSujeet Kumar, \nSherly Tomy, \nJagabathula Syama Dayal, \nBalasubramanian Changaramkumarth Paran, \nParamita Banerjee Sawant, \nShekhar Mudagandur Shashi, \nChadha Narinder Kumar, \nAmbasankar Kondusamy","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"d14652b3344f2beb884971992ac64bc149c85ae711f6299c0da2178c21c9c966","category":"Environment"}
