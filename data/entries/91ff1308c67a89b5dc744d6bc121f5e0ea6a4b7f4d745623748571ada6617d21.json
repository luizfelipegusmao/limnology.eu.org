{"title":"The Misalignment between the Strategic Asset Allocation and ESG Investment Target of Institutional Investors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0602/v1","date":1720424962000,"content":"Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment has become a common trend in capital markets, and many institutional investors have publicly declared their long-term ESG investment target (ESGIT). This study focuses on investors who conduct strategic asset allocation (SAA) using composite indices but establish their ESGIT outside the SAA process. A mismatch could arise between investorsâ€™ planned and actual portfolios because they must pursue their ESGIT by asset selection, which inevitably makes the constituents of their portfolios different from those of composite indices. To scrutinize the potential existence of a misalignment between their SAA and ESGIT, this study analyzes actual stock and bond indices over the past decade using traditional mean-variance optimization. The results reveal significant differences between the expected and realized performances, and the misalignment is more significant when the analysis period is divided into two sub-periods: stable and volatile. Specifically, the results indicate that the efficient frontier constructed using ESG indices significantly differs from that constructed using composite indices, and that the difference between these two efficient frontiers becomes more significant during volatile periods. Furthermore, the results show that investors cannot meet their targets if their ESGIT is established outside the SAA process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91ff1308c67a89b5dc744d6bc121f5e0ea6a4b7f4d745623748571ada6617d21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
