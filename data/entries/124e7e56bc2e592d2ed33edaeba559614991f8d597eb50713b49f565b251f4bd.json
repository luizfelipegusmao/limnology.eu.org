{"title":"The effect of shoreline habitats on native and non-native fish species in a set of Neotropical reservoirs","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05576-5","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Biodiversity is declining worldwide due to anthropogenic impacts, especially noxious for freshwater ecosystems, considering their close relationship with human activities. Damming is one of the most harmful human impacts that leads to the loss of several riverine fish through habitat loss or change. Herein, we aimed to assess the relationship between the composition of fish assemblages in reservoirs and the availability of littoral habitats, and whether these patterns differ between native and non-native species. Fish assemblages of fifteen reservoirs from up to downstream the Para√≠ba do Sul river basin were evaluated. Habitat availability was more important for native than for non-native species, after controlling for the influence of reservoir features. Local drivers were crucial for the occurrence of non-native species which thrived in the absence of complex habitats. Macrophytes seemed to play two key but quite antagonistic roles for fish species. They were positively related to native small characids, probably acting as shelter against predation, but they were also related to hypoxic conditions in eutrophic reservoirs. These findings stress the importance of preserving or restoring physically complex habitats as beneficial for native fish species through providing grounds for feeding (catfishes on leaves) and recruitment (juveniles of characids in macrophytes banks).</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"124e7e56bc2e592d2ed33edaeba559614991f8d597eb50713b49f565b251f4bd","category":"Environment"}
