{"title":"Enhancing Concrete Recycling in Iran: A Comprehensive Review of Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0798/v1","date":1715579419000,"content":"Concrete, the most-used construction material by weight, presents a significant environmental challenge due to its high production environmental footprint and huge quantities of demolition waste.Iran, with a thriving construction sector, faces escalating waste management issues.This paper provides a comprehensive review of strategies to increase concrete recycling in Iran. It explores the current state of concrete recycling practices, the environmental and economic benefits, and the existing barriers hindering wider adoption.The paper then analyzes various strategies across the concrete life cycle, including: demolition practices, collection and transportation systems, processing technologies, and market development for recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs).Several case studies are examined in order to identify best practices and strategies used by countries with successful concrete recycling programs that provide valuable insights about the factors contributing to their success which will be useful for implementation in Iran.Furthermore, the review concludes with recommendations tailored to the Iranian context, emphasizing the crucial role of collaboration between different stakeholders in Iran.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39d30071024c04f3b0e4745651bf7a65bbe3308f78ca4080495911457b88d9f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
