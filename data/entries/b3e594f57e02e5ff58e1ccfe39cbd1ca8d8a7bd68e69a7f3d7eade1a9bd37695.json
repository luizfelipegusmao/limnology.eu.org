{"title":"Establishing the Characteristic Compressive Strength Parallel to Fiber of Four Local Philippine Bamboo Species","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0820/v1","date":1710400101000,"content":"Bamboo is considered a sustainable construction material due to its ability to grow quickly and its mechanical properties that are comparable to timber. Contributing to the current effort to establish the structural bamboo standards in the National Structural Code of the Philippines (NSCP), this study establishes the characteristic compressive strength of four bamboo species: Bambusa vulgaris (36 samples), Dendrocalamus asper (36 samples), Bambusa blumeana (94 samples), and Guadua angustifolia Kunth (30 samples). The samples were subjected to compressive loading following ISO 22157-1 (2017). The characteristic compressive strength values obtained, according to ISO 12122-1 (2014), were 40.35 MPa for B. vulgaris, 40.21 MPa for D. asper, 46.63 MPa for B. blumeana, and 36.99 MPa for G. angustifolia Kunth. Simple linear analysis, One-way ANOVA, and Welchâ€™s t-Test were used to analyze the correlation models and establish a comparative analysis of the effect of nodes, and geometric and physical properties on the compressive strength of bamboos. Comparing the characteristic compressive strength obtained from this study to the strength of unseasoned structural timber of Philippine woods, all bamboo species showed higher strength values, and thus have great potential as an alternative construction material to timber.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3e594f57e02e5ff58e1ccfe39cbd1ca8d8a7bd68e69a7f3d7eade1a9bd37695","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
