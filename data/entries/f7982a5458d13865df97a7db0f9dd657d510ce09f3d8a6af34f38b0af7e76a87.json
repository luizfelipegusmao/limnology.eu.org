{"title":"Study of Tunnel Vehicle GNSS/INS/OD Combination Position Based on Lateral Distance Measurement and Lane Constraint","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0530/v1","date":1712568584000,"content":"High-precision dynamic positioning of highway vehicles is the foundation and prerequisite for achieving intelligent connected transportation. For the shortcomings of GNSS/INS combination and GNSS/INS/OD combination in tunnel vehicle positioning, this paper proposes a tunnel vehi-cle positioning method of GNSS/INS/OD combination based on lateral distance measurement and lane constraint. Firstly, lateral distance measurement of vehicles inside the tunnel is conducted based on laser radar point cloud data. Secondly, map matching positioning is performed based on lateral distance measurement, odometer, and lane markings. Experimental results demonstrate that for a 4.6 km tunnel, the average absolute error of lateral positioning is 0.294 meters, and the longitudinal positioning error is no more than 0.6 meters, which can effectively meet practical operational requirements.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f7982a5458d13865df97a7db0f9dd657d510ce09f3d8a6af34f38b0af7e76a87","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
