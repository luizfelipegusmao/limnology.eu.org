{"title":"Salt Marsh Morphological Evolution Under Plant Species Invasion","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12237-024-01346-7","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Species invasion in salt marsh wetlands is known to disturb the balance of biotic and abiotic ecosystems (e.g., changing material exchange cycles and community structure). However, its influence on the morphological evolution of salt marshes is not yet understood in depth. This study investigates the long-term temporal and spatial distributions of an invasive plant (<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>) and its morphological characteristics in the Yangtze Estuary by remote sensing imagery interpretation, tidal creek extraction, regional statistical analysis, and proximity analysis. The invaded site shows an area of <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> with a 35-fold increase from the start to the end of its initiation phase; it is the second biggest species in the study area. It is found that species invasion not only limited the expansion of native pioneer vegetation but also changed bio-geomorphic feedback loops. With the influence of plant invasion, median tidal creek lengths decreased and the median tidal creek sinuosity ratio remained stable, between 1.06 and 1.07 in the subarea. The method used here is adaptable to other salt marshes. The findings from this study can provide practical guidance for the restoration of native salt marshes in the estuary and thus control the spread of invasive species.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"56d242ddbff3833a455a09705f4e62d8edcff6f3e069e8fb7c3a212527c88c0e","category":"Environment"}
