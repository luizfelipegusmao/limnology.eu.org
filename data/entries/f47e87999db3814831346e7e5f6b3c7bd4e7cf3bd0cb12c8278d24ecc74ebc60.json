{"title":"Markov Chain Based Statistic Model for Predicting Particle Movement in Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) Risers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1963/v1","date":1721817672000,"content":"To increase the calculation speed of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based simulation for the gas-solid flow in fluidized beds, a Markov chain model (MCM) is developed to simulate the particle movement in a two-dimensional (2D) circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser. As a statistic model, the MCM takes the CFD-discrete element method (DEM) results as samples to calculate the transition probability matrix of particles, which can describe the macroscopic regularities of the particle movement and guide the numerical simulation of the particle motion based on the Monte Carlo method. The particle distribution snapshots, residence time distribution (RTD) and mixing obtained from both the CFD-DEM and the MCM are compared. Results show that the computational speed of the MCM is faster than that of the CFD-DEM by about 2 orders of magnitude, and the difference of the mean particle residence time calculated by the two models is less than 2%. Besides, the MCM can well describe the time-averaged particle mixing compared to the CFD-DEM.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f47e87999db3814831346e7e5f6b3c7bd4e7cf3bd0cb12c8278d24ecc74ebc60","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
