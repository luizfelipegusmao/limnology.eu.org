{"title":"Optimized Nanocellulose-Based Magnetic Metal-Organic Frameworks for Antibiotic Adsorption: A Cutting-Edge Strategy in Environmental Remediation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1348/v1","date":1726653659000,"content":"The growing threat of antibiotic pollution in water systems demands innovative and sustainable remediation strategies. Nanocellulose-based magnetic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a cutting-edge solution for the adsorption and removal of antibiotics, leveraging their high porosity, magnetic properties, and environmentally friendly nature. This paper provides an in-depth review of recent advancements in nanocellulose-based MOFs, focusing on their synthesis, adsorption mechanisms, and applications in environmental remediation between 2020 and 2024. By summarizing key studies, we highlight their performance in targeting widely used antibiotics such as tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. The integration of nanocellulose with MOFs not only enhances adsorption capacity but also offers easy recovery, recyclability, and environmental compatibility. This review explores their adsorption mechanisms, practical applications, and future research directions, contributing to the advancement of scalable and sustainable water treatment technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"79c3a687734ab80a0efaf1edfbe925ecc23761a523cecebadf6c98667a13d4de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
