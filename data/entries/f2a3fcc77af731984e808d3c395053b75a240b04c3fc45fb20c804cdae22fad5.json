{"title":"A Blockchain Approach for the Organic Food Supply Chain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0814/v1","date":1728566255000,"content":"This paper proposes a novel blockchain-based system designed to revolutionize transparency, traceability, and reliability within the organic food supply chain. Addressing persistent challenges such as certification fraud, opaque supply chains, and the high costs associated with organic food production, stakeholders including farmers, processors, distributors, retailers, and consumers stand to benefit from the system’s innovative approach. By leveraging blockchain technology and a robust system architecture, the proposed system offers enhanced transparency, improved traceability, and streamlined certification processes. Through detailed exploration of key components such as user interfaces, smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, IoT integration, and governance frameworks, the paper illustrates the practical application of blockchain technology in improving transparency and traceability throughout the food supply chain. A case study focusing on the organic Tofu supply chain further demonstrates the system’s potential to enhance sustainability, efficiency, and integrity in organic food production and distribution networks. The paper concludes by discussing potential implementation challenges and suggesting areas for future research and development to advance the impact of blockchain technology on the food supply chain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f2a3fcc77af731984e808d3c395053b75a240b04c3fc45fb20c804cdae22fad5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
