{"title":"Effect of replacing a portion of fish meal with unfermented and/or fermented soybean meal on the growth performance, antioxidant and immunity capacity and related gene expression in juvenile Coho Salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.12998?af=R","date":1707993399000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study investigated the effect of replacing a portion of fish meal with unfermented and/or fermented soybean meal in juvenile coho salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus kisutch</i>). Four groups of juveniles (initial weight 110.31 ± 3.12 g) in triplicate were fed for 90 days on four different iso-nitrogen and iso-lipid diets. The G0 diet comprised 28% fish meal protein (control group). In the other three diets (G1, G2, and G3), 10% of the fish meal protein was replaced with unfermented and/or fermented soybean meal protein. The main results were: Compared with G0, the WGR, SGR, CF; the contents of GLU, TP, ALB, T-CHO, and T-AOC, the activities of AKP, CAT, SOD, GST, GSH-PX, O<sub>2</sub>·-CR, OH·-CR, and GSH and the expressions of SOD, GSH-PX, GST, CAT, and Nrf2 genes of juvenile coho salmon in G3 were significantly (<i>p &lt;</i> 0.05) increased, However, the FCR, HSI, the content of MDA, and the expressions of TNF-α and IL-6 genes of juvenile coho salmon in G3 were significantly (<i>p &lt;</i> 0.05) decreased. There was no significant effect (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05) of diet on their survival rate (SR). In conclusion, the fermented soybean meal in the juvenile coho salmon diet can replace 10% of the fish meal protein.</p>","author":"Qin Zhang, \nJiajing Wang, \nQiuyue Yang, \nLixiao Xu, \nJian Xu, \nYongqiang Liu, \nTong Tong","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"ffdac7af2eee95688046c878db740af7eceaca0c315aabfb77f2dfd874f67b5c","category":"Environment"}
