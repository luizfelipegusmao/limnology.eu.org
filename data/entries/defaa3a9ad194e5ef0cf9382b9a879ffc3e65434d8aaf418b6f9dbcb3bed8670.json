{"title":"The psychosocial determinants of adherence to home-based rehabilitation strategies in parents of children with cerebral palsy: A systematic review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305432","date":1718200800000,"content":"<p>by Japhet Niyonsenga, Liliane Uwingeneye, Inès Musabyemariya, Jean Baptiste Sagahutu, Francesca Cavallini, Luca Caricati, Rutembesa Eugene, Jean Mutabaruka, Stefan Jansen, Nadia Monacelli</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Involving parents of children with cerebral palsy (C-CP) in home exercise programmes (HEP) is globally practiced strategy closely linked to improved physical performance and functional outcomes for the child. Nevertheless, non-adherence to HEP is increasing at an alarming rate, and little is known about the factors influencing adherence to HEP (AHEP) especially in parents of C-CP. This systematic review aimed to identify the factors enhancing AHEP among parents of C-CP to reinforce the efficacy of rehabilitation practices proposed by health professionals, researchers, and educators.</p> Materials and methods <p>We conducted searches in PubMed, Scopus, CINHAL, PsycINFO, and Embase for articles published up to March 2023, that investigated the factors influencing AHEP among parents of C-CP. A narrative synthesis was conducted using the search results and pertinent material from other sources.</p> Results <p>Overall, non-adherence rates to HEP were moderate to high, ranging from 34% to 79.2%. Strong evidence suggests that factors enhancing AHEP fall into three categories: child-related (such as younger age and better gross motor function [GMF]), the caregiver-related (including high self-efficacy and knowledge, strong social support, low levels of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, and a low perception of barriers), and the physiotherapist-related. For the latter category, the parent’s perception of a supportive and collaborative relationship with the therapist is one of the conditions most favourably influences AHEP.</p> Conclusion <p>Our findings highlight that factors influencing AHEP are multifactorial. Some, such as GMF or the economic and social conditions of the family, are challenging to change. However, the relationship between therapist and parent is an aspect that can be strengthened. These results underscore the importance of substantial training and psychosocial support for therapists to enhance their awareness and competence in building supportive relationship with parents.</p>","author":"Japhet Niyonsenga","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"defaa3a9ad194e5ef0cf9382b9a879ffc3e65434d8aaf418b6f9dbcb3bed8670","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
