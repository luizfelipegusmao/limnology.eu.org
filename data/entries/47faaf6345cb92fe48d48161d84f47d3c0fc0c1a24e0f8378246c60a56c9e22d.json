{"title":"Exploring Urban Lighting Design Effect on Citizens&rsquo; Emotions through the Application of Kansei Methodology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1129/v1","date":1715966662000,"content":"Outdoor lighting design is a multidisciplinary topic that involves, among other aspects, design, energy savings, protection of nocturnal biodiversity and profitability, all of which are important functional and regulatory requirements. However, they do not necessarily consider user needs, which make perception and emotional response difficult parameters in the lighting design process. The studies carried out on lighting and its impact on emotions have mainly been done indoors. The objective of this work is to propose a methodology to evaluate emotional response to the illuminated nocturnal urban space with the purpose of providing knowledge to create emotionally efficient luminous spaces that improve people's perception and well-being. The instrument used was the survey (online questionnaires), based on Kansei engineering, created to incorporate the emotional variable in product design. The research was carried out with participants from Peru, Spain, and Germany. The results collected the reaction of the participants to different types of night-time luminous spaces presented, which contributes to a better understanding of user needs and activities regarding the space. This knowledge is intended to help designers meet their expectations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"47faaf6345cb92fe48d48161d84f47d3c0fc0c1a24e0f8378246c60a56c9e22d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
