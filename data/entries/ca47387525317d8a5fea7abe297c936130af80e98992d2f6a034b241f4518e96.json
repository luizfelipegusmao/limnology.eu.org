{"title":"Increasing Endoglin Deletion in Endothelial Cells Exacerbates the Severity of Brain Arteriovenous Malformation in Mouse","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1623/v1","date":1719219952000,"content":"Abstract: Endoglin (ENG) is a causative gene of type 1 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1). HHT1 patients have arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in multiple organs, including the brain. In mice, Eng deletion induced by R26RCreER or SM22aCre leads to AVM development in the brain and other organs. We have reported that the severity of brain AVM in mice with activin receptor-like kinase 1 (Alk1, an HHT2 causative gene) mutation is correlated with the number of Alk1 negative endothelial cells (ECs). We hypothesized that increase of Eng negative ECs will enhance AVM severity. To increase EC Eng deletion, we used a codon improved cre (icre), which is more potent in recombination of floxed alleles than the wild type (WT) cre. R26RCreER;Engf/f mice that have Rosa promoter driving and tamoxifen (TM) inducible WT cre expression globally and PdgfbiCreER;Engf/f that have Pdgfb promoter driving and TM inducible icre expression in ECs were treated with 3 intra-peritoneal injections of TM (2.5 mg/25g of body weight) to delete Eng globally or in the ECs. AAV-VEGF was stereotactically injected into the brain to induce brain focal angiogenesis and brain AVM. We found that iCre caused more Eng deletion in the brain indicated by lower level of Eng proteins (p&lt;0.001) and fewer Eng positive ECs (p=0.01) than mice with WT cre. Mice with iCre mediated Eng deletion have more abnormal vessels (p=0.02), CD68+ macrophages (p=0.002), and hemorrhage (p=0.04), and less vascular pericyte and smooth muscle coverage than mice with WT cre. In addition, arteriovenous shunts were detected in the intestines of icre mice, a phenotype that have not been detected in WT cre mice before. RNAseq analysis showed that 8 out of the 10 top upregulated pathways identified by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis are related to the inflammation. Therefore, increase of Eng deletion in ECs exacerbates AVM severity, which is associated with enhanced inflammation. Strategies that can reduce Eng negative ECs could be used to develop new therapies to reduce AVM severity for HHT1 patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca47387525317d8a5fea7abe297c936130af80e98992d2f6a034b241f4518e96","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
