{"title":"Utilization of Post-Process Osmotic Solution Based on Tomato Juice Through Spray Drying","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2092/v1","date":1727362369000,"content":"The study focused on utilizing post-process osmotic solution enriched with inulin or maltodextrin, evaluating its potential for spray drying. Parameters such as yield, energy consumption, and the physical properties of the dried solutions and powders—including moisture content (Mc), water activity (Aw), color, true and bulk density, porosity, and glass transition temperature—were analyzed. The effects of carrier type, concentration, and inlet temperature (Tin) were systematically examined. Samples dried with maltodextrin demonstrated over 50% higher yield than those with inulin, with the highest yield of 32.13±0.64% and the lowest yield of 2.75±0.48%. Higher Tin improved drying efficiency by reducing Mc but also caused darker powders. Energy consumption increased with rising Tin, peaking at 2295±51 kJ. The Spray Drying Energy Index (SDEI) was introduced to assess energy consumption relative to powder yield, with the most favorable SDEI values observed for processes with the highest total energy consumption. These same samples exhibited lower Mc and Aw values. The lowest bulk density was 0.455±0.004 g·cm-3, while porosity was 58.3±0.7%. The results highlight the potential of spray drying as a sustainable method for utilizing by-products from osmotic dehydration, aligning with the principles of sustainable food practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf1388df941c8f3825901ec8feea9c3f8f66845a0bcca31b92c44d802b16b9e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
