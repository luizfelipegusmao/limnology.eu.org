Although the study found a low prevalence of hepatitis viruses, these types of viruses will continue to pose a significant risk to public health. Based on this study, it is imperative for authorities to actively enhance public awareness in order to enable prompt planning and essential arrangements for an effective response to outbreaks or epidemics. This will ultimately lead to a reduction in illness, death, and economic burden.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"249d1ba45aa62aee6c4c8497a19532adca07234bcac6b145336f07d0641c02cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
