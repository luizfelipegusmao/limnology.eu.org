{"title":"Adaptive fixed-time TSM for uncertain nonlinear dynamical system under unknown disturbance","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304448","date":1724248800000,"content":"<p>by Saim Ahmed, Ahmad Taher Azar, Haoping Wang</p>\r\n\r\nFor nonlinear systems subjected to external disturbances, an adaptive terminal sliding mode control (TSM) approach with fixed-time convergence is presented in this paper. The introduction of the fixed-time TSM with the sliding surface and the new Lemma of fixed-time stability are the main topics of discussion. The suggested approach demonstrates quick convergence, smooth and non-singular control input, and stability within a fixed time. Existing fixed-time TSM schemes are often impacted by unknown dynamics such as uncertainty and disturbances. Therefore, the proposed strategy is developed by combining the fixed-time TSM with an adaptive scheme. This adaptive method deals with an uncertain dynamic system when there are external disturbances. The stability of a closed-loop structure in a fixed-time will be shown by the findings of the Lyapunov analysis. Finally, the outcomes of the simulations are shown to evaluate and demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested method. As a result, examples with different cases are provided for a better comparison of suggested and existing control strategies.","author":"Saim Ahmed","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"276843fcf1f0d12a2d1bfcbe8ac68eb40e31fa8998b393b6a233c1adecabbb7e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
