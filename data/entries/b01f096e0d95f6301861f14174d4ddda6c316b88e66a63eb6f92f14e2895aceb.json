{"title":"Investigation of Inter- and Intra-Chain Interactions in Mixtures of Long-Chain Polymer Monomer with Relations to Applications in agriculture of Plant Cuticular Waxes: Using n-Nonadecane and 1-Octadecanol Mixture as example","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0628/v1","date":1710158027000,"content":"The article delves into the intricate phase transitions of 1-Octadecanol and n-Nonadecane within a binary system, unveiling dynamic structural changes under varying conditions. Through Fouri-er-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, specific molecular vibrations were identified, shedding light on the molecular composition and interactions. The study highlights the challenges in detecting subtle phase transitions and emphasizes the individuality of molecular behaviours in closely related compounds. The findings underscore the complexity of phase transitions in binary systems and advocate for a nuanced approach to studying molecular structures and behaviours. Addi-tionally, the research contributes valuable insights into the molecular dynamics of Organic Polymer Functional Adsorption Materials, offering implications for synthetic waxy layers in plant epidermis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b01f096e0d95f6301861f14174d4ddda6c316b88e66a63eb6f92f14e2895aceb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
