{"title":"Investigation into process parameter optimization of selective laser melting for producing AlSi12 parts using ANOVA","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2051/v1","date":1719905021000,"content":"In this study, AlSi12 alloy was fabricated using the selective laser melting (SLM) technique to produce high density components with complex and customized parts for railway applications. Nonetheless, the production of dense samples necessitates the optimization of production process parameters. As a statistical design of experimental technique, the response surface methodology was used to optimise different combination of SLM parameters. The results were analysed using analyse of variance (ANOVA) and the signal-to-noise(S/N) ratios. The relationship between the hardness response to the process parameters (scanning speed and lase power) for determining the optimal processing conditions were examined. A hardness value of 133 HV was obtained. The process parameters were successfully optimized and the relationship between the parameters and the structures of the fabricated samples were reported.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b66dd95cae123173bcc0d2976f866bdc4b4dc79deb8b7aa58b700ce4704d7d23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
