{"title":"Transforming Experiential Learning: The Role of Advanced Human-Computer Interaction Technologies in Modern Education and Hands-On Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0622/v1","date":1720432344000,"content":"Experiential learning, defined as the result, source, or context of knowledge obtained from direct experience, is increasingly bolstered by technology and human-computer interaction (HCI) principles and protocols. This article will describe how technology-based human-computer interaction (HCI) has been used in experiments to enhance direct knowledge experience. In this paper, immersive technologies (such as Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and haptics) will be described based on cognitive learning theory, empirical research and practical experience gained from implementing cutting-edge technology and maximizing HCI principles in constructive learning. Additionally, this article will describe how AI can be used to create individualized learning environments according to a student's needs in the future.  While cost, technical issues and specialised trainings are the obstacle to deliver personalized learning experiences especially to economically disadvantaged students, technological change opportunities are projected, and these technologies will take educational outcomes to the next level.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e94106f0134fd8a02e77007c2b7a826fd713e23bbd6e8af43f9761843f7c935c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
