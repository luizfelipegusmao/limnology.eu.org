{"title":"Antifungal Activity and Mycotoxin Degradation Potential of Bioprotective Microorganisms to Application in Animal Food Production Chain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1872/v1","date":1727173991000,"content":"The global meat industry has grown substantially, producing 357.39 million tons in 2021, with poultry and pork comprising nearly 73% of this total. However, contamination by mycotoxins, such as zearalenone (ZEA) and fumonisin B1 (FB1), presents a major issue, as these toxins resist common preservation methods. This study explores the potential of bioprotective microorganisms in mycotoxin degradation and fungal control within the animal food production chain, a sector facing significant challenges due to fungal contamination. In this study, 23 bacterial and yeast strains were tested for their ability to degrade ZEA and FB1, and to inhibit mycotoxigenic fungi. Four bacterial strains were highly effective in degrading ZEA: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MLB3, Bacillus subtilis MLB2, Bacillus velezensis CL197, and Streptomyces griseus CECT 3276. However, no strain achieved satisfactory FB1 degradation. The strains also displayed antifungal activity, inhibiting up to 100% of fungi growth in solid media co-culture tests. Simulated swine and poultry digestion demonstrated complete ZEA degradation after 2 hours of incubation. Metabolite analysis revealed that low-toxicity conjugates were formed. These findings suggest that these bacteria hold significant promise for biotechnological applications in animal production, helping to reduce mycotoxin contamination, improve food safety, and protect both animal and human health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c4ccf46873c343bcdc8fa19e20642c2881e86e71155ee8ba48f96caa0b2fe27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
