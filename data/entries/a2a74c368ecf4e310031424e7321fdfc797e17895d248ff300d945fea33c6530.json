It crafts an advanced neural network with an encoder-decoder architecture capable of predicting the Spar’s motion and fairlead tensions time series. These predictions are based on wind and wave excitations across various operational and extreme conditions. The LSTM network, trained on an extensive dataset from over 300 fully coupled simulation scenarios using OpenFAST, ensures a robust framework that captures the complex dynamics of floating platform under diverse environmental scenarios. This framework’s effectiveness is further verified by thoroughly evaluating the model’s performance, leveraging comparative statistics and accuracy assessments to highlight its reliability. This methodology contributes to substantial reductions in computational time. This research aims to provide critical insights that facilitate the optimization of offshore wind turbines, marking a step forward in the quest for more efficient and dependable renewable energy solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a2a74c368ecf4e310031424e7321fdfc797e17895d248ff300d945fea33c6530","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
