{"title":"A review of the varunid crab genus Parapyxidognathus Ward, 1941 (Decapoda: Brachyura: Varunidae), with descriptions of two new species","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jcb/article/doi/10.1093/jcbiol/ruae022/7678784?rss=1","date":1716249600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Species of <span>Parapyxidognathus</span> Ward, 1941 are distributed across tropical Indo-West Pacific to temperate downstream rivers and in estuaries. The genus previously included only one species, <span>Parapyxidognathus deianira</span> (De Man, 1888). We examined specimens from <span>Parapyxidognathus</span> and its closely related genus, <span>Pyxidognathus</span> A. Milne-Edwards, 1879 from the eastern Indian Ocean and western Pacific, focusing on their morphological characters. The results also support the reclassification of <span>Pyxidognathus fluviatilis</span> Alcock, 1900 into <span>Parapyxidognathus</span>, as well as the establishment of two new species from the western Pacific, <span>Pa. tshiansue</span><strong>sp. nov.</strong> and <span>Pa. ongia</span><strong>sp. nov.</strong> The identity of the species is supported by evidence from mitochondrial 16S rDNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) genes. There are now four species in <span>Parapyxidognathus</span> distinguishable by the characters of the anterolateral teeth of the carapace, the pleon, and the first gonopods of the male, and the female vulvae.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Crustacean Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"8ca07ea220dbc7082c62912ab6b47a7a5a309f6e19a7257844b27bf0267b5f04","entryHash":"cf06d987739664569b5022709fdc7484e5f8a505229c70712ca2fd01332ac1c4","category":"Environment"}
