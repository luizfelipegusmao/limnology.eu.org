Childs</p>\r\n\r\nBrain pericytes are one of the critical cell types that regulate endothelial barrier function and activity, thus ensuring adequate blood flow to the brain. The genetic pathways guiding undifferentiated cells into mature pericytes are not well understood. We show here that pericyte precursor populations from both neural crest and head mesoderm of zebrafish express the transcription factor <i>nkx3</i>.<i>1</i> develop into brain pericytes. We identify the gene signature of these precursors and show that an <i>nkx3</i>.<i>1</i>-, <i>foxf2a</i>-, and <i>cxcl12b</i>-expressing pericyte precursor population is present around the basilar artery prior to artery formation and pericyte recruitment. The precursors later spread throughout the brain and differentiate to express canonical pericyte markers. Cxcl12b-Cxcr4 signaling is required for pericyte attachment and differentiation. Further, both <i>nkx3</i>.<i>1</i> and <i>cxcl12</i>b are necessary and sufficient in regulating pericyte number as loss inhibits and gain increases pericyte number. Through genetic experiments, we have defined a precursor population for brain pericytes and identified genes critical for their differentiation.","author":"Suchit Ahuja","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"5f8fbe445c6090acbda15c168110989b87014279415bc72bcd19efd807f5a889","category":"Environment"}
