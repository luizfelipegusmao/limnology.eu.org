This research aims to predict gully formation in the Kalshour basin, Sabzevar, Iran. Employing the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) index, we identified 13 key factors out of 22 for modeling, with elevation emerging as the most influential factor in gully formation. The study evaluated the performance of individual machine learning algorithms and ensemble algorithms, including the Functional Tree (FT) as the main classifier, Bagging (Bagg), AdaBoost (Ada), Rotation Forest (RoF), and Random Subspace (RSS). Using a data set of 400 gully and non-gully points obtained through field investigations (70% for training and 30% for testing), the RoF model achieved an area under the curev (AUC) value of 0.99, indicating its high predictive ability for gully-susceptible areas. Other algorithms also performed well (Ada: 0.90, FT: 0.92, RSS: 0.94, Bagg: 0.95). However, the RoF algorithm with the functional tree as the main classifier (RoF_FT) demonstrated the highest ability in gully classification and susceptibility mapping, enhancing the functional tree's performance. In addition to AUC, the RoF_FT model achieved an F1 score of 0.89 and an MCC of 0.78 on the validation set, indicating a high balance between precision and recall, and a strong correlation between predicted and actual classes, respectively. Similarly, other models showed robust performance with high F1 scores and MCC values, but the RoF_FT model consistently outperformed them, underscoring its robustness and reliability. The resulting gully erosion-susceptibility map can be valuable for decision-makers and local managers in soil conservation and minimizing damages. Implementing proactive measures based on these findings can contribute to sustainable land management practices in the Kalshour basin.</p>\n<p><b>Recommendations</b>\n</p><p><b>Gully erosion threat</b>: Gully erosion poses a significant threat to soil, with far-reaching environmental consequences.</p>\n<p><b>Predictive modeling</b>: This research focuses on predicting gully formation in the Kalshour basin, Sabzevar, Iran, using advanced machine learning algorithms.</p>\n<p><b>Key findings for decision-makers</b>: The study evaluates the performance of various machine learning algorithms and ensemble algorithms, with the Functional Tree serving as the main classifier.
