{"title":"The Utility of the IWGDF Diabetes-Related Foot Ulcer Risk Classification Annual Reassessment in the Primary Care Setting &ndash; a Cohort Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0259/v1","date":1712138647000,"content":"Background: We assessed the pertinence of yearly updating the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) risk classification in people with diabetes by quantifying the changes in the risk group and its accuracy in identifying those developing an ulcer (DFU) in a primary care setting.\nMethods: In our retrospective cohort study, we included all people with diabetes with a foot as-sessment registry between January 2016 and December 2018 in the Baixo Alentejo Local Health Unit. Foot-related data was collected at baseline after one and two years. DFU and/or death until December 2019 were registered. The proportion of people changing their risk status each year was calculated. Accuracy measures of the IWGDF classification to predict DFU occurrence at one, two, and three years were calculated.\nResults: A total of 2097 people were followed for three years, during which 0.1% died, and 12.4% developed a DFU. After two years, 3.6% of the participants had progressed to a higher-risk group. The IWGDF classification presented specificity values superior to 90% and negative predictive values superior to 99%.\nConclusion: Foot risk status can be safely updated every two years instead of yearly. The IWGDF classification can accurately identify those not at risk of DFU.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab57aa7d31ae41e71f2b52f48166154fd08fd3870c786360d0e8bb20ab9b3be7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
