{"title":"The Role of Ethical Sourcing Practices in Addressing Price Inflation in Renewable Energy Supply Chains","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2097/v1","date":1717135840000,"content":"Ethical sourcing practices play a pivotal role in addressing price inflation within renewable energy supply chains. This qualitative research investigates the multifaceted impacts of ethical sourcing, drawing insights from interviews with key stakeholders in the renewable energy sector. The study reveals that ethical sourcing enhances supply chain transparency, traceability, and resilience by mitigating risks associated with unethical practices such as labor exploitation and environmental degradation. Fair trade initiatives contribute to economic stability and reduce price volatility by ensuring fair compensation for producers and workers, fostering long-term relationships, and reinvesting premiums into community development projects. Sustainable sourcing practices align with consumer preferences for eco-friendly products, reduce the demand for virgin resources, and promote regulatory compliance and incentives, thereby stabilizing costs and reducing environmental impact. Socially responsible companies that prioritize fair labor practices and community support experience fewer disruptions and benefit from a more stable and productive workforce. Entrepreneurship and emotional intelligence among leaders drive the adoption and successful implementation of ethical sourcing practices, enhancing brand reputation, consumer trust, and market competitiveness. Despite challenges, such as higher implementation costs and supplier resistance, the long-term benefits of ethical sourcing outweigh the initial costs and contribute to sustainable supply chains. Collaboration, consumer education, and effective regulation are essential for promoting ethical sourcing across the renewable energy sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"660814e7177f3bfd35684603532db95b7e66fa1e021e499c8faf69e0898a2bda","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
