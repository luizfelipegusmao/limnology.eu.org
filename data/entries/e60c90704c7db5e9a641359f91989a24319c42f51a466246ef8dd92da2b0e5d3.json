{"title":"The NRC0 gene cluster of sensor and helper NLR immune receptors is functionally conserved across asterid plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3344/7687706?rss=1","date":1717459200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor (NLR) proteins can form complex receptor networks to confer innate immunity. An NLR-REQUIRED FOR CELL DEATH (NRC) is a phylogenetically related node that functions downstream of a massively expanded network of disease resistance proteins that protect against multiple plant pathogens. In this study, we used phylogenomic methods to reconstruct the macroevolution of the NRC family. One of the NRCs, termed <span>NRC0</span>, is the only family member shared across asterid plants, leading us to investigate its evolutionary history and genetic organization. In several asterid species, <span>NRC0</span> is genetically clustered with other NLRs that are phylogenetically related to NRC-dependent disease resistance genes. This prompted us to hypothesize that the ancestral state of the NRC network is an NLR helperâ€“sensor gene cluster that was present early during asterid evolution. We provide support for this hypothesis by demonstrating that NRC0 is essential for the hypersensitive cell death that is induced by its genetically linked sensor NLR partners in 4 divergent asterid species: tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>), wild sweet potato (<span>Ipomoea trifida</span>), coffee (<span>Coffea canephora</span>), and carrot (<span>Daucus carota</span>). In addition, activation of a sensor NLR leads to higher-order complex formation of its genetically linked NRC0, similar to other NRCs. Our findings map out contrasting evolutionary dynamics in the macroevolution of the NRC network over the last 125 million years, from a functionally conserved NLR gene cluster to a massive genetically dispersed network.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"e60c90704c7db5e9a641359f91989a24319c42f51a466246ef8dd92da2b0e5d3","category":"Environment"}
