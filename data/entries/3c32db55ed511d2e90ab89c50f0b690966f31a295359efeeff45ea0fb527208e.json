{"title":"Quantum Channel Extreme Bandgap AlGaN HEMT","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1693/v1","date":1727142672000,"content":"â€” An extreme bandgap Al0.64Ga0.36N quantum channel HEMT with Al0.87Ga0.13N top and back barriers grown by MOCVD over bulk AlN substrate demonstrated a critical breakdown field of 11.37 MV/cm, higher than 9.8 MV/cm expected for the channel Al0.64Ga0.36N material. We show that the fraction of this increase is due to the quantization of the 2D electron gas. The polarization field maintains electron quantization in the quantum channel even at low sheet densities in contrast to conventional HEMT designs. An additional increase in the breakdown field is due to quantum-enabled real space transfer of energetic electrons into high-Al barrier layers in high electric fields. These results show the advantages of quantum channel design for achieving record high breakdown voltages and enabling superior power HEMT devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c32db55ed511d2e90ab89c50f0b690966f31a295359efeeff45ea0fb527208e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
