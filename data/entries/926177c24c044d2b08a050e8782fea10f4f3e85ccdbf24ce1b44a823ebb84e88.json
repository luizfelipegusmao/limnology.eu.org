{"title":"Effect of tremella polysaccharides on the quality of collagen jelly: insight into the improvement of the gel properties and the antioxidant activity of yak skin gelatin","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13510?af=R","date":1720851246000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The present study aimed to investigate the effects of tremella polysaccharides on the gel properties and antioxidant activity of yak skin gelatin with a view to improving the quality of collagen jellies. The preparation of composite gels were performed by yak skin gelatin (66.7 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) and tremella polysaccharides with different concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>), and finally the collagen jelly was prepared by composite gel (yak skin gelatin: 66.7 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>; tremella polysaccharides:6 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) with the best performance.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Tremella polysaccharides not only improved the hardness, springiness, gel strength, water holding capacity and melting temperature of yak skin gelatin, but also enhanced the composite gel's scavenging activity against ABTS radicals, DPPH radicals, O<sub>2</sub> and OH radicals. The filling of tremella polysaccharides into the gelatin network increased the number of crosslinking sites inside the gel, which resulted in the gel network structure becoming dense and orderly. The gel particles became finer and more uniform, and the thermal stability was improved. Furthermore, the sensory score of commercially available gelatin jelly decreased more rapidly during storage compared to the composite gel jelly.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The gel properties and antioxidant activity of yak skin gelatin were improved by adding tremella polysaccharides, and then the quality and storage properties of the jelly were improved, which also provided technical reference for the development of functional gel food. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yueyue Zhang, \nGuangxing Han, \nXinyue Wang, \nYanru Wang, \nMin Wang, \nYing Li, \nQunli Yu, \nLing Han","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"926177c24c044d2b08a050e8782fea10f4f3e85ccdbf24ce1b44a823ebb84e88","category":"Environment"}
