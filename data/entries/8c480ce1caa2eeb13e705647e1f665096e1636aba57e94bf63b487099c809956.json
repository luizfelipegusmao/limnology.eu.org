{"title":"Comorbidity of Hypothyroidism and Low-Alanine Aminotransferase Associated Sarcopenia is Common and Associated with Shortened Survival. A Retrospective Study of 16,827 patients Over a Period of 21 Years","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0374/v1","date":1725449683000,"content":"Background. Hypothyroidism is very common worldwide. It is known to be associated with frailty which in turn, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the elderlies. Low ALT blood activity is an established marker for sarcopenia and frailty. The incidence and outcomes of the association of low ALT values and hypothyroidism, as manifested in elevated blood TSH levels, is unknown. \nMethods. This was a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients in a large, tertiary hospital. \nResults. Over a period of 21 years, an overall population of 16,827 patients were identified as eligible to participate in this study. Within the study population 726 (4.3%) were classified as suffering from hypothyroidism (TSH values &gt; 6 MIU/L) and 2,184 (13%) were classified as patients with sarcopenia (ALT &lt; 12 IU/L). Within our patientsâ€™ population, hypothyroidism was associated with sarcopenia in a statistically significant manner (p = 0.011). Patients classified as suffering from both hypothyroidism and sarcopenia had significantly shorter survival: A multivariate analysis showed that the frail and hypothyroid group of patients had a statistically significant risk of mortality in the for coming 5 years (HR = 3.6; CI 2.75-4.71; p &lt; 0.001). \nConclusions. Sarcopenia and frailty are common comorbidities, bearing negative long-term clinical outcomes. Low ALT values could serve as a useful biomarker for screening of patients already diagnosed with hypothyroidism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c480ce1caa2eeb13e705647e1f665096e1636aba57e94bf63b487099c809956","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
