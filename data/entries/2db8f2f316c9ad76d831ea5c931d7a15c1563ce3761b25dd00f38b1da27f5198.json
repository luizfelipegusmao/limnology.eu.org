{"title":"Formulation and Evaluation of Hydrophilic Matrix Tablets for Controlled Released Chlorzoxazone Delivery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0503/v1","date":1712553331000,"content":"The release of the active substance from the matrix modified-release tablets based on Kollidon®SR and chitosan depends on its solubility in the dissolution medium and on the composition of the matrix-forming polymers. The study is based on new oral matrix tablets based on Kollidon®SR and chitosan, formulated to optimize the low oral bioavailability of chlorzoxazone, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a class II Biopharmaceutical Classification System. Nine types of chlorzoxazone matrix tablets were obtained using the direct compression method, and their combination at 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 chlorzoxazone/ excipients, 20%-40% (w/w) Kollidon®SR, 3-7% (w/w) chitosan and the auxiliary substances were formulated in constant concentrations. Pharmaco-technical characterization included the analysis of flowability and compressibility properties (flow time, friction coefficient, angle of repose, Hausner ratio, Carr Index), and of pharmaco-chemical characteristics (mass and dose uniformity, thickness, diameter, mechanical strength, Friability, degree of softening, in vitro release profile) of the tablets. Based on the initial evaluation of the pharmaco-technical analysis, pharmaco-chemical characteristics, and in vitro release profile, only three matrix tablet formulations (F1b, F2b, and F3b) were further tested. They were evaluated through Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry, X-ray Diffraction, thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, and in vitro dissolution tests. The three formulations were comparatively studied regarding the release kinetics of active substances using in vitro release testing. The results were analyzed by fitting into four representative mathematical models for the modified release oral formulations. In vitro kinetic study reveals a complex mechanism of release occurring in the first (0 - 2 hours) and second (2.0 hours – 36 hours) steps of drug release. Two factors have been calculated to assess the release profile of chlorzoxazone: f1 - the similarity factor and f2 - the factor difference. The results have shown that both Kollidon®SR and chitosan may be used as matrix-forming agents when combined with chlorzoxazone. In vitro dissolution tests revealed the F2b sample, data suggesting a faster drug release. The three formulations showed optimum pharmaco-technical properties and in vitro kinetic study, and they had tremendous potential to be used in oral pharmaceutical products for the controlled delivery of chlorzoxazone.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2db8f2f316c9ad76d831ea5c931d7a15c1563ce3761b25dd00f38b1da27f5198","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
