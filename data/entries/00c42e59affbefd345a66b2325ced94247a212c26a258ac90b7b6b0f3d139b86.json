{"title":"Safeguard the endemic species of Honduras | Science","link":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp8662","date":1724936460000,"content":"The Swan Islands, three remote islands in the Caribbean Sea, are home to several endemic species. In 1991, the islands were designated as the Abogado Agustín Córdoba Rodríguez Marine National Park (1). However, the Honduran Naval Force has custody of the islands (1), and researchers are often denied access to them (2). The Honduran government is now moving forward with plans to establish a correctional facility for prisoners within the park’s borders on Great Swan Island (3, 4), putting endemic species at risk.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"00c42e59affbefd345a66b2325ced94247a212c26a258ac90b7b6b0f3d139b86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
