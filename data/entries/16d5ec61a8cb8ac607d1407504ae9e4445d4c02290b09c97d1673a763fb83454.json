{"title":"A New Method for Deriving High-Vertical-Resolution Wind Vector Data from the L-Band Radar Sounding System in China","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00376-024-3163-5","date":1730419200000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>High-vertical-resolution radiosonde wind data are highly valuable for describing the dynamics of the meso- and microscale atmosphere. However, the current algorithm used in Chinaâ€™s L-band radar sounding system for calculating high-vertical-resolution wind vectors excessively smooths the data, resulting in significant underestimation of the calculated kinetic energy of gravity waves compared to similar products from other countries, which greatly limits the effective utilization of the data. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel method to calculate high-vertical-resolution wind vectors that utilizes the elevation angle, azimuth angle, and slant range from L-band radar. In order to obtain wind data with a stable quality, a two-step automatic quality control procedure, including the RMSE-F (root-mean-square error F) test and elemental consistency test are first applied to the slant range data, to eliminate continuous erroneous data caused by unstable signals or radar malfunctions. Then, a wind calculation scheme based on a sliding second-order polynomial fitting is utilized to derive the high-vertical-resolution radiosonde wind vectors. The evaluation results demonstrate that the wind data obtained through the proposed method show a high level of consistency with the high-resolution wind data observed using the Vaisala Global Positioning System and the data observed by the new Beidou Navigation Sounding System. The calculation of the kinetic energy of gravity waves in the recalculated wind data also reaches a level comparable to the Vaisala observations.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"16d5ec61a8cb8ac607d1407504ae9e4445d4c02290b09c97d1673a763fb83454","category":"Environment"}
