{"title":"BESO and SESO: Comparative Analysis of Spatial Structures Considering Self-Weight and Structural Reliability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1618/v1","date":1719222585000,"content":"A comparative analysis between Bidirectional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (BESO) and Smoothing-ESO (SESO), simultaneously considering Reliability-Based Topology Optimization (RBTO) and the structure's self-weight in the case of three-dimensional elasticity, is presented in this study. Due to the important role of the existence of uncertainties in making the structural design more realistic, geometry, volumetric fraction, modulus of elasticity, compliance, and loading are considered random variables with normal probability distribution. When adopting the First Order Reliability Method (FORM), the failure probability is calculated based on the reliability index. Furthermore, considering the influence of self-weight in problems involving large structures in civil engineering, especially in the case of bridges, makes the optimal configuration more reliable for design. A series of examples are covered to validate the methods presented, showing their efficiency and robustness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76f231afa37e482ce4162ef868e2e5cebf93b47c147844919e158838d1846321","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
