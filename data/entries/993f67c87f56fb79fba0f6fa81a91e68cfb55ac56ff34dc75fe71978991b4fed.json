{"title":"ARIMA Models and Parallel Computing Applied to Anemia Diagnosis in Children Under 36 Months in Juninn Region, Peru","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2444/v1","date":1722408302000,"content":"This research explores the application of ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models and parallel computing techniques to analyze and forecast anemia diagnoses in children under 36 months in the Jun√≠n region of Peru. Using health data from 2023-2024, including insurance type, patient information, diagnosis dates, hemoglobin levels, and treatment details, we develop predictive models to understand trends and patterns in childhood anemia. The study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of time series analysis and high-performance computing in addressing this critical public health issue. Results indicate improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency, potentially aiding in resource allocation and policy development for anemia prevention and treatment programs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"993f67c87f56fb79fba0f6fa81a91e68cfb55ac56ff34dc75fe71978991b4fed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
