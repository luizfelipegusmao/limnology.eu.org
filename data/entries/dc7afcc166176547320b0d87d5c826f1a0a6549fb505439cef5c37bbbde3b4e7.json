There has been no comparison between these med-ications and standard treatment (without antiviral). Our study aimed to examine the con-tribution of each regimen compared to standard treatment on the survival of EVD patients and assess whether this association was modified by EVD vaccination (rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine) status.\nMethodology: We performed a secondary analysis of data obtained from four EVD treatment centers located in Katwa, Mangina, Butembo, and Beni in the North Kivu region. The main outcome measure was mortality within a 28-day period. A Cox model was used to identify predictors of survival in hospitalized EVD patients. \nResults: Vaccinated EVD patients were 1.7 times less likely to die compared to unvac-cinated patients (3.70 days vs. 5.00 days; p=0.0002). Delaying care and treatment at EVD treatment centres increased mortality risk by 5% for each day following symptom onset. Compared to the standard treatment group, adjusted mortality rates were significantly re-duced in the groups receiving MAb114 (0.29, p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc7afcc166176547320b0d87d5c826f1a0a6549fb505439cef5c37bbbde3b4e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
