{"title":"Comprehensive Analysis of Various Parkinson-Like Events and Induced Drugs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0258/v1","date":1717568700000,"content":"Parkinson-like events are side effects that may persist for an extended period even after drug administration is discontinued. Although these events can be triggered by various drugs, the mechanisms underlying their diverse symptoms remain largely unclear. To investigate this, we used the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Reporting Database, which is maintained by the Phar-maceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, to analyze the risk factors associated with Parkinson-like events along with associated drug trends and characteristics. Our findings indicate that similar to　Parkinson’s disease, age-related differences affect the onset of these events, with older individuals being more susceptible. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis revealed that the mechanisms triggering these Parkinson-like events are consistent across reports, suggesting a common underlying cause. However, even with a consistent mechanism, side effects can vary depending on the site of action. These insights underline the importance of swift identification of the drugs suspected of causing these events and implementation of measures to reduce their side effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40a5a2ec24600b11a730cf5dc270cf92f4a1842ad2e04b27564c744ccdc7cfac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
