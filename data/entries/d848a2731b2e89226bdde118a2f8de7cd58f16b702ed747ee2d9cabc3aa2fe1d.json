{"title":"Transcription factor GmAlfin09 regulates endoplasmic reticulum stress in soybean via peroxidase GmPRDX6","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/592/7687020?rss=1","date":1717372800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Soybean (<span>Glycine max</span> [L.] Merr.) is a valuable oil crop but is also highly susceptible to environmental stress. Thus, developing approaches to enhance soybean stress resistance is vital to soybean yield improvement. In previous studies, transcription factor Alfin has been shown to serve as an epigenetic regulator of plant growth and development. However, no studies on Alfin have yet been reported in soybean. In this study, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related GmAlfin09 was identified. Screening of genes co-expressed with <span>GmAlfin09</span> unexpectedly led to the identification of <span>soybean peroxidase 6</span> (<span>GmPRDX6</span>). Further analyses revealed that both GmAlfin09 and GmPRDX6 were responsive to ER stress, with GmPRDX6 localizing to the ER under stress. Promoter binding experiments confirmed the ability of GmAlfin09 to bind to the <span>GmPRDX6</span> promoter directly. When <span>GmAlfin09</span> and <span>GmPRDX6</span> were overexpressed in soybean, enhanced ER stress resistance and decreased ROS levels were observed. Together, these findings suggest that GmAlfin09 promotes the upregulation of <span>GmPRDX6</span>, and GmPRDX6 subsequently localizes to the ER, reduces ROS levels, promotes ER homeostasis, and ensures the normal growth of soybean even under ER stress. This study highlights a vital target gene for future molecular breeding of stress-resistant soybean lines.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"d848a2731b2e89226bdde118a2f8de7cd58f16b702ed747ee2d9cabc3aa2fe1d","category":"Environment"}
