{"title":"Genetic Evaluation of Monthly Test Day Milk Yields of Jersey Crossbred Cattle under Farmers’ Production System in Tamil Nadu, India","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0968/v1","date":1723588700000,"content":"Tamil Nadu, a state in southern India, is bereft of any native milch or dual-purpose cattle breed and the state depends chiefly on crossbred cattle for milk production. As most (90 percent) of the milk production in the state was contributed by Jersey crossbred cattle, the genetic evaluation study was intended to assess the milk production traits viz., test-day milk yields (TDMYs), total milk yield (TMY) and 305-day milk yield (305MY) in these crossbred cattle reared under farmers’ rearing environment. Data on monthly TDMYs (TDMY1 to TDMY10) of Jersey crossbred cows (n=81,653) reared by the farmers over 24 years (1999-2022) were collected for evaluation. The influence of non-genetic factors viz., location (agroclimatic zones), period and season of calving, and parity on TDMYs, TMY, and 305MY were assessed, and the variance and covariance components for genetic parameters (heritability and genetic correlation) of the traits were estimated by the method of restricted maximum likelihood (REML) under multivariate animal model and by random regression model (RRM). The overall means of various TDMYs ranged from 4.98 (TDMY10) to 9.95 kg (TDMY2) and, for TMY and 305MY the means were 2480.33 and 2393.71 kg respectively. The heritabilities estimated by animal model for TDMYs were high and ranged from 0.39 ± 0.01 to 0.47 ± 0.01 and were fairly less variable throughout the lactation while the estimates obtained by RRM were medium to high and ranged between 0.28 ± 0.01 and 0.65 ± 0.02 for different days in milk (DIMs). The heritability estimated for TMY and 305MY were 0.48 ± 0.01 and 0.49 ± 0.01 respectively. The estimates of heritability in mid-lactation yields were comparatively little less than those at the beginning and the end of lactation. The high estimates of heritabilities for TDMYs, TMY, and 305MY obtained in the present study offered an ample scope for improving milk production through selective breeding. Genetic correlations between TDMYs estimated by animal model were positive and moderate to high, with a range between 0.47 ± 0.01 and 0.99 ± 0.00. Considerably higher estimates (0.97-0.99) were observed between adjacent TDMYs showing strong genetic associations. By RRM, genetic correlations estimated between DIMs were positive, except for a few estimates and the magnitude of genetic correlation decreased with an increase in the interval between the DIMs. The high genetic correlation observed between the TDMYs in early and mid stages of lactation with TMY and 305MY suggested that these test day yields could be used favorably for the early selection of cows for milk production which facilitates reduction in the generation interval and consequently increase the annual genetic gain for the milk production traits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45f89acde92c59a2417f288ca96cfafcd79b50f040d627167e9bb047e354d871","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
