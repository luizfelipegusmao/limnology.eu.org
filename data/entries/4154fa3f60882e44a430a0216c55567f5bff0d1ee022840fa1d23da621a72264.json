{"title":"Upper thermal tolerance and population implications for the Magdalena River stingray Potamotrygon magdalenae","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15668?af=R","date":1709197765000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Knowledge of thermal tolerance limits provides important clues to the capacity of a species to withstand acute and chronic thermal changes. Climate models predict the increase and intensification of events such as heat waves, therefore understanding the upper thermal limits that a species can tolerate has become of utmost importance. We measured the upper thermal tolerance of the endemic Magdalena river stingray <i>Potamotrygon magdalenae</i> acclimated to experimental conditions, and then used critical thermal methodology to find the temperature at which an organism reaches a critical endpoint where locomotory activity becomes disorganized and the animal loses its ability to escape from conditions that will promptly lead to its death. We also describe the behavioral response of individuals to acute thermal stress and infer the possible consequences of temperature increases in the habitats of <i>P. magdalenae</i> populations. There were no significant differences between sexes in temperature tolerance or behavior. The critical thermal maximum (39°C) was 5.9°C above the maximum recorded temperature for the study area. Although <i>P. magdalenae</i> was tolerant to high temperature and currently is not living at its upper thermal limit, its survival in Guarinocito Pond will be threatened if temperatures continue to increase, considering the warming scenarios predicted for tropical regions due to climate change, even including short-term climate phenomena such as El Niño.</p>","author":"Daniela Gómez‐Martínez, \nEdgardo Londoño‐Cruz, \nPaola Andrea Mejía‐Falla","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"4154fa3f60882e44a430a0216c55567f5bff0d1ee022840fa1d23da621a72264","category":"Environment"}
