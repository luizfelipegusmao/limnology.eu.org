{"title":"The Role of the Epikarst in Feature Development in Climatic Karsts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2176/v1","date":1721991831000,"content":"This study describes the relationship between the epikarst and the surface karst of climatic karsts. Bedrock resistivity values along VES measurements were measured and calculated. The elevation difference between the surface and the karstwater table and the annual distribution of precipitation were calculated in certain karst areas. The resistivity of the epikarst can be high (drawdown dolines) and low (subsidence dolines). In the former case, the cavity index and the vertical drainage of the epikarst are heterogeneous, while in the latter they are homogeneous. Considering the above characteristics, two types of doline development are possible. A feature development controlled by the epikarst (tajga karst, soil-covered karst of the temperate belt, glaciokarst), by the epikarst and the karstwater (polje karst, fengcong karst), and controlled predominantly by karstwater (intermountain plain of fenglin karst, tropical karren). At feature development controlled by the epikarst, drawdown dolines (soil-covered karst) and subsidence dolines (covered karst) develop, in the case of feature development controlled by the epikarst and karstwater, drawdown dolines, subsidence dolines and feature assemblages with subsidence dolines and katavotra (polje karst, fengcong karst) are formed. At feature development controlled predominantly by karstwater, subsidence dolines (intermountain plain of fenglin karst), and giant grikes (tropical karren) develop.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe2ff1f2b5d101ae3eac61cf65ef703a8c4695fc94b7e7464afe3d2e5c2414c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
