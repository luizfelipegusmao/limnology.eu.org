{"title":"Construction and Stability of All-in-One Adenovirus Vectors Simultaneously Expressing Four and Eight Multiplex Guide RNAs and Cas9 Nickase","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1092/v1","date":1718606101000,"content":"CRISPR/Cas9 technology is expected to offer novel genome editing-related therapies for various diseases. We previously showed that an adenovirus vector (AdV) possessing eight expression units of multiplex guide RNAs (gRNAs) was obtained with no deletion of these units. Here, we attempted to construct “all-in-one” AdVs possessing expression units of four and eight gRNAs with Cas9 nickase. We expected this to be difficult because extremely high copies of viral genomes during replication may cause severe off-target cleavages of host cells and induce homologous recombination. However, four units in the all-in-one AdV genome were maintained completely intact. For all-in-one AdV containing eight gRNA units, we shortened the U6 promoter of the gRNA expression units and enlarged the E3 deletion in the vector backbone to shorten the AdV genome within the adenovirus packaging limits. The final size of the all-in-one AdV genome containing eight gRNA units still slightly exceeded the reported upper limit. Nevertheless, approximately one-third of the eight units remained intact even upon preparation for in vivo experiments. Although the genome editing efficiency unexpectedly decreased upon enlarging the E3 deletion, our results suggested that all-in-one AdVs containing four and eight intact gRNA units could be obtained if the problems caused by the excessive size of the vector genome are solved.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0e9c92fc5ed288b6d4b2f42747dfe7ea7cc33e6498568d6dca360bb0a56f5f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
