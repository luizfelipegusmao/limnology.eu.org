Evaluations of the proposed method show that compared to random neural network methods, nearest neighbor, and support vector machine, the accuracy of attack detection improves up to 99.49 percent, and the random neural network method has been able to improve by 99.01 percent, placing the best methods together in these experiments in the form of a multi-learning model showed that the results also had an increase in accuracy up to 99.56 percent, while the training time in the proposed model is less compared to the random neural network method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c2acd5ea836a347b3fc051d58c004bc7b0f294a9681bd93c75b21502e835d6e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
