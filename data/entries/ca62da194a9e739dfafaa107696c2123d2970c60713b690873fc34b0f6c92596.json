{"title":"Predictors of cochlear implant outcomes in pediatric auditory neuropathy: A matched case-control study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304316","date":1716991200000,"content":"<p>by Zahra Jafari, Elizabeth M. Fitzpatrick, David R. Schramm, Isabelle Rouillon, Amineh Koravand</p>\r\nObjectives <p>Current evidence supports the benefits of cochlear implants (CIs) in children with hearing loss, including those with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD). However, there is limited evidence regarding factors that hold predictive value for intervention outcomes.</p> Design <p>This retrospective case-control study consisted of 66 children with CIs, including 22 with ANSD and 44 with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) matched on sex, age, age at CI activation, and the length of follow-up with CIs (1:2 ratio). The case and control groups were compared in the results of five open-set speech perception tests, and a Forward Linear Regression Model was used to identify factors that can predict the post-CI outcomes.</p> Results <p>There was no significant difference in average scores between the two groups across five outcome measures, ranging from 88.40% to 95.65%. The correlation matrix revealed that younger ages at hearing aid fitting and CI activation positively influenced improvements in speech perception test scores. Furthermore, among the variables incorporated in the regression model, the duration of follow-up with CIs, age at CI activation, and the utilization of two CIs demonstrated prognostic significance for improved post-CI speech perception outcomes.</p> Conclusions <p>Children with ANSD can achieve similar open-set speech perception outcomes as children with SNHL. A longer CI follow-up, a lower age at CI activation, and the use of two CIs are predictive for optimal CI outcome.</p>","author":"Zahra Jafari","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ca62da194a9e739dfafaa107696c2123d2970c60713b690873fc34b0f6c92596","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
