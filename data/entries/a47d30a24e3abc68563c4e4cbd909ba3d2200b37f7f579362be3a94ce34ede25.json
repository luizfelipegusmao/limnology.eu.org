{"title":"Rigid Polynomial Differential Systems with Homogeneous Nonlinearities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1946/v1","date":1721814202000,"content":"Planar differential systems whose angular velocity is constant are called rigid differential systems. We characterize the existence and non-existence of limit cycles, and the finite and infinite singularities of the rigid polynomial differential systems with homogeneous nonlinearities of arbitrary degree in the Poincaré disc. Moreover, we classify the phase portraits in the Poincaré disc of the rigid polynomial differential systems of degree two, and of one class of rigid polynomial differential systems with cubic homogeneous nonlinearitie that can exhibit one limit cycle.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a47d30a24e3abc68563c4e4cbd909ba3d2200b37f7f579362be3a94ce34ede25","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
