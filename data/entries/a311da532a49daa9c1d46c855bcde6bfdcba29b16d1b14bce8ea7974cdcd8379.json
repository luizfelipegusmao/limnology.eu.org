{"title":"Model Order Reduction and Stability Enhancement Control for AC/DC Converters Through State Feedback Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2189/v1","date":1727433073000,"content":"In the DC distribution networks, DC bus voltage is maintained by the grid-connected converter, the controllability and reliability of the grid-connected converter significantly affects the bus voltage characteristic. To address the problem of limited stability and frequent oscillations, this paper proposes a state feedback control method for the AC/DC converter. Conventional AC/DC converter adopts the voltage-current double-closed-loop control structure with the proportional integral (PI) controllers, which is the equivalent of the typical type II control system, but the typical type II control system cannot fully settle the stability and immunity problems. In contrast, the state feedback control strategy not only achieves the control objectives of the traditional double-closed-loop control, but also reduce the AC/DC converter system model to a typical I-type system, which improves the stability, thus enhances the oscillation suppression capability of the bus voltage. By selecting multiple state variables and designing the converter pole configuration range, the proposed single-loop state feedback control method manages to optimize both the dynamic and steady-state performances of the grid-connected AC/DC converter. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed single-loop state feedback control strategy has been verified by both the simulation and experiment results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a311da532a49daa9c1d46c855bcde6bfdcba29b16d1b14bce8ea7974cdcd8379","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
