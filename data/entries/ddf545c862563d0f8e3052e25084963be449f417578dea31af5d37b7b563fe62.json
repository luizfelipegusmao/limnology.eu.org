The application of stresses such as elevated temperature, modified gas phases, or externally applied electric fields can alter interface structures and, therefore, modify microstructures and macroscopic materials properties. During sintering of ceramics from powder compacts the application of electric fields can lead to enhanced densification rates [<a href=\"#ozae044.769-B1\">1</a>] while also modifying grain growth behavior [<a href=\"#ozae044.769-B2\">2â€“4</a>]. Majidi et al. used <span>in-situ</span> transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to demonstrate that electric fields, in the absence of any current flow, can enhance densification by lowering the onset temperature for consolidation of yttrium-stabilized zirconia [<a href=\"#ozae044.769-B5\">5</a>]. However, the fundamental mechanisms for these observations remain unclear, but must be related to the interaction of externally applied electric fields with the emerging grain boundary networks.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ddf545c862563d0f8e3052e25084963be449f417578dea31af5d37b7b563fe62","category":"Environment"}
