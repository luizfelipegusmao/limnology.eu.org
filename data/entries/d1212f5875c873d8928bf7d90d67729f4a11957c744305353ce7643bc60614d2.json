{"title":"The synergy of renewable energy consumption, technological innovation, and ecological quality: SDG policy proposals for developing country","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12404?af=R","date":1706676865000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The rapid growth of technological innovations and human activities has led to significant adverse effects on the environment and its quality. To assess ecological quality, this study utilizes a comprehensive indicator known as the “load capacity factor,” which incorporates two key ecological components: bio-capacity and ecological footprints. By employing dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (DYARDL) and spectral causality approaches, the research investigates the impact of fossil fuel consumption, technological innovation, and renewable energy utilization on improving ecological quality from 1990 to 2018. The DYARDL analysis reveals that economic expansion and reliance on fossil fuel energy contribute to a decline in environmental quality, whereas the use of renewable energy enhances ecological sustainability. Moreover, the spectral causality analysis indicates that fossil fuel consumption, renewable energy usage, and economic growth can predict the load capacity factor in the long run. These findings underscore the significance of renewable energy in achieving long-term environmental objectives. Based on these outcomes, it is recommended that policymakers in South Africa implement measures to reduce ecological damage and foster a more sustainable environment. Emphasizing the adoption of renewable energy sources is crucial for attaining these long-term environmental targets.</p>","author":"Haowen Fang, \nEvidence Akhayere, \nTomiwa Sunday Adebayo, \nDoga Kavaz, \nOluwaseun Racheal Ojekemi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"d1212f5875c873d8928bf7d90d67729f4a11957c744305353ce7643bc60614d2","category":"Environment"}
