{"title":"Comparative analysis of the complete chloroplast genomes of thirteen <i>Bougainvillea</i> cultivars from South China with implications for their genome structures and phylogenetic relationships","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310091","date":1726063200000,"content":"<p>by Xiao-Ye Wu, He-Fa Wang, Shui-Ping Zou, Lan Wang, Gen-Fa Zhu, Dong-Mei Li</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Bougainvillea</i> spp., belonging to the Nyctaginaceae family, have high economic and horticultural value in South China. Despite the high similarity in terms of leaf appearance and hybridization among <i>Bougainvillea</i> species, especially <i>Bougainvillea</i> × <i>buttiana</i>, their phylogenetic relationships are very complicated and controversial. In this study, we sequenced, assembled and analyzed thirteen complete chloroplast genomes of <i>Bougainvillea</i> cultivars from South China, including ten <i>B</i>. × <i>buttiana</i> cultivars and three other <i>Bougainvillea</i> cultivars, and identified their phylogenetic relationships within the <i>Bougainvillea</i> genus and other species of the Nyctaginaceae family for the first time. These 13 chloroplast genomes had typical quadripartite structures, comprising a large single-copy (LSC) region (85,169–85,695 bp), a small single-copy (SSC) region (18,050–21,789 bp), and a pair of inverted-repeat (IR) regions (25,377–25,426 bp). These genomes each contained 112 different genes, including 79 protein-coding genes, 29 tRNAs and 4 rRNAs. The gene content, codon usage, simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and long repeats were essentially conserved among these 13 genomes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels) were detected among these 13 genomes. Four divergent regions, namely, <i>trnH-GUG_psbA</i>, <i>trnS-GCU_trnG-UCC-exon1</i>, <i>trnS-GGA_rps4</i>, and <i>ccsA_ndhD</i>, were identified from the comparative analysis of 16 <i>Bougainvillea</i> cultivar genomes. Among the 46 chloroplast genomes of the Nyctaginaceae family, nine genes, namely, <i>rps12</i>, <i>rbcL</i>, <i>ndhF</i>, <i>rpoB</i>, <i>rpoC2</i>, <i>ndhI</i>, <i>psbT</i>, <i>ycf2</i>, and <i>ycf3</i>, were found to be under positive selection at the amino acid site level. Phylogenetic relationships within the <i>Bougainvillea</i> genus and other species of the Nyctaginaceae family based on complete chloroplast genomes and protein-coding genes revealed that the <i>Bougainvillea</i> genus was a sister to the <i>Belemia</i> genus with strong support and that 35 <i>Bougainvillea</i> individuals were divided into 4 strongly supported clades, namely, Clades Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ and Ⅳ. Clade Ⅰ included 6 individuals, which contained 2 cultivars, namely, <i>B</i>. <i>× buttiana</i> ‘Gautama’s Red’ and <i>B</i>. <i>spectabilis</i> ‘Flame’. Clades Ⅱ only contained <i>Bougainvillea spinosa</i>. Clade Ⅲ comprised 7 individuals of wild species. Clade Ⅳ included 21 individuals and contained 11 cultivars, namely, <i>B</i>. <i>× buttiana</i> ‘Mahara’, <i>B</i>. <i>× buttiana</i> ‘California Gold’, <i>B</i>. <i>× buttiana</i> ‘Double Salmon’, <i>B</i>. <i>× buttiana</i> ‘Double Yellow’, <i>B</i>. <i>× buttiana</i> ‘Los Banos Beauty’, <i>B</i>. <i>× buttiana</i> ‘Big Chitra’, <i>B</i>. <i>× buttiana</i> ‘San Diego Red’, <i>B</i>. <i>× buttiana</i> ‘Barbara Karst’, <i>B</i>. <i>glabra ‘</i>White Stripe’, <i>B</i>. <i>spectabilis</i> ‘Splendens’ and <i>B</i>. <i>× buttiana</i> ‘Miss Manila’ sp. 1. In conclusion, this study not only provided valuable genome resources but also helped to identify <i>Bougainvillea</i> cultivars and understand the chloroplast genome evolution of the Nyctaginaceae family.","author":"Xiao-Ye Wu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"172f5f24dff7f5fbefe7bee0333714fa2bfc56536476f7b7ce64a86250c9638e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
