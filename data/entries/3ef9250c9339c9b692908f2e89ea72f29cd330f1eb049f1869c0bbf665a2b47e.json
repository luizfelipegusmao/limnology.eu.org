{"title":"Methodology For Automating And Orchestrating Performance Evaluation Of Kubernetes Container Network Interfaces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1592/v1","date":1721377898000,"content":"In the dynamic realm of HPC (High-performance computing) and cloud-native applications, ensuring optimal network performance for Kubernetes Container Network Interfaces (CNIs) is critical. Traditional manual methods for evaluating network bandwidth and latency are prone to errors, time-consuming, and lack consistency. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages Ansible to automate and coordinate network performance tests across diverse CNIs, performance profiles, and configurations. By automating these processes, we eliminate the potential for human errors, ensure the ability to replicate the process, and significantly reduce the time required for comprehensive testing. The use of Ansible playbooks facilitates the efficient and scalable deployment, configuration, and execution of performance tests, enabling comprehensive and standardized benchmarking across various environments. The set of Ansible playbooks, which we will make available online, has a significant real-world impact by providing DevOps teams with robust and reliable tools for consistently monitoring and enhancing network performance. This, in turn, enhances the stability and efficiency of cloud-native applications, accelerates the development cycle, and ensures that Kubernetes-based infrastructures can meet the demanding performance requirements of modern applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ef9250c9339c9b692908f2e89ea72f29cd330f1eb049f1869c0bbf665a2b47e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
