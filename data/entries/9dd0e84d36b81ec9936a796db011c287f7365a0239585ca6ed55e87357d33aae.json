{"title":"Parity and post-reproductive mortality among U.S. Black and White women: Evidence from the health and retirement study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310629","date":1726754400000,"content":"<p>by Cheryl Elman, Angela M. O’Rand, Andrew S. London</p>\r\n\r\nPopulation health research finds women’s mortality risk associated with childlessness, low parity (one child), and high parity (6+ children) in a U-shaped pattern, although U.S. studies are inconsistent overall and by race/ethnicity. Parity, however, is contingent on women’s biophysiological likelihood of (in)fecundity as well as voluntary control practices that limit fertility. No studies have empirically examined infecundity differentials among women and their potential contribution to the parity–post-reproductive mortality relationship or the race/ethnic-related mortality gap. We examine 7,322 non-Hispanic Black and White women, born 1920–1941, in the Health and Retirement Study, using zero-inflation methods to estimate infecundity risk and parity by race/ethnicity. We estimate proportional hazards models [t<sub>0</sub> 1992/1998, t<sub>1</sub> 2018] to examine associations of infecundity risk, parity, early-life-course health and social statuses, and post-reproductive statuses with all-cause mortality. We find Black women’s infecundity probability to be twice that of White women and their expected parity 40% higher. Infecundity risk increases mortality risk for all women, but parity–post-reproductive mortality associations differ by race/ethnicity. White women with one and 5+ children (U-shaped curve) have increased mortality risk, adjusting for infecundity risk and early-life factors; further adjustment for post-reproductive health and social status attenuates all parity-related mortality risk. Black women’s parity–post-reproductive mortality associations are not statistically significant. Black women’s post-reproductive mortality risk is anchored in earlier-life conditions that elevate infecundity risk. Results suggest a need to focus upstream to better elucidate race/ethnic-related social determinants of reproductive health, infecundity, parity, and mortality.","author":"Cheryl Elman","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9dd0e84d36b81ec9936a796db011c287f7365a0239585ca6ed55e87357d33aae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
