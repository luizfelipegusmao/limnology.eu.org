{"title":"Increased alertness and moderate ingroup cohesion in bonobosâ€™ response to outgroup cues","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307975","date":1724248800000,"content":"<p>by James Brooks, Karlijn van Heijst, Amanda Epping, Seok Hwan Lee, Aslihan Niksarli, Amy Pope, Zanna Clay, Mariska E.

However, the distribution and selection history of this association across species with varied intergroup relations remains unclear. Using a sample of 8 captive groups (N = 43 individuals), we here tested whether bonobos, like chimpanzees, show more affiliative ingroup behaviour following perception of outgroup cues (unfamiliar male long-distance vocalisations). We used comparable methods to our previous study of captive chimpanzees, and found that, although weaker, there was an association for more frequent social grooming in response to the outgroup condition than the control condition, alongside more alert posture and increased self-directed behaviour. This provides preliminary evidence for an ancestral origin to the proximate association between outgroup cues and ingroup cohesion, at least prior to the <i>Pan-Homo</i> split, and suggests the presence of intergroup competition in our last common ancestor.","author":"James Brooks","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3aeb9a7b92ee7c9ce2f5d4596907870c7a8360557ce96c01a2461347e70451e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
