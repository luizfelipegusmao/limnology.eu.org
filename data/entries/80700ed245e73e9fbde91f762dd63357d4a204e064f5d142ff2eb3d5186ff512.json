{"title":"Incorporation Impact of Fucoxanthin‚ÄêLoaded Nanoliposome in Yogurt on Its Antioxidant, Physicochemical and Rheological Properties under Cold Storage Condition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1508/v1","date":1721382978000,"content":"In the pursuit of functional foods that promote health, nanoliposomal carriers have been used to enhance the stability and functionality of dairy products such as yogurt, promising therapeutic benefits. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of fucoxanthin-loaded nanoliposomes in yogurt on its antioxidant, physico-chemical, and rheological properties under cold storage (21 days). Fucoxanthin-loaded nanoliposomes were prepared using the ultrasonic film dispersion technique and added at concentrations of 0%, 5% and 10% at the yogurt (Y-C, Y-FXN-5, Y-FXN-10). Homogeneous and uniform nanoliposomes (98.28 nm) were ob-tained, preserving their integrity and functionality, and ensuring prolonged release and bioavailability of fucoxanthin. Y-FXN-10 maintained the highest antioxidant activity according to the DPPH (52.96%), ABTS (97.97%), and FRAP (3.16 mmol ET/g) methods. This formulation exhibited enhanced erythroprotective potential, inhibiting hemolysis, photohemolysis, and heat-induced hemolysis, thereby preventing lipid pe-roxidation. However, viscosity and firmness decreased, affecting the texture and appearance. Sensory properties such as color, flavor, aftertaste, texture, and overall acceptance improved with the 10% fuco-xanthin-enriched yogurt formulation. These results suggest that nanoliposomal are suitable for carries fuco-xanthin, their incorporation into food matrices is key to developing functional foods. Regulatory approvals and consumer perceptions regarding nanotechnology-based products must be addressed, emphasizing their safety and health benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"80700ed245e73e9fbde91f762dd63357d4a204e064f5d142ff2eb3d5186ff512","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
