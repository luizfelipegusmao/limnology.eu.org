{"title":"Arbuscular Mycorrhizae for Sustainable Cultivation of Grasses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1804/v1","date":1711704312000,"content":"This study focuses on solving rural problems, sustaining environmental conditions, pastures improvement, and reduction of CO2 concentration, suggesting inoculated vegetation types found in the tropics as a nature-based solution for degraded agroecosystems. Noninoculated plants are intensively used for revegetation of degraded and mined lands, AMF taxonomic and plant-fungal ecological studies. Among those grasses, Urochloa brizantha is a tropical forage, having vigorous deep roots, commonly used for arbuscular mycorrhizae (AMF) multiplication in glasshouse and nursery, developing infective propagules to be conserved in germplasm banks. Other grass species, such as Urochloa decumbens, is also used for arbuscular mycorrhizal multiplication in addition to its cultivation for guaranteeing the sustainable of livestock systems. In the present study, a site of 100 m2 was selected to take soil samples in a plain area, with U. brizantha pasture, and the soil chemical characterization, microcharcoal content and AMF spore identification, were evaluated 3+6showing high amount of potassium (K), high microcharcoal content and the occurrence of 11.32 spores of AMF, most of Glomeraceae, in the rhizosphere of U. brizantha. Due to its economic importance for sustainable agricultural production and other uses besides its environmental services, as important promoters of soil carbon on grazing lands, more detailed research is needed on the biotic interactions and inoculant production in of the studied grasses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e47402910c756d3401d32b2bbae09344b81ec1a3bd123c5e71486fc1580f772","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
