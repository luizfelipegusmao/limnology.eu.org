{"title":"Long noncoding RNA VPS9D1‐AS1 promotes the progression of endometrial cancer via regulation of the miR‐187‐3p/S100A4 axis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24351?af=R","date":1719915937000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>VPS9D1-AS1 functions as an oncogene in many cancers. However, its role and potential mechanism in the progression of endometrial cancer (EC) are not fully understood. VPS9D1-AS1 levels in EC and adjacent normal tissues were investigated using the TCGA-UCEC cohort and 24 paired clinical samples. The roles of VPS9D1-AS1 and miR-187-3p in cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis were evaluated by loss- and gain-of-function experiments. In addition, the effect of VPS9D1-AS1 on tumor growth was further investigated in vivo. Rescue experiments were performed to investigate the involvement of the miR-187-3p/S100A4 axis in VPS9D1-AS1 knockdown-mediated antitumor effects. VPS9D1-AS1 was highly expressed in EC tissues. VPS9D1-AS1 knockdown, similar to miR-187-3p overexpression, significantly inhibited cell proliferation, inhibited colony formation, induced cell cycle arrest, and facilitated apoptosis of KLE cells. MiR-187-3p bound directly to VPS9D1-AS1 and the 3′UTR of S100A4. Furthermore, VPS9D1-AS1 negatively regulated miR-187-3p while positively regulating S100A4 expression in EC cells. MiR-187-3p knockdown or S100A4 overexpression partially reversed the tumor suppressive function of VPS9D1-AS1 knockdown. The results suggest that VPS9D1-AS1 affects EC progression by regulating the miR-187-3p/S100A4 axis. This may provide a promising therapeutic target to help treat EC.</p>","author":"Wei Ren, \nLing Ouyang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"7d057a56a9be6c41d34661581941cf5e7c53da5ee8c92a445025b70b7b298f1e","category":"Environment"}
