{"title":"Transcription factor OsMYB30 increases trehalose content to inhibit α-amylase and seed germination at low temperature","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1815/7459808?rss=1","date":1701820800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Low-temperature germination (LTG) is an important agronomic trait for direct-seeding cultivation of rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>). Both OsMYB30 and OsTPP1 regulate the cold stress response in rice, but the function of OsMYB30 and OsTPP1 in regulating LTG and the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. Employing transcriptomics and functional studies revealed a sugar signaling pathway that regulates seed germination in response to low temperature (LT). Expression of <span>OsMYB30</span> and <span>OsTPP1</span> was induced by LT during seed germination, and overexpressing either <span>OsMYB30</span> or <span>OsTPP1</span> delayed seed germination and increased sensitivity to LT during seed germination. Transcriptomics and qPCR revealed that expression of <span>OsTPP1</span> was upregulated in <span>OsMYB30</span>-overexpressing lines but downregulated in <span>OsMYB30</span>-knockout lines. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that OsMYB30 bound to the promoter of <span>OsTPP1</span> and regulated the abundance of <span>OsTPP1</span> transcripts. Overaccumulation of trehalose (Tre) was found in both <span>OsMYB30</span>- and <span>OsTPP1</span>-overexpressing lines, resulting in inhibition of <span>α-amylase 1a</span> (<span>OsAMY1a</span>) gene during seed germination. Both LT and exogenous Tre treatments suppressed the expression of <span>OsAMY1a</span>, and the <span>osamy1a</span> mutant was not sensitive to exogenous Tre during seed germination. Overall, we concluded that <span>OsMYB30</span> expression was induced by LT to activate the expression of <span>OsTPP1</span> and increase Tre content, which thus inhibited α-amylase activity and seed germination. This study identified a phytohormone-independent pathway that integrates environmental cues with internal factors to control seed germination.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"fe6e732e3e0778b972113251fc21473c95673e947109f02e2213fcfc66bfa13b","category":"Environment"}
