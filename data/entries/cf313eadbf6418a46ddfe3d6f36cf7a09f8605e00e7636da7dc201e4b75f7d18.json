Many novel technologies are being employed to ensure the safety and reliability of grain supply and production. Gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) can effectively separate and sensitively detect volatile organic compounds. It possesses advantages such as speed, convenience, high sensitivity, no pretreatment, and wide applicability. In recent years, many studies have shown that the application of GC-IMS technology for grain flavor analysis can play a crucial role in grains. This article elucidates the working principle of GC-IMS technology, reviews the application of GC-IMS in grains in the past 5 years. GC-IMS technology is mainly applied in four aspects in grains. In grain classification, it distinguishes varieties, quality, origin, production year, and processing methods based on the trace differences in volatile organic compounds, thereby fulfilling various grain classification requirements such as origin tracing, geographical indication product recognition, variety identification, production year identification, and detection of counterfeit and inferior grain samples. In optimizing the processing technology of grains and their products, it can improve food flavor, reduce undesirable flavors, and identify better processing parameters. In grain storage, it can determine the storage time, detect spoilage phenomena such as mold and discoloration during storage, eliminate pests affecting storage, and predict the vitality of seeds after storage. In aroma evaluation of grains and their processed products, it can assess the impact of new raw materials, new technologies, fermentation processes, and even oral processing on the quality of grain products. This article also summarizes the characteristics of GC-IMS technology, compiles typical grain flavor compounds, and provides prospects for the future application of GC-IMS. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Chao Ma, \nHonglei Nie, \nLing‐Xiao Liu, \nFu‐Rong Wang, \nYingjie Chen, \nWenmeng Zhang, \nYun‐Guo Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"cf313eadbf6418a46ddfe3d6f36cf7a09f8605e00e7636da7dc201e4b75f7d18","category":"Environment"}
