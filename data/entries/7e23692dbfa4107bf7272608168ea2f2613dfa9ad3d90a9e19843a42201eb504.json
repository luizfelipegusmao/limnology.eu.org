A State of the Art","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1525/v1","date":1726821843000,"content":"The increasing request of digitized data among several fields, including the built environment and Cultural Heritage (CH) one points out the need of proficient ways to access, archive and share 3D data and related information among users. The sector of reality capture produces accurate and reliable products that can support building management and CH maintenance, at the price of heavy and resource-demanding data. An emerging solution to this problem is represented by the web platforms for 3D data management, that promise to relieve users from the costs of archive and hardware, providing effective visualization, access and sharing tools. The panorama of commercial web platforms is analyzed according to the Software as a Service business model and the features of some representative platforms are exposed. The paper discusses the main advantages in terms of diffused access and collaboration and the potential issues concerning the long-term archive and data persistence. The future perspectives of the web platform sector are promising as, according to the current development path, could be able to empower the built environment and CH sector with a diffused, systematic and aware use of 3D data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e23692dbfa4107bf7272608168ea2f2613dfa9ad3d90a9e19843a42201eb504","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
