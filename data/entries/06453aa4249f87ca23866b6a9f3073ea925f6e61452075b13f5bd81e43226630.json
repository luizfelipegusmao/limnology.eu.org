Yet, the role of CUE in regulating SOC storage remains debated, with evidence for both positive and negative SOC-CUE relations. Here, we use a combination of measured data around the world and numerical simulations to explore SOC-CUE relations accounting for temperature (T) effects on CUE. Results reveal that the sign of the CUE-T relation controls the direction of the SOC-CUE relations. A negative CUE-T relation leads to a positive SOC-CUE relation and vice versa, highlighting that CUE-T patterns significantly affect how organic carbon is used by microbes and hence SOC-CUE relations. Numerical results also confirm the observed negative SOC-T relation, regardless of the CUE-T patterns, implying that temperature plays a more dominant role than CUE in controlling SOC storage. The SOC-CUE relation is usually negative when temperature effects are isolated, even though it can become positive when nonlinear microbial turnover is considered. These results indicate a dominant role of CUE-T patterns in controlling the SOC-CUE relation. Our findings help to better understand SOC and microbial responses to a warming climate.</p>","author":"Zhaoyang Luo, \nJianning Ren, \nStefano Manzoni, \nSimone Fatichi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"06453aa4249f87ca23866b6a9f3073ea925f6e61452075b13f5bd81e43226630","category":"Environment"}
