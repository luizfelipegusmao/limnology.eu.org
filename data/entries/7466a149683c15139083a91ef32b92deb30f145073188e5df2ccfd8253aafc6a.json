{"title":"Reflectivity Thresholds and Optical Loss Predictions in Resonant Photonic Cavities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0292/v1","date":1725430353000,"content":"Minimizing optical losses in resonant cavities is crucial for improving photonic device performance. This study focuses on the development of a simulation tool to analyze scattering losses in Fabry-Pérot interferometers (FPI), offering precise modeling of waveguide dynamics and contributing to accurate loss predictions across various platforms. Optical cavities often suffer from scattering losses due to surface roughness and material defects. Our approach integrates theoretical models and simulations to quantify these losses, utilizing the FPI as a model system. We identified upper and lower reflectivity thresholds, beyond which accurate measurement of losses becomes unreliable. For reflectivity below a certain threshold, measurement errors arise, while excessively high reflectivity can reduce fringe visibility and introduce detector sensitivity issues. Simulations were used to validate the model's ability to predict reflectivity and attenuation in waveguides with varying loss levels. The software’s flexibility to adjust transmission parameters for different cavity configurations enhances its utility for a broad range of photonic systems. Our study offers a novel methodology for optical loss analysis, with practical applications in optimizing photonic devices. By providing a reliable tool for precise loss measurement, this work supports advancements in optical technologies, enabling the design of more efficient, high-performance devices across various applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7466a149683c15139083a91ef32b92deb30f145073188e5df2ccfd8253aafc6a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
