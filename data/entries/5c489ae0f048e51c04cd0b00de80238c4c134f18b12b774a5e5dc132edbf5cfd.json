{"title":"Religious beliefs and practices toward HPV vaccine acceptance in Islamic countries: A scoping review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309597","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Sezer Kisa, Adnan Kisa</p>\r\nBackground <p>Despite the availability of effective HPV vaccines, their acceptance in Islamic countries is often influenced by religious beliefs, practices, and misconceptions.</p> Objective <p>This review aimed to identify the current literature on the religious beliefs and any misconceptions toward HPV vaccine acceptance within the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries.</p> Method <p>Using key terms, a systematic search in MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL yielded 23 studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The scope of this review included all research articles published in English until October 31, 2023. A form based on the aim of the study was developed and used to extract the data.</p> Results <p>The review highlights the complexity of the relationship between religious beliefs and HPV vaccine uptake. The findings reveal significant objections among a number of Muslims. Some of them believe vaccines lead to infertility and sexual promiscuity, defy religious norms, are a sneaky way to inject good Muslims with haram ingredients, and are an abandonment of righteous principles in general.</p> Conclusions <p>Vaccine hesitancy is a result of doubts regarding the vaccineâ€™s safety, necessity, and compatibility with religious beliefs. It is recommended to encourage HPV vaccine uptake in Islamic countries by using public health strategies that adopt a holistic approach that incorporates religious, cultural, and social aspects.</p>","author":"Sezer Kisa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5c489ae0f048e51c04cd0b00de80238c4c134f18b12b774a5e5dc132edbf5cfd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
