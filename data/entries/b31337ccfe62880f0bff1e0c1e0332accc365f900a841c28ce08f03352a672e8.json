{"title":"Integration and characterization of a zeolite material in a microcomponent for measurements of environmental carbon dioxide","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/appl.202300105?af=R","date":1712230236000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>This study demonstrates integration of a zeolite material in a ceramic microcomponent intended for use in sampling and analysis of environmental carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). The zeolite material was integrated in bulk form, allowing for adsorption of large quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> compared to previous integration attempts as thin films. To obtain a porous bulk material, an injectable slurry was developed, where expandable polymeric microspheres were added as a sacrificial template. By varying water and sphere contents of the slurry, it was possible to tune the porosity of the zeolite material between 55 and 72 %. This in turn affected the flow resistance of the microcomponents, where an increase in the porosity of the filling from 62 to 72 % reduced the flow resistance from 84 to 28 kPa min cm<sup>-3</sup>. In addition, the spheres facilitated complete fillings free from cracks. The zeolite material was seen to retain its ability to adsorb CO<sub>2</sub> after processing, but it was not possible to quantify the level of retention compared to unprocessed zeolite.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
