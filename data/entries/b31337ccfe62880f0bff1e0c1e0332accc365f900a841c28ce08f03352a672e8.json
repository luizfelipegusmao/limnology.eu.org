This work explores integration of a zeolite material in a miniaturized device for sampling of environmental CO<sub>2</sub>. Through the use of expandable microspheres, CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbant zeolite fillings free from cracks and with tuneable porosity were obtained.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study demonstrates integration of a zeolite material in a ceramic microcomponent intended for use in sampling and analysis of environmental carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). The zeolite material was integrated in bulk form, allowing for adsorption of large quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> compared to previous integration attempts as thin films. To obtain a porous bulk material, an injectable slurry was developed, where expandable polymeric microspheres were added as a sacrificial template. By varying water and sphere contents of the slurry, it was possible to tune the porosity of the zeolite material between 55% and 72%. This in turn affected the flow resistance of the microcomponents, where an increase in the porosity of the filling from 62% to 72% reduced the flow resistance from 84 to 28 kPa min cm<sup>−3</sup>. In addition, the spheres facilitated complete fillings free from cracks. The zeolite material was seen to retain its ability to adsorb CO<sub>2</sub> after processing, but it was not possible to quantify the level of retention compared to unprocessed zeolite.</p>","author":"Erika Åkerfeldt, \nGreger Thornell, \nAnders Persson","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"b31337ccfe62880f0bff1e0c1e0332accc365f900a841c28ce08f03352a672e8","category":"Environment"}
