{"title":"Hydropeaking mitigation with re‐regulation reservoirs","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4290?af=R","date":1725594812000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The role of hydropower as a renewable and balancing power source is expected to increase in a Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario. As a common phenomenon in hydropower plants, hydropeaking will become more prominent, resulting in additional stresses on the ecological status of rivers. Here we propose a novel approach to design and operate auxiliary reservoirs called re-regulation reservoirs (RRR) that aim to mitigate the adverse impacts of hydropeaking on rivers. A re-regulation reservoir aims at smoothing flow fluctuations caused by hydropeaking by diverting and retaining parts of high flows and returning them back to river corridors during low flows. Using actual data from a hydropeaking-influenced river system, the operation and efficiency of potential reservoirs have been investigated. An open-access algorithm was developed to analyze the influence of the reservoirs to mitigate hydropeaking, considering peak and minimum flow and up- and down-ramping rates. The findings illustrate that, in most cases, the required reservoir volume increases as the flow thresholds become more stringent. Nonetheless, several exceptions were observed, where larger reservoir volumes were required compared with cases with more stringent thresholds. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the impact of flow adjustments, while carefully considering the river regime, sub-daily flow patterns, and unique characteristics of the river's ecosystem. Our approach shows theoretical possibilities for regulating hydropeaking and provides a basis for optimizing re-regulation reservoirs, contributing to practical and adaptable strategies for sustainable hydropower management without increasing the operational cost of power systems.</p>","author":"Ali Mchayk, \nHannu Marttila, \nBjörn Klöve, \nAli Torabi Haghighi","siteTitle":"Wiley: River Research and Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"dd8f8dcb48cf1db6f6edba43098839a842d88bad9f088e9d186fa05ae3366ba7","entryHash":"fa0cc2a47efcb803599cb5ee33451f67628998c82269b31dd4b3bf35c0aa228b","category":"Environment"}
