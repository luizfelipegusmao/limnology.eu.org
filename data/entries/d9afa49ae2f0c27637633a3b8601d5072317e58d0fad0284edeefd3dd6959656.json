{"title":"Monitoring and Remote Control of Solar Tracker Using MQTT Technologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1635/v1","date":1727079010000,"content":"This study presents the development and implementation of a remote monitoring system for a dual-axis solar tracker, integrating Industry 4.0 technologies such as IoT, SCADA, and MQTT. The system, which combines a Siemens S7-1200 PLC, an IoT gateway, and a SCADA platform based on Ignition, demonstrated significant increases in solar capture efficiency, with production gains of 25-30% compared to fixed systems, reaching up to 67.65% under ideal conditions. In addition to improving operational management through predictive monitoring and early fault detection, the study identified areas for improvement, such as the need for real-world testing and the integration of weather predictions. In conclusion, the research validates the feasibility and effectiveness of automated IoT and SCADA-based systems to optimize solar trackers, significantly contributing to improved energy efficiency in photovoltaic installations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9afa49ae2f0c27637633a3b8601d5072317e58d0fad0284edeefd3dd6959656","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
