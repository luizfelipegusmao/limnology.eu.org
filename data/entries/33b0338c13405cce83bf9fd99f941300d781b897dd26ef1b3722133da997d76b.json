{"title":"Television for Vision Pro","link":"https://sandwich.vision","date":1709757878000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/01/weather-up\">Speaking of</a> new apps from <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2024/02/13/ep-395\">recent guests</a> on my podcast, Adam Lisagor has created a new app for Vision Pro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjwj236c8I\">that he introduces thus, with a clever one-minute video</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Welcome to the future of television. I call it ... Television.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The gimmick is that Television offers an assortment of realistic-looking televisions, old and new, and you can just place them in the world around you. You can watch videos from your Photos library, and, starting with the 1.1 update, from YouTube and other web streaming platforms.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t know if this is a useful way to watch video but I’m certain that it’s fun. And I think being <em>fun</em> is exactly what we need from developers in the early days of a new platform. In a weird way, that stupid <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/iphone-beer-app-ibeer-money-made-20000-per-day/\">beer-drinking iPhone app</a> <em>mattered</em>. I think Television matters the same way. It’s just fun to plop a realistic old-time CRT TV on your desk. I get why Apple didn’t go this way — with skeuomorphic VR objects — with the system design of VisionOS, but that just means the opportunity is there for the taking for third-party developers.</p>\n\n<p>It’s just <em>fun</em>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/06/television\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"33b0338c13405cce83bf9fd99f941300d781b897dd26ef1b3722133da997d76b","category":"Tech"}
