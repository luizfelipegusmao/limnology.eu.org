{"title":"The impact of low-carbon city pilot policy on urban green technology innovation: Based on government and public perspectives","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306425","date":1720620000000,"content":"<p>by Qingjie Pan, Shouguo Zhao</p>\r\n\r\nGlobal climate change has caused a series of environmental problems, green technology innovation is necessitating strategic responses, but the impact of low-carbon city pilot policy on urban green technology innovation is unclear. Based on panel data from 285 Chinese cities during 2005â€“2022, this study employs the Difference in Difference method to examine the impact of low-carbon city policy on urban green technology innovation. The results show that (1) The low-carbon city pilot policy promotes urban green technology innovation. (2) The low-carbon city pilot policy promotes urban green technology innovation through government green input and public engagement. (3) New infrastructure enhances the impact of low-carbon city pilot policy on quantity of green technology innovation. (4) Compared with the Yangtze River Economic Belt, the low-carbon city policy has a greater influence on urban green technology innovation in the Yellow River Basin.The findings provide policy insights for the construction of low-carbon pilot cities.","author":"Qingjie Pan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f4c12bb1c836d5e734f1285e1cf391428ddb90a7be229a747613e14cf13081ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
