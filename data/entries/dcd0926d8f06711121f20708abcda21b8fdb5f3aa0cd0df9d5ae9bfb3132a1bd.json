Examination of illegal fishing photo archives collected during enforcement revealed these endangered species, and spinetail devil rays (<i>Mobula mobular</i>), are being caught within the archipelago's vast no-take marine protected area. Future cooperation between authorities and mobulid ray experts is crucial to improve the availability and accuracy of enforcement data and improve management of illegal fishing and mobulid ray conservation activities.</p>","author":"Joanna L.
