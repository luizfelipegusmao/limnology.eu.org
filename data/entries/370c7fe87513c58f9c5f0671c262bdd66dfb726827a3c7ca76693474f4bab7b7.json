{"title":"On the Protocols of New Historicism and Epochal Thought: A proposition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1924/v1","date":1727230241000,"content":"The modern Historicism is plagued by its non-scientific appropriation â€“ rightfully so, if we consider the genocidal proclivities that have defined the post-modern era to act on a perceived justification for the historical process, then the philosophy is little more than a falsely asserted and criminal interpretation made by taxonomists and romanticists. Yet, it should be noted that the study retains significant value in the discussion of Epochs, but its pertinence is represented in degrees of unknowable ideas and uncertainties.  This article introduces two new, pragmatic constituent studies of Historicism such that it is reformed in the context of indeterminacy and an expected, non-processional characterization becomes forefront to the study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"370c7fe87513c58f9c5f0671c262bdd66dfb726827a3c7ca76693474f4bab7b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
