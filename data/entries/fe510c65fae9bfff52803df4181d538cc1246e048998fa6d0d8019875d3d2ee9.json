{"title":"Climate Change and Its Importance to the Vertical Distribution of Rhynchocypris kumgangensis (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae) in Deogyusan National Park","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1862/v1","date":1729706004000,"content":": Rhynchocypris kumgangensis, endemic to Korea, is limited to the upper Hangang River and Gucheondongcheon Stream. As a key and climate-sensitive biological indicator species in Deogyusan National Park, it has a southern range limit in the Gucheondong Valley. Due to climate change, notable shifts in the activity, vertical distribution, and population of R. kumgangensis in the Gucheondongcheon Stream are expected. Owing to the rapidly changing climate, significant changes in the activity, vertical distribution, and population size of R. kumgangensis in the Gucheondongcheon Stream are anticipated, and continuous surveys of the distribution of R. kumgangensis in this river area have been conducted. This study assessed the habitat of R. kumgangensis at 13 sites, including five in the Gucheondongcheon Stream, from July to October 2020 and compared the results with historical data to evaluate the impacts of climate change. At the five Gucheondongcheon Stream sites, 102 individuals were recorded from April to October 2020, and 378 were recorded between June 2018 and July 2019. Additionally, the subdominant species shifted from R. kumgangensis (2014â€“2018) to Zacco koreanus (2020). In the two southernmost Gucheondongcheon Stream sites, only 18 R. kumgangensis were observed in 2020 compared to 82 in 2019, indicating a significant population decline.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe510c65fae9bfff52803df4181d538cc1246e048998fa6d0d8019875d3d2ee9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
