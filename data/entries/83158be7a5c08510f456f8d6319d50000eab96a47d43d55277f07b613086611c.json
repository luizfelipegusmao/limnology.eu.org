{"title":"KRILLSCAN: An automated open‐source software for processing and analysis of echosounder data from the Antarctic krill fishery","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12739?af=R","date":1725536909000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Krillscan software was developed to automatically process echosounder data and achieve an accelerated and transparent analysis of backscatter data that allows calculation of target biomass. Herein, the fishery for Antarctic krill (<i>Euphausia superba</i>, Henceforth Krill) was used as a case study to develop the approach. Implementation of a sustainable management strategy for the krill fishery is complicated by a lack of regularly updated krill abundance data on spatiotemporal scales of the fishery. To increase krill biomass data availability, automatic echosounder data processing and swarm detection software was tested against traditional manual scrutinization with LSSS software and agreed with only minor offsets in estimated nautical area scattering coefficients. In addition to automatic processing and data transfer, Krillscan also has a graphical user interface to supervise automatic krill swarm detection. Echogram size can be compressed up to 100 times and raw data are processed faster than generated, thereby enabling near-real time analysis and data transfer. Compressed data can be transmitted online to allow fishing vessels to conduct surveys without having scientific personnel with special expertise on board.</p>","author":"Sebastian Menze, \nGavin J.
