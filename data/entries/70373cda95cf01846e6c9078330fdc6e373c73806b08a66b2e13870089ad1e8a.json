{"title":"Parameters Variation of Natural Gas Hydrate with Thermal Fluid Dissolution Based on Multi-field Coupling under Pore-Scale Modeling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0377/v1","date":1725489063000,"content":"The permeability, heat conductivity and reaction rate will be varied with the change of natural gas hydrate saturation, when thermal fluid injected into the natural gas hydrate reservoirs. In order to characterize the variation of physical field parameters with hydrate saturation, DDF-LBM was applied to simulate the hydrate dissolving process by thermal fluid injection under pore scale modelling. Based on the forced conjugate heat transfer case, the relaxation frequency of the thermal lattice in the pores is corrected. Based on the P-T phase equilibrium relationship of hydrates and considering the heat absorbed by the hydrate reaction, the solid-liquid state of the hydrate lattice is judged in real time, and the dynamic simulation of the heat flow solidification multi-physics field is realized. The simulation results show that the dissolution rate of hydrates by thermal fluid injection was higher than that by heating the hydrate surface alone, and was positively correlated with the hydrate saturation. On the basis of the above results, this paper provided exponential fitting equations between different hydrate saturations and average permeability, effective thermal conductivity, and inherent reaction rate. The fitting results show that saturation has a negative correlation with relative permeability and effective thermal conductivity, and a positive correlation with the inherent reaction rate. The above results can provide a reference basis for accurately describing the heat and mass transfer of natural gas hydrate under macro-scale.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70373cda95cf01846e6c9078330fdc6e373c73806b08a66b2e13870089ad1e8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
