{"title":"Orthognathic Surgery vs. Orthodontic Camouflage: Differential Impacts on Convex Profile Faces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1243/v1","date":1729060214000,"content":"Facial appearance significantly influences several life outcomes, and a convex profile often prompts patients to seek treatment to enhance their facial esthetics. This study aimed to assess the facial appearance outcomes of combined orthodontic and orthognathic intervention compared to orthodontic camouflage treatment in convex facial profile individuals. The study sample comprised 36 consecutively selected Class II Division 1, convex facial profile patients. Two groups of 18 non-growing patients with similar characteristics were compared. Group A was treated with orthodontics and orthognathic surgery, whereas Group B with orthodontics exclusively. Pre- and post-treatment profile and frontal facial photographs were presented simultaneously to orthodontists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, convex profile patients, and laypeople, asking them to assess changes in facial appearance. Considerable positive changes in facial appearance were perceived for Group A, compared to no changes for Group B, with a 17/100 VAS units difference. The rater groups demonstrated a high degree of consistency (ICC &gt; 0.88). Multivariate analysis revealed significant differences in perceived changes between the two treatment groups (F = 14.63, P &lt; 0.001, Pillai's Trace = 0.36, partial Î·2 = 0.36), with no significant effects from the rater group (P &gt; 0.05). Similar results were evident when only profile photos were rated (P &gt; 0.05). The combined orthodontic and surgical intervention is an efficient approach for the enhancement of facial appearance in convex profile cases. On the contrary, orthodontic treatment alone has no such impact. These findings should be properly communicated during patient consultation and considered for treatment planning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bec91cba824526e6fbcf3d990df5d703cef570d195b3267a922a63089b730af3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
