Affected persons often have severe limitations in their quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate protective properties of the active compound of dimethyl fumarate, monomethyl fumarate (MMF), on distinct regions of the central nervous system after ischemic events. Dimethyl fumarate is an already established drug in neurology with known anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In this study, we chose organotypic slice cultures of rat cerebellum and hippocampus as an <i>ex vivo</i> model. To simulate cardiac arrest and return of spontaneous circulation we performed oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD) followed by treatments with different concentrations of MMF (1–30 μM in cerebellum and 5–30 μM in hippocampus). Immunofluorescence staining with propidium iodide (PI) and 4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was performed to analyze PI/DAPI ratio after imaging with a spinning disc confocal microscope. In the statistical analysis, the relative cell death of the different groups was compared. In both, the cerebellum and hippocampus, the MMF-treated group showed a significantly lower PI/DAPI ratio compared to the non-treated group after OGD. Thus, we showed for the first time that both cerebellar and hippocampal slice cultures treated with MMF after OGD are significantly less affected by cell death.","author":"Oliver Althaus","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"86afd44241096916eb4a1b6709a29d866dd43ab303fa1d08b2ea91aab6f7be21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
