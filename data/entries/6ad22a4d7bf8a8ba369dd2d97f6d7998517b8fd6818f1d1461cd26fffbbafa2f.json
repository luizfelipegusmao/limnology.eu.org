The VOCs responsible for aromas have been identified from many natural products. The current major strategy is to analyze chemical compositions and aroma qualities of individual VOCs using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and GC-olfactometry. However, such analyses cannot determine whether candidate VOCs contribute to the characteristic aroma in mixtures of many VOCs. In this study, we developed a GC/MS-based VOC collection/omission system that can modify the VOC compositions of samples easily and rapidly. The system is composed of GC/MS with a switching unit that can change gas flow routes between MS and a VOC collection device. We first applied this system to prepare gas samples for omission tests, and the aroma qualities of VOC mixtures with and without some VOCs were evaluated by panelists. If aroma qualities were different between the 2 samples, the omitted VOCs were likely key odorants. By collecting VOCs in a gas bag attached to the collection device and transferring some VOCs to MS, specific VOCs could be omitted easily from the VOC mixture. The system could prepare omission samples without chemical identification, preparation of each VOC, and laborious techniques for mixing VOCs, thus overcoming the limitations of previous methods of sample preparation. Finally, the system was used to prepare artificial aromas by replacing VOC compositions between different samples for screening of key odorants. In conclusion, the system developed here can improve aroma research by identifying key odorants from natural products.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"6ad22a4d7bf8a8ba369dd2d97f6d7998517b8fd6818f1d1461cd26fffbbafa2f","category":"Environment"}
