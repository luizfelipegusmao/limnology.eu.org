Jönsson</p>\r\n\r\nGenetic analyses were conducted on tumor samples from 88 patients with uveal melanoma (UM), 6 of whom carry pathogenic germline variants in <i>BAP1</i>. We assessed the frequency, pattern, and prognostic significance of somatic aberrations, and investigated differences between germline <i>BAP1</i> variant carriers compared to sporadic cases. The frequency of the main oncogenic driver mutations was not significantly different between these groups. Patients with germline <i>BAP1</i> variants did not have significantly different overall survival compared to the wildtype or somatic <i>BAP1</i> mutation groups. Patients with a somatic <i>BAP1</i> mutation (n = 24) had a significantly worse prognosis compared to wildtype (n = 58). All patients with stage III tumors and a somatic <i>BAP1</i> mutation (n = 7) developed metastasis, however four of 28 stage I-II tumors without metastasis had somatic <i>BAP1</i> mutations, with observation time &gt;5 years. The tumor from one germline <i>BAP1</i> carrier (stage IIIC) with a somatic <i>EIF1AX</i> splice variant, has not developed metastasis within a 22-year observation time.","author":"Karin A. W.
