{"title":"Preclinical evaluation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) to predict poor control of chronic respiratory diseases in primary care: a novel approach to focus our efforts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1430/v1","date":1726661148000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Managing chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) within the Spanish Sistema Nacional de Salud (SNS) presents significant challenges, particularly due to their high prevalence and poor disease control rates—approximately 45.1% for asthma and 63.2% for COPD. This study aims to develop a novel predictive model using Electronic Health Records (EHR) to estimate the likelihood of poor disease control in these patients, thereby enabling more efficient management in primary care settings. Methods: The Seleida project employed a bioinformatics approach to identify significant clinical variables from EHR data in primary care centers in Seville and Valencia. Statistically significant variables were incorporated into a logistic regression model to predict poor disease control in patients with asthma and COPD patients. Key variables included the number of short-acting β-agonist (SABA) and short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) canisters, prednisone courses, and antibiotic courses over the past year. Results: The developed model demonstrated high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in predicting poorly controlled disease in both asthma and COPD patients. These findings suggest that the model could serve as a valuable tool for the early identification of at-risk patients, allowing healthcare providers to prioritize and optimize resource allocation in primary care settings. Conclusions: Integrating this predictive model into primary care practice could enhance the proactive management of asthma and COPD, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. Further validation in diverse clinical settings is warranted to confirm the model's efficacy and generalizability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e827a2a8d6dce7aca257093e04b93001b1cd6daffdc0e7d0dd0bee8bb216a18e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
