{"title":"Creativity and Emotional Exhaustion in Virtual Work Environments. The Ambiguous Role of Work Autonomy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0008/v1","date":1719818384000,"content":"Creativity in virtual work environments and its influence on emotional exhaustion is a relationship with inconclusive results. Furthermore, autonomy, when it loses its original purpose of acting as a job resource, takes on an ambiguous role that needs further research. Objective: To analyze the relationship between creativity and emotional exhaustion, along with the role assumed by work autonomy in this link, in an online work context. Methodology: The sample is formed by 448 employees with university studies. The statistical analysis is done through a simple moderation process. Results: Creativity and work autonomy mitigate emotional exhaustion. Control over work surely reduces the impact of work related stressors, and this safety climate promotes adaptive and original responses that improve employees' emotional health. However, when creative demands coincide with an autonomy that extends working hours, instead of establishing limits, this supposed benefit becomes a demand that prevents employees from disconnecting until emotionally exhausting them. Conclusion: A virtual work environment is an ideal habitat for creativity and self-management to improve employees' emotional health, as long as work autonomy acts as a resource.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"169bef6610254d57c1685279f298f7a80daca437df8b695f98bc6c3b71fabca6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
