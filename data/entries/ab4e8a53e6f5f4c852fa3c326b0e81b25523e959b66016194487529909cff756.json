{"title":"Hybrid Power Source Assisted by Renewable Energies for Hybrid Electric Vehicles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1252/v1","date":1713432039000,"content":"The article studies and analyzes a hybrid power source system, lithium battery, and fuel cell assisted by flexible photovoltaic panels for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The new configuration operates based on optimizing the performance of the dual power source to maximize the available energy and operating time. The operational mode simulates specific driving conditions in urban, peripheral, and intercity routes under variable driving patterns and traffic conditions. The simulation results show that the new configuration increases the hybrid electric vehicle performance, providing higher reliability despite the more complex design. The proposed system reduces the external power supply dependence and avoids unexpected sudden stops due to energy exhaustion. The new configuration also extends the vehicle driving range depending on driving mode and route conditions. The vehicle driving range extension may reach up to 276.3 km. The hybridization of fuel cells with lithium battery and PV panel assistance enhances battery management, reducing battery servicing and increasing lifespan. The proposed topology is cheaper than a single fuel cell power system by 17.2%, reducing the total cost related to the single battery power system if we consider the battery recharge for its entire lifespan. The cost saving is 2.6% for the American market and 14.8% for the European one.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab4e8a53e6f5f4c852fa3c326b0e81b25523e959b66016194487529909cff756","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
