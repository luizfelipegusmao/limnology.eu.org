{"title":"Monthly Monitoring of Inundated Areas and Water Storage Dynamics in China's Large Reservoirs Using Multisource Remote Sensing","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036450?af=R","date":1723451937000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>High-frequency monitoring of reservoir inundation and water storage changes is crucial for reservoir functionality assessment and hydrological model calibration. Although the integration of optical data with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering coefficients (backscatters) offers an effective approach, conventional methods struggle to consistently provide accurate retrievals over diverse regions and seasons. In this study, we introduce reservoir- and monthly-specific classification models to enhance the integration of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatters with optical-based water dynamics. Our method covers 721 reservoirs with a capacity greater than 0.1 km<sup>3</sup> in China during 2017–2021. Furthermore, we leverage multisource satellite altimetry records (e.g., ICESat-2, CryoSat-2, and GEDI) and digital elevation models to derive hypsometry relationship (i.e., water level–water area relationship) for reservoirs, enabling the transformation of inundated areas into monthly water storage changes for 662 reservoirs, representing 93% of the total storage capacity of large reservoirs. Validation against in-situ measurements at 80 reservoirs reveals improved monthly inundated area monitoring compared to existing data sets. Additionally, our reservoir water storage change estimates exhibit an average <i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> of 0.79 and a mean relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 21%. Our findings highlight reservoir water increases from May/June to November and declines in winter–spring in most regions. However, the inter-annual patterns vary among regions, with increases in Northeast China, the Yellow River basin (YR), and Southwest China, contrasted by declines in Eastern and Northwest China. Inter- and intra-annual variability in reservoir water storage is mainly influenced by natural inflow in Northeast and Northwest China, while anthropogenic factors dominate in the YR, Eastern, and Southwest China.</p>","author":"Yongzhe Chen, \nYiming Wang, \nLuoqi Li, \nYanhong Cui, \nXingwu Duan, \nDi Long","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"ca6e5d0d73aec69bd660cba1168d3e9f995c71909a7d3244d4d2fab49407da56","category":"Environment"}
