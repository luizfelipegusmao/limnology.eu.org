{"title":"From barriers to opportunities from COVID-19 pandemic: Stakeholder perspectives on cervical cancer screening programs in LMICs of the Asia-Pacific region","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003768","date":1728050400000,"content":"<p>by Jieying Lee, Ida Ismail-Pratt, Dorothy A. Machalek, Suresh Kumarasamy, Suzanne M. Garland</p>\r\n\r\nCervical cancer is preventable, yet it remains the fourth most common cancer in women globally. The highest incidence and mortality occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where over 70% of women have never been screened, and 58% of the cases are in Asia. While the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to cervical screening programs, particularly for LMICs, there were opportunities that emerged from the pandemic that were enablers of program recovery. Stakeholders played key roles in materialising strategy into implementation. Therefore, in this study, we examined the barriers and facilitators to implementing recovery strategies from the stakeholders’ perspectives. We interviewed fifteen stakeholders from nine LMICs in the Asia-Pacific region directly involved in the implementation of the cervical screening program. A total of 23 barriers and 21 facilitators were identified, of which seven barriers and nine facilitators related directly to the pandemic. Pandemic-related barriers included movement restrictions, resource diversion, cancelled campaigns and training, deprioritisation of HPV prevention efforts, and a reduced health workforce. Stakeholders concurred that most barriers had predated the pandemic and remained as the pandemic eased. Conversely, the pandemic introduced facilitators such as means for targeted campaigns, improved understanding of viruses, accessible training with online platforms, better PCR testing capabilities, a shift in the government’s position towards preventive health services, and openness to HPV testing and self-swabs. The emerging facilitators offered opportunities to address some of the persistent barriers, such as limited cervical cancer awareness and insufficient healthcare providers in screening programs. However, effective implementation of these emerging facilitators requires improved communication and collaboration between policymakers and implementers to accelerate the recovery of screening programs in LMICs. Further work is necessary to align emerging facilitators with the health system goals and resource settings of each country in turning these opportunities into actions.","author":"Jieying Lee","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"d4797bd471adc8349c8b47070024bd7d5a79adbf6037f7f7e1ce415463b52b2c","category":"Environment"}
