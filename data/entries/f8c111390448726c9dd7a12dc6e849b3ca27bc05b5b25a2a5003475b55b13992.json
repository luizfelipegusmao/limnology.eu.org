{"title":"Proteomics and PTMomics to Unveil Metabolic Regulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2071/v1","date":1721975097000,"content":"Proteomics is the study of cellular proteome by investigating how different proteins interact with each other and the roles they play in the organism. For mRNA expression levels do not always correlate well with protein expression levels, and the study of mRNA does not consider protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs), complex formation and localization; all of which are key to protein function. Quantitative proteomics uses mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins so as to find differentially expressed proteins under different condition. This allows us to gain biological insights under stress or other pathological conditions. posttranslational modifications, such as lysine acetylation, succinylation and lactylation, occur after protein biosynthesis and play vital roles in protein activity and cell physiology regulation. Here we present the mass spectrometry analysis in detail to unveil protein acylase and deacylaseâ€™ roles in metabolic regulation based on PTMomics lysine acetylome and suincylome.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8c111390448726c9dd7a12dc6e849b3ca27bc05b5b25a2a5003475b55b13992","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
