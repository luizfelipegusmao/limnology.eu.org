{"title":"Review of Taxonomic Knowledge of Dictyota (Phaeophyceae; Dictyotales); Two Centuries after its Description","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0841/v1","date":1712909316000,"content":"Some current systematized reviews of macroalgae are concise and descriptive, but it is important to conduct these of a larger number of taxa to facilitate visualizations of the types of primordial research, relevant methods, and areas of opportunity. The aim was to elaborate the state of the art in the taxonomic knowledge of Dictyota based on a systematized review of the generated information since its original description (1809 to 2023). We conducted a search for names and literature in different databases, followed by a temporal analysis (by century and bidecadal). To date, a total of 313 names have been registered for Dictyota; 108 are accepted names. The largest number of registered taxonomic names (207) was found for the 19th century, derived from large expeditions. Our analysis of literature involved 318 publications, 89 of which corresponded to alpha taxonomy, 187 to beta, and 42 to gamma. We determined that the trend in taxonomic works is integrative in nature because they include other disciplines to explain aspects that go beyond taxonomic description. Our analysis suggests that extensive reviews and monographic approaches are still required to achieve a better understanding of the genus. The effort in integrative taxonomy must be intensified, which allow improve the systematic of Dictyota.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68eb3561499c6dc7eb47ad0d86ad11e5c47f5fdbb10e699df9566a739f8406c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
