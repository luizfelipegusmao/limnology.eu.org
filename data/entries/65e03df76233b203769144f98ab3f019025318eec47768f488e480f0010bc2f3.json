{"title":"Simultaneous confidence interval construction for many-to-one of proportion ratios of bilateral correlated data","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311850","date":1729000800000,"content":"<p>by Zhaoqi Zhang, Chang-Xing Ma</p>\r\n\r\nIn ophthalmology and otolaryngology, data collected from paired body parts are typically reformatted into categorical bilateral data structures for subsequent research. This article applies Donnerâ€™s equal correlation coefficient model and obtains nine simultaneous confidence intervals (SCI) of proportion ratios under three asymptotic statistical methods and three ways of multiplicity adjustment. The empirical coverage probability and mean interval width are evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations. A real example is used to demonstrate the proposed methods.","author":"Zhaoqi Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"65e03df76233b203769144f98ab3f019025318eec47768f488e480f0010bc2f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
