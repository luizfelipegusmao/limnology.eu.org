{"title":"Effect of utilizing either a self-reported questionnaire or administrative data alone or in combination on the findings of a randomized controlled trial of the long-term effects of antenatal corticosteroids","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308414","date":1723039200000,"content":"<p>by Mohammad Shahbaz, Jane E.

Gamble, for the ANCHOR Study Group </p>\r\nIntroduction <p>A combination of self-reported questionnaire and administrative data could potentially enhance ascertainment of outcomes and alleviate the limitations of both in follow up studies. However, it is uncertain how access to only one of these data sources to assess outcomes impact study findings. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether the study findings would be altered if the outcomes were assessed by different data sources alone or in combination.</p> Methods <p>At 50-year follow-up of participants in a randomized trial, we assessed the effect of antenatal betamethasone exposure on the diagnosis of diabetes, pre-diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, mental health disorders, and asthma using a self-reported questionnaire, administrative data, a combination of both, or any data source, with or without adjudication by an expert panel of five clinicians. Differences between relative risks derived from each data source were calculated using the Bland-Altman approach.</p> Results <p>There were 424 participants (46% of those eligible, aged 49 years, SD 1, 50% male). There were no differences in study outcomes between participants exposed to betamethasone and those exposed to placebo when the outcomes were assessed using different data sources. When compared to the study findings determined using adjudicated outcomes, the mean difference (limits of agreement) in relative risks derived from other data sources were: self-reported questionnaires 0.02 (-0.35 to 0.40), administrative data 0.06 (-0.32 to 0.44), both questionnaire and administrative data 0.01 (-0.41 to 0.43), and any data source, 0.01 (-0.08 to 0.10).</p> Conclusion <p>Utilizing a self-reported questionnaire, administrative data, both questionnaire and administrative data, or any of these sources for assessing study outcomes had no impact on the study findings compared with when study outcomes were assessed using adjudicated outcomes.</p>","author":"Mohammad Shahbaz","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"04e98d99430a0ab802ca56955137ee65f243cc902838d85f3485f0292db0a50b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
