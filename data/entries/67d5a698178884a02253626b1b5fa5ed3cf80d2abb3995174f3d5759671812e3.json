{"title":"Differential lung gene expression identified Zscan2 and Bag6 as novel tissue repair players in an experimental COPD model","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309166","date":1724335200000,"content":"<p>by Laura Sánchez Carretero, Àdele Chole Cardeñosa Pérez, Germán Peces-Barba, Sandra Pérez-Rial</p>\r\n\r\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a common chronic lung disease with an ever-increasing incidence. Despite years of drug research and approvals, we are still not able to halt progress or restore normal lung function. Our previous studies have demonstrated that liver growth factor—LGF has an effect on the repair of the affected tissue in a mouse model of cigarette smoke exposure, but by what pathways it achieves this is unknown. The present study aimed to identify differentially expressed genes between emphysematous mice treated with LGF to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of pulmonary emphysema. The emphysema mouse model was induced by prolonged exposure to cigarette smoke. To determine the gene expression profile of the lung in smokers treated or not with LGF, lung messenger RNA gene expression was assessed with the Agilent Array platform. We carried out differentially expressed gene analysis, functional enrichment and validated in treated mouse lung samples. The treated group significantly improved lung function (~35%) and emphysema level (~20%), consistent with our previous published studies. Microarray analysis demonstrated 290 differentially expressed genes in total (2.0-fold over or lower expressed). Injury repair-associated genes and pathways were further enhanced in the lung of LGF treated mice. The expression trends of two genes (Zscan2 and Bag6) were different in emphysematous lungs treated with LGF compared to untreated lungs. Therefore, Zscan2 and Bag6 genes could play a role in regulating inflammation and the immune response in the lung that undergoes partial lung regeneration. However, further studies are necessary to demonstrate this causal relationship.","author":"Laura Sánchez Carretero","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"67d5a698178884a02253626b1b5fa5ed3cf80d2abb3995174f3d5759671812e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
