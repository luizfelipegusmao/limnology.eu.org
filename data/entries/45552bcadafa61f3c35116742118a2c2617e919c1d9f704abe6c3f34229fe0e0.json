{"title":"Real-Time Home Automation System using BCI Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0353/v1","date":1720054745000,"content":"Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) processes and converts brain signals to provide 20 commands to output devices to carry out certain tasks. The main purpose of BCI is to replace or 21 restore missing or damaged functions of disabled people including neuromuscular disorders like 22 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), cerebral palsy, stroke, or spinal cord injury. Hence, BCI does 23 not use neuromuscular output pathways. Scientists have used several techniques like 24 Electroencephalography (EEG), intracortical, and Electrocorticographic (ECoG) to collect brain 25 signals which are used to control robotic arms, prosthetics, wheelchairs, and several other devices. 26 The non-invasive method of EEG is used for collecting and monitoring the signals of the brain. 27 Implementing EEG-based BCI technology in home automation systems may facilitate a wide range 28 of tasks for people with disabilities. It is important to assist and empower individuals with paralysis 29 to engage with existing home automation systems and gadgets in this particular situation. This 30 paper proposed a home security system to control a door and a light using EEG-based BCI. The 31 system prototype consists of the EMOTIV Insight™ headset, Raspberry PI 4, servo motor to 32 open/close the door, and LED. The system can be very helpful for disabled people including arm 33 amputees who cannot close/open doors or use remote control to turn on/turn off doors. The system 34 includes an application made in Flutter to receive notifications on the smartphone related to the 35 status of the door and the LEDs. The disabled person can control the door as well as the LED using 36 his/her brain signals detected by the EMOTIV Insight™ headset.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45552bcadafa61f3c35116742118a2c2617e919c1d9f704abe6c3f34229fe0e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
