Moreover, specific strategies for diagnosing and managing malnutrition in OSCC are lacking. Methods: This retrospective study included 52 consecutive patients with OSCC who underwent surgery at the University Hospital of Palermo (I) from Jan 2020 to May 2023. In-hospital nutritional support was provided by a dedicated team. The patients were compared with a historical control group of 11 patients. The nutritional treatment consisted of standard oral (ON) or artificial nutrition (AN). Traditional measurements, including bioimpedance-derived body composition and volumetric reconstruction of the posterior paraspinal muscles at the C3 level based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-C3), were obtained in 16 patients to investigate sarcopenia. Results: The patients were categorized according to TNM stage: groups A (TNM stages I-III) and B (IVa-IVc). The prevalence of group A patients was 59.6% in the case group and 90.9% in the control group (P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7eff4849f879f7f4ddfc25f12785c118fcc817c2d91724089e13bb0b7d428781","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
