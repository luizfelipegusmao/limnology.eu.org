{"title":"Application of Methods Detecting Xenotransplantation-Relevant Viruses for Screening German Slaughterhouse Pigs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1569/v1","date":1719223426000,"content":"Detection methods have been developed to prevent transmission of zoonotic or xenozoonotic porcine viruses after transplantation of pig organs or cells to the recipient (xenotransplantation). Eleven xenotransplantation-relevant viruses including porcine cytomegalovirus, a porcine roseolovirus (PCMV/PRV), porcine lymphotropic herpesviruses -1, -2, -3 (PLHV-1, 2, 3), porcine parvovirus (PPV), porcine circovirus 2, 3, 4 (PCV2, 3, 4), hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV3), porcine endogenous retrovirus-C (PERV-C) and recombinant PERV-A/C have been selected. In the past, several pig breeds, minipigs and genetically modified pigs generated for xenotransplantation had been analyzed using these methods. Here, spleen, liver and blood samples from 10 German slaughterhouse pigs were screened using both, PCR-based and immunological assays. Five viruses: PCMV/PRV, PLHV-1, PLHV-3 and PERV-C were found in all animals, and PCV3 in one animal. Some animals were latently infected with PCMV/PRV as only virus-specific antibodies were detected. Others were also PCR positive in spleen and/or liver, indicative of an ongoing infection. These results provide important information on the viruses that infect German slaughterhouse pigs and together with results of previous studies revealed that the methods and test strategies efficiently work under field conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"670c30614beb69f6e2ba9dfe4ff0b70cadc47c64c2c7d26cfa58f12bc9135b06","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
