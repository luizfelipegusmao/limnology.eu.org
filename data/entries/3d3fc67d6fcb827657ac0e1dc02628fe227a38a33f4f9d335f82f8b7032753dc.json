Whereas APT avoids projection issues that may limit STEM, STEM does not suffer from limiting factors of APT such as data reconstruction, small volumetric regions of interest, and lack of crystallographic identification. The advent of aberration (C<sub>s</sub>) correction in STEM has also provided materials scientists and microscopists with the ability to observe microstructures and microchemistries at unparalleled length scales. To further push STEM to near the analytical resolution of APT others have demonstrated the ability to collect energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) tilt series on material ranging from semiconductors to nanoparticles [<a href=\"#ozae044.279-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.279-B2\">2</a>]. Although there are still projection issues, it does provide chemical analysis with respect to larger portions of the sample.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3d3fc67d6fcb827657ac0e1dc02628fe227a38a33f4f9d335f82f8b7032753dc","category":"Environment"}
