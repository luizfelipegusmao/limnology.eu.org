With the use of a nanoscale probe, 4D-STEM emerges as a potent diffraction technique for mapping strain in nanomaterials. Leveraging the electron microscope pixel array detector (EMPAD), nanobeam 4D data contain unsaturated center beams and clear diffraction spots, which are particularly advantageous for strain analysis in nanomaterials. Its capability has been demonstrated in achieving sub-picometer precision for strain mapping in two-dimensional monolayers [<a href=\"#ozae044.549-B1\">1</a>]. Moreover, it enables comprehensive mapping of entire samples over dimensions ranging from a few nanometers to tens of micrometers. However, nanoparticles pose challenges in 4D data processing, including lattice misalignments and projection complexities resulting from overlapped materials. Therefore, data processing strategies to address these challenges are imperative.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c3712cb5d379116ffd54277d1fd5445f8213c1c242bd9bd91d9bedfe06dbb0dd","category":"Environment"}
