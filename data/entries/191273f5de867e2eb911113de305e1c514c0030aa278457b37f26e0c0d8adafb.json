{"title":"Water and the Origin of Life","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0414/v1","date":1722939509000,"content":"This article reviews all the major stages in the origins of life. From the emergence of matter in the initial Big Bang to the modern, civilized human being. On an immaterial level, it is proposed and explained how consciousness necessarily takes precedence over matter. Next, we explain how consciousness, with its ability to process information, selected the water molecule to breathe life into the periodic table of elements. We also explain why the notion of entropy allows us to evolve: \"Die Entropie der Welt strebt einem Maximum zu\" (second principle) and, therefore, takes precedence over the notion of energy, which, on the contrary, encourages us to preserve what we have: \"Die Energie der Welt bleibt konstant\" (first principle). This is followed by a discussion of the importance of quantum coherence and the need to rely on a second quantization formalism for a proper understanding of the physical-biochemical properties of water. Moreover, throughout the argument developed on the best and most fundamental things science has to offer, care is taken to link this knowledge to the great philosophies of the West (Greece), the East (China, India) or even to practices of a shamanic nature (Africa, America). Hence, finally, the proposal to reconsider all musical practice within the framework of the diapason of water at a frequency of 429.62 Hz, as well as all therapeutic practice on the basis of seven clearly identified and established frameworks of thought.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"191273f5de867e2eb911113de305e1c514c0030aa278457b37f26e0c0d8adafb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
