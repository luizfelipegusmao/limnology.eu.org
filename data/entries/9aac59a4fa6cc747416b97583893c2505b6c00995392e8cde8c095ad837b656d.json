{"title":"ML Based Software Defect Prediction in Embedded Software for Telecommunication Systems(Focusing on the Case of SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0685/v1","date":1710227040000,"content":"Software stands as one of the most rapidly evolving technologies in the present era, characterized by its swift expansion in both scale and complexity which leads to challenges in quality assurance. Software Defect Prediction (SDP) emerges as a methodology crafted to anticipate undiscovered defects, leveraging known defect data from existing codes. This methodology serves to facilitate software quality management, thereby ensuring overall product quality. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methodologies exhibit superior accuracy and adaptability compared to traditional statistical approaches catalyzing active researches in this domain. However, it makes us hard to generalize not only because of the disparity between open-source project and commercial project but also the difference on each industrial sectors. Consequently, further research utilizing datasets sourced from diverse real-world sectors becomes imperative to bolster the applicability of these findings. In this study, we utilized embedded software for telecommunication systems of SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS, supplemented by the introduction of nine novel features to train the model, and subsequent analysis of results ensued. Experimental outcomes revealed that the F-measurement metric has been enhanced from 0.58 to 0.63 upon integration of the new features, thereby signifying a performance augmentation of 8.62%. This case study is anticipated to contribute to bolster the application of SDP methodologies within analogous industrial sectors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9aac59a4fa6cc747416b97583893c2505b6c00995392e8cde8c095ad837b656d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
