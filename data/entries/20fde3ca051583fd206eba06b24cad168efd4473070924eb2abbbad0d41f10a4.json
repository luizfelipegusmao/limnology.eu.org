However, its commercial production has not yet been achieved.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A strain with a strong surfactin-producing ability was isolated and identified as <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> SOPC5, based on the appearance of colonies, microscopic observation, and 16S rDNA sequencing. The isolate exhibited significant tolerance to acid, bile, gastric, and intestinal juices, and was sufficiently susceptible to antibiotics. <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> SOPC5 showed high levels of auto-aggregation and surface hydrophobicity, and a strong capacity to secrete protease, amylase, and cellulase. The strain also exhibited antibacterial activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> 10 306 with a antibacterial circle diameter of 18.0 ± 1.1 mm. The maximal yield of surfactin (1.32 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) was obtained by fermenting soybean meal (SBM) using the isolate under the following conditions: SBM 86 g L<sup>−1</sup>, inoculation 1.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU mL<sup>−1</sup>, FeSO<sub>4</sub> 1.2 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, MnSO<sub>4</sub> 2.6 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 0.5 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>, L-Glu 4 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, temperature 33 °C, duration 120 h, and shaking at 210 rpm. The purity of surfactin was 97.42% as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The half inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values for surfactin to scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS·<sup>+</sup>) were 1.275 ± 0.11 and 0.73 ± 0.08 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>, respectively.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study provides a scientific basis for the application of <i>B. subtilis</i> SOPC5 (as a potential probiotic) and the preparation of its metabolic product (surfactin). © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Chunhua Dai, \nZhenzhen Shu, \nChunfang Ma, \nPengfei Yan, \nLiurong Huang, \nRonghai He, \nHaile Ma","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"20fde3ca051583fd206eba06b24cad168efd4473070924eb2abbbad0d41f10a4","category":"Environment"}
