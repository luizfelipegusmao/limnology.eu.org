{"title":"Plant Synthetic Promoters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1084/v1","date":1713331561000,"content":"The article features the structure and functions of plant synthetic promoters frequently exercised to precisely regulate complex regulatory routes. The composition of plant native promoters together with interacting proteins is presented to provide a better understanding of tasks associated with synthetic promoter development. The production of synthetic promoters is conferred on relatively small libraries produced generally by basic molecular or genetic engineering methods such as cis-element shuffling or domain swapping. Moreover, the preparation of large-scale libraries supported by synthetic DNA fragments, directed evolution, and machine or deep learning methodologies is presented. \nA particularly interesting group of synthetic promoters are bidirectional forms that enable the putative expression of up to 6â€“8 genes by one regulatory element. The introduction and controlled expression of several genes after one transgenic event strongly decreases the frequency of such problems as complex segregation patterns and random integration of multiple transgenes. These complications are commonly observed during transgenic crop development through traditional, multistep transformation by genetic constructs containing a single gene. Another path to solving problems associated with the low complexity and homology of already tested DNA fragments is through orthogonal expression systems composed of synthetic promoters and trans-factors that do not occur in nature or arise from different species. Their structure, functions, and applications are rendered in the article.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da6ff52673bdb60c0fd5deaab8798364a53efc95af0d66441a4d357c27bf999b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
