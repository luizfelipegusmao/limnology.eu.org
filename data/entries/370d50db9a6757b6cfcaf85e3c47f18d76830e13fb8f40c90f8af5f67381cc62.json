{"title":"Influence of Process Parameters on the Mechanical Properties of 3D printed Metallic Specimens of Steel 1.2709 and 1.4542","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1434/v1","date":1726740467000,"content":"Process parameters influencing mechanical properties have always been a critical area of research for quite some time. We investigated the effect of laser power and laser scan velocity on the impact strength and maximum stress of 3D-printed metallic specimens of steel 1.2709 and 1.4542. Laser power significantly affected the impact strength and maximum stress of both the steels. With the increase in laser power, the impact strength increased for 1.2709 steel. However, there was a little increase in the impact strength with increasing laser power in the case of 1.4542 steel. Laser power had a decreasing impact on the maximum stress for 1.2709 steel. For 1.4542, maximum stress increased with increasing laser power, but then gradually declined. We observed that using laser power beyond 350W led to printing defect in the specimens, as maximum stress for some specimens reached close to zero in the case of 1.4542 steel. Laser scan velocity had a strong declining effect on the impact strength of 1.2709 steel.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"370d50db9a6757b6cfcaf85e3c47f18d76830e13fb8f40c90f8af5f67381cc62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
