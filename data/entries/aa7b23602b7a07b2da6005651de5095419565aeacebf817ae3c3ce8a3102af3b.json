{"title":"Microanalysis Society Awards: 2024 Award Recipients","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mt/article/32/4/17/7718047?rss=1","date":1721606400000,"content":"<span>Each year, the Microanalysis Society bestows several major awards during the Microscopy &amp; Microanalysis annual meeting. Regrettably, there is never enough time on stage to fully elaborate the recipients’ contributions to the science of microanalysis and the Society. This series of articles is intended to rectify this situation with brief biographies and accomplishments of each awardee. MAS award selections are made through a variety of mechanisms. For example, nominations for the Peter Duncumb Award for Excellence in Microanalysis come directly from the MAS membership, while nominations for the KFJ Heinrich Award come from the MAS Awards Committee via input by the microanalysis community. In addition, nominations for MAS Fellows are also contributed by MAS members. More information on the submission processes and a listing of previous award recipients and MAS Fellows can be found at <a href=\"https://the-mas.org/awards\">https://the-mas.org/awards</a>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"aa7b23602b7a07b2da6005651de5095419565aeacebf817ae3c3ce8a3102af3b","category":"Environment"}
