{"title":"Comprehensive Geophysical Exploration Technology for Sedimentary Exhalative Deposits: An Example from the Huaniushan Lead-Zinc-Silver Polymetallic Deposit in Gansu, China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1545/v1","date":1726750415000,"content":"The Huaniushan lead-zinc-silver deposit is a hydrothermal sedimentary exhalative deposit (SEDEX). The mining area has complex geological conditions. The main tectonic structure in the area is the Huaheitan-Shuangfengshan Fault (F3), which controls the distribution of strata and magmatic rocks. Since the discovery of the Huaniushan Lead-zinc-silver polymetallic deposit, there are diverse understandings of the deposit's genesis and mineralization law, making it challenging to meet the geological interpretation requirements of the Huaniushan Lead-zinc-silver polymetallic deposit. Moreover, a single geophysical exploration method utilizes limited rock physical parameters, making it difficult to effectively characterize underground structures. The integrated exploration of multiple geophysical methods can effectively integrate the geophysical characteristics of different rock physical parameters, reducing the multiplicity and uncertainty of geophysical data inverse interpretation. The comprehensive interpretation of three-dimensional inversion based on various geophysical data, the construction of geological-geophysical models based on geological grounds, the establishment of hidden ore exploration and positioning, and the rapid evaluation of geophysical technology systems are the current development trends in mineral exploration. In light of this, this paper conducts research on the three-dimensional inversion interpretation of the heavy magnetoelectric exploration data of the Huaniushan sedimentary exhalative deposit lead-zinc-silver polymetallic deposit in the mining area and constructs a three-dimensional geological-geophysical model of the study area based on the obtained three-dimensional physical structure of the underground three-dimensional density, magnetization intensity, resistivity, and polarizability structure of the study area, in combination with the information of related geology and drilling holes. It comprehensively interprets the favorable mineralization parts in the study area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db95c17b9f67b8f64d1d5953942d1ec4963bafe64ac02df3b376d40f258cb265","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
