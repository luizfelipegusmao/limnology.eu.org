{"title":"Domestic Use of E-Cargo Bikes and Other E-Micromobility: Protocol for a Multi-Centre, Mixed Methods Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2049/v1","date":1727350979000,"content":"Physical inactivity is a leading risk factor for non-communicable diseases.  Climate change is now regarded as the biggest threat to global public health. Electric micromobility (e-micromobility, including e-bikes e-cargo bikes and e-scooters) has the potential to simultaneously increase people’s overall physical activity while decreasing greenhouse gas emissions where it substitutes for motorised transport.  The ELEVATE study aims to understand the impacts of e-micromobility, including identifying the people, places and circumstances where they will be most beneficial in terms of improving people’s health while also reducing mobility-related energy demand and carbon emissions.  A complex mixed methods design collected detailed quantitative and qualitative data from multiple UK cities. First, a nationally representative (n=2000), city-wide (n = 1200) and targeted study area surveys have collected data on travel behaviour, levels of physical activity, vehicle ownership and use as well as attitudes towards e-micromobility. Then, to provide insights on an understudied type of e-micromobility, 49 households have been recruited to take part in e-cargo bike one-month trials. Self-reported data from participants are validated with objective data using methods such as GPS trackers and smartwatches recording of routes and activities. CO2  impacts of e-micromobility use are also calculated. Participant interviews provided detailed information on preferences, expectations, experiences, barriers and enablers of e-micromobility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0207ab911f52ca7b16ec97a52bc1db574d10ba788d8807c061d036d910ab68f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
