Ongoing improvement in environmental quality of surface waters requires many of these sites to meet stringent effluent standards. Since publication of the original model for nitrification on mineral media trickling filters by Pearce and Williams in 1999 and the model for nitrification on plastic media filters by Pearce and Edwards in 2010, they have attracted widespread use. Since publication, the models have undergone some refinement and benefitted from an increased application range. Furthermore, recent publications by Pearce and Yang have delivered widely based models for predicting average and seasonal humus tank effluent suspended solids and variability at a resolution of daily 95th percentile performance. This paper presents recent developments of the nitrification models and consolidates the suite of models now available for trickling filter design, evaluation and operation.</p>","author":"Peter Pearce","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"71d875b4ecfa28404053f140fbc399d89da03a66356dd6fb165957d2e87f550f","category":"Environment"}
