Methods: Twelve overweight women with normal-to-elevated BP were recruited and performed six exper-imental protocols in a randomized order: 1) control protocol (CC) – BP assessed without exercises performed, 2) strength training (ST), 3) foam rolling warm-up followed by strength training (FR+ST), 4) specific warm-up followed by strength training (SW+ST), 5) aerobic exercise followed by strength training (AE+ST), and 6) stretching exercises followed by strength training (SE+ST). Strength training consisted of three sets at 80% of 10RM with a self-suggested rest interval between sets for bench press, back squat, bench press 45º, front squat, lat pull-down, leg press, shoulder press, and leg extension. Results: All experimental protocol had a lower total training volume, fa-tigue index, and repetitions performance in relation to ST (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8e89e976038af45541f4c6b97053eb3bbf463774fcfc8b5fcf40f4d858bc7b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
