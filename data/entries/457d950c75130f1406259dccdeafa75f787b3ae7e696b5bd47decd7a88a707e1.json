{"title":"May DNA analyses be biased by hidden oxidative damage? Voltammetric study of temperature and oxidation stress effect","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305590","date":1718373600000,"content":"<p>by Oskar Szczepaniak, Marta Ligaj</p>\r\n\r\nThe analysis of nucleic acids is one of the fundamental parts of modern molecular biology and molecular diagnostics. The information collected predominantly depends on the condition of the genetic material. All potential damage induced by oxidative stress may affect the final results of the analysis of genetic material obtained using commonly used techniques such as polymerase chain reaction or sequencing. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of high temperature and pH on DNA structure in the context of the occurrence of oxidative damage, using square-wave voltammetry and two independent research protocols. We resulted in visible oxidation damage registered in acidic conditions after the thermal denaturation process (pH 4.7) with changes in the intensity of guanine and adenine signals. However, using phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for DNA denaturation negatively affected the DNA structure, but without any oxidized derivatives present. This leads to the conclusion that oxidation occurring in the DNA melting process results in the formation of various derivatives of nucleobases, both electrochemically active and inactive. These derivatives may distort the results of molecular tests due to the possibility of forming complementary bonds with various nucleobases. For example, 8-oxoguanine can form pairs with both cytosine and adenine.","author":"Oskar Szczepaniak","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"457d950c75130f1406259dccdeafa75f787b3ae7e696b5bd47decd7a88a707e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
