{"title":"162 Effect of molasses-based liquid supplement vs. corn-based dry supplement on beef cattle feedlot performance, carcass characteristics, and intestinal length","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/206/7664717?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Molasses-based liquid supplements contain sugars that can be fermented into butyrate, the primary source of energy for gastrointestinal (GIT) epithelial cells and may improve gut health and enhance beef cattle performance. The aim of this study was to examine how a molasses-based liquid supplement, in contrast to a dry-based supplement, impacts the performance, carcass characteristics, and intestinal length of beef cattle. Crossbred steers [n = 60; body weight (BW) = 381.7 ± 1.3 kg] were divided into 10 pens (5 pens per treatment; 6 steers per pen) and were assigned to one of two treatment groups: dry, which consisted of a 10% ground corn-based dry supplement, or liquid, which included a 10% liquid molasses-based supplement. All the steers were fed a high-forage diet (56%) and were transitioned to a high-grain diet (7%) on d 1 of the experiment. The animals were on feed for an average of 122 d and had ad libitum access to feed and water. Steers were weighed every 21 to 28 d, and feed intake, average daily gain (ADG), and gain to feed ratio (G:F) were assessed both overall and for two distinct periods: the initial period (IP) from d 0 to 69, and the subsequent or second period (SP) from d 70 until slaughter. Intestinal length was measured at the time of slaughter. Data analysis was performed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS. Body weight and ADG did not differ between treatments in either period, or overall (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.41). However, it is noteworthy that feed intake was greater for steers that received the dry supplement during both periods as well as across the entire study (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.04). In terms of G:F, steers provided with the liquid supplement demonstrated a tendency for improved efficiency in the second period (<span>P</span> = 0.09) and an overall greater efficiency (<span>P</span> = 0.04) compared with those receiving the dry supplement. Intestinal length exhibited no difference for both the small and large intestine (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.57). For carcass data parameters no differences were observed for hot carcass weight, dressing %, or %KPH (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.24). Fat depth tended to be greater (<span>P</span> = 0.06), and yield grade (<span>P</span> = 0.01) and marbling score (<span>P</span> = 0.03) were greater for the steers fed the dry supplement. Rib-eye area was greater (<span>P</span> = 0.03) for the liquid supplement group. Therefore, these findings suggest feeding a liquid based supplement to steers on a 93% concentrate diet decreases intake, maintains BW, and improves feed efficiency and carcass leanness compared with steers fed a dry supplement. However, the improvement in efficiency as a result of feeding a liquid based supplement was not caused by an increase in absorptive capacity through increased intestinal length.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"84baf8d3fd557046002341ae367888b57f4addd110535e048bf9b21b294029bd","category":"Environment"}
