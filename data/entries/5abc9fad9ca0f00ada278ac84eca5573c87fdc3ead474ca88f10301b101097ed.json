{"title":"Relationship between the level of physical activity and body mass index to blood pressure among overweight and obese young adults in the Northern Emirates city: A cross-sectional study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304360","date":1718892000000,"content":"<p>by Naina Choudhary, Kumaraguruparan Gopal, Waqar Naqvi, Praveen Kumar Kandakurti, Animesh Hazari</p>\r\nBackground <p>Obesity affects both adults and children all over the world and it is a major causative factor for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, different types of cancer, and even death. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the level of PA and BMI to the risk of developing high BP among overweight and obese young adults.</p> Methodology <p>A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Thumbay Medi-city Northern Emirates, Ajman, UAE. Participants enrolled in the study under the convenient sampling method and inclusion criteria: young overweight and obese individuals, male and female, aged between 18 to 30 years. Approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (CoHS, GMU (IRB-COHS-STD-110-JUNE-2023). The blood pressure and body mass index were clinically measured using standard tools whereas the GPAQ questionnaire was used to determine the level of physical activity of all participants.</p> Results <p>Out of 206 participants, 139 were overweight and 67 were obese. Further, 89 were found to have high normal BP, 93 normal BP, and 24 were found to have optimal blood pressure. The mean GPA scores were 322.8±62.28 in overweight individuals and 301.17±49.05 in obese individuals. Furthermore, among overweight and obese participants there is a weak correlation between PA &amp; BMI (r = 0.06, p = 0.88) and (r = 0.15, p = 0.44) and the BP and BMI (r = 0.18, p = 1.02) and (r = 0.16, p = 0.90) were found.</p> Conclusion <p>Although PA, BMI, and BP are assumed to be related variables leading to various non-communicable diseases the present study showed a weak correlation between the level of PA and BMI to the risk of developing BP among overweight and obese young adults in the Northern Emirates.</p>","author":"Naina Choudhary","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5abc9fad9ca0f00ada278ac84eca5573c87fdc3ead474ca88f10301b101097ed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
