{"title":"Industrial Catalytic Production Process of Erythromycin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1359/v1","date":1721200416000,"content":"The impact of COVID-19’s unexpected outbreak forced the scientific world to thoroughly seek alternative ways of treatment in order to overcome the hindrance of traditional medicine in alleviating the symptoms of this virus and possibly be an option for a potential cure in the near future. The antibiotic erythromycin, which was introduced in 1952, has been reported to pose an effective substitute medication for various ailments such as skin, respiratory, bone, female reproductive conditions, and cancer, as well as the newly added COVID-19’s aftermath. Countries, World Health Organization and the health industry have recruited and cooperated with numerous universities and institutions, so as to tackle the demand for efficient antibiotics, with USA and China leading this effort. Consequently, the catalytic mechanism of erythromycin’s synthesis and industrial production was discussed and analyzed further in order to gain a better understanding and extrapolate innovative and environmentally friendly methods of producing this antibiotic. Therefore, the demand for an increase and improvement in the production of erythromycin should be globally promoted, in order to deliver more effective results against infectious diseases such as COVID – 19.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68e543b97939e06d24b20d8388f8abba3b12cfe150cd4a7fa3dc766188e213c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
