{"title":"Assessment of Urban Resilience to Floods: A Spatial Planning Framework for Cities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0453/v1","date":1720130770000,"content":"Urbanization-led economic growth has created cities to drive infrastructure investments and population accumulation and exploit natural resources at an extreme phase. While coastal cities become vulnerable to climate change-induced extreme weather events and human-made disasters in recent history, effective measures to improve the resilience of cities are pivotal to developing sustainable living environments. This study proposes a framework to assess urban resilience to natural disasters (floods) using bottom-up spatial interactions among natural, physical, and social systems within cities and regions. It is noted that studies focus on either the vulnerability or coping capacity of urban communities to assess resilience, where effective strategies to manage disaster risk demand adaptation and mitigation measures at a spatial scale. Quantified resilience at small spatial units assists urban planning and disaster management agencies in the timely allocation of resources to optimize the recovery process. Moreover, spatial planning agencies can adopt resilience mapping to identify the potential growth zones while minimizing the natural disaster risks in urban growth management. Urban resilience can be embodied in spatial strategies with the operational framework proposed here, and future urban growth scenarios can be tested in multiple disaster conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"85747b5b8917ec998c87ec09a5e88de4dffeeead369f69d00a2b3bf287ad8dfd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
