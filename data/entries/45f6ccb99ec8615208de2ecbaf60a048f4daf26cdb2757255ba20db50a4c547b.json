{"title":"Robotics Application in the Hospital Domain: Operator-Patient- Robot Interface","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1161/v1","date":1718628226000,"content":"Robotic systems are increasingly being used in healthcare to improve patient care and support healthcare professionals. These robots are especially effective at performing repetitive tasks. In complex cancer cases, robots can enhance surgical precision and efficiency, resulting in reduced pain for patients and a lower risk of complications. Robot-assisted surgery offers high-quality 3D imaging, improved clarity, and increased efficiency. This review paper examines the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotic systems in the healthcare domain, specifically focusing on the interaction among operators, patients, and robots. The goal is to promote collaboration and improve healthcare provision through human-robot interaction. We considered already published articles by relevance, to identify the primary safety issues that need addressing for the integration of AI and robots in hospitals. Concluding with insights into understanding the focal points of social errors in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is crucial for mitigating these errors. While current technologies have reached a certain level of maturity, there are still numerous challenges in utilizing robot-assisted clinical practice, including technological, safety, clinical, financial, insurance, psychological, social, ethical, and legal issues. In addition, there is an urgent issue that needs to be addressed: the alignment of values in artificial intelligence, ensuring that AI systems reflect ethical principles and human values is crucial to avoid negative consequences such as bias, discrimination, and prejudicial decisions. Resolving this complex issue requires collaboration among clinical staff, researchers, programmers, and political decision-makers from various fields.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45f6ccb99ec8615208de2ecbaf60a048f4daf26cdb2757255ba20db50a4c547b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
