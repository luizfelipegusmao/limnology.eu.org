{"title":"Review of the Il-18 and IL37 Implications in the Pathogenesis of Atopic Dermatitis and Psoriasis: Prospective Treatment Targets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1196/v1","date":1718691387000,"content":"Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are prevalent inflammatory skin conditions with diverse treatment options. Despite advances in understanding their underlying mechanisms, recent research highlights the significance of interleukins IL-18 and IL-37 as potential therapeutic targets. This review synthesizes knowledge on these interleukins, their roles in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, and emerging treatment strategies. Findings of a literature search up to May 30, 2024 underscore a research gap in IL-37-targeted therapies. Conversely, IL-18-focused treatments have demonstrated promise in adult-onset Stillâ€™s Disease, warranting further exploration for their potential efficacy in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee05eb159648f2fa21543f6da589b9ce74165d1d9c6fe27c340a89ba4f37a3df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
