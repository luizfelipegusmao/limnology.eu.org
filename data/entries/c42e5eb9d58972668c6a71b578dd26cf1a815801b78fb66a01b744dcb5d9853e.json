{"title":"Celebrating the career of Angela Gurnell","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4328?af=R","date":1720605085000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This Special Issue arose from a 1-day international workshop on the theme of <i>Fluvial Biogeomorphology</i> to mark Professor Angela Gurnell's official retirement. As co-editors, we felt this Special Issue also afforded an opportunity which we could not let pass by to capture some key aspects of Angela's inspiring and impactful career to date. We have written this Preface to accompany the main Editorial as a celebration of Angela's distinguished career and the many contributions Angela has made to physical geography and in particular fluvial geomorphology. We present an overview of Angela's career, insights into key research areas and contributions through a consideration of her publications, and her work inspiring early career researchers through PhD supervision before some final, more personal, reflections.</p>","author":"G.
