{"title":"Fine-Grained Recognition of Mixed Signals with Geometry Coordinate Attention","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1232/v1","date":1716213659000,"content":"With the advancement of technology, signal modulation types are becoming increasingly diverse and complex. The phenomenon of signal time-frequency overlap during transmission poses significant challenges for the classification and recognition of mixed signals, including poor recognition capabilities and low generality. This paper presents a recognition model for fine-grained analysis of mixed signal characteristics, proposing a Geometry Coordinate attention mechanism and introducing a low-rank bilinear pooling module to more effectively extract signal features for classification. The model employs a residual neural network as its backbone architecture and utilizes the Geometry Coordinate attention mechanism for time-frequency weighted analysis based on information geometry theory. This analysis targets multiple-scale features within the architecture, producing time-frequency weighted features of the signal. These weighted features are further analyzed through a low-rank bilinear pooling module, combined with the backbone features, to achieve fine-grained feature fusion. This results in a fused feature vector for mixed signal classification. Experiments were conducted on a simulated dataset comprising 39,600 mixed signal time-frequency plots. The model was benchmarked against a baseline using a residual neural network. The experimental outcomes demonstrated an improvement of 9% in the exact match ratio and 5% in the Hamming score. These results indicate that the proposed model significantly enhances the recognition capability and generalizability of mixed signal classification.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bca2fccf9a99d822c991fe53eebe9b2b10be3cc15476a476914fa0077d4a0ff5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
