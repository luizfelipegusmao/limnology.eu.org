{"title":"Revolutionizing Crisis Management: Innovative Supply Chain Strategies for Resilient Pharmaceutical Companies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0243/v1","date":1722910480000,"content":"Pharmaceutical companies use crisis management as a vital technique to lessen the effects of catastrophes. In this study, the author highlighted the significance of supply chain management for crisis management in the pharmaceutical industry. The study concludes by discussing the role that supply chain management plays in crisis management and offering pharmaceutical businesses advice on how to run their supply chains in an emergency. We conclude after conducting a thorough analysis of the literature review and regress research. These are actions that pharmaceutical organizations can take to strengthen their supply chain management skills and enhance their crisis readiness: Identifying possible supply chain risks through routine risk evaluations; Creating backup strategies in case the supply chain is disrupted; Establishing procedures to guarantee a smooth and efficient supply of medications in an emergency; and Collaborating with vendors and other stakeholders to increase the resilience of the supply chain. The pharmaceutical industry is critical to healthcare, providing safe and effective medicines to patients. Supply chain management is essential for maintaining the flow of medicines during crises. Proactive risk assessment, backup plans, teamwork, and efficient communication are all critical for crisis management in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in supply chain management. In India, inadequate transportation infrastructure leads to a significant expense for pharmaceutical businesses. To mitigate negative effects, such as reduced healthcare access and insurance coverage, the study suggests implementing multi-echelon, closed-loop green supply chain models. These strategies aim to minimize total costs and ensure efficient resource management. To improve the resilience of pharmaceutical and consumable medical equipment during crises, policymakers should integrate modern technologies and consider business complexity, economic development, intense competition, and changing customer needs. The relationship between manufacturers, distributors, prescribers, and insurance organizations as purchasers should also be considered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1dbe5913414a00a6682aa6c6f2fe3cc029cfac82198e363ae3c1a3c8723a5e32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
