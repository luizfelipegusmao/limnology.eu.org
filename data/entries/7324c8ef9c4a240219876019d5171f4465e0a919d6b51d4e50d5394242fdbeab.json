{"title":"A Survey in Eastern Europe on the Evaluation of Umami Taste","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1416/v1","date":1716382040000,"content":"The umami taste, one of the five primary tastes, has been shown to be a helpful tool in reducing salt intake and improving eating patterns. This study aimed to investigate how umami taste is perceived and evaluated in a sample of adult participants living in Eastern Europe, taking into account their sex, education, and travel habits. A Text Semantic-mining Analysis (TSA) was conducted using data from 300 adults (152 males and 148 females, mean age = 26.71 years). They also performed an MSG and NaCl (salt) discrimination test and were further interviewed about taste preferences, travel habits, and type of residence. The results indicated that the taste sensation elicited by the MSG solution was complex, unfamiliar and had negative valence. The descriptor most commonly used for MSG was \"sour,\" followed by \"bitter\" and \"salty\" for the whole group, but these differed by gender. There was no difference in umami preference between males and females, but males preferred spicy flavors while females favored sweet and salty tastes. This finding underscores the potential bias and unknown significance of umami taste, suggesting the importance of establishing an accurate concept in European culture and promoting its usage in food choices for better health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7324c8ef9c4a240219876019d5171f4465e0a919d6b51d4e50d5394242fdbeab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
