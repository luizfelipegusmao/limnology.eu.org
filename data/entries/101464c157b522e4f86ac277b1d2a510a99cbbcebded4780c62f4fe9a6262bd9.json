{"title":"It takes two to tango: the second session of negotiations (INC-2) for a global treaty to end plastic pollution","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13412-024-00906-4","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The United Nations (UN) Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) has completed its second round of negotiations on a new international legally binding instrument to ‘end plastic pollution’. This paper examines the results of the second session of negotiations, which took place May 29–June 2, 2023, and analyses the trends, barriers, and themes shaping the emerging legally binding instrument. The paper considers the discussion surrounding the Options Paper as presented by the INC Secretariat and United Nations Environmental Program based upon written submissions received by UN member states prior to the second session of negotiations. These include potential elements the future treaty text may include—namely objectives, core obligations, and implementation and monitoring measures. At the second session of negotiations, progress towards consensus on these items was severely lacking. We draw on close observations via event ethnography of participants during the negotiations and document analysis. We conclude by looking towards the third round of negotiations by discussing the ongoing ‘dance’ of sorts as submissions are being asked of member states and like-minded groups to contribute to the zero draft treaty text.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"101464c157b522e4f86ac277b1d2a510a99cbbcebded4780c62f4fe9a6262bd9","category":"Environment"}
