Ng, Shineui Kim, Nikhil Chervu, Zihan Gao, Saad Mallick, Peyman Benharash, Hanjoo Lee</p>\r\nBackground <p>Disparities in colorectal cancer screening have been documented among people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). However, surgical outcomes in this population have yet to be studied. The present work aimed to evaluate the association of IDD with outcomes following colorectal cancer resection.</p> Methods <p>All adults undergoing resection for colorectal cancer in the 2011–2020 National Inpatient Sample were identified. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were developed to examine the association of IDD with risk factors as well as outcomes including mortality, complications, costs, length of stay (LOS), and non-home discharge. The study is limited by its retrospective nature and did not capture disease staging or time of diagnosis.</p> Results <p>Among 722,736 patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection, 2,846 (0.39%) had IDD. Compared to patients without IDD, IDD patients were younger and had a higher burden of comorbidities. IDD status was associated with increased odds of non-elective admission (AOR 1.40 [95% CI 1.14–1.73]) and decreased odds of treatment at high-volume centers (AOR 0.64 [95% CI 0.51–0.81]). Furthermore, IDD patients experienced significantly greater LOS (9 vs 6 days, p&lt;0.001) and hospitalization costs ($23,500 vs $19,800, p&lt;0.001) relative to neurotypical patients. Upon risk adjustment, IDD was significantly associated with 2-fold increased odds of mortality (AOR 2.34 [95% CI 1.48–3.71]), 1.4-fold increase in complications (AOR 1.41 [95% CI 1.15–1.74]), and 6.8-fold increase in non-home discharge (AOR 6.83 [95% CI 5.46–8.56]).</p> Conclusions <p>IDD patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection experience increased likelihood of non-elective admission, adverse clinical outcomes, and resource use. Our findings highlight the need for more accessible screening and patient-centered interventions to improve quality of surgical care for this at-risk population.</p>","author":"Ayesha P.
