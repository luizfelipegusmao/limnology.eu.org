Understanding the feedback loops between increased litter inputs and soil biota activity will allow for better prediction of organic matter and carbon (C) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nNematodes represent the full spectrum of trophic groups within the soil biota. Accordingly, we studied the link between nematode metabolic activities and plant litter input. For this, different litter input levels were manipulated in a temperate forest, including control zones without litter, natural litter input zones and zones with double, triple and quadruple amounts of natural litter input. Soil top layers (0–10 cm) were then collected to study the responses of nematode communities.\n\nIncreased litter input positively influenced the abundance and diversity of nematodes, except for plant-parasitic species. Higher litter input levels led to an enhancement in the ratio of bacterivores to the total of bacterivores and fungivores. More litter increased the <i>K</i>/<i>r</i> strategist ratio among bacterivores and the corresponding nematode metabolic footprints. More litter also stimulated nematode production and respiration components and improved the carbon use efficiency of bacterivores. Moreover, structural equation modelling revealed the crucial role of bacterivores in influencing soil organic C under increased litter input.\n\nIn conclusion, our study shows that increased plant above-ground litter input modifies the taxonomic and functional communities of soil nematodes, ultimately regulating carbon cycling in forest soils.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/07/02/the-activities-of-soil-nematodes-are-driven-by-the-amount-of-plant-aboveground-litter-input/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Zhiyong Zhang, \nRenhui Miao, \nSergio Rasmann","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"b72cf69e9aec9e9b7255a636f040abe47392531b9196bbc828a782ae98fba772","category":"Environment"}
