The dissolution of agriculture as a cultural practice has led to a reduction in daily physical activity, contributing to an alarming increase in non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. This article explores how Nepal can adopt new health-oriented cultural practices to combat obesity, drawing inspiration from the gym culture in the United States and the cycling culture in Europe. It advocates for the promotion of physical activity through community-based fitness programs, active transportation, and integrating exercise into educational curriculums. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of reviving traditional dietary practices and supporting mental well-being. The article underscores the need for government support in implementing policies and infrastructure that foster a culture of health, ensuring a healthier future for Nepal's population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"841ccdd0283c708e67ea73ea76c4cd3c955be9be2ca3dfc76c3a80f689b72eac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
