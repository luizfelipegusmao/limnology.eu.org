However, local manifestations of global changes, anthropogenic pressures, and species characteristics may lead to unanticipated and varied responses by individual species. In this regard, the Celtic-Biscay Shelf is a particularly interesting study system because it has historically been heavily fished and occurs at the interface between two distinct biogeographic provinces, its community thus comprised of species with diverse thermal preferenda. In the context of rapidly warming temperatures and intense fishery exploitation, we investigated the distribution shifts of 93 taxa (65 Actinopteri, 10 Elasmobranchii, 11 Cephalopoda, 5 Malacostraca, and 2 Bivalvia), which were sampled annually from 1997 to 2020 during a scientific bottom trawl survey. We used a set of 11 complementary spatial indices to quantify taxon distribution shifts over time. Then, we explored the relative effect of taxon abundance, fishing pressure, and climatic conditions on taxon's distribution shift when a significant shift was detected. We observed that 56% of the taxa significantly shifted. Not all taxa will necessarily shift northward and to deeper areas, as it is often expected. Two opposite patterns were identified: taxa either moving deeper and to the southeast, or moving closer to the surface and to the northwest. The main explanatory factors were climate change (short- and long-term temperatures) and taxon abundance. Fishing pressure was the third, but still significant, explanatory factor of taxa of greater commercial importance. Our research highlights that taxa are displaying complex distribution shifts in response to the combined anthropogenic disturbances and underscores the need to conduct regional studies to better understand these responses at the ecosystem scale to develop more suitable management plans and policies.</p>","author":"Emilie LeÂ Luherne, \nLionel Pawlowski, \nMarianne Robert","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"2d93a13fd96da87d0b763fc4f631f77a2e37b2610f9650de25a8a72d189ac7a1","category":"Environment"}
