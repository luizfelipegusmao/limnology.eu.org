{"title":"The Influence of In-Plane Constraints on Fatigue Crack Growth Rate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1244/v1","date":1726629458000,"content":"The geometry of structural members can influence the fatigue crack growth rate. In the paper, the T-stress depending on the element's geometry is used to quantify the effect of geometry on the fatigue crack growth rate. A series of fatigue tests on three-point bending specimens with different initial crack lengths were conducted. As a result, the dependence of the crack growth rate on the T-stress value was obtained.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17bf39c77f8842518acd7057a888d746a67afdbdaab59de23c518896e6b07397","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
