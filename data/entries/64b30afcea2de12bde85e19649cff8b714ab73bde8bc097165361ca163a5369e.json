{"title":"Method of Motion Planning for Digital Twin Navigation and Cutting of Shearer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2204/v1","date":1722242813000,"content":"To further enhance the intelligence level of coal mining faces and achieve autonomous derivation, learning, and optimization of shearer navigation cutting, this paper proposes the methods of shearer digital twin navigation cutting motion planning based on the concept of shearer autonomous navigation cutting technology and intelligent coal mining face digital twins. The study includes the digital twin theory and the construction method of the shearer digital twin navigation cutting motion planning system based on this theory. Based on the digital twin theory, a shearer digital twin navigation cutting motion planning system was constructed. This system supports the service functions of shearer cutting digital twin, dynamic navigation map digital twin, reinforcement learning environment construction, and motion planning through the physical perception layer, comprehensive data layer, and digital-model fusion analysis layer. Finally, by comparing the effects of the DQN-NAF and DDPG deep reinforcement learning algorithms in the shearer motion planning task within the constructed digital twin environment, the results show that the DQN-NAF algorithm demonstrates better performance and stability in solving the shearer digital twin motion planning task.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64b30afcea2de12bde85e19649cff8b714ab73bde8bc097165361ca163a5369e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
