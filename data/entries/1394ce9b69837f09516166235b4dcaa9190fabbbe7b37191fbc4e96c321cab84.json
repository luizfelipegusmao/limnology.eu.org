{"title":"Stochastic Parameterization of Moist Physics Using Probabilistic Diffusion Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1262/v1","date":1726498107000,"content":"Deep-learning-based convection schemes receive wide attention due to its impressive im-provement on precipitation distribution and tropical convections of earth system simulation. But they cannot represent the stochasticity of moist physics, which will degrade the simulation of large-scale circulations, climate mean, and variability. To solve this problem, a stochastic pa-rameterization scheme based on probabilistic diffusion model named DIFF-MP is developed. The cloud-resolving data from GRIST model is coarse-grained into resolved-scale variables and sub-grid contributions due to moist physics to form the training data. DIFF-MP’s performance is compared against generative adversarial network and variational autoencoder. Results show that DIFF-MP is consistently better than the other two models on prediction error, coverage ratio, and spread-skill correlation. The standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of subgrid contributions generated by DIFF-MP is also closer to the testing data than the others. Interpretability experiment shows that DIFF-MP’s parameterization of moist physics is physically reasonable.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1394ce9b69837f09516166235b4dcaa9190fabbbe7b37191fbc4e96c321cab84","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
