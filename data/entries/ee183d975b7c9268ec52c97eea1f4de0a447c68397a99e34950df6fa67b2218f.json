{"title":"Impact of Preprocessing Parameters in Multimodality Imaging-Based Radiomic Studies: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1716/v1","date":1719299962000,"content":"Lately, radiomic studies featuring the development of a signature to use in prediction models in diagnosis or prognosis outcomes are being published increasingly. While the results are shown to be promising, these studies still have many pitfalls and limitations. One of the main issues of this methodology is that radiomic features depend on how the images are preprocessed before their computation. Since, in widely known and used software for radiomic features calculation, it is possible to set these preprocessing parameters before the calculation of the radiomic feature, there are ongoing studies assessing the stability and repeatability of radiomic features to find the most suitable preprocessing parameters for every used imaging modality. This review examines the impact of preprocessing parameters on the reproducibility and reliability of radiomic features extracted from multimodality imaging (CT, MRI, CBCT, PET/CT). Standardized preprocessing is crucial for consistent radiomic feature extraction. Key preprocessing steps include voxel resampling, normalization, and discretization, which influence feature robustness and reproducibility. From our work, we highlighted the need to harmonize the use of preprocessing parameters and their values, especially in light of future studies of prospective studies, which are still lacking in the current literature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee183d975b7c9268ec52c97eea1f4de0a447c68397a99e34950df6fa67b2218f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
