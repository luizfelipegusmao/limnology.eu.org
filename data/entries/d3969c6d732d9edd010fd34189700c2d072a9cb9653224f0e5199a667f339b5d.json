To assess whether Salas y Gómez Island serves as a nursery area for the Galápagos shark <i>Carcharhinus galapagensis</i>, we conducted a thorough literature review. Multiple lines of evidence show that young-of-the-year (YOY);  inhabiting the remote Salas y Gómez Island (1) present a higher density around Salas y Gómez Island than the surrounding deeper oceanic waters and in the south-eastern Pacific, (2) potentially display high fidelity to this area, and (3) demonstrate the repeated use of this area over multiple years. We also discuss the significance of this isolated island for the Galápagos shark population and propose specific research, management, and conservation actions for its preservation.</p>","author":"Naití Morales‐Serrano, \nAdriana Gonzalez‐Pestana","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"d3969c6d732d9edd010fd34189700c2d072a9cb9653224f0e5199a667f339b5d","category":"Environment"}
