{"title":"MicroRNAomic Analysis of Spent Media From Slow and Fast-Growing Bovine Embryos Reveal Distinct Differences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0596/v1","date":1715566917000,"content":"In bovine embryos, microRNA (miRNA) expression has been profiled at each stage of early development in-vitro. miRNAomic analysis of spent media has the potential to reveal characteristics of embryo health, however, applications are limited without categorizing miRNA profiles by embryo quality. Time-lapse imaging has shown the timing of embryo development in-vitro may be indicative of their developmental potential. The aim of the study was to profile miRNAs in the spent media of slow and fast-growing bovine embryos throughout the pre-implantation period. Bovine cumulus-oocyte-complexes were aspirated from ovaries, fertilized, and cultured to blastocyst stage of development. At 2-cell, 8-cell, and blastocyst stage, each microdrop of 30 presumptive-zygotes were classified as slow or fast-growing based on the percentage of embryos that had reached the desired morphological stage. Following hybridization on a GeneChip miRNA 4.0 array, comparative analysis was conducted between spent media of slow and fast-growing embryos. In total, 34 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between the comparison groups, with 14 of the miRNAs detected in the 2-cell samples, 7 miRNAs detected in the 8-cell samples, and 12 miRNAs detected in the blastocyst samples. The results demonstrate distinct miRNAs populations can be identified between slow and fast-growing embryos, highlighting novel biomarkers of developmental potential at each stage of pre-implantation development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2d24d183895b5f135aba697614d1bf09ce2e89d73057daff8d1cb55193a9113","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
