{"title":"Economic and Environmental Effects Evaluation of Farmer&rsquo;s Green Production Behaviors: Evidence from Major Rice-Producing Areas in Jiangxi Province, China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1681/v1","date":1721634069000,"content":"Evaluating the economic and environmental effects of farmers' green production behaviors holds important reference value for promoting sustainable agricultural development, alleviating agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution, and achieving the organic combination of environmental protection and economic development. This paper utilizes survey data from 1,345 farm households in the main rice production areas of Jiangxi Province, China, using the example of reduced fertilizer application (RFA) among rice farmers. By constructing a DEAâ€”SBM model with undesirable outputs to measure environmental effects, and applying an endogenous switching model to test the economic and environmental effects of farmers' adoption of green production technologies. The study found that: (1)The behavior of RFA by farmers has a significant positive impact on their net profit per mu(NPPA), helping farmers increase their income, with the increase ranging from 2.05% to 6.54%. (2)The behavior of RFA by farmers has a significant positive impact on agricultural green productivity(AGP), contributing to the improvement of the environment, with the improvement ranging from 44.09% to 45.35%. (3)Heterogeneity analysis found inconsistencies in the income-enhancing and environmental-enhancing effects at different quantiles of NPPA and AGP. Therefore, attention should be placed on improving the agricultural product quality supervision system under the market circulation mechanism, creating land scale conditions conducive to the promotion and application of fertilizer reduction technologies, and promoting the implementation of externality internalization compensation systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eed4f7a8f93f08d7903c4c9459266bf8c1f4e379c0f54c15e89c0c5f87662aa1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
