{"title":"Observation, Analysis and Numerical Simulation of a Low-Level Windshear Case at Beijing Daxing International Airport","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1113/v1","date":1710844167000,"content":"A case of low level windshear at Beijing Daxing International Airport is studied in the present pa-per.  It is related to the synoptic scale/mesoscale changes of the airflow pattern over northern China.  The shear was captured well by the Doppler LIDAR at the airport and timely alerts had been issued.  This study considers the technical feasibility of forecasting the shear feature using a high resolution numerical weather prediction model with a lead time of several hours.  It turns out that the shear feature could be forecast well, and is generally consistent with the actual observations.  However, there are still discrepancies between reality and the simulation, such as the strength of the shear and persistency of the feature.  More cases of windshear at Daxing airport would be studied in the fu-ture in order to understand the nature of windshear over there.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb953dc0379f1bf32e7f86cd3c89c017d4ad98f55dbdf8ac707878c4af80bc1b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
