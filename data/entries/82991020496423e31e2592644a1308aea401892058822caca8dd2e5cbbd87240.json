Outcomes of interest were global survival and event-free survival, improvement in motor function and treatment-related adverse events. Risk of bias assessment and certainty of evidence were performed for each outcome. Proportional meta-analysis models were performed when applicable.</p> Results <p>Four reports of three open-label, non-comparative clinical trials covering 67 patients were included. Meta-analyses of data available in a 12-month follow-up estimate a global survival of 97.56% (95%CI: 92.55 to 99.86, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%, n = 67), an event-free survival of 96.5% (95%CI: 90.76 to 99.54, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 32%, n = 66) and a CHOP-INTEND score ≥ 40 points proportion of 87.28% (95%CI: 69.81 to 97.83, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 69%, n = 67). Proportion of 52.64% (95%CI: 27.11 to 77.45, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 78%, n = 67) of treatment-related adverse events was estimated.</p> Conclusion <p>The results indicate a potential change in the natural history of type 1 SMA, but the methodological limitations of the studies make the real extent of the technology’s long-term benefits uncertain.</p>","author":"Brígida Dias Fernandes","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"82991020496423e31e2592644a1308aea401892058822caca8dd2e5cbbd87240","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
