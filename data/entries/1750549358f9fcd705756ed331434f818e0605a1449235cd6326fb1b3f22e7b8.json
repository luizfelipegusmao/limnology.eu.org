The incorporation of microgreens juice powder (MJP) into muffins boosts their nutritional value. The influence of the incorporation of wheatgrass, fenugreek and basil MJP at 1.5% and 3.0% levels on the nutritional composition, physical properties, pasting, sensory, textural and phenolic profile of functional muffins was evaluated.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results indicated a significant increase in the protein content, ash content, dietary fiber and total phenolic content of MJP incorporated muffins. The incorporation of MJP to the muffins led to a gradual reduction in the <i>L</i>*, <i>a</i>* and <i>b</i>* values. Baking characteristic such as bake loss decreased significantly as a result of MJP incorporation. Furthermore, the incorporation of various MJPs resulted in a significant decrease in the peak viscosity of the flour-MJP blends. Regarding texture, the hardness and chewiness of the muffins increased progressively with an increase in the level of MJP incorporation. The highest hardness (10.15 N) and chewiness (24.45 mJ) were noted for 3% fenugreek MJP incorporated muffins (FK 3.0). The sensory score of MJP incorporated muffins was acceptable and satisfactory. Additionally, 3% basil MJP incorporated muffins (<i>BL 3.0</i>) marked the dominant presence of majority of the detected phenolic acids such as ferulic acid, sinapic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin, cinnamic acid, isothymosin and rosamarinic acid. The highest concentration of <i>p-</i>coumaric acid (11.95 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>), vanillic acid (26.07 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) and kaempferol (8.04 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) was recorded for FK 3.0 muffin.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>MJP incorporated muffins revealed the pool of phenolic acids and the reduced bake loss is of industrial interest. The present study concludes that wheatgrass, fenugreek and basil MJP can be incorporated by up to 3% into baked products as a source of functional ingredients for health benefits. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Arun Kumar, \nNarpinder Singh","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"1750549358f9fcd705756ed331434f818e0605a1449235cd6326fb1b3f22e7b8","category":"Environment"}
