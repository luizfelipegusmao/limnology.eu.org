{"title":"Unveiling the True Nature of Sliding Friction through Thermodynamic Principles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0069/v1","date":1714548729000,"content":"Friction, one of the oldest technologies harnessed by humanity, has thus far eluded a theoretical model capable of predicting kinetic friction forces across a broad range of sliding velocities. This study employs the first principle of thermodynamics to delve into sliding friction. For the first time, a general expression for the friction force has been derived, revealing that the damping of sliding friction is inversely proportional to the relative sliding velocity between the two interfaces in motion, contrary to the assumption in traditional models that it is directly proportional to the relative velocity. To simplify the general result, the concept of a friction boundary layer is introduced. An approximate expression is found to reveal the mechanism for reducing friction, which involves increasing the sliding velocity while decreasing the vibration velocity of the object perpendicular to the sliding interface.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"393a0a86b01071a85d72f31dae337356819dfa7a3a7b058ec07f826128d6a5b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
