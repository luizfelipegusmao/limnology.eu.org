{"title":"Study of Physical Properties of Copper Oxide Thin Films Prepared by Spin Coating for Hole Transport Applications in Perovskite Solar Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0515/v1","date":1723032996000,"content":"Different materials prepared by appropriate synthesis methods and applying different post syn-thesis processes could be used as hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells. In the present work annealing was employed to enhance physical properties of copper oxide (CuO) thin films fabricated via spin coating technique and the effects of annealing on their optical, morphological, electrical and structural properties were investigated. The XRD findings revealed the polycrystalline structure with large crystallite size. Optical spectra showed larger transmission beyond the visible region, reduced absorption, and a decrease in bandgap energy from 1.93 eV to 1.81 eV. The Ag phonon modes at 299.22 and 304 cm-1 shown by the Raman shift confirmed the development of the CuO pure phase. FTIR spectra showed the Cu-O stretching band at 759, 764 and 446 cmâˆ’1. SEM revealed the agglomeration of nano crystallites with large grains on the surface. The carrier type conductivity of annealed CuO thin films was determined via two-point hot probe technique. Low resistivity values were determined via four-point probe method. These findings indicate that CuO thin films may be successfully used as a companion with an n-type layer in p-n junction solar cells, and a hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52ccf616ea6308011bcc476623c964aaafda1c818545eeaf6c618868038592ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
