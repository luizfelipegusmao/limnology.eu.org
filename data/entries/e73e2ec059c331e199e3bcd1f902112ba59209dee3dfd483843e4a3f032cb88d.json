{"title":"Effects of dietary citrus pulp level on the growth and intestinal health of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13157?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Citrus pulp (CP) is rich in pectin, and studies have shown that pectin possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gut microbiota-regulating properties. However, the application of CP in aquafeed is limited. In this study, the effect of dietary inclusion of CP on the intestinal health of largemouth bass (<i>Micropterus salmoides</i>) was investigated. Juveniles of similar size (6.95 ± 0.07 g) were fed isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets containing different levels of CP (0%, 3%, 6%, 9%, 12%, or 15%) for 58 days.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>As the level of CP in the feed for largemouth bass increased, the fish's growth performance and intestinal health initially improved and then declined. Adding low doses of CP (≤9%) to the feed had no significant impact on the growth performance of large-mouth black bass, whereas high doses of CP (&gt;9%) significantly reduced their growth performance. Adding 6%, 9%, or 12% of CP to that feed enhanced the expression of genes related to tight junctions, anti-inflammatory activity, anti-apoptotic activity, and antioxidant activity in the intestines of largemouth bass. It reduced intestinal inflammation and improved intestinal nutrient absorption, intestinal mucosal barrier function, and intestinal antioxidant capacity. Moreover, it improved the α-diversity, structure, and function of the intestinal flora. The addition of 6% CP had the most beneficial effect on the intestinal health of largemouth bass. On the other hand, the addition of 15% CP had adverse effects on the intestinal antioxidant capacity and intestinal mucosal barrier function of largemouth bass.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Adding 6–9% CP to the feed for largemouth bass can improve their intestinal health without having a significant impact on their growth performance. CP could serve as a novel prebiotic and immunostimulant ingredient in aquafeed. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Wen Long, \nJiajie Luo, \nHongdong Ou, \nWen Jiang, \nHang Zhou, \nYongyin Liu, \nLu Zhang, \nHaifeng Mi, \nJunming Deng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"e73e2ec059c331e199e3bcd1f902112ba59209dee3dfd483843e4a3f032cb88d","category":"Environment"}
