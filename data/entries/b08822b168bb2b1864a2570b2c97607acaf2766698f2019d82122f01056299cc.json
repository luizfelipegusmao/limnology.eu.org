{"title":"Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte and Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio: Side by Side with Molecular Mutations in Patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. The INOLUNG Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0487/v1","date":1720229398000,"content":"Background and objective: Analysis of inflammatory biomarkers, along with the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) or platelets/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), supports the connection between inflammation and carcinogenesis. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study at the Clinical County Hospital Mureș, including patients with lung cancer. The parameters analyzed included: histopathological type (NSCLC - squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma; SCLC), molecular mutations (EGFR, ALK, PD-L1), parameters from the complete blood count, inflammatory parameters and associated comorbidities. Results: 380 patients were included: 115 patients in the cancer group and 265 patients in the control group. Among patients in the lung cancer group, 88 were diagnosed with NSCLC (44 adenocarcinomas, 44 squamous cell carcinomas) and 27 with SCLC. Both NLR and PLR were significantly higher in cancer patients than in the control group (5,30 versus 2,60, p&amp;lt;0,001; 217 versus 136, p&amp;lt; 0.001, respectively). NLR and PLR differs between men and women (p = 0.005, respectively p=0.056). C-reactive protein was not correlated with either NLR (p-value: 0.0669) or PLR (p-value: 0.6733) in lung cancer patients. Conclusion: The NLR and PLR values ​​may serve as new predictive biomarkers for the diagnostic of disease in patients with lung cancer, especially those with NSCLC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b08822b168bb2b1864a2570b2c97607acaf2766698f2019d82122f01056299cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
