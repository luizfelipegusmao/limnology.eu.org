{"title":"Postnatal quality of care measures for mothers and newborns at home: A scoping review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003498","date":1724162400000,"content":"<p>by Ann-Sofie Mespreuve, Lise Apers, Ann-Beth Moller, Anna Galle</p>\r\n\r\nThe postnatal period is one of the most critical periods in the lives of mothers and newborns. Yet, the postnatal period remains the most neglected period along the maternal health care continuum. Globally, measures assessing quality of postnatal care (PNC) often focus on care at health facility level, the provision of home-based PNC and associated quality of care measures seem largely overlooked. This scoping review aims to give an overview of the literature on measures assessing quality of PNC for mothers and newborns in a home-based setting. This review was conducted according to the Arksey and O’Malley’s methodology for scoping reviews. Three electronic bibliographic databases were searched together with a grey literature search. Two reviewers independently screened the identified articles. All data on home-based PNC measures were extracted and mapped according to the 2022 World Health Organization PNC Guideline recommendations in three categories: i) maternal care, ii) newborn care, iii) health system and health promotion interventions. Several additional quality of care domains, characterizing home-based PNC, were identified: i) social and emotional empowerment, ii) assessment of the home setting, iii) early breastfeeding, iv) health education and counseling, v) personal hygiene and prevention of infections, vi) referral to health facility when necessary, vii) thermal care, viii) parent-child relationship and ix) promote economic self-sufficiency. This review illustrates that home-based PNC has a very broad spectrum of care and plays a vital role in improving maternal and newborn health and well-being. In addition, there is a clear need for more research on the optimal timing and content of home-based care in the postnatal period for maximizing its potential.","author":"Ann-Sofie Mespreuve","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"e1c667893986c8b229db08a40e2678d7ef31c3ac4e67b5879dc8d40ea91cfa86","category":"Environment"}
