{"title":"A Normal Displacement Model and Compensation Method of Polishing Tool for Precision NC Polishing of Aspheric Surface","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2421/v1","date":1727697023000,"content":"The position accuracy of polishing tool affects the surface quality of the polished aspheric surface. The contact deformation among the polishing tool, abrasives and aspheric part can cause a displacement, in turn will cause a position error of polishing tool, this will lead to a significant change of the polishing force. In order to resolve this error, this paper proposed a method of normal displacement compensation for NC polishing system by controlling the polishing force. Firstly, the coupling principle between polishing force and position of polishing tool are expounded, the relationship between normal displacement and deformation is analyzed, based on Hertz theory, a model of normal displacement is established. Then, on the basis of decoupled polishing system developed, a normal displacement compensation method was proposed. Finally, a group of comparative experiments was carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with no displacement compensation, when the part was polished with normal displacement compensation method, the value of roughness decreases from 0.4µm to 0.21µm, and the unevenness coefficients of surface roughness decreases from 112.5% to 19%. The experimental results show that the polishing quality is improved greatly and the aspheric surfaces can be polished more uniformly with method proposed in this paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d753c074373059f1892b9db4efdd01056154f77495d24df22df60430b2d52fd7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
