{"title":"Design and Testing Acoustically Stimulated Anaerobic Digestion Coupled with Low Level Post Aeration for Agricultural Wastewater Remediation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1613/v1","date":1726829135000,"content":"The construction of an anaerobic digester coupled with post-digestion low level aeration for agricultural wastewater treatment is described. The digester employs underwater speakers to accelerate the anaerobic digestion process while retaining solids to reduce the strength of the effluent. The digester effluent is sent to a holding tank and fed at a low flow rate to an aeration tank to effect partial nitrification of the wastewater. The outlet of this tank is sent to a settling tank to retain biomass that developed in the aeration tank and the effluent is sent to a small, constructed wetland to further reduce wastewater nitrogen and phosphorus. The wetland was planted with the broadleaf cattail, Typha latifolia, and hence to a retention basin. The system has reduced energy consumption due to both the use of underwater sonic treatment and low-level aeration that is not designed to achieve full nitrification/denitrification but rather to achieve a mixture of ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate that might foster the development of a consortium of organisms (i.e. nitrifiers, Anammox bacteria) that can remediate wastewater ammonium at low cost. Biogas is sent to an inground condenser where different treatments may be tested to remove carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. The system is meant to serve as a complex where various technologies and practices can be evaluated to improve the treatment of agricultural wastewater.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8702b8218ddb9839a957f232a6c34a7f44f01817d3b9935b666939c2d9fec7d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
