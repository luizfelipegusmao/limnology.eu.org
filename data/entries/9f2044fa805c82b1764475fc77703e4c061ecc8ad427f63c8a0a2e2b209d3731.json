{"title":"Overcoming the Technological Barriers in the Blockchain Supply Chain for Small Carriers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1028/v1","date":1713257406000,"content":"The current trend in supply chain development requires the application of new knowledge to meet the challenges posed by new technologies. One such technology is blockchain, which facilitates supply chain solutions through the use of innovative data transfer, storage and verification systems. However, the use of blockchain can be challenging for certain stakeholders, such as small carriers, who may lack the necessary technical expertise or access to the technology. In this paper, we explore the potential for engaging small carriers that provide services within the blockchain supply chain but face technological barriers. We identify the barriers and opportunities for these carriers to participate, focusing on a case study of a small carrier that transports temperature-sensitive cargo. In addition, we introduce in-vehicle temperature measurement for use in cold chains and propose an ecosystem that can benefit different stakeholder groups.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f2044fa805c82b1764475fc77703e4c061ecc8ad427f63c8a0a2e2b209d3731","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
