{"title":"Bioactive foamulsion gels: a unique structure prepared with gellan gum and Acanthophyllum glandulosum extract","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13267?af=R","date":1712732400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Foamulsions have become increasingly popular in the food industry due to their ability to enhance the textural, sensory and health-promoting properties of food products. This study was therefore aimed to design and prepare a novel gelled structure, foamulsion gel containing 0–600 g L<sup>−1</sup> oil, with gellan gum (GG; 7, 10 and 13 g L<sup>−1</sup>) and saponin-rich antioxidant <i>Acanthophyllum glandulosum</i> extract (AGE; 2, 6 and 10 g L<sup>−1</sup>).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The interaction between components was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. The overrun and porosity of the foamulsion gels increased with antioxidant AGE (1.30 times) and reduced with oil (up to <i>ca</i> 70% and 30%, respectively) and GG levels. The systems were highly stable, and no water or oil was released during the physical stability experiments. Microscopic images showed that the size of air cells was significantly larger than that of oil droplets. The foamulsion gels based on 13 g L<sup>−1</sup> GG and 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> AGE had markedly higher elastic (<i>G</i>′) and viscous (<i>G</i>′′) moduli than other samples, and exhibited an elastic and solid-like behavior (<i>G</i>′ &gt; <i>G</i>′′). The highest gel firmness was found in oil-free sample, and the presence of oil resulted in a lower firmness induced by the larger size and lubrication effect of oil droplets.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>As a result, the interactions between AGE, GG and oil could lead to the creation of new aerated structures known as bioactive foamulsion gels. These gels exhibit excellent foamability, stability and viscoelasticity and may find applications in the development of novel, healthy and low-calorie aerated foods. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yeganeh Sabeghi, \nMehdi Varidi, \nMajid Nooshkam","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"8a3fba9ce42f63d1ae174e7ed8226f8fca08b57f64708ecf8a493b7f57cb8380","category":"Environment"}
