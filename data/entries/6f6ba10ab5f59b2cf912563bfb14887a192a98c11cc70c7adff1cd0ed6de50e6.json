{"title":"Importance of Topographical Recognition of Pulmonary Arteries in Diagnostics and Treatment of CTEPH, Based on Analysis of a Dissected Case Model – Pilot Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2048/v1","date":1719633744000,"content":"Background: Knowledge of the anatomy of pulmonary arteries is essential in many invasive procedures concerning pulmonary circulation. In the diagnosis and treatment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), two-dimensional (2D) pulmonary angiography is used. Recognizing the topographic course of the pulmonary arteries and understanding the status in three-dimensions (3D) is paramount. The study aimed to evaluate and describe the branching variant of pulmonary arteries in a single case, as well as morphological parameters of the segmental arteries, like length, diameter and branching angles. Methods: One pair of embalmed human cadaver lungs were dissected by scalpel, surgical forceps and measured until the subsegmental arteries. Results: The diameters (ranging from 3.04 to 9.29 mm) and lengths (ranging from 9.09 to 53.91 mm) of the pulmonary segmental arteries varied. The proximal branching angles were wide and close to perpendicular, while distally, the angles between the segmental and subsegmental arteries were narrower (30-45°). Upon evaluating the branching, rare variations were identified and delineated, notably in the lower lobes of both lungs. Conclusions: Utilizing knowledge and data in clinical settings is instrumental for effectively diagnosing and treating CTEPH. Further research is required to explore the complications in invasive procedures related to various anatomical variations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f6ba10ab5f59b2cf912563bfb14887a192a98c11cc70c7adff1cd0ed6de50e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
