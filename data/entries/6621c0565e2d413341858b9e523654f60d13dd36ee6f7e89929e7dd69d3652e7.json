{"title":"The Influence of Organisational and Management Factors on Effective Sport Service Delivery in Ethiopian Sport Governing Bodies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1352/v1","date":1724068864000,"content":"There is an observed general low performance of Ethiopian Sport Governing Bodies (SGBs) in service delivery. Evidence shows that the trend can be corrected with proper understanding and insight into the process of organisational and management factors of these SGBs. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of organisational and management factors on effective sport service delivery in SGBs. For this study, a cross-sectional research design was employed. Purposive sampling was used to choose 350 samples. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient and multiple regression were used to analyse the data at the 0.05 significant level. The findings confirmed that organisational and management factor variables had a significant positive relationship with sport service delivery (organisational structure (r=0.515), organisational capabilities (r=0.701), communication (r=0.549), management practice (r=0.571), materials &amp;amp; resources (r=0.527) and stakeholders satisfaction (r=0.742). In addition, Management factors were found to be significant contributors for predicting effective sport service delivery (F(3, 329)= 165.868, R2= 0.612). Furthermore, organisational factors had a joint significant contribution to effective sport service delivery (F(3, 329) = 148.743, R2= 0.576). In addition, organisational and management factor variables jointly best predicted effective sport service delivery in Ethiopian SGBs (F(6, 326) =130.81, R2= 0.707). Therefore, this study suggests organisational and management factor variables can be used to predict effective sport service delivery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6621c0565e2d413341858b9e523654f60d13dd36ee6f7e89929e7dd69d3652e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
