{"title":"Automated High Content Imaging and Analysis of Spheroids Using Clearing and Deep Learning for Volumetric Quantification","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.168/7719461?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Spheroids are increasingly being used as models for drug screening, as these three-dimensional systems often better capture physiologically relevant characteristics of solid tumors [<a href=\"#ozae044.168-B1\">1</a>]. The complexity of these three-dimensional cultures permits cell polarization and microenvironmental changes that cannot be modeled with two-dimensional monolayer cultures. This complexity and size confer data collection and analysis challenges especially for imaging and image analysis applications. To address these challenges, a workflow for sample preparation, imaging, and image analysis was developed, allowing for high-content, high-resolution confocal three-dimensional imaging of entire spheroids [<a href=\"#ozae044.168-B2\">2</a>]. The key to adapting spheroid imaging for use in high content applications was to implement a custom “smart” algorithm, which allows for automated, supervision-free image acquisition. The algorithm finds the spheroid in a 384-well plate at 4× magnification and defines the volume. Following object identification, the instrumentation switches to a high magnification objective to acquire a high-resolution stack. End-to-end visualization of the entire spheroid structure up to 600 µm in depth is enabled by tissue clearing (modified OptiMus [<a href=\"#ozae044.168-B3\">3</a>] solution) prior to image acquisition. The resulting image stack itself presents challenges from an image analysis perspective. The heterogeneous nature of the spheroid makes segmentation of the nuclei and cells difficult using traditional approaches based on watershed algorithms. To facilitate better segmentation of the nuclei and cells, a deep learning model (Cellpose [<a href=\"#ozae044.168-B4\">4</a>]) was retrained to recognize the nuclei in the spheroid. The trained deep learning model can differentiate the nuclei by using a model based on hand drawn annotations. This trained model is fed into an analysis pipeline to make batch analysis of the spheroid image stacks possible. Using these techniques together allows for high-content, high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging with volumetric quantification using deep learning.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1adbb72f32cd319c32aaa92e293fa22b53dfe1fc2bc675d2f728746350bf6ca6","category":"Environment"}
