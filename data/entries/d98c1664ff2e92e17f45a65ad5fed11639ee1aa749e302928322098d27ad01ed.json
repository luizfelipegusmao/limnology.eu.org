As sessile organisms, they are remarkably resilient to adverse environments, which have been exacerbated in the current context of global change. The way in which plants sense and respond to various types of abiotic stresses varies depending on the severity of the stress and the developmental stage of the plant, affecting both vegetative and reproductive aspects. Understanding how plants respond and adapt to a changing environment is crucial for predicting and mitigating the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and ensuring the future survival and reproduction of plant species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"d98c1664ff2e92e17f45a65ad5fed11639ee1aa749e302928322098d27ad01ed","category":"Environment"}
