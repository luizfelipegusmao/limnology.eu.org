{"title":"Time-varying Correlations between JSE.JO Stock Market and its Partners Using Symmetric DCC Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0233/v1","date":1719913276000,"content":"The extent of correlation or co-movement among the returns of developed and/or emerging stock markets remains pivotal for efficiently diversifying global portfolios. This correlation is prone to variation over time as a consequence of escalating economic interdependence fostered by international trade and financial markets. In this study, we analyzed the time-varying correlation and co-movement between the JSE.JO stock market of South Africa and its developed and developing stock market partners. The Dynamic Conditional Correlation - Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (DCC-EGARCH) methodology is employed with different multivariate distributions to explore the time-varying correlation and volatilities between the JSE.JO stock market and its partners. Based on the conditional correlation results, the JSE.JO stock market is integrated and co-moves with its partners, and the conditional correlation for all markets exhibit time-variant behavior. The conditional volatility results show that the JSE.JO stock market behaves differently from other markets, especially after 2015, indicating a positive sign for investors to diversify between JSE.JO and its partners. The highest value of conditional volatility for markets was in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, representing the riskiest period that investors should avoid due to the lack of diversification opportunities during crises.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38d4a03065064eb10b6db62646f51d53ad1982b0fc88d5d5c9c360299f310b57","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
