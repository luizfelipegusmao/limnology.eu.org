{"title":"Design and Performance Evaluation of Oil Palm Fresh Fruit Bunch Transporter with Scissor Lift Mechanism","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0379/v1","date":1720095678000,"content":"The existing methods of oil palm Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) evacuation from in-field to temporary collection point which typically apply medium to large tractors, often result in unexpected soil compaction. Meanwhile, smaller size equipment indicates low working capacity and unable to perform direct unloading to collection bin. This paper addresses the challenge of FFB evacuation by focusing on preventing soil compaction, increasing working capacity and enabling direct unloading to collection bin. For this purpose, a 6x6WD transporter prototype with a scissor lift mechanism was developed. With the design, the transporter could evacuate FFB in both steep mineral terrain and low ground pressure peatland, able to carry FFB with capacity of 750 kg and provide direct unloading into collection bin. The average field working capacity of the transporter was found to be 15 tons day-1. This research offers insights for future designs of medium-sized FFB transporters with advanced unloading mechanisms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d980d084509086e52e121147eed3480e65902bf7fad396a8e0539f9d72588e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
