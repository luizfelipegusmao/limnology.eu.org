Kamya</p>\r\n\r\nMalaria continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Appropriate combinations of non-chemical and chemical methods of malaria vector control in the context of integrated vector management have been recommended by the World Health Organization. The aim of the study was to explore facilitators and barriers to using integrated malaria prevention in Wakiso district, Uganda. This qualitative study employed photovoice among 20 community members in Kasanje Town Council, Wakiso District. The photos taken by participants for 5 months using smartphones were discussed during monthly meetings with the researchers. The discussions were audio-recorded, and resulting data analysed using thematic analysis with the support of NVivo (2020) QSR International. Findings indicated that various conventional and non-conventional measures were being used for preventing malaria such as: insecticide treated nets; clearing overgrown vegetation; draining stagnant water; mosquito coils; smouldering of cow dung; spraying insecticides; plant repellents near houses; eating of prophylactic herbs; as well as closing doors and windows on houses early in the evening. Facilitators supporting the use of several malaria prevention methods holistically included: low cost and accessibility of some methods such as slashing overgrown vegetation; and support provided for certain methods such as receiving free mosquito nets from the government. Barriers to using several malaria prevention methods holistically included: inadequate knowledge of some methods such as housing improvement; allergic reactions to chemical-based methods such as insecticide treated nets; unaffordability of some methods such as insecticide sprays; and inaccessibility of certain methods such as body repellents. These barriers to integrated malaria prevention need to be addressed to achieve greater impact from the combination of methods in endemic communities.","author":"David Musoke","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"e4f33e226f42ffc467a42e4666f0a2bbfef4d156f4b8f3013734835038cc3da0","category":"Environment"}
