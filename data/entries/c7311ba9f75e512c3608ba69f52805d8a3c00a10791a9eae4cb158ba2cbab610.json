{"title":"Quality-aware Signal Processing Mechanism for Long-term Heart Rate Monitoring","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1179/v1","date":1713357800000,"content":"Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely utilized in wearable healthcare devices due to its convenient measurement capabilities. However, the unrestricted behavior of users often introduces artifacts into the PPG signal. As a result, signal processing and quality assessment play a crucial role in ensuring that the information contained in the signal can be effectively acquired and analyzed. Traditionally, researchers have discussed signal quality and processing algorithms separately, with individual algorithms developed to address specific artifacts. In this paper, we propose a quality-aware signal processing mechanism that evaluates incoming PPG signals using signal quality index (SQI) and selects the appropriate processing method based on the SQI. Unlike conventional processing approaches, our proposed mechanism recommends processing algorithms based on the quality of each signal, offering an alternative option for designing signal processing flows. Furthermore, our mechanism achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption, which are the key considerations in long-term heart rate monitoring.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c7311ba9f75e512c3608ba69f52805d8a3c00a10791a9eae4cb158ba2cbab610","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
