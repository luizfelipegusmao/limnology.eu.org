{"title":"The efficacy of 1-allyloxy-4-propoxybenzene (3c{3,6}) against Varroa destructor mites in honey bee colonies from Maryland, USA","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/iead111/7683867?rss=1","date":1716854400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Varroa destructor</span> Oud (Acari: Varroidae) is a harmful ectoparasite of <span>Apis mellifera</span> L. honey bees causing widespread colony losses in Europe and North America. To control populations of these mites, beekeepers have an arsenal of different treatments, including both chemical and nonchemical options. However, nonchemical treatments can be labor intensive, and <span>Varroa</span> has gained resistance to some conventional pesticides, and the use of other chemical treatments is restricted temporally (e.g., cannot be applied during periods of honey production). Thus, beekeepers require additional treatment options for controlling mite populations. The compound 1-allyloxy-4-propoxybenzene (<strong>3c</strong>{<span>3,6</span>}) is a diether previously shown to be a strong feeding deterrent against Lepidopteran larvae and a repellent against mosquitoes and showed promise as a novel acaricide from laboratory and early field trials. Here we test the effect of the compound, applied at 8 g/brood box on wooden release devices, on honey bees and <span>Varroa</span> in field honey bee colonies located in Maryland, USA, and using a thymol-based commercial product as a positive control. <strong>3c</strong>{<span>3,6</span>} had minimal effect on honey bee colonies, but more tests are needed to determine whether it affected egg production by queens. Against <span>Varroa</span><strong>3c</strong>{<span>3,6</span>} had an estimated efficacy of 78.5%, while the positive control thymol product showed an efficacy of 91.3%. <strong>3c</strong>{<span>3,6</span>} is still in the development stage, and the dose or application method needs to be revisited.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"9a9da308ac7377ba2a407de9a9537774bdc85efe4c2d4db9b9010eb0a272a1ad","category":"Environment"}
