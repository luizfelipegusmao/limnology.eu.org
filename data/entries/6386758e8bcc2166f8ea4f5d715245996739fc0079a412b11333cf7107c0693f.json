The role of human immune status on the transmission dynamics of cryptosporidiosis in humans and cattle is investigated. A deterministic model is used to study the transmission dynamics of cryptosporidiosis, incorporating populations of cattle, immunocompetent humans, and immunocompromised humans. Mathematical analysis is carried out to establish existence of equilibria as well as the threshold dynamics. Sensitivity analysis reveals that cattle significantly influence the dynamics of the disease. Simulation results show that the persistence of cryptosporidiosis is influenced by an increase in the transmission rates of the disease and the shedding rates of <em>Cryptosporidium</em> oocysts into the environment by infectious cattle and humans. An increase in the rate at which susceptible immunocompetent humans lose immunity to become susceptible immunocompromised is associated with increased infectious immunocompromised humans. It is crucial to safeguard immunity loss, and prevention and control of cryptosporidiosis may focus on eradicating the <em>Cryptosporidium</em> oocysts in the environment and preventing the direct spread of the disease among individuals.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"6386758e8bcc2166f8ea4f5d715245996739fc0079a412b11333cf7107c0693f","category":"Environment"}
