In this study, a novel ultrasound technology of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> was used with the aim of improving fermentation efficiency and volatile flavor quality of RW.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that fixed-frequency ultrasonic treatment (28 kHz, 45 W L<sup>−1</sup>, 20 min) of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> seed culture at its logarithmic metaphase significantly increased the biomass and alcohol yield by 31.58% and 26.45%, respectively, and reduced fermentation time by nearly 2 days. Flavor analysis indicated that the flavor compounds in RW, specifically the esters and alcohols, were also increased in quantity after the ultrasonic treatment of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> seed liquid. Isobutyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl hexanoate and phenethyl acetate contents were increased by 78.92%, 129.19%, 7.79% and 97.84%, respectively, as compared to the control.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Ultrasonic treatment of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> reduced fermentation time and enhanced the flavor profile of RW. This study could provide a theoretical and/or technological basis for the research and development of RW. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jing Hao, \nHaining Xu, \nPengfei Yan, \nMengyuan Yang, \nBenjamin Kumah Mintah, \nChunhua Dai, \nRong Zhang, \nHaile Ma, \nRonghai He","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"2d849ecf24521a58484c2179a18a745835b3631bf4470dc87ac05383a4acebdc","category":"Environment"}
