We are the first to study the issue of practical implementation of MTR protocols in current-generation real-life instruments. We propose an empirical quantitative model for calculating acquisition and reconstruction times. It is demonstrated that projection acquisition order has a significant impact on the time and dose of tomographic experiments. The new alternative acquisition most suitable for MTR protocols is proposed. To estimate the restrictions and scope of applicability for MTR four typical commercial setups are studied within a proposed model. We construct an experimental stand for achieving a real-time reconstruction, together with validation of the proposed acquisition time model. We demonstrate that real-time reconstruction may be implemented without slowing down an acquisition process. An optimization of reconstruction from partial data is proposed, which allowed the production of 385 and 440 reconstructions for standard and proposed acquisition orders correspondingly during a single acquisition of 512 projections. The results of the study demonstrate that with proposed optimizations MTR can be effectively utilized for practical applications using the current generation of existing setups in industrial and nano tomography fields.","author":"Marat Gilmanov","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d9f3ab77c90b99790d743b968c1e9f075fff1450aa0fe1fd2c93d5eeb240b474","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
