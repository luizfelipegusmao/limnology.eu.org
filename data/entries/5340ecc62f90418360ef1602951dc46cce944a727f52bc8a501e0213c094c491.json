However, anthropogenic uranium can also leach into groundwater sources due to mining, ore refining, and improper nuclear waste management. Over the last few decades, various methods for measuring uranium have emerged; however, most of these techniques require skilled scientists to run samples on expensive instrumentation for detection or require the pretreatment of samples in complex procedures. In this work, a Schiff base ligand (P1) is used to develop a simple spectrophotometric method for measuring the concentration of uranium (VI) with an accurate and affordable light-emitting diode (LED) spectrophotometer. A test for a higher-order polynomial relationship was used to objectively determine the calibration data’s linearity. This test was done with a Python program on a Raspberry Pi computer that captured the spectrophotometer’s calibration and sample measurement data.","author":"Amrutaa Vibho","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5340ecc62f90418360ef1602951dc46cce944a727f52bc8a501e0213c094c491","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
