{"title":"Anti-collision Path Planning and Tracking of Autonomous Vehicle Based on Optimized Artificial Potential Field and Discrete LQR Algorithm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1007/v1","date":1720781368000,"content":"Aiming at the APF algorithm in the collision-free path planning and LQR algorithm tracking process, there are problems such as unreachable target points, local optimization, low safety coefficient of autonomous lane change collision avoidance tracking control and poor stability, this paper proposes an optimized APF method, which solves the defects of the traditional artificial potential field method by adding the distance adjustment factor, the safety distance protection model and the sub-target virtual potential field, and at the same time generates the autonomous driving car collision-free path. The path tracking control system is designed based on feed-forward control and DLQR controller, in which the vehicle dynamics state space model is used as the basis, the model is linearized and discretized, and the corresponding constraint variables are set to minimize the control command objective cost function under the constraints, and the objective of the DLQR controller.The objective is to accurately determine the steering angle in order to achieve path tracking and eliminate the lateral error between the reference path and the actual path caused by external interference.Finally, the simulink model and CarSim parameter configuration joint simulation platform are built, and different obstacle scenarios and different speeds are selected for collision-free path planning and tracking motion simulation research and analysis, which verifies the accuracy and practicability of the algorithm, and shows more obvious advantages in obstacle avoidance ability, path smoothing degree, and collision avoidance safety stability. The ideas proposed in this paper are expected to be further extended and popularized to actual path planning problems, which has important practical significance and engineering value.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4aa8723a0c2cb1753a7974fb09a15ae73fd4285086ccdf9190420d42a459a311","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
