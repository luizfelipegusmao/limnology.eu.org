This study was conducted in 16 mid-field ponds. Compositional and biodiversity indexes and ordination methods were used to analyze the relationship between zooplankton assemblages in unstable fishless and stable fish ponds. A total of 121 zooplankton taxa were identified. Compositional indicators revealed significant differences in zooplankton assemblages between fish ponds (FPs) and fishless ponds (FLPs). Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that variation in zooplankton assemblages depended on the pondsâ€™ features. Most of the high trophic state indicator species were present only in FPs or occurred sporadically in FLPs. Rarefaction and extrapolation indicated a higher number of zooplankton taxa in FPs than in FLPs. The stability of the ecosystem was essential for maintaining the high species richness of zooplankton. Diversity indices were not influenced by variations in species composition or environmental differences among ponds. Diversified pond types are necessary to maintain the heterogeneity of mid-field ponds, which support the high regional biodiversity of zooplankton assemblages.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"74f6cbf68bedbc791439af2bf2b5afeb408818c39937800fa4451461872e5491","category":"Environment"}
