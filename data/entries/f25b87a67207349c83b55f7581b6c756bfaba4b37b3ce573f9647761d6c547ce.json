{"title":"Behavioral Evidence of Emotional Influence on Time Perception","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0984/v1","date":1713181127000,"content":"Research has shown that emotional states may influence the subjective experience of time. The present study involved 111 healthy adult participants and examined the impact of emotional stimuli on time perception, using a time estimation task with four conditions: in one of the conditions, participants estimated the exposure time of a black screen, wherein the duration could vary be-tween 2 to 7 s (condition without emotional interference); in the other conditions, participants es-timated the exposure time (also ranging from 2 to 7 s) of images that would induce pleasant, un-pleasant, or neutral emotions, to which participants were instructed to focus their attention (pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral emotions). The results showed that participants estimated “shorter” time intervals (underestimation) for pleasant and unpleasant images compared to the condition without interference, but no significant differences were found between the neutral condition and the condition without interference. It is suggested that increased attention to an ex-ternal stimuli, regardless of its emotional valence, produces an underestimated perception of time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f25b87a67207349c83b55f7581b6c756bfaba4b37b3ce573f9647761d6c547ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
