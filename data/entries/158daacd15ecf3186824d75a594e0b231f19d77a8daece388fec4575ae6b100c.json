{"title":"Social work practice in UAE schools during and after Covid-19 pandemic: A qualitative study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1019/v1","date":1718356178000,"content":"Apart from their obvious educational mission, public schools provide health, psychological, emotional, and social development grounding for students. Thus, the educational system is special in that it combines multiple integrated responsibilities and duties beyond the scope of any other social welfare program. As such, social workers are a very important constituent of this system, and they ostensibly serve to attend to the wellbeing of students while ensuring educational system performance. In light of this extremely steep set of demands, this work assesses and compares social workersâ€™ authentic roles in UAE schools during and after the COVID-19 pandemic so that we may contribute to the improvement of educational systems worldwide. The results are nuanced and will better illuminate the important capabilities of social workers in the continually changing educational system, as well as the challenges they face and ameliorate during emergency scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"158daacd15ecf3186824d75a594e0b231f19d77a8daece388fec4575ae6b100c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
