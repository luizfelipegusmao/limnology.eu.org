{"title":"Physiological Impacts of Energy Drink Consumption: A Clinical Analysis in Adolescents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1479/v1","date":1718947573000,"content":"Energy drink (ED) consumption among Israeli-Arab adolescents is widespread. This study aimed to investigate the acute glycemic and insulin effects of EDs in healthy adolescents. Seventy-one Israeli-Arab adolescents (56% girls, average age 16.04Â±1.03 years) participated in a non-randomized, case-controlled, open-label study. Participants consumed ED (n=36) or a volume- and carbohydrate-matched non-caffeinated soft drink (SD, n=35), followed by a 2 h glucose tolerance test. Blood glucose was measured at baseline and 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes post-consumption (T0, T15, T30, T60 and T120, respectively). Serum insulin concentration and caffeine relative intensity were determined 45 minutes post-consumption (T45). Blood glucose levels peaked significantly at T15 and remained significantly higher at T30 in the ED group compared to the SD group (p=0.005, p=0.017, respectively). Insulin concentrations were substantially higher at T45 in the ED group (t[64]=2.794, p=0.001). This pattern was especially prominent in heavy ED consumers. A positive correlation emerged between the amount of caffeine consumed (mg/kg), blood glucose levels at T15 and T30, and insulin concentration at T45. This study is the first to demonstrate the glycemic and insulin responses to ED consumption in adolescents, suggesting that regulatory measures limiting ED sales to adolescents could improve their health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d05e22fed813b68dfd413311224d7a79122e45ef2451f885f702aaffe6c4806","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
