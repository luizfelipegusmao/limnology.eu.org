{"title":"Invasive macroalgae in native seagrass beds: vectors of spread and impacts","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/133/1/41/7288096?rss=1","date":1696291200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>Worldwide, invasive species are spreading through marine systems at an unprecedented rate with both positive and negative consequences for ecosystems and the biological functioning of organisms. Human activities from shipping to habitat damage and modification are known vectors of spread, although biological interactions including epibiosis are increasingly recognized as potentially important to introduction into susceptible habitats.<div>Methods</div>We assessed a novel mechanism of spread – limpets as transporters of an invasive alga, <span>Sargassum muticum</span>, into beds of the seagrass <span>Zostera marina</span> – and the physiological impact of its invasion. The association of <span>S. muticum</span> with three limpet species and other habitats was assessed using intertidal surveys on rocky shores and snorkelling at two seagrass sites in the UK. A 4-year field study tested the effect of <span>S. muticum</span> on <span>Z. marina</span> shoot density, dry weight and phenolic compounds (caffeic and tannic acid) content, and a laboratory experiment tested the impact of <span>S. muticum</span> on nutrient partitioning (C/H/N/P/Si), photosynthetic efficiency (<span>F</span><sub>v</sub>/<span>F</span><sub>m</sub>) and growth of <span>Z. marina</span>.<div>Results</div>On rocky shores 15 % of <span>S</span>. <span>muticum</span> occurrences were attached to the shells of live limpets. In seagrass beds 5 % of <span>S. muticum</span> occurrences were attached to the shells of dead limpets. The remainder were attached to rock, to cobblestones, to the seagrass matrix or embedded within the sand. <span>Z. marina</span> density and phenolics content was lower when <span>S. muticum</span> co-occurred with it. Over 3 years, photosynthetic responses of <span>Z. marina</span> to <span>S. muticum</span> were idiosyncratic, and <span>S. muticum</span> had no effect on nutrient partitioning in <span>Z. marina</span>.<div>Conclusions</div>Our results show limpets support <span>S. muticum</span> as an epibiont and may act as a previously unreported transport mechanism introducing invaders into sensitive habitats. <span>S. muticum</span> reduced production of phenolics in <span>Z. marina</span>, which may weaken its defensive capabilities and facilitate proliferation of <span>S. muticum</span>. The effect of <span>S. muticum</span> on <span>Z. marina</span> photosynthesis requires further work but having no effect on the capacity of <span>Z. marina</span> to sequester nutrients suggests a degree of resilience to this invader.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"850d5b3171800d7a8ef1307e56fa68b47cb61c6971af05c5557230c7f5c12aa2","category":"Environment"}
