{"title":"From many voices, one question: Community co-design of a population-based qualitative cancer research study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309361","date":1724680800000,"content":"<p>by Susannah K.

Goodwin</p>\r\nPurpose <p>This study formed the development stage of a population-based survey aiming to: (i) understand the needs and experiences of people affected by cancer in Queensland, Australia and (ii) recruit a pool of participants for ongoing cancer survivorship research. The current study aimed to co-design and test a single qualitative survey question and study invitation materials to maximise acceptability of, and participation in, the survey and future research.</p> Methods <p>Fifty-two community members, including cancer survivors and caregivers, participated across 15 co-design workshops and 20 pretest interviews. During workshops, participants generated and refined ideas for an open-ended survey question and provided feedback on a study invitation letter. The use of a single, open-ended question aims to minimise participant burden while collecting rich information about needs and experiences. The research team then shortlisted the question ideas and revised study invitation materials based on workshop feedback. Next, using interviews, community members were asked to respond to a shortlisted question to test its interpretability and relevance and to review revised invitation materials. Content analysis of participant feedback was used to identify principles for designing study materials.</p> Results <p>Principles for designing qualitative survey questions were identified from participant feedback, including <i>define the question timeframe and scope; provide reassurance that responses are valid and valued;</i> and <i>use simple wording</i>. Principles for designing study invitation materials were also identified, including <i>communicate empathy and sensitivity; facilitate reciprocal benefit;</i> and <i>include a ‘human element’</i>. The qualitative survey question and study invitation materials created using these principles were considered relevant and acceptable for use in a population-based survey.</p> Conclusions <p>Through community consultation and co-design, this study identified principles for designing qualitative data collection and invitation materials for use in cancer survivorship research. These principles can be applied by other researchers to develop study materials that are sensitive to the needs and preferences of community members.</p>","author":"Susannah K.
