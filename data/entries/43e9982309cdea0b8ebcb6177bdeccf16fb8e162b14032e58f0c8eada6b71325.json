{"title":"Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition in an HHT-like pediatric case of Multiple Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1781/v1","date":1714196368000,"content":"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are vascular anomalies resulting in abnormal connection between pulmonary arteries and veins. In 80% of cases, PAVMs are present from birth, but clinical manifestations are rarely seen in childhood. These congenital malformations are typically associated with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), a rare disease that affects 1 in 5,000/8,000 individuals. HHT disease is frequently caused by mutations in genes involved in the TGF-β pathway. However, approximately 15% of patients do not have a genetic diagnosis and, among the genetically diagnosed, more than 33% do not meet the Curaçao Criteria. This makes clinical diagnosis even more challenging in the pediatric age group. Here, we introduce an 8 years old patient bearing a severe phenotype of multiple diffuse PAVMs caused by an unknown mutation which ended in lung transplantation. Phenotypically, the case of study follows a molecular pattern HHT-like. Therefore, molecular biology and cellular functional analysis has been performed in primary endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from the explanted lung. The findings revealed a loss of functionality in lung endothelial tissue and a stimulation of endothelial to mesenchymal transition. Understanding the molecular basis of this transition could potentially offer new therapeutic strategies to delay lung transplantation in severe cases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43e9982309cdea0b8ebcb6177bdeccf16fb8e162b14032e58f0c8eada6b71325","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
