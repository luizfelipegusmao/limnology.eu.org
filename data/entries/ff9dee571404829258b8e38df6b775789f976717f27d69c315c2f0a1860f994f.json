To investigate the acute effects of systemic inflammation on ACC network oscillation and cognitive function, we analyzed cytokine level and cognitive performance as well as network oscillation in the mouse ACC Cg1 region, within 4 hours after lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 30 μg/kg) administration. While the interleukin-6 concentration in the serum was evidently higher in LPS-treated mice, the increases in the cerebral cortex interleukin-6 did not reach statistical significance. The power of kainic acid (KA)-induced network oscillation in the ACC Cg1 region slice preparation increased in LPS-treated mice. Notably, histamine, which was added <i>in vitro</i>, increased the oscillation power in the brain slices from LPS-untreated mice; for the LPS-treated mice, however, the effect of histamine was suppressive. In the open field test, frequency of entries into the center area showed a negative correlation with the power of network oscillation (0.3 μM of KA, theta band (3–8 Hz); 3.0 μM of KA, high-gamma band (50–80 Hz)). These results suggest that LPS-induced systemic inflammation results in increased network oscillation and a drastic change in histamine sensitivity in the ACC, accompanied by the robust production of systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines in the periphery, and that these alterations in the network oscillation and animal behavior as an acute phase reaction relate with each other. We suggest that our experimental setting has a distinct advantage in obtaining mechanistic insights into inflammatory cognitive impairment through comprehensive analyses of hormonal molecules and neuronal functions.","author":"Ayumi Hirao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ff9dee571404829258b8e38df6b775789f976717f27d69c315c2f0a1860f994f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
