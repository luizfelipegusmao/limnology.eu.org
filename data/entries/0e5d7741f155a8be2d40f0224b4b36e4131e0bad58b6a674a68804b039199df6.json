{"title":"Effect of Sourdough-Yeast Co-Fermentation on Physicochemical Properties of Corn Fagao Batter","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0911/v1","date":1723547291000,"content":"Fagao is one of China's traditional gluten free staple foods made by rice or corn flour. Corn Fagao prepared by co-fermentation with sourdough and yeast exhibits better quality and less staling compared to traditional yeast-fermented Fagao. The physicochemical properties of corn Fagao batter during the sourdough-yeast co-fermentation were investigated. The results showed that compared with yeast fermentation, the gas production and viscosity of the batter increased by co-fermentation. The co-fermented batter shows higher hydrolysis of starch and less amylose content. The integrity of starch granules in co-fermented batter was damaged more seriously, the crystallinity and short-range ordered structure were less than yeast fermented batter, even though the crystal structure type of starch did not change obviously. The peak viscosity, minimum viscosity, final viscosity, decay value and recovery value of corn batter are reduced by co-fermentation, which can improve the thermal stability of the batter and slow down the aging. Co-fermentation also results in a more pronounced reduction in protein subunit contents than yeast fermentation. The changes in the physicochemical properties of corn Fagao batter help explain the quality improvement of corn Fagao made from co-fermentation method, and may provide theoretical references for co-fermentation with sourdough and yeast to other gluten free foods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0e5d7741f155a8be2d40f0224b4b36e4131e0bad58b6a674a68804b039199df6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
