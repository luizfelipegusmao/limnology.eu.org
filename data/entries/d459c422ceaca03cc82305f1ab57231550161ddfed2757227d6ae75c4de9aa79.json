{"title":"Ameliorative effects of zinc and vitamin E against phthalates‐induced reproductive toxicity in male rats","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24191?af=R","date":1709632511000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Objective</h2>\n<p>Phthalates (PEs) could cause reproductive harm to males. A mixture of three widely used PEs (MPEs) was used to investigate the ameliorative effects of zinc (Zn) and vitamin E (VE) against male reproductive toxicity.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>Fifty male SD rats were randomly divided into five groups (<i>n</i> = 10). Rats in MPEs group were orally treated with 160 mg/kg/d MPEs, while rats in MPEs combined Zn and/or VE groups were treated with 160 mg/kg/d MPEs plus 25 mg/kg/d Zn and/or 25 mg/kg/d VE. After intervention for 70 days, it's was measured of male reproductive organs' weight, histopathological observation of sperms and testes, serum hormones, PIWI proteins and steroidogenic proteins.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Compared with control, anogenital distance, testes weight, epididymides weight, and sex hormones were significantly decreased, while the sperm malformation rate was markedly increased in MPEs group (<i>p</i> &lt; .05); the testicular tissues were injured in MPEs group with disordered and decreased spermatids, and arrested spermatogenesis. PIWIL1, PIWIL2, StAR, CYP11A1 and CYP19A1 were down-regulated in MPEs group (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). However, the alterations of these parameters were restored in MPEs combined Zn and/or VE groups (<i>p</i> &lt; .05).</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Zn and/or VE improved steroid hormone metabolism, and inhibited MPEs' male reproductive toxicity.</p>","author":"Ling‐Zi Xia, \nLi‐Lan Liu, \nJun‐Zhe Yue, \nZhen‐Yu Lu, \nRu‐Ya Deng, \nXi He, \nCan‐Can Li, \nBurong Hu, \nHai‐Tao Gao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"d459c422ceaca03cc82305f1ab57231550161ddfed2757227d6ae75c4de9aa79","category":"Environment"}
