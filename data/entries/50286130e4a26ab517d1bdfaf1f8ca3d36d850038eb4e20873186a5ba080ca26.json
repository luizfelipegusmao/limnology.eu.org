{"title":"Neuronal Mechanisms of Reading Informational Texts in People with Different Levels of Mental Resilience","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0820/v1","date":1720580897000,"content":"Resilience is an important determinant of the quality of life in adults, among others in the sphere of cognitive activities. Developments in brain imaging technology make it possible to acquire a more accurate understanding of the neuronal mechanisms of these correlations. The aim of this study was to verify whether the level of mental resilience would differentiate reading comprehension performance when using different information carriers. More than 150 adults were surveyed with the use of two questionnaires (original and standardised) and near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The results obtained did not show differences in correct responses between the groups of individuals with different levels of resilience, however, the results in the group of subjects with moderate levels were differentiated by the type of carrier. Further analysis showed that the results referred to above resulted from different neuronal mechanisms. The differences affected many areas of the brain and also depended on the type of information carrier (medium). They affected, among others, attentional areas as well as areas directly involved in the reading process. This may result in increased energy consumption during the examined activities, which can result in greater fatigue, accelerated job burnout and progressive concentration difficulties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50286130e4a26ab517d1bdfaf1f8ca3d36d850038eb4e20873186a5ba080ca26","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
