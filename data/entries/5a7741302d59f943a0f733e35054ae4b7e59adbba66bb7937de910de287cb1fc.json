{"title":"Intermittent Fasting: Myths, Fakes and Truth on this Dietary Regimen Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1820/v1","date":1716883725000,"content":"Intermittent fasting (IF) has been indicated as a valuable alternative to the classical caloric restriction dietary regimen for lowering body weight and preventing obesity-related complications such as metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes. However, is it effective? In this review article, we analyzed over 50 clinical studies in which IF, conducted by alternate day fasting (ADF) or time-restricted feeding (TRF), was compared with the caloric restriction approach. We evaluated the different roles of IF in treating and preventing human disorders such as metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes, and some types of cancer, as well as the usefulness of IF in reducing body weight and cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension. Furthermore, we explored the cellular pathway targeted by IF to exert their beneficial effects by activating effector proteins that modulate cell functions and resistance to oxidative stress. In contrast, we investigated the concerns for human health related to the adoption of IF dietary regimen, highlighting the profound debate on weight loss regimens. We have examined and compared several clinical trials to formulate an updated conception regarding IF and its therapeutic potential.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a7741302d59f943a0f733e35054ae4b7e59adbba66bb7937de910de287cb1fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
