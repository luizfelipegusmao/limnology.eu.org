Because the sexes often differ in their resource acquisition and allocation strategies, variations in adult body mass and their consequences on fitness can differ between the sexes.\n\nAssessing the relative contributions of environmental and genetic effects (i.e. heritability)—and whether these effects and their fitness consequences are sex-specific—is essential to gain insights into the evolution of sexual dimorphism and sexual conflicts.\n\nWe used 20+ years of data to study the sources of variation in adult body mass and associated fitness consequences in a bird with biparental care, the Alpine swift (<i>Tachymarptis melba</i>). Swifts appear monomorphic to human observers, though subtle dimorphisms are present.\n\nWe first investigated the effects of weather conditions on adult body mass using a sliding window analysis approach. We report a positive effect of temperature and a negative effect of rainfall on adult body mass, as expected for an aerial insectivorous bird. We then quantified the additive genetic variance and heritability of body mass in both sexes and assessed the importance of genetic constraints on mass evolution by estimating the cross-sex genetic correlation. Heritability was different from zero in both sexes at ~0.30. The positive cross-sex genetic correlation and comparable additive genetic variance between the sexes suggest the possibility for evolutionary constraints when it comes to body mass. Finally, we assessed the sex-specific selection on adjusted body mass using multiple fitness components. We report directional positive and negative selection trending towards stabilizing and diversifying selection on females and males respectively in relation to the weighted proportion of surviving fledglings.\n\nOverall, these results suggest that while body mass may be able to respond to environmental conditions and evolve, genetic constraints would result in similar changes in both sexes or an overall absence of response to selection. It remains unclear whether the weak (1%) dimorphism in Alpine swift body mass we report is simply a result of the similar fitness peaks between the sexes or of genetic constraints.\n</p>","author":"Michela N.
