{"title":"Composite Coating of Oleaster Gum Containing Cuminal Keeps Postharvest Quality of Cherry Tomatoes by Reducing Respiration and Potentiating Antioxidant System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1756/v1","date":1714143310000,"content":"Exploring for green and affordable protection of perishable fruit like cherry tomato is of significance. Here the protective efficacy and its underpinnings of coating with oleaster gum, alone or incorporated with cuminal, on cherry tomatoes stored at ambient temperature were investigated. The composite coating of oleaster gum with 0.1% cuminal reduced decay, respiration rate, weight loss, and softening of the fruit and decelerated their decreases of total soluble solids, titratable acidity, and soluble proteins, and therefore maintained their marketability. Furthermore, it reduced the accumulation of O•− 2and H2O2 in fruit, and mitigated cell membrane lipid oxidation and permeabilization, thereby retarding their senescence. Instrumentally, it elevated the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase and the levels of ascorbic acid and glutathione. This potentiation of the fruit antioxidant system makes the composite coating a promising approach to keeping the postharvest quality of perishable fruit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"98ca5d875b203148f168ed8191e0eff79a0cf7ad3795cf775c80af22c37b180c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
