{"title":"Significant contribution of amino acids to antioxidant capacity of Japanese rice wine (sake)","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13821?af=R","date":1724315080000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Various antioxidant components have been reported in Japanese rice wine (<i>sake</i>), while the contribution ratio of each component to the antioxidant capacity of whole <i>sake</i> has not been well understood. In this study, we evaluated the radical absorption capacity (H-ORAC and/or DPPH radical scavenging ability) and antioxidant components of commercially available <i>sake</i>, and estimated the major components contributing to antioxidant capacity.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Water-soluble components with a molecular weight of less than 3000 contributed more than 90% to H-ORAC of <i>sake</i> by measuring the ultrafiltered fraction. The Maillard reaction seemed to have little influence on H-ORAC by browning experiments. The radical absorption capacity of <i>sake</i> showed a strong positive correlation with the amounts of four antioxidant amino acids (Cys, Met, Tyr, Trp) and two phenolic acids (ferulic acid and <i>p</i>-coumaric acid). Evaluating H-ORAC of a <i>sake</i> model solution composed of these antioxidants revealed that the four amino acids showed a clearly higher contribution (25.7–58.2%) than the phenolic acids. In addition, there was a slight synergistic effect when the four amino acids were mixed, whereas such effects were not seen when mixed with the phenolic acids and other <i>sake</i> major components (organic acids, glucose and ethanol).</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We concluded that the contribution of free amino acids to the radical absorption capacity is quite important in <i>sake</i>. These findings will provide a new perspective for antioxidant researches of <i>sake</i> and many fermented foods. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Atsushi Tsuji, \nTakashi Koyanagi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"440479ab04479ea67e1b93f781fb3c0bb6028297b99f5f4be3ddde2e176e1536","category":"Environment"}
