{"title":"Research on the Application of Tbm Advanced Geological Prediction Based on Ellipsoidal Positioning Velocity Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2260/v1","date":1725022550000,"content":"Traditional seismic wave-based tunnel advanced geological forecasting techniques are primarily designed for drill and blast method construction tunnels. However, given the fast excavation speed and limited prediction space in Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) construction tunnels, traditional methods have significant technical limitations. This paper analyzes the characteristics of different types of TBM construction tunnels and, considering the practical construction conditions, identifies an effective observation system and data acquisition method. Utilizing numerical simulation, a model for advanced detection of typical unfavorable geological formations is established by obtaining the wave field response characteristics of seismic waves in three-dimensional space. The seismic wave reflection method can effectively receive information from unfavorable geological formations in front of the tunnel face. To address the challenges in advanced forecasting for TBM construction tunnels, a method of ellipsoid positioning velocity analysis, which takes into account the constraints of three-component data directions, is proposed. Based on the characteristics of the advanced forecasting observation system, the method compares the maximum values on the spatial isochronous ellipsoidal surface to determine the average velocity of the geological layer rays, thereby enabling accurate inversion of the spatial distribution ahead. Field verification of advanced geological forecasting based on ellipsoid positioning velocity analysis for TBM tunnels is conducted. The results indicate that this method can be used to obtain the three-dimensional velocity of the predicted unfavorable geological formations in front of the tunnel and is effective for the application of geological forecasting in TBM construction tunnels, thus providing crucial references and assurances for construction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7526a9ff616dde3593f626b81711f20fc162e12cb440738d7e3c8fa016e3064f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
