{"title":"Narratives of Sustainable Transformation: The Power of Speculative Fiction in Innovationology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0204/v1","date":1727874854000,"content":"As humanity confronts the existential threats of climate change, biodiversity loss, and growing socioeconomic inequalities, the need for transformative, systemic change has never been more urgent. Conventional innovation approaches, often focused on technological solutionism and market imperatives, have consistently fallen short in delivering the comprehensive, equitable, and sustainable solutions required to navigate these interconnected crises. This pioneering article explores the profound intersection between speculative fiction, sustainable innovation, and the burgeoning field of innovationology. By harnessing the transformative power of imaginative narratives, the integrated praxis of innovationology and sustainability science can challenge existing mental models, spark collective imagination, and foster agency to co-create sustainable futures. Through a rigorous examination of cutting-edge research, empirical evidence, and case studies, this article positions speculative fiction as a critical lever for catalyzing the systemic changes required for a more just, regenerative, and resilient future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dff8f502f95a86a3bccb8d2e6345616e0a77cb99add7aaeef4fb3523f18a645d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
