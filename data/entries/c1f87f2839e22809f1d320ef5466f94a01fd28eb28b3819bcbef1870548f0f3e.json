{"title":"The Role of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Muscle Growth and Recovery: Implications for Aging and Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2418/v1","date":1722318018000,"content":"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a critical yet underappreciated role in muscle health, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Through a review of current literature, we analyze the effects of these nutrients on muscle protein synthesis, mass, strength, and recovery. Studies demonstrate that omega-3 PUFAs enhance muscle protein synthesis via the mTOR pathway and possess anti-inflammatory properties that may reduce muscle damage and atrophy, particularly in older adults. Their potential to improve muscle function and mitigate exercise-induced damage is also reviewed, highlighting relevance for athletes and active individuals. Further research on optimal dosages and long-term effects of omega-3 supplementation is needed, providing a basis for future studies and practical recommendations for leveraging these nutrients to support muscle health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c1f87f2839e22809f1d320ef5466f94a01fd28eb28b3819bcbef1870548f0f3e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
