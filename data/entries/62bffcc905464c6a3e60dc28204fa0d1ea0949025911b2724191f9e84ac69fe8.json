{"title":"Characterization of an α‐L‐fucosidase in marine bacterium Wenyingzhuangia fucanilytica: new evidence on the catalytic sites of GH95 family glycosidases","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13659?af=R","date":1719470150000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p><i>α</i>-<span>l</span>-Fucose confers unique functions for fucose-containing biomolecules such as human milk oligosaccharides. <i>α</i>-<span>l</span>-Fucosidases can serve as desirable tools in the application of fucosylated saccharides. Discovering novel <i>α</i>-<span>l</span>-fucosidases and elucidating their enzyme properties are always worthy tasks.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>A GH95 family <i>α</i>-<span>l</span>-fucosidase named Afc95A_Wf was cloned from the genome of the marine bacterium <i>Wenyingzhuangia fucanilytica</i> and expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. It exhibited maximum activity at 40 °C and pH 7.5. Afc95A_Wf defined a different substrate specificity among reported <i>α</i>-<span>l</span>-fucosidases, which was capable of hydrolyzing <i>α</i>-fucoside in CNP-fucose, Fuc<i>α</i>1-2Gal<i>β</i>1-4Glc and Gal<i>β</i>1-4(Fuc<i>α</i>1-3)Glc, and showed a preference for <i>α</i>1,2-fucosidic linkage. It adopted Asp residue in the amino acid sequence at position 391, which was distinct from the previously acknowledged residue of Asn. The predicted tertiary structure and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Asp391 participates in the catalysis of Afc95A_Wf. The differences in the substrate specificity and catalytic site shed light on that Afc95A_Wf adopted a novel mechanism in catalysis.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>A GH95 family <i>α</i>-<span>l</span>-fucosidase (Afc95A_Wf) was cloned and expressed. It showed a cleavage preference for <i>α</i>1,2-fucosidic linkage to <i>α</i>1,3-fucosidic linkage. Afc95A_Wf demonstrated a different substrate specificity and a residue at an important catalytic site compared with known GH95 family proteins, which revealed the occurrence of diversity on catalytic mechanisms in the GH95 family. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jingjing Shen, \nJiajing Li, \nYuying Zhang, \nXuanwei Mei, \nChanghu Xue, \nYaoguang Chang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"62bffcc905464c6a3e60dc28204fa0d1ea0949025911b2724191f9e84ac69fe8","category":"Environment"}
