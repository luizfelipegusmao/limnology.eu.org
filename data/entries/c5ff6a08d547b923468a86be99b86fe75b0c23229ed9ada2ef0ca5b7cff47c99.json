EELS measures a material’s chemical and structural properties ranging from collective oscillations such as phonons and plasmons to the atomic oxidation state and local coordination [<a href=\"#ozae044.724-B1\">1</a>]. Ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) could bring high spatiotemporal resolution to EELS, allowing, for example, the nanoscale mapping of charge recombination and transport. A myriad of studies have focused on the low-loss (0 – 100 eV) region due to the larger cross-section for inelastic scattering where surface plasmon and optical near-field excitations occur [<a href=\"#ozae044.724-B2\">2</a>]. Only a few studies have reported transient core-loss EELS (&gt; 100 eV) in the TEM which would allow synchrotron types of information to be obtained [<a href=\"#ozae044.724-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c5ff6a08d547b923468a86be99b86fe75b0c23229ed9ada2ef0ca5b7cff47c99","category":"Environment"}
