{"title":"Evaluation of the Bioherbicidal Potential of Thymus sp. Pl. Essential Oils in Weed Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0027/v1","date":1727936255000,"content":"The bioherbicidal potential of four essential oils (EOs) from Mediterranean species of Thymus sp. pl.: Thymus algeriensis Boiss. et Reut., T. ciliatus Desf. subspecies coloratus (Boiss. et Reut.) Batt., T. vulgaris L., ecotype Fasano and T. vulgaris L. var. Varico was investigated to identify new sources of biomolecules. In vivo assays were carried out to assess the effect of the EOs on pre and post-emergence of two weed species: Lolium perenne L. and Amaranthus retroflexus L.. Four concentrations of EO emulsions (500, 750, 1000 and 2000 µl/100 mL) were applied. All the EOs expressed an important bioherbicidal activity against the target species. A total inhibition of seed germination was displayed at 2000 µl whereas a potent effec-tiveness was achieved even at 500 µl. On the contrary, for post-emergence experiments, L. perenne showed resistance to the EOs while A. retroflexus was highly sensitive, arguing a selectivity of the EOs. Bioassays were also performed on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh, for a better understanding of the structural modifications induced by the EOs. The root system of EO-treated A. thaliana seedlings was highly damaged.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad36c922bc1a97e8470edea1c6d74702e8b49929c4ed0c78e28cb19c0cdd105e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
