Self- care management education of diabetes provides skills and information for diabetic patients to effectively perform their own self diabetic self-care for optimum glycemic index control. As T2DM is a growing health issue in Fiji, promoting diabetes self manages among patients is a need, however there is lack of evidence in this regard. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the perception of T2DM patients on diabetic self-care management.</p> Method <p>This study used a qualitative method among T2DM patients regarding diabetic self-care management in Central Division, Fiji in 2022. This study was conducted in SOPD (Special Out Patient Department) clinics in the three chosen governmental health centers in the central division of Fiji. The study sample inclusion criteria were only T2DM patients, and no other types of diabetes, patients who are 18years and above, patients who are attending clinic at least for more than 6 months, self-identified as Fijian participants of any ethnicity or gender. The study settings were also purposively selected but the study sample was selected using purposive sampling. In depth interview using semi-structured open-ended questionnaires was used to collect data. Thematic analysis was done, followed by reviewing themes, defining and naming them.</p> Results <p>Thirty patients participated in this study. Five major themes emerged from the in-depth interview including; patient factors that affect diabetes self-care management, behavior and attitude towards T2DM self-care management, health services delivery, challenges and barriers faced by patients to perform diabetes self-care management, and recommendations to improve patient self-care management. Patients in this study have good knowledge about T2DM and the self-care management they have to perform. It is the patients’ attitude and behavior towards T2DM self-care management that affects patients to perform self-care management. The study also showed patients have gained good knowledge from Health Care Workers (HCW). Socio-economic and psychological status also played a vital part in patients’ self-care management. Apart from challenges, there were opportunities to learn the difficulties patients face in order to perform self-care management.</p> Conclusion <p>The results of this study revealed a combination of individual, cultural, and health systematic related factors as the mots influencer of diabetes self-management among patients in Fiji. Patients have to take ownership of their own health in order to improve their blood sugar reading and reduce complication of diabetes. Tailored interventions that consider patients’ belief and address potential challenges would be useful. A lot is needed in terms of upgrading facilities for the comfort of patients and need to collaborate more with other multidisciplinary team and stakeholders.</p>","author":"Reshma Kumar","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"54016fbf209d714e0f1ed82fe907d97582e71d0c6d711c729bbe9caa80d38048","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
