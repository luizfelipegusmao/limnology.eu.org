{"title":"Effect of Different Doses of Capsaicin Administration and Titanium Implant Osseointegration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2092/v1","date":1717138381000,"content":"Background and Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the histological and biochemical ef-fects of capsaicin on implant osseointegration and oxidative stress. Materials and Methods: Male Wistar albino rats weighing between 250 and 300 grams were used in this study. Twenty-four rats were randomly divided into three equal groups: implant + control (n= 8), implant + capsai-cin-1 (n= 8), and implant + capsaicin-2 (n= 8). 2.5 mm diameter and 4 mm length titanium im-plants were surgically integrated into the corticocancellous bone parts of the femurs. In the treatment groups, rats were injected intraperitoneally with 25 mg/kg (implant + capsaicin-1) and 50 mg/kg (implant + capsaicin-2) of capsaicin. No additional applications were made in the con-trol group. Three rats in totally were died during and after the experiment, as a result of the an-alyzes performed on 21 animals. Results: The highest total antioxidant status value was found in capsaicin dose 2, according to the analysis. The control group had the highest total oxidant status and oxidative stress index values, while group 2 of capsaicin had the lowest. After analysis, we found that there was no observed positive effect on osteointegration in this study (p&gt; 0.05), alt-hough the bone implant connection was higher in the groups treated with capsaicin. Conclusi-ons: A positive effect on osteointegration was not observed in this study. This may be due to os-teaclast activation. However it was found that it has a positive effect on oxidative stress. Osteo-clast activation may be the cause of this phenomenon. Capsaicin was found to have a positive effect on oxidative stress (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10ef6b27613983be74353374d483fed8b9a0e3eb1e86382666892a73c6c5d324","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
