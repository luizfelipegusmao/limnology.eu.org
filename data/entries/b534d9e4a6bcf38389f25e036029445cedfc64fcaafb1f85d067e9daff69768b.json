For NGCP to be successfully implemented, the generated carbon products need to be value added and aligned with target markets able to handle the influx that will be generated in conjunction with hydrogen. Alignment of the carbon products within certain markets entails tailoring the properties and allotropes selectivity to maximize the value-added nature of the material. A first step in tailoring to markets involves leveraging analytical techniques and creating methods to characterize the carbon products.
