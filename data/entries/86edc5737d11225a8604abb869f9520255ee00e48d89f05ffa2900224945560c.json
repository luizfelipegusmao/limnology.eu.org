{"title":"Galactic Symmetry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202009.0215/v8","date":1721106278000,"content":"Differences between the quantum mechanical and relativistic concepts of time observed in GPS satellites are accounted for by applying the equivalence principle to the transitioning electron of an atomic clock. This allows a differential equation of motion to be derived for the electron in the Minkowski space between electron shells. By applying Hamiltonâ€™s principle we transform the differential equation into a relativistically correct integral equation of motion, the time integral of a Lagrangian. This newly derived equation accounts for the abstract mathematics of the more familiar non-relativistic model by means of a physical interpretation. Abstract rotations in Hilbert space are replaced by real rotations of particle field geometries in Minkowki space that describe the electron transition and emission of a photon. Because the properties of energy are universal the same integral equations are able to be used to describe the time evolution of galaxies despite vast differences in lifetime. The comparison of gravitational and electromagnetic energy exchanges by means of radial and transverse fields leads to an alternative to the standard model that is based on a field model. It explains the observed properties of galaxies as a superposition of neutrinos localized within the horizon of a black hole with spins aligned. The particle properties of free neutrinos are accounted by means of a classical field geometry; specifically, a spin that is oriented in space with rotational inertia due to energy. A test of the standard model is proposed based on differing views for flavor oscillation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"86edc5737d11225a8604abb869f9520255ee00e48d89f05ffa2900224945560c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
