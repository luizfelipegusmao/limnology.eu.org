{"title":"Peruvian origin and global invasions of five continents by the highly damaging agricultural pest Liriomyza huidobrensis (Diptera: Agromyzidae)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.13702?af=R","date":1729528758000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Identification of the geographic origin of invasive species can be critical to effective management and amelioration of negative impacts in the introduced range. <i>Liriomyza huidobrensis</i> is a polyphagous leafmining fly that is a devastating pest of many vegetable and floriculture crops around the world. Considered native to South and possibly Central America, <i>L. huidobrensis</i> became invasive in the 1980s and has since spread to at least 30 countries on five continents. We used phylogeographic analysis of over 2 kb of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and II sequence data from 403 field-collected specimens from both native and introduced populations to investigate the geographic origins of invasive <i>L. huidobrensis</i> worldwide. Within South America, there was substantial genetic variation, as well as the strong phylogeographic structure typical of a native range. In contrast, leafminers from the introduced range and Central America all contained little genetic variation and shared the same small set of haplotypes. These haplotypes trace to Peru as the ultimate geographic origin of invasive populations. Central America is rejected as part of the original geographic range of <i>L. huidobrensis.</i> Within Peru, the primary export region of Lima shared an extremely similar pattern of reduced haplotype variation to the invasive populations. An additional 18 specimens collected at US ports of entry did not share the same haplotype profile as contemporary invasive populations, raising perplexing questions on global pathways and establishment success in this species.</p>","author":"Sonja J.
