{"title":"Microstructure Evolution of Alloy 800H during Cold Rolling and Subsequent Annealing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1707/v1","date":1714112172000,"content":"The microstructure evolution during the cold rolling and subsequent annealing of Alloy 800H was investigated. Two distinct rolling methods, unidirectional rolling and cross-rolling, were intro-duced. Results show that better ductility was observed in the unidirectional rolling than in cross-rolling, whilst a higher volume fraction of large deformed grains was observed in the cross-rolled plates than in the unidirectionally rolled plates. Recrystallization occurred faster in plates from unidirectional rolling than from cross-rolling.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c188108451bf4753c0dadd9cf9805542786bcf6103644f819cc3220ec594f64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
