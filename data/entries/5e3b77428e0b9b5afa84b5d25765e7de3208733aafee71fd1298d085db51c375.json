{"title":"Chaotic Instability of Oscillations in Microwave Power Amplifierswhen Amplifying a Biharmonic Signal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1573/v1","date":1713940091000,"content":"The occurrence of chaotic instability of oscillations at the output of a single-stage amplifier on a powerful bipolar microwave transistor when a biharmonic signal is amplified is considered. It has been established that at a high level of the input signal at the output of the amplifier, the signal contains a significant chaotic component. Cases were experimentally studied when the frequency distance between the partial frequency components of a biharmonic signal is close to the gain band and when it is much smaller than this band. It has been established that in the first case, the chaos in oscillations is associated with the emergence of a sequence of trains of a forced oscillatory process with arbitrary initial phases and durations. In the second case, the appearance of a chaotic pedestal is associated with the chaos in the passive underexcited mode of the nonlinear circuit formed by the capacitance of the p-n junction and the input matching circuits of the amplifier stage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e3b77428e0b9b5afa84b5d25765e7de3208733aafee71fd1298d085db51c375","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
