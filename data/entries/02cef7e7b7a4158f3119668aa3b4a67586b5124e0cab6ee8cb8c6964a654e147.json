{"title":"Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Differently Modulates the Release of IL-6 and IL-8 Cytokines in Human Glial Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1816/v1","date":1719383509000,"content":"Background: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a significant player in the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite the established link between ER stress and inflammatory pathways, there remains a need for deeper exploration of the specific cellular mechanisms underlying ER stress-mediated neuroinflammation. Methods: This study aimed to investigate how severity of ER stress can impact the release of proinflammatory cyto-kines IL-6 and IL-8 from astrocytes and microglia, comparing the effects with those induced by well-known immunostimulants - tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results: Mild ER stress has a distinct effect on the cytokine release compared to more intense stress levels, i.e. diminished IL-6 production was accompanied by an increase in IL-8 level, which was significantly more pronounced in astrocytes than in microglia. On the contrary, prolonged or more severe ER stress induced inflammation in glial cells, leading to a time- and concentration-dependent buildup of pro-inflammatory IL-6 but unlike inflammatory agents, ER stress inducer diminished IL-8 secretions by glial cells. Conclusion: The differences could hold importance in identifying ER stress markers as potential drug targets for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases or mood disorders, yet it requires confirmation in more complex animal studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02cef7e7b7a4158f3119668aa3b4a67586b5124e0cab6ee8cb8c6964a654e147","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
