{"title":"Differing physiological performance of coexisting cool- and warmwater fish species under heatwaves in the Midwestern United States","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301130","date":1711116000000,"content":"<p>by Qihong Dai, Cory D. Suski</p>\r\n\r\nHeatwaves are becoming more frequent and intensified with climate change. Freshwater ecosystems are among the most threatened, within which, differing responses between cool- and warmwater species to heatwaves can lead to fundamental changes in communities. Physiological experiments can identify potential mechanisms underlying the impacts of such heatwaves on fish communities. In the current study, we quantified the oxygen consumption rate, aerobic scope and swimming performance of cool- and warmwater fish species following the simulation of short-term heatwaves currently occurring in streams in the Midwestern United States. The coolwater predator walleye (<i>Sander vitreus</i>) showed clear thermal disadvantages relative to the warmwater predator largemouth bass (<i>Micropterus salmoides</i>), based on a high metabolic cost during the heatwave, low metabolic activity when encountering prey, and reduced swimming performance following the heatwave. Largemouth bass also showed a thermal advantage relative to the warmwater prey fathead minnow (<i>Pimephales promelas</i>) related to swimming performance and energetic costs, highlighting differing thermal responses between predators and prey. This study demonstrates the importance of considering short-term extreme thermal events in the response of aquatic communities to climate stressors.","author":"Qihong Dai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a2fa3aaec193753f37c063de3445cfa93887daa03d5421d30897f3a697ecd730","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
