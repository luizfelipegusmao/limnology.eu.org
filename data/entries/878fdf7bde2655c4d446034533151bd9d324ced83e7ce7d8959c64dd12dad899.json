{"title":"Extracting bioactive compounds and proteins from <i>Bacopa monnieri</i> using natural deep eutectic solvents","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300969","date":1711720800000,"content":"<p>by Tan Phat Vo, Tran Ha Phuong Nguyen, Vy Khang Nguyen, Thi Cam Tu Dang, Le Gia Kiet Nguyen, Thanh Quynh Chung, Thi Thanh Huong Vo, Dinh Quan Nguyen</p>\r\n\r\nThis study employed novel extraction methods with natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) to extract bioactive compounds and proteins from <i>Bacopa monnieri</i> leaves. The conditional influence of ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), and enzymatic-assisted extraction (EAE) on the recovery efficiency of phenolics, proteins, flavonoids, and terpenoids was evaluated. The conditions of UAE were 50 mL/g LSR, 600W of ultrasonic power, and 30% water content with 40Â°C for 1 min to obtain the highest bioactive compounds and protein contents. The conditions of MAE were 40 mL/g LSR, 400W of microwave power with 30% water content for 3 min to reach the highest contents of biological compounds. The conditions of EAE were 30 mL/g of LSR, 20 U/g of enzyme concentration with L-Gly-Na molar ratio at 2:4:1, and 40% water content for 60 min to acquire the highest bioactive compound contents. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is employed to analyze the surface of <i>Bacopa monnieri</i> leaves before and after extraction. Comparing seven extraction methods was conducted to find the most favorable ones. The result showed that the UMEAE method was the most effective way to exploit the compounds. The study suggested that UMEAE effectively extracts phenolics, flavonoids, terpenoids, and protein from DBMP.","author":"Tan Phat Vo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"878fdf7bde2655c4d446034533151bd9d324ced83e7ce7d8959c64dd12dad899","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
