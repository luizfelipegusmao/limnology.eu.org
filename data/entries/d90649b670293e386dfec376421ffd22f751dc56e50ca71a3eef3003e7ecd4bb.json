To investigate Chinese adults’ preferences regarding COVID-19 vaccine attributes, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey in 12,000 Chinese adults in June-July, 2021. Participants were requested to answer a series of discrete choice questions related to hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines. Using mixed logit models, our analysis revealed that participants had a higher preference for COVID-19 vaccines with longer duration of protection (coefficient: 1.272, 95% confidence interval [1.016 to 1.529]) and higher efficacy (coefficient: 1.063, [0.840, 1.287]). Conversely, participants demonstrated a lower preference associated with higher risk of rare but serious side-effects (coefficient: -1.158, [-1.359, -0.958]), oral administration (coefficient: -0.211, [-0.377, -0.046]), more doses (coefficient: -0.148, [-0.296, 0.000]) and imported origin (coefficient: -0.653, [-0.864, -0.443]). Moreover, preferences were heterogeneous by individual factors: highly educated participants were more sensitive to the negative vaccine attributes including price (coefficient -0.312, [-0.370, -0.253]) and imported vaccine (coefficient -0.941, [-1.186, -0.697]); there was also substantial heterogeneity in vaccine preferences with respect to age group, marital status, work status, income, chronic diagnosis history, COVID-19 vaccination history and geographic regions. As the first study of examining the public preferences for COVID-19 vaccine in China with a large nationwide sample of 12,000 adults, our results indicate that future vaccine should pose lower risk, possess longer protection period, have higher efficacy, be domestically produced, and have lower costs to increase the COVID-19 vaccination coverage. Our current study findings from this study provide insights and recommendations for not only COVID-19 vaccine design but also vaccine attribute preferences to increase vaccine uptake in potential future pandemics.","author":"Fengyun Yu","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"d90649b670293e386dfec376421ffd22f751dc56e50ca71a3eef3003e7ecd4bb","category":"Environment"}
