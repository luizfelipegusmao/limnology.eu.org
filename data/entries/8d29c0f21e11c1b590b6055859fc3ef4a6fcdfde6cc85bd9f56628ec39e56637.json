{"title":"Experiment and analysis of physical, mechanical, and viscoelastic properties of the roots and stalks of green leafy vegetables","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305572","date":1719928800000,"content":"<p>by Yue Jin, Zhiyu Song, Renlong Zhang, Jianfei Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nGreen leafy vegetables are an essential component of Chinese leafy vegetables. Due to their crisp stems and tender leaves, orderly harvester generally causes significant mechanical clamping damage. The physical and mechanical properties of green leafy vegetables are one of the important basis to design the orderly harvester. At the same time, they provide important parameters for the simulation and optimization of harvester. So, this paper measured the physical characteristic parameters of roots and stems of green leafy vegetables. Then, based on the TMS-Pro texture analyzer, the elasticity modulus of the roots and stems of green leafy vegetables were measured. The static friction coefficient, dynamic friction coefficient, and restitution coefficient of green leafy vegetables root-root, stem-stem, root-steel, and stem-steel were measured separately using a combination method of inclined plane and high-speed photography. Uniaxial compression creep experiments were carried out on whole and single leaf of green leafy vegetables using the TA.XT plus C universal testing machine. The constitutive equation of the four-element Burgers model was used to fit the deformation curve of the sample with time during the constant-pressure loading stage. The fitting determination coefficients R<sup>2</sup> were all higher than 0.996, which verified the reasonable validity of the selected model. The above experimental results provide a parameter basis and theoretical support for the design and discrete element simulation optimization of orderly harvester critical components of green leafy vegetables.","author":"Yue Jin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8d29c0f21e11c1b590b6055859fc3ef4a6fcdfde6cc85bd9f56628ec39e56637","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
