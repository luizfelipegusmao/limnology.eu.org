{"title":"Molecular Insights into Female Hybrid Sterility in Interspecific Crosses between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1438/v1","date":1713853551000,"content":"Species of the genus Drosophila have served as favorite models in speciation studies; however, genetic factors of interspecific reproductive incompatibility are underinvestigated. Here we performed the analysis of hybrid female sterility by crossing Drosophila melanogaster females and Drosophila simulans males. Using transcriptomic data analysis, molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches, we analyzed differential gene expression, transposable element (TE) activity, piRNA biogenesis, and functional defects of oogenesis in hybrids. Premature germline stem cell loss was the most prominent defect of oogenesis in hybrid ovaries. Due to the differential expression of genes encoding piRNA pathway components, rhino and deadlock, the functional RDCmel complex in hybrid ovaries was not assembled. However, the activity of the RDCsim complex was maintained in hybrids, independent of the genomic origin of piRNA clusters. Despite the identification of a cohort of overexpressed TEs in hybrid ovaries, we found no evidence that their activity can be considered the main cause of hybrid sterility. We revealed a complicated pattern of Vasa protein expression in the hybrid germline, including partial AT-chX piRNA targeting of the vasasim allele and a significant zygotic delay in vasamel expression. We arrived at the conclusion that the hybrid sterility phenotype was caused by intricate multi-locus differences between the species.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"afa57d7054a1d76ed6664580e98795ae0e7c28a703dd9b7458518cd9f8fe02d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
