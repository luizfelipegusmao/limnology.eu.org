{"title":"The Orthogonal Analysis of Selected Influence Factors for Bioaerosol Samplers in an Aerosol Generating Chamber","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s41810-024-00229-5","date":1733011200000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>A high-efficiency bioaerosol sampler is a necessary tool to capture airborne pathogenic microbes, and can effectively ensure the concentration and biological viability of the microbes for further biological and medical analysis. The Andersen sampler and Fuji cyclone were applied in the bacteria and virus under a bioaerosol emission chamber. The four factors selected for this study were temperature, microbial culture concentration, aerosol emission time, and the placing position of biosamplers, and each influencing factor with its varying levels were optimized by orthogonal analysis to evaluate the sampling efficiency of alternative biosamplers under both bacterial and viral environment in a bioaerosol generating chamber. The Andersen impactor had a better collecting effect than Fuji cyclone under four influence factors in bacterial aerosol environment. In the viral aerosol collection, a high air flow rate Fuji cyclone has a better performance for collecting viral aerosol without considering the viability. The two best factors from both Andersen and Fuji were the emission concentration and the angle of 45Â° sampler placing position under bacteria environment. The two best factors from both Andersen and Fuji were the temperature and the emission time under the virus environment.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"6123dccf15afa83d1853527536c26c421b04d66b181a7bc80f7464e2f4389d60","category":"Environment"}
