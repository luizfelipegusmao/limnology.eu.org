{"title":"Constraints on the Minimally Extended Varying Speed of Light Model Using Pantheon+ Dataset","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1349/v1","date":1713620171000,"content":"In the context of the minimally extended varying speed of light (meVSL) model, both the absolute magnitude and the luminosity distance of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) differ from those predicted by general relativity (GR). Utilizing the Pantheon+ data, we examine the plausibility of various dark energy models under meVSL. Both ωCDM and CPL parameterization dark energy (DE) models exhibit indications of cosmic variations in the speed of light at the 1-σ level. For Ωm0=0.30,0.31, and 0.32 with (ω0,ωa)=(−1,0), the 1-σ range of c˜˙0/c˜0(10−13yr−1) is (-8.76 , -0.89), (-11.8 , 3.93), and (-14.8 , -6.98), respectively. Meanwhile, the 1-σ range of c˜˙0/c˜0(10−12yr−1) for CPL dark energy models with −1.05≤ω0≤−0.95 and 0.28≤Ωm0≤0.32, is (-6.31 , -2.98). The value of c˜ at z=3 can exceed that of the present by 0.2∼3 % for ωCDM models and 5∼13 % for CPL models. Additionally, for viable models except for the CPL model with Ωm0=0.28, we find −25.6≤G˜˙0/G˜0(10−12yr−1)≤−0.36. For this particular model, we obtain an increasing rate of the gravitational constant within the range 1.65≤G˜˙0/G˜0(10−12yr−1)≤3.79.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"344cbe21358a2cf30200f29682e44d6baa2e0718ee50a99c7b335282a9170ed7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
