{"title":"Photochemical and Oxidative Degradation of Chamazulene Contained in Artemisia, Matricaria and Achillea Essential Oils and Setup of  Protection Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0280/v1","date":1714981502000,"content":"Chamazulene (CA) is an intensely blue molecule with a wealth of biological properties. In cosmetics chamazulene is exploited as a natural coloring and soothing agent. CA is unstable and tends to spontaneous degradation accelerated by light. We studied the photodegradation of CA upon controlled exposure to UVB-UVA irradiation by multi-ple techniques, including GC-MS, UHPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS and by direct infusion in ESI-MSn, which were matched to in silico mass spectral simulations to identify degra-dation products. Seven byproducts formed upon UVA exposure for 3 h at 70mW/cm2 (blue-to-green color change) were identified, including CA dimers and CA benzenoid which were not found on extended 6 h irradiation (green-to-yellow fading). Photosta-bility tests with reduced irradiance conducted in various solvents in the pres-ence/absence of air indicated highest degradation in acetonitrile in the presence of ox-ygen, suggesting a photo-oxidative mechanism. Testing in the presence of antioxidants (tocopherol, ascorbyl palmitate, hydroxytyrosol, bakuchiol, γ-terpinene, TEMPO and their combinations) indicated highest protection by tocopherol and TEMPO. Sun-screens ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate and particularly Tinosorb® S (but not octo-crylene) showed good CA photoprotection. Thermal stability tests indicated no degra-dation of CA in acetonitrile at 50°C in the dark for 50 days; however, accelerated deg-radation occurred in the presence of ascrorbyl palmitate.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"47a968f3d05fabe158ac9d37102a33e18c6ede3fe4798184306591d7d0e97716","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
