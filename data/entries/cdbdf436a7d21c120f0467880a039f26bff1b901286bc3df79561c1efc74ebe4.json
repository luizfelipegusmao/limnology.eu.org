{"title":"The plant POLYMERASE-ASSOCIATED FACTOR1 complex links transcription and H2B monoubiquitination genome wide","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/640/7591236?rss=1","date":1706486400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The evolutionarily conserved POLYMERASE-ASSOCIATED FACTOR1 complex (Paf1C) participates in transcription, and research in animals and fungi suggests that it facilitates RNA POLYMERASE II (RNAPII) progression through chromatin. We examined the genomic distribution of the EARLY FLOWERING7 (ELF7) and VERNALIZATION INDEPENDENCE3 subunits of Paf1C in <span>Arabidopsis</span> (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). The occupancy of both subunits was confined to thousands of gene bodies and positively associated with RNAPII occupancy and the level of gene expression, supporting a role as a transcription elongation factor. We found that monoubiquitinated histone H2B, which marks most transcribed genes, was strongly reduced genome wide in <span>elf7</span> seedlings. Genome-wide profiling of RNAPII revealed that in <span>elf7</span> mutants, RNAPII occupancy was reduced throughout the gene body and at the transcription end site of Paf1C-targeted genes, suggesting a direct role for the complex in transcription elongation. Overall, our observations suggest a direct functional link between Paf1C activity, monoubiquitination of histone H2B, and the transition of RNAPII to productive elongation. However, for several genes, Paf1C may also act independently of H2Bub deposition or occupy these genes more stable than H2Bub marking, possibly reflecting the dynamic nature of Paf1C association and H2Bub turnover during transcription.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"cdbdf436a7d21c120f0467880a039f26bff1b901286bc3df79561c1efc74ebe4","category":"Environment"}
