{"title":"Investigating the Dynamic Impact of Socioeconomic Issues on Crimes: A Comparison of Newly Democratized Countries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1174/v1","date":1728985188000,"content":"This study aims to investigate the dynamic impact of socio-economic issues such as youth unemployment and income inequality on crime by comparing the findings from newly democratized African countries (South Africa and Namibia) to those of recently democratized European countries (Lithuania and the Ukraine) and newly democratized Asian countries (Kyrgyzstan) from 1994 to 2019.   \nThe study used the Bayesian vector autoregression approach with hierarchical priors. This model was chosen due to its ability to address the dynamics of several entities, such as the measurable defects where data quality is uncertain, or perhaps lacking as frequently happens. Prior selection in a Bayesian vector autoregression approach can help adjust for these flaws. According to the study's findings, an unexpected shock in unemployment and income inequality has a significant positive impact on crime; however, an unanticipated shock in government expenditure has a significant negative impact. The results are interesting, as we found that the impact of these socio-economic issues does not necessarily depend on the geographical area, as the results are similar for income inequality in both regions. This study serves as a wake-up call to the government that some policies (fiscal policy or income policy) are more appropriate for resolving concerns about inequality and unemployment than others. As a result, addressing these issues through policies that promote greater economic equality and ensure everyone has access to basic education, healthcare, and job training, could assist in reducing crime while promoting a more equal society.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49655ca4146cc0ab0699845d7fa9fad9b07ffa82f2844251ba45351eeb5b6f62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
