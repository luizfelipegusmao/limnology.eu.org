{"title":"Micro and Nano Pollutants from Tires and Car Brakes Generated in Winter Season in the Poznan City Urban Environment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1351/v1","date":1713535211000,"content":"This research focusing on the environmental impact of tire and brake pad wear constitutes a significant area of transport-related studies. These two key vehicle components are not only the most frequently worn, but also generate micro and nano pollutants (i.e., rubber, metal oxides) that potentially harm the environment. Over half of the globally produced natural and synthetic rubbers, which amounted to about 30 million tons in 2022, are used for tire production. According to Wagner et al.'s research, over 1.3 million tons of such particles are released due to wear and tear in the European Union alone. This work focuses on examining snow deposits from various locations in an urban agglomeration (Poznan, Poland) in the winter season. FT-IR and NMR spectroscopic studies, optical and electron scanning microscopy SEM-EDS, and particle size studies using the DLS technique were conducted for a detailed characterization of pollutants in the environment. The conducted particle separation methods allowed for the extraction of a fraction mainly containing gum residues with particle sizes less than 2 Âµm. The results of these studies are crucial for understanding the impact of vehicle part exploitation on the environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"362e3403ba881a212e95b99a7ffe238d830d68d26ce26da1304f511d6c56b7b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
