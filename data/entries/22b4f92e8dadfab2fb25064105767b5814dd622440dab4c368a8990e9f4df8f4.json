{"title":"Correlation between MELD Score and Postoperative Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery: A Retrospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0516/v1","date":1720165971000,"content":"1) Background- Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a common surgical intervention for patients with severe coronary artery disease. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has been widely used to predict mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease, but its utility in predicting postoperative outcomes in cardiac surgery patients is less well-established. 2) Methods-This retrospective study aims to investigate the association between preoperative MELD score and post-operative complications, length of hospital stay, and mortality in patients under-going coronary artery bypass grafting. This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary care academic medical center. The study includes all adult patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting between January 2011 and December 2020. Preoperative MELD scores were calculated for each patient, and postoperative outcomes including major ad-verse cardiac events, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality was assessed. To ensure a homogeneous study cohort, we excluded patients who underwent emergent cardiac procedures or had incomplete data necessary for the calculation of MELD scores and assessment of postoperative outcomes. Data was extracted from the electronic medical records, including patient de-mographics, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory values, operative details, and postoperative outcomes. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and the require-ment for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study.3) Results- This study reveals a statistical association between the MELD score calculated at admission and the length of hospital stay, duration in the ICU, patient age, and the duration of aortic clamping and extracorporeal circulation. Specifically, there is an exponential increase in the MELD score corre-lating with the rise in these factors, both collectively and individually, highlighting a significant relationship between the duration of extracorporeal circulation and aortic clamping time. 4) Conclusion-Patients with a high MELD score had an increased risk of postoperative complications and mortality compared to those with a low MELD score. Careful preoperative patient selection and optimization of the patient's clinical condition may improve outcomes in patients with advanced liver disease undergoing cardiac surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22b4f92e8dadfab2fb25064105767b5814dd622440dab4c368a8990e9f4df8f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
