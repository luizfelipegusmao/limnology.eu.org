{"title":"A quantitative analysis of factors shaping attitudes toward green products among Cambodian public employees","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13412-023-00879-w","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Green consumption is becoming increasingly important as the world faces environmental challenges such as climate change and pollution. This study investigated the factors influencing green product consumption among Cambodian public employees. It is guided by four theoretical frameworks: the Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theory, the Health Belief Model (HBM), the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). These theories comprehensively understand the factors influencing human behavior, including attitudes and intentions. Using data from 252 public employees in Cambodia and applying partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), the study found that health consciousness (HC), attitudes toward the environment (AE), and environmental knowledge (EK) had a significant positive impact on attitude toward green products (AG). EK is also found to mediate the relationship between HC and AG and between AE and AG. These findings suggest that EK is pivotal in nurturing environmentally friendly attitudes. Individuals with higher levels of EK are more likely to be aware of the environmental impacts of their consumption choices and believe they have a responsibility to protect the environment. This knowledge and belief can lead to positive attitudes toward green products. The study has several implications for policymakers and businesses.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"a491c698b1c369e133fb80e6c5771ddf0daba38cb3b0cff62bdbd03552e63d05","category":"Environment"}
