{"title":"Ultrastructural localization of calcium homeostasis modulator 1 in mouse taste buds","link":"https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjae019/7676314?rss=1","date":1715990400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Taste receptor cells are morphologically classified as types II and III. Type II cells form a unique type of synapses referred to as channel synapses where calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) together with CALHM3 forms voltage-gated channels that release the neurotransmitter, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). To validate the proposed structural model of channel synapses, the ultrastructural localization of CALHM1 in type II cells of both fungiform and circumvallate taste buds was examined. A monoclonal antibody against CALHM1 was developed and its localization was evaluated via immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy using the immunogold-silver labeling technique. CALHM1 was detected as puncta using immunofluorescence and along the presynaptic membrane of channel synapses facing atypical mitochondria, which provide ATP, by immunoelectron microscopy. In addition, it was detected along the plasma membrane lined by subsurface cisternae at sites apposed to afferent nerve fibers. Our results support the validity of a previously proposed structural model for channel synapses and provide insights into the function of subsurface cisternae whose function in taste receptor cells is unknown. We also examined the localization of CALHM1 in hybrid synapses of type III cells, which are conventional chemical synapses accompanied by mitochondria similar to atypical mitochondria of channel synapses. CALHM1 was not detected in the six hybrid synapses examined using immunoelectron microscopy. We further performed double immunolabeling for CALHM1 and Bassoon, which is detected as puncta corresponding to conventional vesicular synapses in type III cells. Our observations suggest that at least some, and probably most, hybrid synapses are not accompanied by CALHM1.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"98fa82e8325043548fd36728b5139ebeffced86e78b6c00dee30bd1301c24719","category":"Environment"}
