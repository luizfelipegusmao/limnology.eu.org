While many methods have been implemented for arbitrary-shape text detection, most cannot achieve real-time detection or meet practical needs. In this work, we propose a YOLOv6-based detector that can effectively implement arbitrary-shape text detection and achieve real-time detection. We include two additional branches in the neck part of the YOLOv6 network to adapt the network to text detection, and the output side uses the pixel aggregation (PA) algorithm to decouple the PA output to use it as the detection head of the model. Experiments on benchmark Total-Text, CTW1500, ICDAR2015, and MSRA-TD500 showed that the proposed method outperformed competing methods in terms of detection accuracy and running time. Specifically, our method achieved an F-measure of 84.1% at 291.8 FPS for 640 × 640 Total-Text images and an F-measure of 81.5% at 199.6 FPS for 896 × 896 ICDAR2015 incidental text images.","author":"Manhuai Lu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"53fa00469046cd4b61eb0a0c21fb2dcd54d8e5bbc8ba12eafd8810114211268c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
