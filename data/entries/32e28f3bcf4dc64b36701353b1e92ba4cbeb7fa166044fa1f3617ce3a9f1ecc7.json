{"title":"The Associations between the Quantity and Quality of Urban Green Spaces and Health: Enlightenment from the Case of Hangzhou, China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1183/v1","date":1713452800000,"content":"China is experiencing rapid urbanization. The focus on health issues has shifted from the treatment of diseases to passive or active prevention. Diseases caused by the deterioration of the urban environment, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and other chronic diseases and mental illness, have gradually become the main threat to public health. Studies have confirmed that urban green spaces (UGS) can help residents relieve mental stress, improve mood, reduce mental fatigue and restore attention, which has a positive effect on people's physical and mental health. In this study, the relationship between the quantity and quality factors of UGS and the physical and mental health of urban residents in Xihu District of Hangzhou is examined, and on this basis, UGS design strategies are proposed to promote the physical and mental health of residents. This study is of great significance for the future construction of UGS that are beneficial to the health of residents and the promotion of a healthy China and healthy city construction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32e28f3bcf4dc64b36701353b1e92ba4cbeb7fa166044fa1f3617ce3a9f1ecc7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
