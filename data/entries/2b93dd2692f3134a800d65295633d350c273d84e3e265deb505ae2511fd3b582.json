{"title":"Phase behavior and synergistic gelation of scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) male gonad hydrolysates and gellan gum driven by pH","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13961?af=R","date":1729328101000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Previous studies have investigated complexation and coacervation of scallop <i>Patinopecten yessoensis</i> male gonad hydrolysates (SMGHs) and polysaccharides influenced by pH and blending ratio. It has been found that SMGHs/polysaccharide composite shows better gel properties under strongly acidic conditions. Thus, the complexation and coacervation of SMGHs and gellan gum (GG) were investigated <i>via</i> turbidimetric titration at different pH values (1–12) and biopolymer blending ratios (9.5:0.5–6:4).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Both pH<sub>c</sub> and pH<sub>φ1</sub> exhibited ratio-independent behavior with constant values at approximately pH 5.8 and pH 3.8, respectively, dividing SMGHs/GG blends into three phases named mixed polymers, soluble complexes and insoluble coacervates, respectively. Overall, SMGHs and GG exhibited synergistic gelation under neutral and acidic conditions, with the initial storage modulus (<i>G'</i>) increasing by approximately 42.5-, 573.7- and 3421-fold and 97.7-, 550.3- and 0.5-fold, respectively, at pH 7, 5 and 3, compared with SMGHs and GG. As pH decreased from 7 to 3, the initial <i>G'</i> and viscosity <i>η</i> values of SMGHs/GG gels increased by 20.1- and 2.3-fold, respectively, exhibiting the greatest increase in gel strength. Moreover, the free water in the SMGHs/GG system significantly shifted toward lower relaxation times attributed to the immobilization of the outer hydration layers. SMGHs/GG gels in the insoluble phase exhibited denser networks and rougher surfaces, supporting the enhanced rheological properties and water retention capacity of the gel.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This work provides a basic foundation for the development of pH-driven SMGHs/GG gelation by examining complexation and coacervation processes. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jia‐Cheng Liu, \nBin Nie, \nYu‐Qiao Wang, \nJia‐Nan Yan, \nHai‐Tao Wu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"2b93dd2692f3134a800d65295633d350c273d84e3e265deb505ae2511fd3b582","category":"Environment"}
