{"title":"High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) in Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Management of Multi-Organ Failure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1596/v1","date":1711450567000,"content":"High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy has emerged as a non-invasive respiratory support method with potential benefits in various conditions, including acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF). This essay provides an overview of HFNC therapy, focusing on its indications based on institutional protocols, a critical appraisal of the FLORALI study and European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines regarding its use in AHRF, and its impact on clinical practice. The FLORALI study, a multicentre randomized controlled trial, and the ERS guidelines offer insights into the efficacy and safety of HFNC compared to conventional oxygen therapy (COT) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The synthesis of this information informs clinical decision-making and highlights considerations for managing patients with AHRF, including the influence of other organ failures on treatment strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d0f7397f99322477cd636ba52dc99d9d275b540916e9926ffc787a8628a4e1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
