{"title":"Polymer Electrolytes for Supercapacitors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0317/v1","date":1728023103000,"content":"Because of safety concerns associated with the use of liquid electrolytes and electrolyte solutions options of non-liquid materials like gels and polymers used as ion conducting electrolytes have been explored intensely. The low ionic conductivity of hard and soft solid materials was too low for practical applications in supercapacitors which require low internal reistance of a device and consequently highly conducting materials. Even if an additional separator may not be needed when the solid electrolyte already ensures reliable separation of the electrodes the electrolytes prepared as films or membranes as thin as practically acceptable resistance may still be too high. Recent developments with gel electrolytes sometimes approach or even surpass liquid electrolyte solutions in terms of effective conductance. Reported studies are reviewed, material combinations are sorted out, trends are identified.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"01b5d2094ccb87ad50d2ee32f33a771236757a3f65f2421b13566a18706683c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
