To inform South Africa’s National Tuberculosis Strategic Plan 2023–2028, we conducted a systematic review of active TB disease and latent TB infection (LTBI) prevalence and incidence in underserved populations, defined as those living in informal settlements, townships, or impoverished communities. We identified articles published from January 2010 to December 2023, assessed study quality, and conducted a meta-analysis to estimate pooled TB and LTBI prevalence stratified by HIV status. We calculated prevalence ratios for underserved populations compared to the overall South African population. The search yielded 726 unique citations. We identified 22 studies reporting TB prevalence (n = 12), TB incidence (n = 5), LTBI prevalence (n = 5), and/or LTBI incidence (n = 2) eligible for the review, including six high-quality studies. Meta-analysis demonstrated a high prevalence of TB disease among persons living without HIV (2.7% 95% CI 0.1 to 8.5%) and persons living with HIV (PLWH) (22.7%, 95% CI 15.8 to 30.4%), but heterogeneity was high (I2 = 95.5% and 92.3%, p-value&lt;0.00). LTBI prevalence was high among persons living without HIV (44.8%, 95% 42.5 to 47%) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 14.6%, p-value = 0.31), and lower among PLWH (33%, 95% CI 22.6 to 44.4%) based on one study. Compared to the national average, underserved populations of persons living without HIV had a 4-fold higher TB prevalence and a 3.3-fold higher LTBI prevalence. Underserved PLWH had a 31-fold higher TB prevalence than the national average, but similar LTBI prevalence as measured in one study. Our findings illustrate that underserved populations in South Africa have a substantially higher TB and LTBI prevalence than the general population, making targeted TB interventions potentially beneficial. More research is needed to explore the heterogeneous TB epidemiology in South Africa.","author":"Lydia M. L.
