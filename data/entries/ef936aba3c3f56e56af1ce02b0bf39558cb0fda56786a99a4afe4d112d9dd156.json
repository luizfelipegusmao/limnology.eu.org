{"title":"High-Performance Dual-Redox-Mediator Supercapacitors Based on Buckypaper Electrodes and Hydrogel Polymer Electrolytes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2187/v1","date":1727416476000,"content":"In recent years, the demand for solid, thin, and flexible energy storage devices has surged in modern consumer electronics, which require autonomy and long duration. In this context, hybrid supercapacitors have become strategic, leading to significant efforts to develop cells with an energy density close to that of batteries, while maintaining the power density of conventional supercapacitors. Motivated by these requirements, we report the development of a new high-performance dual-redox-mediator supercapacitor. In this study, cells were constructed using fully moldable buckypapers (BPs), composed of carbon nanotubes and cellulose nanofibers, as electrodes. We evaluated the compatibility of BPs with hydrogel polymer electrolytes, based on 1 mol L-1 H2SO4 and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), supplemented with different redox species: methylene blue, indigo carmine, and hydroquinone. Solid cells were constructed containing two active redox species to maximize the specific capacity of each electrode. Considering the main results, the dual-redox-mediator supercapacitor exhibits a high energy density of 32.0 Wh kg-1 (at 0.8 kW kg-1) and is capable of delivering 25.9 Wh kg-1 at high power demands (4.0 kW kg-1). Stability studies conducted over 10,000 galvanostatic cycles revealed that the PVA polymer matrix benefits the system by inhibiting the crossover of redox species within the cell.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef936aba3c3f56e56af1ce02b0bf39558cb0fda56786a99a4afe4d112d9dd156","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
