Kamya</p>\r\n\r\nChronic diseases such as HIV, hypertension, and diabetes increase the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and death. Thus, COVID-19 vaccine uptake data among these priority populations are needed to inform immunization programs. We assessed COVID-19 vaccine uptake among people living with HIV (PLWH) and those with hypertension/diabetes without HIV (PWoH) in Southwestern and Southcentral Uganda and determined factors influencing vaccination. We conducted a cross-sectional study from January to April 2023. We enrolled a random sample of participants aged 18 years and older seeking HIV, hypertension, or diabetes care at two regional referral hospitals (RRHs) in Mbarara and Masaka in Uganda. Using vaccination records abstraction and interviewer-administered questionnaires, we collected data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake, sociodemographic data, and reasons for non-uptake in unvaccinated persons. We compared COVID-19 vaccination uptake between PLWH and PWoH and applied modified Poisson regression to determine sociodemographic factors associated with vaccine uptake. The reasons for non-vaccine uptake were presented as percentages. Of the 1,376 enrolled participants, 65.6% were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Vaccination coverage was 65% among PWLH versus 67% among PWoH. Higher education attainment and older age were associated with COVID vaccination. Participants with secondary education and those aged â‰¥50 years achieved &gt;70% coverage. Fear of side effects was the most cited reason (67%) for non-vaccination among 330 unvaccinated participants, followed by vaccine mistrust (24.5%). People with chronic diseases in Southwestern Uganda had slightly lower than 70% COVID-19 vaccine coverage as recommended by WHO. Higher educational attainment and older age were linked to increased vaccine uptake. However, mistrust and fear of vaccine side effects were the main reasons for non-vaccination. To increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake, programs must reach those with lower educational attainment and younger age groups, and address the fear of vaccine side effects and mistrust among persons with underlying diseases in Uganda.","author":"Asiphas Owaraganise","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"cb784d9e7118c75cbf50b7e72de36644d7f3861978b0a6bb337e79bc33ec45d0","category":"Environment"}
