This research focuses on two comprehensive parks located in Xinxiang, China—People’s Park and Harmony Park, using multi-spectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images as the data source and considering monthly periods. Monthly FVC data was obtained using the method of Dimidiate Pixel Model based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The dynamic changes of monthly FVC at regional scale were described through the dynamic changes in the monthly FVC mean and in the FVC areas at various scales, and the dynamic changes in the monthly FVC were analyzed using the coefficient of variation and curve change trends. Furthermore, the dynamic changes in FVC areas at various scales in the parks were analyzed using standard deviation and curve change trends. Subsequently, the differential method was used to analyze the monthly FVC dynamic changes at pixel scale. The results indicate: (1) In terms of the spatial distribution characteristics in monthly FVC of urban parks, both parks exhibit the highest ratio of bare area in January and February. The proportions of FVC for People’s Park are 59.17% and 64.46%, while for Harmony Park they are 69.10% and 51.92%, showing the most distinct spatial distribution characteristics. The high and very high coverage areas in each month are mainly distributed on the outskirts of the park, while the medium, medium-low, and low coverage areas are mainly located in the central and middle parts of the park. The overall FVC of the park shows a trend of high coverage on the periphery and low coverage in the center. (2) In the spatial-temporal dynamic change in FVC at regional scale, the average monthly FVC changes exhibit an overall “∩” -shaped pattern. The peak and minimum FVC values for different parks occur at different times. The peak FVC for People’s Park appears in August, while for Harmony Park it appears in June, with corresponding FVC values of 0.46 and 0.50, respectively. The minimum FVC for People’s Park occurs in February, and for Harmony Park it occurs in January, with FVC values of 0.17 and 0.15, respectively. Among the dynamic change in FVC areas at various scales, the areas of bare and highest-coverage exhibit the greatest fluctuations, with the ascending and descending changes and rates of bare and highest-coverage areas generally showing opposite trends. (3) In terms of the spatial-temporal dynamic changes in FVC at pixel scale in urban parks, overall, FVC shows moderate improvement from February-August, and moderate degradation from January-February and from August-December. The degradation and improvement are primarily slight. The most significant improvement in monthly FVC occurs in March-April, with a predominant type of significant improvement in FVC changes. People’s Park and Harmony Park show the most significant degradation in FVC during September-October and October-November, respectively, with a predominant type of significant degradation in FVC changes. During the periods of most significant improvement and degradation in monthly FVC, the spatial distribution of significant improvement and degradation areas primarily occurs in the periphery and middle parts of the parks. FVC in urban parks decreases from January to February and from August to December, while it increases from February to August, with relatively good conditions from June to August. Vegetation optimization should consider: balancing recreational and ecological functions overall, controlling the proportion of bare land, and enhancing the canopy structure of vegetation in low coverage areas or the coverage of hard surfaces; locally increasing the proportion of evergreen plants and moderately increasing planting density. In addition, parks should strengthen management to reduce the impact of flooding and maintain the health of vegetation.","author":"Yichuan Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"33d14edcccccf4e7adcca97a56e7e2a8310bc348e36925560fcf3b8c89962f3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
