{"title":"Effect of electron beam irradiation on glycosylation reaction and structural characterization of whey isolate protein","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13816?af=R","date":1724240605000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Whey protein isolate (WPI) is a high-quality animal protein resource. The modification of WPI through physical, chemical and biological methods can substantially improve the functional properties of proteins. This study investigated the effect of electron beam irradiation (EBI) on the modification of WPI–xylose glycosylation.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The degree of grafting and browning revealed that EBI promoted WPI glycosylation. The maximum emission wavelength of intrinsic fluorescence was red-shifted and the fluorescence intensity was reduced, suggesting that irradiation induced the unfolding of the WPI structure, thereby promoting glycosylation. Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy revealed that the covalent binding of the conjugates occurred on the introduction of the hydrophilic groups, resulting in decreased surface hydrophobicity. When compared with conventional wet-heat glycosylation, irradiation-assisted glycosylation improved the emulsifying activity of WPI from 179.76 ± 0.83 to 277.83 ± 1.44 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>, and the emulsifying and rheological properties improved.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These results confirmed that EBI can increase the degree of WPI glycosylation and improve the functional properties of proteins, thereby laying a theoretical foundation for the further application of WPI. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Linlu Zhang, \nRong Bai, \nShengqi Jiang, \nZiwei Li, \nYa Chen, \nXiang Ye, \nJiangtao Yu, \nWu Ding","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a20f8107dc0fb5cdab0dde30d5a6bb79182f00f916106c73dcd3ffa224faad02","category":"Environment"}
