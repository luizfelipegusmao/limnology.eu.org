{"title":"Exploring Strategies to Market SMEs Activities: The Role of Personality Traits and Travel Motivations towards Tourist Activities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0501/v1","date":1728380341000,"content":"Traditionally, professionals in the tourism sector have been encouraged to segment their market based on socio-demographic variables. However, the multifaceted nature of tourist activity calls for consideration of psychological factors to effectively shape marketing strategies. This study aims to provide insights for tourism industry practitioners by investigating the roles of tourists’ personalities and travel motivations in shaping their activities, and commitment to sustainability in Cumbria, home to UNESCO World Heritage Sites like The Lake District National Park, and Hadrian's Wall. Data was collected using quantitative methods to identify correlations between personality traits, travel motivations, and tourist activities. Additionally, a qualitative focus group with SME representatives from Cumbria provided insights into their understanding of the model. The findings provide significant insights into how the relationship between personality traits, travel motivations and tourist activities benefit tourism SMEs. By comprehending tourist behaviour, SMEs can tailor their offerings to appeal to the right audience, mitigating the adverse effects of overtourism, and therefore do more than allude to the concept of sustainability. Using these insights, SMEs could make informed decisions and create more effective marketing strategies, fostering sustainable practices that benefit both their customers and the long-term viability of their businesses and the destination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eaaa3e3d660cf65621e1ce0e570a4189f4b1c22585033f54425fc744c3b7e9d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
