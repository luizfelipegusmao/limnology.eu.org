{"title":"An Exploration on Z-Number and Its Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0939/v1","date":1720684692000,"content":"For better solving both fuzziness and reliability occurring in practical issues simultaneously, Z-number deserves further exploration under uncertainty environment. Based on the credibility distribution and conversion rules, we define its expected value, variance, and semi-variance, and realize the feasibility of calculation by deriving calculation formulas. Moreover, we delve into three characteristics inherent in symmetrical Z-numbers. The link that followed between the variance and the semi-variance of Z-numbers is discovered and proved. Furthermore, we apply the formulas of expected value and variance on Z-numbers to examples, whose consequences validate our proposed formulas. The findings indicate the significance of our study in applying the expected value and variance of fuzzy sets across diverse fields.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a81dbbef12bf1a3a9d9b1859e5cabe4723822ca272421489c61a8be56c268ea0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
