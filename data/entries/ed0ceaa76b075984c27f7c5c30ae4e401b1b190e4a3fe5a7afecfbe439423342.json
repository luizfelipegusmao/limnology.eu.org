{"title":"Leveraging machine learning to unravel the impact of cadmium stress on goji berry micropropagation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305111","date":1718287200000,"content":"<p>by Musab A. Isak, Taner Bozkurt, Mehmet Tütüncü, Dicle Dönmez, Tolga İzgü, Özhan Şimşek</p>\r\n\r\nThis study investigates the influence of cadmium (Cd) stress on the micropropagation of Goji Berry (<i>Lycium barbarum</i> L.) across three distinct genotypes (ERU, NQ1, NQ7), employing an array of machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gaussian Process (GP), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The primary motivation is to elucidate genotype-specific responses to Cd stress, which poses significant challenges to agricultural productivity and food safety due to its toxicity. By analyzing the impacts of varying Cd concentrations on plant growth parameters such as proliferation, shoot and root lengths, and root numbers, we aim to develop predictive models that can optimize plant growth under adverse conditions. The ML models revealed complex relationships between Cd exposure and plant physiological changes, with MLP and RF models showing remarkable prediction accuracy (R<sup>2</sup> values up to 0.98). Our findings contribute to understanding plant responses to heavy metal stress and offer practical applications in mitigating such stress in plants, demonstrating the potential of ML approaches in advancing plant tissue culture research and sustainable agricultural practices.","author":"Musab A.
