Mortality in &lt; 33 weeks gestational age at birth display global variations across different healthcare units. Objective: This study aims to explore trends in neonatal mortality among infants born preterm in the different units in Latin America and the Caribbean utilizing the EpicLatino Network Database in comparison to Canadian Neonatal Network (CNN) 2022. Materials and Methods: This study focused on an eight-year period, with a particular attention to mortality rates during the pre-pandemic (2015-2019) and pandemic/post pandemic (2020-2022) periods. Survival rates from CNN 2022 were included in the comparison analysis. Logistic regression analysis was confined to the 2020-2022 period. Adjustments were made for factors including gestational age, small for gestational age (SGA), Snape II score, inborn/outborn status, and center. As major malformations could account for mortality differences among units. The incidence of major congenital malformations, as defined by CNN, was compared among deceased patients. Results: A total of 15,454 records from 2015-2019 and 10,711 records from 2020-2022 were scrutinized. Overall, there were no significant differences in mortality rates between the two time periods (p=0.22). Moreover, the originating unit during the 2020-2022 period significantly influenced all statistical computations. Conclusions: Survival rates among infants &lt; 26 weeks of gestation in Latin America and the Caribbean are on an upward trajectory, with the healthcare unit playing a pivotal role in this outcome within the EpicLatino database. Major malformations do not seem to be a significant contributing factor. These findings underscore the imperative of implementing quality improvement initiatives to elevate neonatal care standards in Latin America and the Caribbean.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"985147c970ac7109611e8580e827c209ab902c3a7a8163e6c12b2626b9df4f14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
