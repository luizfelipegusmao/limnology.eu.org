{"title":"Evaluation of Underground Pipelines Inspection Methods: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1833/v1","date":1724664601000,"content":"This paper explores various methods for inspecting gravity pipes. It emphasizes that understanding the initial process of pipe prioritization is crucial before discussing inspection methods. Given the extensive gravity pipeline systems in use today, inspecting all suspected pipelines without prioritization would be extremely costly and time-consuming, especially in a large country like India. Therefore, the paper highlights the importance of using algorithms and analysis tools to prioritize which pipelines need inspection. It also describes innovative inspection techniques, such as wave and sound analysis, which can improve inspection efficiency. The research provides an overview of the pipe inspection process and discusses cost-saving algorithms that can enhance field efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4546b2d3e4b62d5cbba2d2f4b29fa683bc34310e250d03573e46771b20a2ac30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
