{"title":"Identification, characterization and nutritional regulation of fatty acid‐binding protein (fabp) genes by vegetable oils in European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) reared in low water temperatures","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16137?af=R","date":1668758400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Dietary n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs), which are low in vegetable oils (VO), are natural ligands of fatty acid-binding protein (<i>fabp</i>) genes, which function in molecular n-3 HUFAs metabolism in fish. Low water temperature (LWT) also affects fish fatty acid (FA) metabolism. Therefore, in this study, we investigated mRNA expression levels of <i>fabp</i> genes in European seabass (<i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>) reared in LWTs. For this purpose, we cloned and characterized open reading frames of 10 <i>fabp genes</i>. Changes in the expression of <i>fabp</i> genes to VO-based diets for 60 days and fish oil (FO)-based diet for 30 days were determined. The present study's results suggest the following: (1) <i>D. labrax fabp</i> genes are orthologues of vertebrate <i>fabp/FABP</i> genes. (2) <i>fabp1b.1</i>/<i>fabp1b.2</i> and <i>fabp7a</i>/<i>fabp7b</i> are retained in the <i>D. labrax</i> genome most likely because of the subfunctionalization. (3) The variation in tissue-specific expression of <i>fabp10a</i>/<i>fabp10b</i> and <i>fabp11a</i>/<i>fabp11b</i> paralogues also provides evidence of subfunctionalization; however, nutrigenomic results did not support this observation. Therefore, more detailed promoter analyses are needed to better understand their retentions in the <i>D. labrax</i> genome. (4) Feeding <i>D. labrax</i> with a FO-based diet following feeding with VO-based diets is insufficient for molecular FA metabolism recovery. This study is the first report on the characterization and nutritional regulation of <i>fabp</i> genes by dietary FAs in <i>D. labrax</i> reared in LWTs and suggests that transcriptional control of <i>fabp</i> genes by agonists would be helpful to maintain lipid homeostasis, protect fish health and increase fish welfare for sustainable aquaculture production.</p>","author":"Oğuz Taşbozan, \nCelal Erbaş, \nMehtap Bayır, \nErdal Özdemir, \nAbdulkadir Bayır","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"1ee15690a1baad7aa6846d9fc198e7232816acc4ad4ab4cbe437064b0883cbf2","category":"Environment"}
