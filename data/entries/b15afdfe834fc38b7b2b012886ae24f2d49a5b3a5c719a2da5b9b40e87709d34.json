{"title":"Solving Apollonius&rsquo; Problem through Relativity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0716/v1","date":1715352732000,"content":"We solve the problem of Apollonius by applying the Lorentz transformation within the frame- work of special relativity to go to a frame of simultaneity, where the solutions are the circum- center. We transform back to get the solutions in a general frame. We show that the solutions in a general frame are the foci of the ellipse going through the centers of the given 3 circles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b15afdfe834fc38b7b2b012886ae24f2d49a5b3a5c719a2da5b9b40e87709d34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
