An important first step in growing CNTs is a heat treatment in air to oxidize the stainless steel, forming a thin layer of oxide scale (<strong>Figure 1A</strong>) which later catalyzes CNT growth [<a href=\"#ozae044.254-B1\">1</a>]. Understanding the composition of this oxide layer across various preparation times and temperatures allows us to better model CNT growth and choose the ideal parameters for growing CNTs on stainless steel.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c69c5925cc015c6eaf7d7f3c21f7597c9550332a988381ce0ef2eedfbfd97b0e","category":"Environment"}
