{"title":"360o Fusion of the Lumbar Spine Using Flarehawk 9 : A Retrospective Study of 58 Patients Demonstrating Imagistic and Clinical Outcomes with One Year Follow-up","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1505/v1","date":1711437993000,"content":"Background/Objectives:The first attempts of posterior lumbar interbody fusion can be traced back to the 1940s, where their performance was marked by animosity due to high rates of failure. Nowadays, the use of interbody fusion involves a much more complicated consideration of factors such as global alignment, disc height, fusion rates, and operative risk, all combined at once.Our study aims to examine all these effects using Flarehawk 9 as a means of interbody fusion.Materials and methods: A total of 58 patients underwent open posterior lumbar surgery using Flarehawk 9 between September 2021 and February 2023 with a mean follow up of 1 year.The mean age was 59.8 years old ( range between 33 and 79 years old), 36 of them are males while 22 of them are females. The diagnostic groups included spinal canal stenosis (n=40), failed back surgery syndrome-revision surgery (n=5),spondylolisthesis with slip percentage 25% (n=4),recurrent herniated disc (n=7) and adjacent segment disease (n=2). Results: The majority of patients demonstrated remarkable improvement based on ODI scores.The rate of union varied based on the fused levels and whether the patients had previous surgery or not.The amount of lordosis postoperatively is increased by 2Â±0.4 degrees.Conclusions: Even though anterior approaches become more and more popular and advanced nowadays, posterior fusion with interbody cage still remains a safe and effective method to treat various spine surgical pathologies with optimal results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78fa4bb6dcdd1e05a746720b3c66915d498d0f204c7ed91e19cc22a3b917ad5e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
