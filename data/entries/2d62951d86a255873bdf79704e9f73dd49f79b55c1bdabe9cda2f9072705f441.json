{"title":"Poverty, childcare responsibilities, and stigma hinder adolescent mothers from returning to school in a low-income urban informal settlement in Kenya","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307532","date":1721656800000,"content":"<p>by Sheila Mukabana, Benta Abuya, Caroline W. Kabiru, Anthony Idowu Ajayi</p>\r\nBackground <p>While a few studies have examined barriers to school re-entry among adolescent mothers, studies focusing on the experiences of girls in low-income informal settlements are scarce. We examined the factors that hindered parenting girls living in a resource-constrained urban setting from re-enrolling in school.</p> Study setting <p>We conducted the study in Korogocho, a low-income urban informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya.</p> Methods <p>Barriers to school re-entry were documented through inductive thematic analysis of 32 in-depth interviews with pregnant and parenting adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 years (N = 22), parents/guardians (N = 10), and 10 key informant interviews with teachers (N = 4), and community leaders (N = 6).</p> Results <p>Interviewed girls blamed their being out of school on their childcare responsibilities, poverty, stigmatizing and discriminatory attitudes from students and teachers, and withdrawal of parental support. While parents, teachers, and community leaders agreed that poverty and lack of childcare support hindered parenting girls from returning to school, they contended that robust support systems encompassing childcare and financial support, and less hostile school environments constituted facilitators of school re-entry among parenting adolescents.</p> Conclusion <p>While the 2020 National Guidelines for School Re-entry in Kenya seek to deter the exclusion of adolescent mothers from education thereby ensuring retention, transition and completion at all basic education levels, the findings underscore the need for programs that ensure that pregnant and parenting adolescents have the requisite financial, material, and childcare support to facilitate their retention or re-enrollment in school in line with the Guidelines. School administrators and the Ministry of Education should develop and implement interventions that make the school environment less hostile for parenting girls.</p>","author":"Sheila Mukabana","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2d62951d86a255873bdf79704e9f73dd49f79b55c1bdabe9cda2f9072705f441","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
