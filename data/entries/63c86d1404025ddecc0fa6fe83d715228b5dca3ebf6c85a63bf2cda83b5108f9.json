Early detection in young adults is crucial for preventing adverse cardiovascular events. This study investigates the associations between inflammatory indices, lipid biomarkers, and the presence of atherosclerosis in patients aged 18 to 55 years.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 89 participants divided into two groups: 62 patients with documented atherosclerosis (main group) and 27 healthy controls without significant atherosclerosis. Comprehensive data—including demographic information, medication use, imaging results, laboratory parameters, and calculated inflammatory indices (SIRI, SII, AISI, NLR, PLR, MLR)—were collected. Statistical analyses included correlation assessments, group comparisons using the Mann-Whitney U test, logistic regression modeling, feature importance analysis with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and K-means clustering.\nResults: Significant differences were observed between the main and control groups. Patients with atherosclerosis exhibited elevated inflammatory indices (SIRI, NLR, MLR, SII) and lipid profile abnormalities (higher TC and LDL-C, lower HDL-C). Lp(a) and ANGPTL3 levels were significantly higher in the main group (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63c86d1404025ddecc0fa6fe83d715228b5dca3ebf6c85a63bf2cda83b5108f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
