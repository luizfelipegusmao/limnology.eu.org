{"title":"Exploring the Adoption of Blockchain Technology in Supply Chain Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2419/v1","date":1722327462000,"content":"This study investigates the adoption of blockchain technology in supply chain management, focusing on its transformative potential, challenges, and strategic implications. Blockchain, characterized by its decentralized and immutable ledger, offers significant benefits in enhancing transparency, efficiency, and trust among supply chain stakeholders. It enables accurate tracking of products, verification of provenance, and streamlined processes through smart contracts, which reduce the need for intermediaries and minimize operational costs. The research explores various sectors, highlighting how blockchain can address issues of counterfeiting, compliance, and sustainability by providing verifiable information about products' origins and handling. However, the adoption of blockchain is not without challenges. The technological complexity involved in integrating blockchain with existing systems, the need for specialized skills, and concerns over data privacy and security pose significant barriers. Additionally, the lack of regulatory clarity and the high initial costs associated with blockchain infrastructure present further obstacles, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. The study emphasizes the necessity of a cultural shift towards greater openness and collaboration among stakeholders to fully leverage the potential of blockchain. Furthermore, it discusses the environmental impact of blockchain technologies, particularly their energy consumption, and the need for sustainable solutions. The findings suggest that while blockchain holds great promise for transforming supply chain management, careful consideration of the associated challenges is crucial. Future research and industry dialogue will be essential in overcoming these hurdles and achieving widespread blockchain adoption.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9129cd2778715650d1440609257d0fcc3790031641f5e10d9b1506f1e65edc65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
