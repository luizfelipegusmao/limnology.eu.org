Price, Adam P. Arkin</p>\r\n\r\nGenome sequencing has revealed an incredible diversity of bacteria and archaea, but there are no fast and convenient tools for browsing across these genomes. It is cumbersome to view the prevalence of homologs for a protein of interest, or the gene neighborhoods of those homologs, across the diversity of the prokaryotes. We developed a web-based tool, <i>fast</i>.<i>genomics</i>, that uses two strategies to support fast browsing across the diversity of prokaryotes. First, the database of genomes is split up. The main database contains one representative from each of the 6,377 genera that have a high-quality genome, and additional databases for each taxonomic order contain up to 10 representatives of each species. Second, homologs of proteins of interest are identified quickly by using accelerated searches, usually in a few seconds. Once homologs are identified, <i>fast</i>.<i>genomics</i> can quickly show their prevalence across taxa, view their neighboring genes, or compare the prevalence of two different proteins. <i>Fast</i>.<i>genomics</i> is available at https://fast.genomics.lbl.gov.","author":"Morgan N.
