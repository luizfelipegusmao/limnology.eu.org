{"title":"Anatomical and Imaging Aspects of the Hip Joint of the Giant Anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1976/v1","date":1714471120000,"content":"This study evaluated the hip joints of the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) through imaging and macroscopic analyses and proposed a surgical approach for arthrotomy procedures in this species. The study used four samples fixed in 10% formaldehyde and six thawed carcasses. Radiographic and ultrasound examinations and anatomical dissection allowed the proposal of a surgical approach for the hip joint. The radiographic evaluation occurred with frog-legged ventrodorsal and lateral projections, and the ultrasound enabled joint soft tissue assessment. The articular elements represented similar characteristics to other domestic species. Some anatomical particularities of muscle groups were the intermuscular septum between the tensor fasciae latae and superficial gluteus muscles at the level of the greater trochanter of the femur, which provides lateral access to the femoral head and neck more conservatively. In conclusion, the anatomical particularities of radiographic positioning, the clinical applications of joint ultrasound, and the arrangement of muscle groups must be considered when evaluating and surgically accessing the hip joint of the giant anteater.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6518701f57722d11ad076bd31cfa765244279c5e6e0d67dba3e94586ce31894b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
