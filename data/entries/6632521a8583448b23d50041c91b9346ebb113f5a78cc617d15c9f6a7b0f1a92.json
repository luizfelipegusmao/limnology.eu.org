{"title":"Corporate restructuring and firm performance in Vietnam: The moderating role of digital transformation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303491","date":1716213600000,"content":"<p>by Duc Hong Vo, Anh The Vo, Co Thi-Huyen Dinh, Ngoc Phu Tran</p>\r\n\r\nIn the digital age, firms should continually innovate and adapt to remain competitive and enhance performance. Innovation and adaptation require firms to take a holistic approach to their corporate structuring to ensure efficiency and effectiveness to stay competitive. This study examines how corporate restructuring impacts firm performance in Vietnam. We then investigate the moderating role of digital transformation in the corporate restructuringâ€“firm performance nexus. We use content analysis, with a focus on particular terms, including \"digitalization,\" \"big data,\" \"cloud computing,\" \"blockchain,\" and \"information technology\" for 11 years, from 2011 to 2021. The frequency index from these keywords is developed to proxy the digital transformation for the Vietnamese listed firms. A final sample includes 118 Vietnamese listed firms with sufficient data for the analysis using the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach. The results indicate that corporate restructuring, including financial, portfolio, and operational restructuring, has a negative effect on firm performance in Vietnam. Digital transformation also negatively affects firm performance. However, corporate restructuring implemented in conjunction with digital transformation improves the performance of Vietnamese listed firms. These findings largely remain unchanged across various robustness analyses.","author":"Duc Hong Vo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6632521a8583448b23d50041c91b9346ebb113f5a78cc617d15c9f6a7b0f1a92","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
