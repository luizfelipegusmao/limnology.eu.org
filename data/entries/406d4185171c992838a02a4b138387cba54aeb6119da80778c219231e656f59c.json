{"title":"Micromechanics for Polymer Matrix Laminated Composites: A Literature Review of Fundamental Models, Advances and a Trend Analysis for Future Researches","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.1284/v2","date":1726841821000,"content":"Due to satisfactory mechanical properties, low specific weight and other advantages, a substantial utilization of laminated structural composites in many components and equipments of several industry sectors, especially in the past two decades, has been made. This class of materials has a good potential to be an important ally to support scientists and engineers with the main current world challenge: an energy transition process that must occur with sustainability, eco-friendly materials and based on an efficient reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, a microanalysis (scale length: 10Î¼m to 1mm) of mechanical behavior that considers the multiphase characteristics, at leastwise a matrix and a reinforcement phase, of this kind of composites must be explored, i. e., a heterogeneous material is assumed to predict, for example, the effective tensors of stiffness or compliance by a homogenization process, modeling to damage analyses, studies about progressive delamination and other specific aspects of a composite can be previously investigated using micromechanical approaches. Therefore, the understanding of fundamental micromechanics as well as some advanced models are essential to apply these materials in structural industry components. In this sense, this literature review is designed to investigate and analize intrinsic physical hypothesis and theories behind the main basic and advanced models of polymer laminated composite micromechanics expanding possibilities to the development of more accurate approximations and showing future perspectives to the topic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"406d4185171c992838a02a4b138387cba54aeb6119da80778c219231e656f59c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
