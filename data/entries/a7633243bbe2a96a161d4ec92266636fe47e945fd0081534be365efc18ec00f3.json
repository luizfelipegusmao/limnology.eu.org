{"title":"134 Does inclusion of high oleic soybeans in a swine finishing ration influence lipid oxidation and consumer taste panel preference?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/51/7664815?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to determine if a swine finishing ration that included soybeans with greater concentration of oleic acid will have an impact on lipid oxidation and palatability of pork. Crossbred pigs [n = 72; initial body weight (BW) = 78 ± 9 kg] were blocked by BW, sex, and distributed within 18 pens. Each pen was randomly assigned to 1 of 3 experimental diets: a control soybean-meal (CTRL), extruded conventional soybean (CONV), and extruded high oleic acid soybean (TRU). Six different harvest groups (n = 12/group) were created across treatments to ensure uniformity of final BW. Therefore, experimental diets were offered to animals for 34, 37, 41, 42, 48, or 50 d, until all pigs reached 118 ± 5 kg. Carcasses were harvested, and chilled (2°C) for 24 h, before fabricating one 2.5 cm chop from the 11<sup>th</sup> rib of the right carcass side. The chops were vacuum packaged, aged for 7 d at 2 <sup>o</sup>C, and frozen (-18 <sup>o</sup>C) for later sensory analysis. Pork chops were thawed and cooked to 71 <sup>o</sup>C peak internal temperature (AMSA sensory guidelines) and fed to 115 consumers that rated overall liking, flavor, tenderness, juiciness, and presence of off flavors using hedonic scales. Also, a 50 g sample was obtained from each loin at the 12<sup>th</sup> rib, aged for 7 d and frozen at -80 <sup>o</sup>C for evaluation of malondialdehyde (MDA) as indicator of lipid oxidation. Subcutaneous fat samples were obtained from the first thoracic vertebra, frozen, and saved for fatty acid analysis. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS where diet was the main effect, while pen and breed were random effects. Repeated measures were used to analyze the consumer panel. Differences were considered significant at <span>P</span> ≤ 0.05 with pen as experimental unit. There were no significant differences (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) for consumer perception of overall like, pork flavor, and presence of off flavors. Experimental diets impacted the perception of juiciness and tenderness (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), where CONV was perceived as juicier and more tender than CTRL and TRU. As expected, diet affected the fatty acid profile of subcutaneous fat (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001), with TRU having the greatest percentage for oleic (43.9 %), CONV the greatest percentage for linoleic and linolenic (17.8 and 1.3 % respectively), and CTRL for saturated fatty acids (34.5 %). Surprisingly, the lipid oxidation was not affected by the diet (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). These results indicate that feeding extruded high oleic soybeans during the finishing period can modify the fatty acid profile in pork by improving the percentage of unsaturated fatty acids, so these soybeans can be considered as an alternative to improve nutritional value of pork without increasing the lipid oxidation or affecting the consumers acceptability.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"a7633243bbe2a96a161d4ec92266636fe47e945fd0081534be365efc18ec00f3","category":"Environment"}
