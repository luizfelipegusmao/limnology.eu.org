{"title":"A Focus on the Metabolic Dysfunction of Proximal Tubule Cells in Dent Disease Type 1","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0048/v1","date":1722506523000,"content":"Dent disease type 1 is a rare inherited renal disorder affecting mainly young males, generally leading to end-stage renal failure and for which there is no cure. It is caused by inactivating mutations in the gene encoding ClC-5, a 2Cl-/H+ exchanger found on endosomes in the renal proximal tubule. This transporter participates in reabsorbing all filtered plasma proteins which justifies why proteinuria is commonly observed when ClC-5 is defective. In the context of Dent disease type 1, a proximal tubule dedifferentiation was shown to be accompanied by a dysfunctional cell metabolism. However, the exact mechanisms linking such alterations to chronic kidney disease are still unclear. In this review, we gather knowledge from several Dent disease type 1 models to summarize the current hypotheses generated to understand the progression of this disorder. We also highlight some urinary biomarkers for Dent disease type 1 suggested in different studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9b3b118bf8d886097d07caacd065aff6d7613d963804ae8a6eda723a9e7a761","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
