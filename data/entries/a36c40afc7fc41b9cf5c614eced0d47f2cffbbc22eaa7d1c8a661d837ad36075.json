Previous studies of meristics in <i>Salvelinus</i> have focused mostly on individual populations. We collated data from 456 populations/systems across the North American and Russian Arctic and sub-Arctic, and found that counts of pyloric caeca and gill rakers differed consistently between fish visually and/or genetically identified as Arctic char and Dolly Varden across their distributional ranges.</p>","author":"Spencer Y.
