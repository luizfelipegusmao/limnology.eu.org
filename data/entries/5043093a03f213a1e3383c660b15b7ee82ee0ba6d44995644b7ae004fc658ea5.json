Since then, the technology has gained interest, especially in research fields demanding ultra-high throughput acquisition of image data. At the forefront is the field of Connectomics in Neurobiology which aims at reconstructing large volumes of the brain to understand its structure and function [<a href=\"#ozae044.327-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.327-B3\">3</a>].
