{"title":"Soluble hemp protein–xylose conjugates fabricated by high‐pressure homogenization and pH‐shifting treatments","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13788?af=R","date":1722954319000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The process of Maillard conjugation occurs with plant proteins and sugars and can be influenced by several factors, such as processing time, pH, and shear force. By utilizing cavitation processes such as high-pressure homogenization (HPH) and pH-shifting, it is possible to regulate the degree of grafting, functional characteristics, and structural changes in the formation of conjugates. The present study aimed to improve the hemp protein concentrate (HPC) through two different conjugation techniques: HPH and pH-shifting-assisted processes.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The best conjugation conditions for the conventional method were identified as a 1:2 HPC to xylose ratio, a pH of 10, and 3 h of treatment at 70 °C. The use of HPH and pH 12-shifting methods resulted in a remarkable 2.5-fold increase in grafting degree, requiring less processing time. Fourier transform infrared spectra confirmed the formation of conjugates. Conjugates produced through HPH with pH 12-shifting (MPHX) transformed into soluble glycoproteins with a particle size of 74 nm. MPHX solubility increased by 5.7-fold than HPC, reaching 85.7%, with a more negatively charged surface at −32.4 mV. Microimages showed cracked and sharp forms for conjugated proteins compared to untreated HPC. Additionally, MPHX conjugates demonstrated superior properties in emulsion stability, foaming capacity, and antioxidant activity compared to HPC and classical conjugates.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The use of HPH and pH-shifting-assisted Maillard conjugation was highly effective in enhancing the functional attributes of hemp protein conjugates. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Gulsah Karabulut, \nRagya Kapoor, \nHao Feng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"221c5ed6700304030faa1a7d12985cc30a8587f5204e04f90d65f3f53fc663af","category":"Environment"}
