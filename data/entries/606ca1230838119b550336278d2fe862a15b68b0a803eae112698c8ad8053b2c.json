Li-ion battery is replaced the conventional energy storage system, it has suitable for transportation, aerospace, defense, and electronics industries due to their high energy density, long lifespan, fast charging time, and lightweight properties. However, Li-ion batteries take the risk of explosion and fire due to the complicated reaction of lithium growth and liquid electrolyte [<a href=\"#ozae044.875-B2\">2</a>]. By replacing the solid-state electrolyte with a liquid electrolyte, the accident can be reduced, and for this reason, the solid-state electrolytes are interested in [<a href=\"#ozae044.875-B3\">3</a>]. The lithium growth influences battery capacitance and still occurs in the electrolyte interface caused by poor interface connection with the cathode and anode [<a href=\"#ozae044.875-B4\">4</a>]. This phenomenon also makes it to difficult get accurate measurements using charge beam experiments [<a href=\"#ozae044.875-B5\">5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"606ca1230838119b550336278d2fe862a15b68b0a803eae112698c8ad8053b2c","category":"Environment"}
