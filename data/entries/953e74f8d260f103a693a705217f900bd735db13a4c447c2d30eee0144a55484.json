{"title":"Generalized Bayesian Inference Study Based on Type-II Censored Data from Pareto Distribution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0029/v1","date":1725260050000,"content":"This paper investigates generalized Bayesian (GB) inference in the context of a one-parameter Pareto distribution. The study focuses on the derivation of generalized Bayesian estimators (GBE) and generalized empirical Bayesian estimators (GEBE) for the parameters of the Pareto distribution using type II censored data. In addition, the study investigates a one-sample prediction approach to examine generalized Bayesian prediction (GBP) and generalized empirical Bayesian prediction (GEBP). To evaluate the performance of these estimation and prediction methods, Monte Carlo simulations were performed comparing GBE with GEBE and GBP with GEBP for different parameter values and learning rate parameters (LRP).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"953e74f8d260f103a693a705217f900bd735db13a4c447c2d30eee0144a55484","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
