{"title":"Calibration and Modelling of the Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament for Diabetic Foot Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1560/v1","date":1713936156000,"content":"Diabetic foot is a serious complication that poses significant risks for diabetic people. The resulting reduction in protective sensitivity in the plantar region requires early detection to prevent the imminent ulceration and amputation. The primary method employed for evaluating this sensitivity loss is the 10 g f Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test, commonly used as a first-line procedure. However, the lack of calibration in existing devices often introduces decision errors due to unreliable feedback. In this paper, a new equipment designed to address these limitations and enhance the assessment of the sensitivity loss using the 10 g f monofilament is introduced. The proposed system automates metrological verification and evaluation processes, ensuring accurate and reliable results. Furthermore, it simulates the practitionerâ€™s procedure, serving both as a valuable training tool and a means to provide force-feedback information. An analytical model of the monofilament buckling and deflection is also presented. The obtained results showed that the tested monofilaments had a  very high error compared to the 10 g f declared by the manufacturers. It is aimed, by introducing this  advanced equipment, to improve the precision and reliability of assessing the sensitivity loss. The  integration of automated verification, simulation capabilities, and precise measurements shows great  promise for diabetic patients, reducing the likelihood of adverse outcomes such as ulceration and amputation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5bfe436a536c5185cc8f0b8e212368708345ab15eea9fdff4fbbb82da6d95e4b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
