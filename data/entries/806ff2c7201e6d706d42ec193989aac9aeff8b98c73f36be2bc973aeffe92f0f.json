{"title":"Plasma taurine level is linked to symptom burden and clinical outcomes in post-COVID condition","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304522","date":1717596000000,"content":"<p>by Mobin Khoramjoo, Kaiming Wang, Karthik Srinivasan, Mahmoud Gheblawi, Rupasri Mandal, Simon Rousseau, David Wishart, Vinay Prasad, Lawrence Richer, Angela M. Cheung, Gavin Y. Oudit</p>\r\nBackground <p>A subset of individuals (10–20%) experience post-COVID condition (PCC) subsequent to initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, which lacks effective treatment. PCC carries a substantial global burden associated with negative economic and health impacts. This study aims to evaluate the association between plasma taurine levels with self-reported symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with PCC.</p> Methods and findings <p>We analyzed the plasma proteome and metabolome of 117 individuals during their acute COVID-19 hospitalization and at the convalescence phase six-month post infection. Findings were compared with 28 age and sex-matched healthy controls. Plasma taurine levels were negatively associated with PCC symptoms and correlated with markers of inflammation, tryptophan metabolism, and gut dysbiosis. Stratifying patients based on the trajectories of plasma taurine levels during six-month follow-up revealed a significant association with adverse clinical events. Increase in taurine levels during the transition to convalescence were associated with a reduction in adverse events independent of comorbidities and acute COVID-19 severity. In a multivariate analysis, increased plasma taurine level between acute and convalescence phase was associated with marked protection from adverse clinical events with a hazard ratio of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.05–0.35; p&lt;0.001).</p> Conclusions <p>Taurine emerges as a promising predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic target in PCC. Taurine supplementation has already demonstrated clinical benefits in various diseases and warrants exploration in large-scale clinical trials for alleviating PCC.</p>","author":"Mobin Khoramjoo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"806ff2c7201e6d706d42ec193989aac9aeff8b98c73f36be2bc973aeffe92f0f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
