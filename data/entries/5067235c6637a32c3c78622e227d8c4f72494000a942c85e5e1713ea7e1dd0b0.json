The Fermatean fuzzy set theory possesses remarkable capability in capturing imprecision due to its capacity to accommodate complex and ambiguous problem descriptions. This paper presents the study of the concepts of dynamic ordered weighted aggregation operators in the context of Fermatean fuzzy environment. In numerous practical decision making scenarios, the term \"dynamic\" frequently denotes the capability of obtaining decision-relevant data at various time intervals. In this study, we introduce two novel aggregation operators: Fermatean fuzzy dynamic ordered weighted averaging and geometric operators. We investigate the attributes of these operators in detail, offering a comprehensive description of their salient features. We present a step-by-step mathematical algorithm for decision making scenarios in the context of proposed methodologies. In addition, we highlight the significance of these approaches by presenting the solution to the decision making problem and determining the most effective big data analytics platform for YouTube data analysis. Finally, we perform a thorough comparative analysis to assess the effectiveness of the suggested approaches in comparison to a variety of existing techniques.","author":"Dilshad Alghazzawi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5067235c6637a32c3c78622e227d8c4f72494000a942c85e5e1713ea7e1dd0b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
