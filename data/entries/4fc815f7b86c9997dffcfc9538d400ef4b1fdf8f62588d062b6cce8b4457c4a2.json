However, &gt;50% of CD19-CAR-T-treated patients experience progressive disease mainly due to antigen escape and low persistence. Clinical prognosis is heavily influenced by CAR-T cell function and systemic cytokine toxicities. Furthermore, it remains a challenge to efficiently, cost-effectively, and consistently manufacture clinically relevant numbers of virally engineered CAR-T cells. Using a highly efficient <i>piggyBac</i> transposon-based vector, <i>Quantum pBac</i>™ (<i>qPB</i>), we developed a virus-free cell-engineering system for development and production of multiplex CAR-T therapies. Here, we demonstrate <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> that consistent, robust and functional CD20/CD19 dual-targeted CAR-T stem cell memory (CAR-T<sub>SCM</sub>) cells can be efficiently produced for clinical application using <i>qPB</i>™. In particular, we showed that <i>qPB</i>™-manufactured CAR-T cells from cancer patients expanded efficiently, rapidly eradicated tumors, and can be safely controlled via an iCasp9 suicide gene-inducing drug. Therefore, the simplicity of manufacturing multiplex CAR-T cells using the <i>qPB</i>™ system has the potential to improve efficacy and broaden the accessibility of CAR-T therapies.","author":"Peter S.
