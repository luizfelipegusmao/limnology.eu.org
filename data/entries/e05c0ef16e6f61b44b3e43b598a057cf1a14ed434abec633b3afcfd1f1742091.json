{"title":"Examining the Correlations between the Visceral Adiposity Index and Various Anthropometric, Biochemical, and Insulin Resistance Parameters in Brazilians: Findings from a Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0699/v1","date":1715353000000,"content":"This cross-sectional, analytical, and observational study aimed to investigate the relationship between Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) and anthropometric, biochemical, and insulin resistance (IR) parameters in Brazilians at risk of CVD. Biochemical parameters and anthropometric measurements were evaluated. The Pearson test was used to assess the correlation between VAI and anthropometric, biochemical, and IR parameters, with a predefined significance level of 5%. The analyzed sample consisted of 88 men and 72 women, with an average age of 58.78±13.48. VAI revealed noteworthy and positive correlations with all anthropometric parameters assessed (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Furthermore, significant positive associations were noted between VAI and total cholesterol in women (p=0.0064), glycemia in men (p=0.0105), and LDL-c (p&amp;lt;0.01) and triglycerides in both genders (p˂0.0001). A significant negative association was observed between VAI and HDL-c in both genders (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Notably, the correlation between VAI and total cholesterol in men, glycemia in women, and CRP in both genders was not found to be significant. However, a significant relationship between VAI and IR parameters was observed in both sexes (p&amp;lt;0.05). The results obtained from our study suggest that VAI functions as a simple and non-intrusive instrument, demonstrating significant effectiveness in identifying metabolic changes primarily associated with adipose tissue dysfunction, particularly dyslipidemia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e05c0ef16e6f61b44b3e43b598a057cf1a14ed434abec633b3afcfd1f1742091","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
