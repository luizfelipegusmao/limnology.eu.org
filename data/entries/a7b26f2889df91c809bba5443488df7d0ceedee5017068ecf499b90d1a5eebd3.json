{"title":"The secret of self-fertilizing plants: NIN-NAD1's role in symbiotic nitrogen fixation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4291/7738353?rss=1","date":1724198400000,"content":"<span>Imagine if crops could naturally fertilize themselves, eliminating the need for synthetic fertilizers and revolutionizing agriculture. This possibility hinges on some plantsâ€™ ability to engage in nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with bacteria (<a href=\"#koae237-B3\">Jhu and Oldroyd 2023</a>; <a href=\"#koae237-B2\">Huisman and Geurts 2019</a>). Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) is primarily found in the nitrogen-fixing clade (NFC) of plants, which includes species from the orders Fabales, Cucurbitales, Fagales, and Rosales (<a href=\"#koae237-B2\">Huisman and Geurts 2019</a>). So far, SNF has 2 forms: rhizobial symbiosis in legumes and actinorhizal symbiosis in various nonlegume NFC species. Both types originated from a common ancestor over 100 million years ago and involve housing bacteria within specialized organs called nodules (<a href=\"#koae237-B8\">Werner et al. 2014</a>). Genomic analyses suggest a predisposition for nodulation in the NFC's common ancestor (<a href=\"#koae237-B1\">Griesmann et al. 2018</a>; <a href=\"#koae237-B10\">Zhang et al. 2024</a>), but direct genetic evidence remains sparse. The central question in the field is: What are the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying SNF in NFC plants?</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"a7b26f2889df91c809bba5443488df7d0ceedee5017068ecf499b90d1a5eebd3","category":"Environment"}
