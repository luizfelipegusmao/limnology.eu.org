{"title":"Moyamoya Disease: Current Knowledge and Future Directions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0527/v1","date":1725621137000,"content":"Background and Purpose: Moyamoya disease is a rare cerebrovascular disorder characterized by stenosis of the carotid arteries and the formation of collateral vessels at the base of the brain. While advances have been made in understanding its genetics, diagnostic criteria, and treatment strategies, further research is needed. The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize current knowledge on Moyamoya disease and identify areas for future study. Materials and Methods: A literature search of databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted. Search terms included \"Moyamoya disease\" and related terms. Only English articles were reviewed, with no date restrictions. Relevant data was extracted and synthesized.  Results: Key findings indicate that genetic factors such as RNF213 variants play an important role in disease susceptibility. Imaging modalities such as MRI and CT angiography are crucial for diagnosis. Surgical revascularization shows superior outcomes compared to medical management for ischemic and hemorrhagic presentations. However, optimal treatment for asymptomatic cases remains unclear. Neurocognitive and psychiatric sequelae can negatively impact quality of life. Promising research directions include investigating ethnic differences, developing biomarkers, and exploring novel therapeutics targeting molecular pathways. Conclusions: In summary, comprehension of Moyamoya disease has significantly progressed but gaps remain regarding treatment of certain populations and underlying mechanisms. Further research addressing these areas can aid in developing personalized care approaches and new interventions to improve patient outcomes","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"616871f7ef176a2853e6e2a0bc170848c809c7f0cc634ee3e0d4a45c35f639b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
