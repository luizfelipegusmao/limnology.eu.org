{"title":"Disentangling the Complex Effects of Seasonal Drought, Floor Mass, and Roots on Soil Microbial Biomass in a Subtropical Moist Forest","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0915/v1","date":1728640698000,"content":"Severe seasonal droughts driven by global climate change significantly alter the cycling of carbon and nutrients in forest ecosystems through disturbing plant physiology and phenology, soil physicochemical properties, and soil microbial activity. While, the investigation into the impacts of floor mass and plant roots on soil microbial biomass within the context of recurrent seasonal droughts is still rare. To investigate the environmental determinants governing soil microbial biomass with the escalating severity of seasonal droughts, we conducted a study on soil microbial biomass in a comprehensive block experiment, which was manipulated to explore the interplay between floor mass and plant roots contributions, crossed with a factorial irrigation treatment, in a montane subtropical moist evergreen broad–leaved forest of southwestern China. Within control and watered plots, we respectively established four experimental subplots with plant roots and floor mass included (R+F+), plant roots included but floor mass excluded (R+F−), plant roots excluded but floor mass included (R−F+), and plant roots and floor mass excluded (R−F−) from June 2019 to May 2023. The study results revealed that soil microbial biomass as well as soil moisture, floor mass, and plant roots showed an apparent single–hump modal within one year. In the comparative analysis of soil microbial biomass fluctuation amplitudes across control and watered plots, a discernible disparity was observed, indicating that significant differences in microbial biomass dynamics between the respective experimental conditions. The pooled data revealed a statistically significant influence of seasonal drought, floor mass, plant roots, and their reciprocal interactions on the soil microbial biomass, highlighting these factors as pivotal determinants of microbial community dynamics. This study elucidates the interactive regulatory mechanisms by which seasonal drought, floor mass, and plant roots collectively modulate soil microbial biomass within tropical and subtropical forests, offering insights into the complex ecological processes governing microbial community dynamics. This interactive regulation might influence the trajectory of plant species and soil microbial communities, facilitating their adaptive development and evolutionary responses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f1e0fc406ac78717be56f660ed4c31d7a3aeed651af90af26dce33ced56e565","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
