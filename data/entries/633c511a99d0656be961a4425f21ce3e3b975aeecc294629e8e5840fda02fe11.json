{"title":"Correlation Study between TV Viewing Patterns and Cognitive Function, Depression, and Activities of Daily Living in Older Individuals Living Alone","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0441/v1","date":1723012282000,"content":"With an aging population, the prevalence of geriatric diseases is increasing, especially among older individuals who live alone. This study investigates the potential of using TV viewing patterns to detect these diseases by analyzing variables such as daily average viewing time, peak viewing hours, and channel-switching behaviors. Significant correlations between TV viewing patterns and early indicators of geriatric diseases (depression, activities of daily living (ADL) performance, and cognitive function) were found. The correlations between the Korean form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (KGDS) and daily average viewing time and excessive channel switching were 0.320 and 0.308, respectively. The Korean version of the Modified Barthel Index (KMBI) showed correlations of -0.313 with daily average viewing time and -0.352 with excessive channel switching. Participants were divided into groups based on scores, and significant differences in peak viewing hours were observed among the different groups. The Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-K) groups showed significant differences at 3, 4, and 5 PM. The KGDS and KMBI groups showed significant differences at 8 PM and midnight and 1 AM and 2 AM, respectively. These findings suggest that TV viewing patterns can serve as effective early diagnostic indicators for geriatric diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"633c511a99d0656be961a4425f21ce3e3b975aeecc294629e8e5840fda02fe11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
