{"title":"A novel methionine nanoparticle in broiler chickens: Bioavailability and requirements","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302230","date":1713362400000,"content":"<p>by Mahmoud Ghazaghi, Mehravar Mehri, Morteza Asghari-Moghadam, Mehran Mehri</p>\r\n\r\nThis bioassay evaluated the bioavailability (RBV) of a novel nanoparticle of methionine (nano-Met) relative to <sub>DL</sub>-methionine (DL-Met), and estimated methionine requirements for both sources in starting broilers. Five supplemental levels (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25% of diet) of DL-Met or nano-Met were added to a basal diet containing 0.35% standardized ileal digestible (SID) methionine to create 11 experimental diets, including a basal diet and 10 experimental diets containing 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.55, and 0.60% SID-Met, respectively. A total of 825 one-day-old male Ross 308 birds were randomly assigned to 11 treatments with 5 pen replicates and 15 birds each. Body weight gain (BWG), breast meat yield (BMY), and thigh meat yield (TMY) increased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) while feed conversion ratio (FCR) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in meat samples decreased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) with increasing dietary methionine. Based on the slope-ratio method, the RBV of nano-Met relative to DL-Met for BWG, FCR, and TMY were 102 (48–155%; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.71), 134 (68–201%; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77), and 110% (27–193%; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.55), respectively. Considering the statistical accuracy of the spline models, the estimated values of DL-Met for maximum BWG and nano-Met for maximum TMY were 0.578% and 0.561%, respectively, which were statistically higher than those recommended for commercial settings. The highest effect size of supplemental methionine was on MDA (ƞ<sup>2</sup>p = 0.924), followed by FCR (ƞ<sup>2</sup>p = 0.578), BMY (ƞ<sup>2</sup>p = 0.575), BWG (ƞ<sup>2</sup>p = 0.430), and TMY (ƞ<sup>2</sup>p = 0.332), suggesting the potent antioxidant properties of methionine. Our findings suggest that reducing the particle size of DL-Met to nanoparticles could be a promising strategy to enhance the efficiency of methionine supplementation in broilers, an idea that requires further investigation in future research.","author":"Mahmoud Ghazaghi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4e12a9ceff58166951036b084f6bb6490ea9530e5af4a52b721330e87060d51e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
