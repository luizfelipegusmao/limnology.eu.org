{"title":"Whole genome resequencing of sablefish at the northern end of their range reveals genetic panmixia and large putative inversions","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/6/1096/7687945?rss=1","date":1717545600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Sablefish (<span>Anoplopoma fimbria</span>) are a highly mobile species that support important commercial fisheries in the North Pacific Ocean. Information on the genetic stock structure of sablefish is vital for constructing management strategies that ensure the long-term viability of the species. Most previous genetic studies on sablefish have found panmixia throughout the majority of their range, but a recent study suggested that a population structure may exist. Here, we use low-coverage whole genome resequencing to investigate genetic structure in the northern end of the species’ range (from Washington State, USA to the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, AK, USA). Additionally, we reanalyzed an existing genomic dataset containing 2661 markers to test specific hypotheses about genetic structure by sex. Genome resequencing data from 119 individuals screened at 7 110 228 markers revealed no evidence of population structure, and reanalysis of the existing genomic dataset supported the same conclusion. Differentiation across the genome was largely driven by variation at two putative inversions located ∼1 megabase apart, which did not display any signals of geographic differentiation. Our study further supports the conclusion of genetic panmixia in sablefish throughout its northern range.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"b59ff5c26d3bfb07811d31aef3166ee4315f046d1ce56b18976ec5cbb2a4293c","category":"Environment"}
