{"title":"VacStent as an Innovative Approach in the Treatment of Anastomotic Insufficiencies and Leakages in the Gastrointestinal Tract &ndash; Review and Outlook","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1876/v1","date":1719401493000,"content":"Anastomotic insufficiencies are severe complications of abdominal surgery, often leading to pro-longed hospitalization, serious tissue inflammation, even sepsis and the need for recurrent sur-gery. Current non-surgical treatments such as self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) and endoscopic vacuum therapy (EVT) have limitations, including stent migration or perforation. This review evaluates the effectiveness of the VacStent GITM, a novel medical device combining SEMS and negative-pressure wound therapy in treating gastrointestinal leaks. Data were gathered from four prospective studies and compared with existing treatments. Studies on the VacStent GITM applica-tion demonstrate technical success and competitive closure rates in upper gastrointestinal leaks, with minimal complications reported. Comparative analyses with SEMS and EVT reveal prom-ising and most importantly equally good outcomes while maintaining the possibility for sus-tained enteral nutrition and reducing stent migration risk. The VacStent GITM presents a promis-ing alternative to current non-surgical treatments. Ongoing research aims to validate its efficacy in lower gastrointestinal leaks and establish its role in leak management comprehensively. Fur-ther investigation is necessary to confirm these findings and optimize treatment protocols. Future usages of the VacStent GITM in colonic anastomotic insufficiencies promise an effective approach and might be able to lower the rates of necessary implementations of a stoma.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59c3fc1c577fec59ae8ad80883870580156574b938ee318f56e3795f02e1bf6d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
