{"title":"Exploring Genetic Factors Associated with Tapeworm Resistance in Central Anatolian Merino Sheep via GWAS Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0494/v1","date":1725586864000,"content":"Gastrointestinal parasite (GIP) infections pose significant challenges in pasture-based sheep farming, leading to economic losses and welfare concerns. This study aimed to uncover the ge-netic basis of resistance to tapeworm (Monezia spp.) infections in Central Anatolian Merino (CAM) sheep and explore the immunogenetic mechanisms underlying this resistance. Ge-nome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted between tapeworm egg burden and ge-nomic data from 227 CAM lambs. Thirteen significant SNPs were identified, with five surpassing the genome-wide threshold and eight exceeding the chromosome-wide threshold. Functional annotation revealed associations with genes involved in immune function, notably CD79A and MAP3K7. CD79A, integral to B-cell activation and antibody production, plays a key role in the immune response against parasitic infections. Its interaction with helminth-derived proteins modulates B-cell function, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. MAP3K7, a central regulator of immune signaling pathways, modulates host responses to helminth infections by influencing NF-ÎºB activity. Additionally, it regulates macrophage function in bacterial infec-tions, showcasing its versatility in mediating immune responses against diverse pathogens. From a practical perspective, the findings of the current research underscore the potential of in-tegrating genomic information into breeding programs to bolster disease resilience in livestock populations for sustainable production purposes. However, further research is needed to eluci-date the functional significance of identified SNPs and associated genes. Functional studies and multi-omic approaches may provide a comprehensive understanding of host-parasite interac-tions. This study underscores the potential of genomic approaches in combating parasitic dis-eases and promoting sustainable agriculture in sheep production systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe73719b5a7a3240cf449be497e29017eb503f6ec307d512ff2380993f368b72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
