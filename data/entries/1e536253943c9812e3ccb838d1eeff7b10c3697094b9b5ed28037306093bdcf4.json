{"title":"Altered Functional Connectivity during Mild Transient Respiratory Impairment Induced by a Resistive Load","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1288/v1","date":1711026614000,"content":"Background: Previous neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions related to respiratory motor control and perception. However, little is known about the resting-state functional connectivity (FC) associated with respiratory impairment. We aimed to determine the FC involved in mild respiratory impairment without changing the saturation of percutaneous oxygen. Methods: We obtained resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 36 healthy volunteers during normal respiration and mild respiratory impairment induced by resistive load (effort breathing). ROI-to-ROI and seed-to-voxel analyses were performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 and the CONN toolbox. Results: Compared to normal respiration, effort breathing activated FCs within and between the sensory perceptive area of respiration (the postcentral gyrus, anterior insular cortex (AInsula), and anterior cingulate cortex) and visual cortex (the visual occipital, occipital pole (OP), and occipital fusiform gyrus). Graph theoretical analysis showed strong centrality in the visual cortex. A significant positive correlation was observed between the dyspnoea score (modified Borg scale) and FC between the left AInsula and right OP. Conclusions: These results suggested that the FCs within the respiratory sensory area via the network hub may be neural mechanisms underlying effort breathing and modified Borg scale scores.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e536253943c9812e3ccb838d1eeff7b10c3697094b9b5ed28037306093bdcf4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
