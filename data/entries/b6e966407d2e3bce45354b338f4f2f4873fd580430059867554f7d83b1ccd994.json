{"title":"MsDD: A novel NDN producer mobility support scheme based on multi-satellite data depot","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310379","date":1726149600000,"content":"<p>by Zhiguo Liu, Qing Zou, Lin Wang, Zhengxia Liu</p>\r\n\r\nThe Named Data Networking (NDN) is currently an important future network framework, and the mobility issue of producers within NDN is a primary challenge. However, in environments characterized by frequent producers mobility, traditional producer mobility support schemes still encounter issues such as excessive consumer delays and interest packet loss. With the development of The 6th generation communication technology (6G), integrating ground networks with satellites has emerged as a potential solution to address the aforementioned problems. In this paper, we propose an NDN producer mobility support scheme based on multi-satellite data depot, named MsDD. The proposed scheme proactively caches producer data into a data depot built on a low-earth orbit satellite constellation to minimize the impact of NDN producer mobility on network performance. We design data depot construction strategy, in-network caching strategy, and routing strategy based on forwarding hint to facilitate effective communication in satellite networks. Experimental results using ndnSIM demonstrate that compared with other existing schemes, MsDD can effectively shield the impact of producer mobility on consumer delay, delivery ratio, and signaling overhead, and MsDD has a clear advantage in terms of consumer delay and delivery ratio.","author":"Zhiguo Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b6e966407d2e3bce45354b338f4f2f4873fd580430059867554f7d83b1ccd994","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
