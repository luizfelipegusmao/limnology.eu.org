{"title":"Metabolite and Gut Microbiota Profiles in Patients with Functional Dyspepsia: An Integrative Multi-omics Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0197/v1","date":1714977979000,"content":"Background: The pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia (FD) remains insufficiently understood, and the pain and economic constraints associated with endoscopic examinations hinder the precise definition and treatment of this disorder. Exploring the potential of multi-omics biomarkers for FD could yield promising targets for effectively diagnosing and treating this condition. Methods: We recruited 54 FD patients and 29 healthy volunteers and characterized their gut microbiota by shotgun metagenomic sequencing and their serum and urine metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results: We identified the changes in circulating metabolites associated with FD and linked to the gut microbial alterations. Among the differential circulating metabolites, we particularly highlighted the strong association of L-glutamate deficiency with the severity of FD symptoms and its strong predictive value for FD. Although no significant changes were noted in the gut microbial community structure of the FD samples, this might be attributed to symptom overlap between epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) and postprandial distress syndrome (PDS). However, significant alterations in the abundance of certain species were observed, including a substantial increase in the abundance of Streptococcus in the digestive tract of patients with FD. Finally, a cross-omics correlation network integrating metabolomic data with microbial community abundance was established, uncovering potential host-microbe-metabolite interactions. Conclusions: This work provides the first comprehensive description of the disrupted state of blood and urine metabolite composition and gut microbiota in patients with FD. These findings potentially offer promising targets for the diagnosis and treatment of this condition through a multi-omics approach, with particular emphasis on serum metabolomics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"503a42ae15f10648b09585dcc68c32c82348f0a1178df0051a1b99abd0bd14a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
