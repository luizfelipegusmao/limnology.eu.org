Therefore, QPI features improved contrast, label-free, minimal power requirement, subcellular resolution, and nanoscale spatiotemporal sensitivity, which make QPI an ideal candidate for long-term monitoring of cellular morphology and events. Recent efforts have applied QPI to plenty of studies in cell biology, oncology, embryology, and neuroscience. However, the limitations in QPI including poor axial resolution and sectioning, limited contrast and imaging depth in deep turbid samples, the phase information being coupled with the thickness of the sample, and lack of biochemical specificity prevent its applications in deep living systems. In this talk, I will present computational algorithms combined with new QPI hardware to provide solutions for those problems. Wolf phase tomography, which extends the diffraction tomography with broadband illumination, offers high-throughput refractive index retrieval of living cells and can indicate biological events in a label-free manner. Artificial confocal microscopy enables confocal-level axial resolution and sectioning, and molecular specificity for label-free three-dimensional living cellular clusters such as spheroids and organoids. Moreover, the quantitative information provided by phase images for the structures of interest can serve as biomarkers for metabolic activities and viability assays. We further developed a health assessment tool using artificial confocal microscopy for living embryos.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5b6508fd1f2bac5b237c8b85fc6c224a591709c34accde0d8fea0ec66e870ca5","category":"Environment"}
