{"title":"Comparative Performance of Autoencoders and Traditional Machine Learning Algorithms in Clinical Data Analysis for Predicting Post-Staged GKRS Tumor Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2245/v1","date":1725268828000,"content":"This study investigates the comparative performance of autoencoders and traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms in predicting tumor dynamics following Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for brain metastases (BMs). The research retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 77 patients (median age: 64 years; 45 males, 32 females) treated at the “Prof. Dr. NicolaeOblu” Emergency Clinic Hospital-Iasi. The dataset comprised 12 variables, including socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and radiosurgery-related factors. The primary outcome was tumor progression or regression within three months post-GKRS, with 71 cases of regression and 6 cases of progression observed. Traditional ML models—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Extra Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost—were evaluated, achieving accuracy rates ranging from 0.91 (KNN) to 1.00 (Extra Trees). When incorporating features extracted by autoencoders, the performance of these models generally improved, especially with compression in the bottleneck layer. For instance, Logistic Regression's accuracy increased from 0.91 to 0.94, while SVM's accuracy improved significantly from 0.85 to 0.96. XGBoost consistently performed well across both traditional and hybrid setups, maintaining an accuracy of 0.94 with an AUC of 0.98. The findings suggest that hybrid approaches combining deep learning with traditional ML techniques can significantly enhance predictive accuracy and robustness, particularly in the context of GKRS for BMs. This improved performance has potential implications for more informed clinical decision-making in personalized medicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e5c8d2ccac9f5ee99df535a6be1492ae3f498ae890f662e5c345db130fcdf83","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
