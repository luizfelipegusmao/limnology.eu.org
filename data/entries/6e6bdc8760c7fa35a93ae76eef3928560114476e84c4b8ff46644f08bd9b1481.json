{"title":"Polyphosphate phosphorus in the Great Lakes","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10394?af=R","date":1713267545000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Polyphosphate (polyP) is important to phytoplankton ecology, but a unified view of its variability and roles in ecosystem-scale phosphorus (P) cycling is lacking. We study polyP in the world's largest freshwater ecosystem, the Laurentian Great Lakes, covering pelagic to nearshore areas across a wide nutrient gradient. We show that polyP (average 10.99 ± 3.90 nmol L<sup>−1</sup>) constitutes 3.8–30.2% (average 18.1 ± 7.2%) of total particulate P (TPP). PolyP accumulation is higher in low-P pelagic waters compared with more productive nearshore areas. PolyP is preferentially degraded in the water column of the Great Lakes, enhancing P recycling and relieving the nitrogen (N) : P imbalance. Our data enables a coherent large-scale freshwater-to-oceanic comparison. We show that while different plankton groups accumulate different levels of polyP with smaller plankton accumulating more, P availability is the key driver of polyP variability within and across systems.</p>","author":"Xingyu Yang, \nRixuan Gao, \nAudrey Huff, \nSergei Katsev, \nTed Ozersky, \nJiying Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Letters: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e3d6bd1d0a248694da65f62e7591c05124a8fbc5456d1cafb66209dfd7ae6238","entryHash":"6e6bdc8760c7fa35a93ae76eef3928560114476e84c4b8ff46644f08bd9b1481","category":"Environment"}
