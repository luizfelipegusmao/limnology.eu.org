{"title":"Vertical Shear, Diapycnal Shear and the Gradient Richardson Number","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1439/v1","date":1721212868000,"content":"In vertical coordinates, (x,y,z), the gradient Richardson number Ri=N^2⁄S^2  is the square of the ratio between buoyancy frequency N and vertical-shear amplitude S, where N^2=-(g⁄ρ)   ∂ρ⁄∂z and S^2=(∂u⁄∂z)^2+ (∂v⁄∂z)^2, with ρ potential density, (u,v) the horizontal velocity components and g gravity acceleration, so that a decrease in stratification brings a decrease in dynamic stability and vice versa. In the isopycnic coordinate system, (x,y,ρ), however, Ri=M^2⁄〖S_ρ〗^2 , is the ratio between 〖M^2≡N〗^(-2) and the squared diapycnal shear 〖S_ρ〗^2=(ρ⁄g)^2 [(∂u⁄∂ρ)^2+ (∂v⁄∂ρ)^2 ], so a decrease in stratification leads to an increase in dynamic stability and vice versa. The apparently different role of stratification arises because S and S_ρ are related through the stratification itself, S_ρ=S⁄N^2  or, equivalently, τ=〖t_o〗^2⁄t_d , which is interpreted as a natural oscillation time τ≡S_ρ that equals the buoyancy or oscillation time t_o=N^(-1) normalized by the ratio t_o⁄t_d , where the deformation time is  t_d=S^(-1). Here we follow simple arguments and use field data from three different situations (island shelf-break, Gulf Stream and Mediterranean outflow) to endorse the usefulness of the isopycnal approach. In particular, we define the reduced squared vertical σ^2= S^2-N^2 and reduced squared diapycnal shear 〖σ_ρ〗^2= 〖S_ρ〗^2-M^2, which are positive for unstable conditions and negative for stable conditions. It turns out that Ri and σ^2 remain highly variable for all stratification conditions; in contrast, the mean 〖σ_ρ〗^2 values display a univocal tendency, its magnitude decreasing with stratification. We propose 〖σ_ρ〗^2 and 〖S_ρ〗^2 to be good indexes for the occurrence of effective mixing under high stratification conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d48a9180199d4213535739f6877d2f1afc01a0d2da88734df9dc3a150728f05e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
