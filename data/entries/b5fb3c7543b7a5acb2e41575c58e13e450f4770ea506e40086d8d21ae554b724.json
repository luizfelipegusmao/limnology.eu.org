{"title":"An optimized ligation-mediated PCR method for chromosome walking and fusion gene chromosomal breakpoints identification","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biomethods/article/doi/10.1093/biomethods/bpae037/7682375?rss=1","date":1716595200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Molecular techniques that recover unknown sequences next to a known sequence region have been widely applied in various molecular studies, such as chromosome walking, identification of the insertion site of transposon mutagenesis, fusion gene partner, and chromosomal breakpoints, as well as targeted sequencing library preparation. Although various techniques have been introduced for efficiency enhancement, searching for relevant single molecular event present in a large-sized genome remains challenging. Here, the optimized ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed and successfully identified chromosomal breakpoints far away from the exon of the new exon junction without the need for nested PCR. In addition to recovering unknown sequences next to a known sequence region, the high efficiency of the method could also improve the performance of targeted  next-generation sequencing (NGS).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"b5fb3c7543b7a5acb2e41575c58e13e450f4770ea506e40086d8d21ae554b724","category":"Environment"}
