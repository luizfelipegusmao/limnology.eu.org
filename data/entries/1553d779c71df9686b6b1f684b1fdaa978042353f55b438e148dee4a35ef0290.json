{"title":"Analyzing the Cooling Effects of Water Facilities in Urban Park: The Case of Sangju Namsan Park, South Korea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0043/v1","date":1725269320000,"content":"This study investigates the cooling effects of water facilities installed in urban parks, focusing on Sangju Namsan Park. The park features a water path and a cooling fog system, introduced as part of an environmental adaptation project to mitigate urban heat. Microclimate data were collected during the hot summer months of 2023 to assess the impact of these facilities on air temperature, humidity, and perceived thermal comfort. Results indicate that the water path and fog system reduced surface temperatures by up to 1.08Â°C, with additional benefits in reducing fine particulate matter and CO2 levels. The findings suggest that strategically placed water features can enhance thermal comfort and air quality in urban parks, offering a practical approach to climate change adaptation in urban planning. These insights are crucial for urban planners and policymakers aiming to improve public health and quality of life in the face of climate change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1553d779c71df9686b6b1f684b1fdaa978042353f55b438e148dee4a35ef0290","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
