{"title":"Sustainable Development Goals for Education and Research in the Ranking of Green Universities of Mahasarakham University","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1377/v1","date":1711348541000,"content":"This research aims to review the educational and research operations of Mahasarakham University and propose development directions for the university to meet sustainable development criteria for ranking as a green university. This involves gathering data and analyzing the results of operations over the past 3 years, then using this analysis to synthesize lessons learned and develop guidelines for sustainable development in the coming years. The study found that the university's policies and strategies implemented following the annual performance evaluation criteria align with the green university assessment criteria for education and research. This has resulted in minor improvements in curriculum for sustainability. However, community service projects for sustainability have increased by 89.10%, while funding for sustainable research and academic publications related to sustainability has decreased. In summary, the projects under the university's development strategy adequately support and drive suitable development activities. Nevertheless, the university must continuously review its operations to adapt to changing contexts, budget constraints, and evolving competition and develop each year sustainably.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25be364f2bef7d588da34e83e4bba1a9f2a35768dcc52de80d55276c90735243","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
