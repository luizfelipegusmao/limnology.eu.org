{"title":"Stable GANs via Fermi-Dirac Statistics and Ruppeiner Geometry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1286/v1","date":1729072082000,"content":"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful models for generative tasks but face significant challenges such as instability, mode collapse, and inefficient convergence. This paper introduces a theoretical framework leveraging Fermi-Dirac statistics, Ruppeiner geometry, phase transition dynamics, and graph theory to address these issues. The proposed theorems provide a robust mathematical foundation for enhancing GAN stability, diversity, and convergence. Experimental validation on the MNIST dataset demonstrates that the application of these theorems results in improved Inception Scores, reduced Fr√©chet Inception Distances, and stable training dynamics, as indicated by Ruppeiner curvature analysis. The findings suggest that these theoretical insights offer a comprehensive solution to the persistent challenges in GAN training, paving the way for more reliable and effective generative models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53a7a2560f94d269882f931fcee1738a23092d40bb883c5a3afedb49ecf98581","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
