{"title":"An auxin research odyssey: 1989â€“2023","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1410/7612216?rss=1","date":1708473600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The phytohormone auxin is at times called the master regulator of plant processes and has been shown to be a central player in embryo development, the establishment of the polar axis, early aspects of seedling growth, as well as growth and organ formation during later stages of plant development. <span>The Plant Cell</span> has been key, since the inception of the journal, to developing an understanding of auxin biology. Auxin-regulated plant growth control is accomplished by both changes in the levels of active hormones and the sensitivity of plant tissues to these concentration changes. In this historical review, we chart auxin research as it has progressed in key areas and highlight the role <span>The Plant Cell</span> played in these scientific developments. We focus on understanding auxin-responsive genes, transcription factors, reporter constructs, perception, and signal transduction processes. Auxin metabolism is discussed from the development of tryptophan auxotrophic mutants, the molecular biology of conjugate formation and hydrolysis, indole-3-butyric acid metabolism and transport, and key steps in indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis, catabolism, and transport. This progress leads to an expectation of a more comprehensive understanding of the systems biology of auxin and the spatial and temporal regulation of cellular growth and development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"011303866b98af27a428858237646b43367e46b46c1ca25aa4e56d3b16c6983e","category":"Environment"}
