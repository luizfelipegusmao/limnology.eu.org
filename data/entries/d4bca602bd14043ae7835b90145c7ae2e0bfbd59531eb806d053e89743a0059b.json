{"title":"No Pain Device: Empowering Personal Safety with An Artificial Intelligence-Based Nonviolence Embedded System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1763/v1","date":1711680324000,"content":"This paper presents the development of a novel anti-violence device titled \"no pAIn\" (an acronym for Never Oppressed Protected by Artificial Intelligence Nonviolence system), which harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (AI). Primarily designed to combat violence against women, the device offers personal safety benefits for individuals across diverse demographics. Operating autonomously, it necessitates no user interaction post-activation. The AI engine conducts real-time speech recognition and effectively discerns genuine instances of aggression from non-violent disputes or conversations.\nFacilitated by its Internet connectivity, in the event of detected aggression, the device promptly issues assistance requests with real-time precise geolocation tracking to predetermined recipients, for immediate assistance. Its compact size enables discreet concealment within commonplace items like candy wrappers, or within purpose-built casings, or as wearable accessories. The device is battery-operated.\nThe prototype was developed using a microcontroller board (Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect), incorporating an omnidirectional microphone and Wi-Fi module, all at a remarkably low cost. Subsequent functionality testing, performed in debug mode using the Arduino IDE serial monitor, yielded successful results. The AI engine exhibited exceptional accuracy in word recognition, complemented by a robust logic implementation, rendering the device highly reliable in discerning genuine instances of aggression from non-violent scenarios","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4bca602bd14043ae7835b90145c7ae2e0bfbd59531eb806d053e89743a0059b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
