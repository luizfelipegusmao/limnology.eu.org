{"title":"Atorvastatin inhibits Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced vascular inflammation to protect endothelium by inducing Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308823","date":1723730400000,"content":"<p>by Jian Luo, Qian Zhu, Keming Huang, Xue Wen, Yongquan Peng, Gong Chen, Gang Wei</p>\r\nPurpose <p>This study aimed to explore the differential effects of varying doses of atorvastatin on antagonizing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endothelial inflammation based on heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression.</p> Method <p>Vascular endothelial inflammatory injury was induced in 40 Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection of LPS. These rats were randomly divided into control, low-dose atorvastatin, high-dose atorvastatin, and HO-1 blocking groups. Seven days after treatment, all rats were sacrificed, and heart-derived peripheral blood was collected to measure the serum concentrations of bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total cholesterol, malondialdehyde, endothelial cell protein C receptor, endothelin-1, von Willebrand factor, and soluble thrombomodulin. Meanwhile, the number of circulating endothelial cells was determined using flow cytometry. Vascular tissues from descending aorta of rats from each group were extracted to detect the expression level of HO-1.</p> Results <p>After different doses of atorvastatin intervention, the above inflammatory indices were decreased, and HO-1 expression and ALT concentration were increased in the atorvastatin-treated group of rats compared with the control group. These changes were more pronounced in the high-dose statin group (P &lt; 0.05). Conversely, no significant decrease in the above inflammatory indices and no significant increase in HO-1 expression were observed in rats in the blocking group (P &gt; 0.05).</p> Conclusion <p>For LPS-induced vascular inflammation, high-dose atorvastatin exerts potent anti-inflammatory and vascular endothelial protection effects by inducing HO-1 expression.</p>","author":"Jian Luo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f97862f42b838214603854ef4d575980e52356fa10fbed99446e93be5c0c4fae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
