{"title":"Quaternion-Spin and Some Consequences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202312.1277/v2","date":1724229778000,"content":"Changing the symmetry of spin from SU(2) to the quaternion group, $Q_8$, has a number of ramifications. In this paper we first summarize the properties of Q-spin and then discuss some of those resulting changes.  Many are counter to well-established ideas which change our view of the microscopic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e588bfde4cb8c2d443823c7fe6ae442bddfc42c107fde7bc21b6a18c69d960c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
