Currently, there is limited evidence of effectiveness of early stroke-specialist vocational rehabilitation (ESSVR) interventions from randomised controlled trials. This study examined fidelity to ESSVR and explored social and structural factors which may have influenced implementation in the RETurn to work After stroKE (RETAKE) randomised controlled trial.</p> Methods <p>Mixed-methods process evaluation assessing intervention fidelity and incorporating longitudinal case-studies exploring stroke survivors’ experiences of support to return to work. Normalisation Process Theory, and the Conceptual Model for Implementation Fidelity, informed data collection and analysis.</p> Results <p>Sixteen sites across England and Wales participated in RETAKE. Forty-eight occupational therapists (OTs), supported by 6 mentors experienced in vocational rehabilitation (VR), delivered the intervention (duration 12 months) between February 2018 and April 2022. Twenty-six participants (15 ESSVR, 11 usual care (UC)) were included in longitudinal case-studies. An additional 18 participants (8 ESSVR and 10 UC) were interviewed once. Nineteen OTs, 6 mentors and 19 service managers were interviewed. Fidelity was measured for 39 ESSVR participants; mean fidelity score was 78.8% (SD:19.2%, range 31–100%). Comparison of the experiences of ESSVR and UC participants indicated duration and type of support to return to work were perceived to be better for ESSVR participants. They received early, co-ordinated support including employer liaison and workplace adjustments where appropriate. In contrast, UC participants reported limited or no VR or return to work support from health professionals. Typically, UC support lasted 2–8 weeks, with poor communication and co-ordination between rehabilitation providers. Mentor support for OTs appeared to increase fidelity. Service managers indicated ESSVR would enhance post-stroke services.</p> Conclusions <p>ESSVR was valued by participants and was delivered with fidelity; implementation appeared to be facilitated by mentor support for OTs.</p>","author":"David James Clarke","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dde2cc1be96ad92a80da5ec23730973d9814eaeecfb5d61ae3ed5d51d0240e9b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
