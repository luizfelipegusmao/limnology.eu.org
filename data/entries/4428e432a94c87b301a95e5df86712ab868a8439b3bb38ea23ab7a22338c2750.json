{"title":"Flood modeling in the Ba River basin using a coupled hydrodynamic model—MIKE FLOOD","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rvr2.82?af=R","date":1719375066000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The problem of flooding in Central Vietnam in general and the lower Ba River in particular is one of the natural disasters that frequently threatens people's lives and socioeconomic development in the region. Especially, climate change is becoming ever more prominent and hotter, making extreme natural disasters more unusual and unpredictable. In this research, MIKE-FLOOD—a model that connects a 1-dimensional (1-D) MIKE 11 Hydrodynamics (HD) model with a 2-dimensional (2-D) MIKE 21 HD model—was used to set up. The model was calculated for three floods: (1) flood in October 1993, (2) flood in November 2003, and (3) flood in November 2007; these are floods with high frequency and relatively large magnitude. The results show that the 1993 flood rose and receded quickly. The flood peak inundated an area of 22,600 ha, accounting for 52% of the natural area. The flooded areas deeper than 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 m were 16500, 11,000, 7000, 4200, and 2200 ha, respectively. In the center of Tuy Hoa city, the flooded area at the time of maximum water level was almost 100%.</p>","author":"Luc Anh Tuan, \nCan Thu Van, \nDoan Van Binh, \nSameh A.
