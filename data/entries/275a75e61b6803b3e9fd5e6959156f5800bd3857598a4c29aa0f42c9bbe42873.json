{"title":"“Capable of much more”: The effects of vocational training on caregiver expectations for neurodivergent dependents in Thailand","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306141","date":1721224800000,"content":"<p>by Drew B. Mallory</p>\r\n\r\nNeurodivergence encompasses a spectrum of natural variations in neurological development, including autism, ADHD, and other expressions of cognitive diversity. Caregiver experiences while supporting their neurodivergent dependents critically influence the quality of life outcomes for neurodivergent dependents across life stages, including during the search for work. However, research on caregiver experiences during this stage remains scarce, especially within lesser studied developing contexts like Thailand. This study explored perspectives of Thai caregivers preparing neurodivergent dependents for employment through a focus group (n = 10) of pre-vocational training caregivers and interviews (n = 13) with post-training caregivers. Analysis revealed significant sociocultural factors introducing stigma that affected acceptance, diagnosis, interventions, and policy support. Both groups reported systemic barriers, doubts about future independence, and hopes to increase advocacy and inclusive attitudes. However, caregivers whose dependents had received the training showed marked shifts in their expectations for their dependents’ success. Tailored vocational preparation helping dependents exhibit strengths may transform societal views on neurodiversity from deficiency to natural diversity and enable more meaningful, sustainable futures. These insights elucidate caregiver challenges and aspirations, which can better inform supportive research and interventions in Thailand and other non-Western locales.","author":"Drew B.
