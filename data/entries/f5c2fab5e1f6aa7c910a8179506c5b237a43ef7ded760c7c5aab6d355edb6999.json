{"title":"Influence of ground motion parameters on seismic response of a large-longitudinal-slope and small-radius curved girder bridge","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308456","date":1723039200000,"content":"<p>by Shenchun Qian, Tao Cheng, Lei Mao, Xiaoxin Zhang, Zhangliang Hu</p>\r\n\r\nThe mechanical performance of curved bridges under the action of an earthquake is complex. To obtain the influence of seismic parameters on the seismic response of curved girder bridges, this paper relies on a large slope small-radius curved steel box girder bridge (LSCGB) and selects seismic wave incidence angle, vertical component of ground motion, and site category as seismic parameters to carry out nonlinear time history analysis. Based on the analysis results of the case bridge, it is shown that the torsional vibration of the first 10 modes of LSCGB is significant, the modes are dispersed, and the contribution of high-order modes of vibration cannot be ignored. The most unfavorable seismic wave incidence angle is in the direction of 45°∼60° counterclockwise Angle from the central connection line of Pier No. 1 and Pier No. 4 of the bridge. The seismic response of the curved bridge components increases with the vertical seismic intensity, and the influence on displacement responses is more significant. The basic vibration period of curved girder bridges built on soft soil sites is extended by approximately 18.23%, and the seismic response of key components increases with the softening of the site soil. Therefore, when analyzing the seismic response of LSCGBs, the influence of vertical component of ground motion and site category should not be ignored.","author":"Shenchun Qian","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f5c2fab5e1f6aa7c910a8179506c5b237a43ef7ded760c7c5aab6d355edb6999","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
