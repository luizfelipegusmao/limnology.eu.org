A population-based study included 1995 healthy participants (1076 Chinese and 919 Indians) to construct a multivariable linear regression compensation model. This model was applied to 357 Chinese glaucoma patients, 357 healthy Chinese, and 357 healthy Indians using Cirrus spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). The compensated RNFL thickness considered age, refractive error, optic disc parameters, and retinal vessel density. Results showed that although the average RNFL thickness was significantly higher in Chinese participants compared to Indians, the compensation model reduced this difference to nonsignificance. Moreover, the compensation model significantly improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.90 vs. 0.78; <i>p</i>&lt;0.001), sensitivity (75% vs. 51%), and specificity (67% vs. 32%) in distinguishing Chinese glaucoma patients from healthy Indian individuals. The compensation model significantly enhanced the diagnostic accuracy of RNFL thickness in distinguishing glaucoma in the Chinese ethnic group compared to the OCT instrument's default values. These results suggest that modifying RNFL measurements based on individual characteristics can yield substantial benefits for glaucoma detection across ethnicities.</p>","author":"Jacqueline Chua, \nChi Li, \nDamon W.
