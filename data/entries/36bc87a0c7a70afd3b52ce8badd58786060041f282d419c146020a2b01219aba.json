{"title":"Peptide-Purified Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) Receptor Autoantibodies Have Inhibitory Effect on Long-Term Synaptic Plasticity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1561/v1","date":1713936504000,"content":"Recent studies, typically using patient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), have suggested that different autoantibodies (Aabs) acting on their respective receptors, may underlie neuropsychiatric disorders. The NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has been identified as a target of anti-NMDAR Aabs in a number of central nervous system (CNS) diseases including encephalitis and autoimmune epilepsy. However, the role or the nature of Aabs responsible for effects on neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity is yet to be established fully. Patient-derived anti-NMDAR Aabs have been shown to bind to specific regions within the NR1 subunit; here, peptide immunisation was used to generate Aabs against selected specific NR1 extracellular sequences. ‘Protein A’ purification was used to obtain total IgG and further peptide purification used to obtain a greater percentage of NMDAR-target specific IgG Aabs. Binding and specificity of these anti-NMDAR Aabs was determined using a range of methodologies including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting. Functional effects were determined using different in vitro electrophysiology techniques: two-electrode voltage-clamp in Xenopus oocytes and measures of long-term potentiation (LTP) in ex vivo hippocampal brain slices using multi-electrode arrays. We show that anti-NMDAR Aabs generated from peptide immunisation had specificity for NR1 immunisation peptides as well as target-specific binding to the native protein. Anti-NMDAR Aabs had no clear effect on isolated NMDARs in an oocyte expression system. However, we show that peptide-purified anti-NMDAR Aabs prevented the induction of LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in ex vivo brain slices. Our data demonstrate that anti-NMDAR Aabs cause synaptic NMDAR hypofunction at a network level. This work provides a solid basis to address outstanding questions regarding anti-NMDAR Aabs mechanisms of action and, potentially, development of therapies against CNS diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"36bc87a0c7a70afd3b52ce8badd58786060041f282d419c146020a2b01219aba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
