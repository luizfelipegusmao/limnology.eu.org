{"title":"Enzymatic preparation of diacylglycerols: lipase screening, immobilization, characterization and glycerolysis performance","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13872?af=R","date":1726047253000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Backgrounds</h2>\n<p>Glycerolysis, with its advantages of readily available raw materials, simple operation, and mild reaction conditions, is a primary method for producing diacylglycerol (DAG). However, enzymatic glycerolysis faces challenges such as high enzyme costs, low reuse efficiency, and poor stability. The study aims to develop a cost-effective immobilized enzyme by covalently binding lipase to pre-activated carriers through the selection of suitable lipases, carriers, and activating agents. The optimization is intended to improve the glycerolysis reaction for efficient DAG production.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Lipase CN-TL (from <i>Thermomyces lanuginosus</i>) was selected through glycerolysis reaction and molecular docking to catalyze the glycerolysis reaction. Optimizing the immobilization method by covalently binding CN-TL to poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE)-preactivated resin LX-201A resulted in the preparation of the immobilized enzyme TL-PEGDGE-LX. The immobilized enzyme retained over 90% of its initial activity after five consecutive reactions, demonstrating excellent reusability. The DAG content in the product remained at 84.8% of its initial level, further highlighting the enzyme's potential for reusability and its promising applications in the food and oil industries.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>The immobilized lipase TL-PEGDGE-LX, created by covalently immobilizing lipase CN-TL on PEGDGE-preactivated carriers, demonstrated broad applicability and excellent reusability. This approach offers an economical and convenient immobilization strategy for the enzymatic glycerolysis production of DAG. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Rui Xie, \nXianwu Peng, \nYee‐Ying Lee, \nPengkai Xie, \nChin‐Ping Tan, \nYong Wang, \nZhen Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"3aa2530ba3c27acb5dce4f359a963a58e04aed624c64dc724d78bf955b0fd620","category":"Environment"}
