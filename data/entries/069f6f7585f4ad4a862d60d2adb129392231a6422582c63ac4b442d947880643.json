{"title":"The Female Global Scholars Program: A mixed-methods evaluation of a novel intervention to promote the retention and advancement of women in global health research","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0002974","date":1716904800000,"content":"<p>by Alexandra A.

Fahme</p>\r\n\r\nFewer than 25% of global health leadership positions worldwide are held by women, adversely impacting women’s health and widening gendered health disparities. The Female Global Scholars (FGS) Program, established in 2018 at Weill Cornell Medicine, is a two-year hybrid training and peer-mentorship program that promotes the retention and advancement of early-career female investigators conducting health research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of the FGS Program on individual career advancement, academic productivity, and research self-efficacy. This mixed-methods study followed an explanatory sequential design. Participants completed an electronic survey collecting information on demographics, academic milestones, and research skill competency. Survey data were descriptively analyzed using R (Version 1.4.1106). In-depth interviews explored perceptions of the impact of the FGS Program on career development. The authors independently reviewed and thematically analyzed de-identified transcripts using NVivo (Version 13). In June 2022, twelve participants completed the survey. The median age was 40 years; 90% carried an MD, PhD, or other post-graduate degree. Since joining the FGS Program, respondents achieved a combined total of eight awarded grants, five academic promotions, 12 oral scientific presentations and 35 first-author peer-reviewed publications. Thematic analysis identified four overarching themes: gaining confidence through mimicry; improved self-efficacy to address gendered challenges; real-world application of scientific and career development skills; and building multi-disciplinary communities in a protected female-only space. We demonstrate that this low-cost training and mentorship program successfully addresses critical barriers that impede women’s advancement in global health research. Our data may inform the adaptation of this initiative across other academic institutions.","author":"Alexandra A.
