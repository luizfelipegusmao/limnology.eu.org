The first products were developed to address the stability and reliability issues in diode laser modules for demanding applications. We manufacture in California, USA, and all suppliers of any build to print components in our system are within 100 miles of our facility ensuring short lead times and on time shipments. Through a philosophy of designing systems using an optical benchtop and referencing the laser source and optics to the optical plane, we have created an unprecedented stability and reliability found in the industry. Our UV lasers have proven “best in class” reliability with an average of 70,000 hours of continuous operation. Vortran Laser continues to be a reliable and consistent provider of high-performance systems in various microscopy applications such as FRAP, FRET, TIRF, SPIM, Light Sheet, and many more.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"62fb20cb14974109a89119d8a387f6265d88a3c9b384fe57c31ec4e8fc09a795","category":"Environment"}
