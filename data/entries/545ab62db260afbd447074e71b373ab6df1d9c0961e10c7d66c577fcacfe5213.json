{"title":"Massive Black Holes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1281/v1","date":1724062620000,"content":"The study of supermassive black holes has significantly advanced our understanding of galaxy structures, yet fundamental questions remain, particularly concerning the structure and dynamics of massive black holes. This article addresses the core structure of massive black holes, defined as those originating from supernova events. Integrating the concept of \"Dachus density,\" a state of maximum matter density, I propose that the core of all massive black holes exists at this density. The research investigates the size of these cores and their event horizons, using Cygnus X-1 and Sagittarius A* as examples. Calculations reveal that the core size is exceedingly small compared to the overall black hole, with the core's volume being up to ~155 orders of magnitude smaller than the event horizon volume in the case of Sagittarius A*. The article briefly explores the implications of a rotating Dachus core on the black hole's structure, including the \"mantle\" region between the core and the event horizon. The discussion extends to absolute zero temperature, asserting that for a non-spinning, static Massive black hole, the temperature of its core reaches 0[K] as in this state, particles do not move in relation to each other and do not have any kinetic and in particular rotational Energy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"545ab62db260afbd447074e71b373ab6df1d9c0961e10c7d66c577fcacfe5213","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
