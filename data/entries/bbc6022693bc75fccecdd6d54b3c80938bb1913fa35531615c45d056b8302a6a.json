{"title":"A Comparative Study of Sol-Gel Deposited Zinc Oxide, Tin Oxide, and Titanium Dioxide Thin Films and Their Photocatalytic Performance on MB Decoloration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0880/v1","date":1726039316000,"content":"A comparative study of the photocatalytic decoloration of methylene blue (MB) dissolved in water was conducted, using three semiconductor oxides: zinc oxide (ZnO), tin oxide (SnO2) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) in the form of thin films and varying their thickness ~ 100, 200, and 300 nm for each film. All the films were deposited using the cost-effective dip-coating technique, at moderate temperature processing (400 Â°C) with sol-gel solutions on cheap glass substrates. The structural, morphological, and compositional properties of the films were analyzed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The degradation of MB was studied by varying both thickness and type of semiconductor oxides through measurements of optical absorbance of decolorated liquid by photocatalytic process. Structural analysis shows that ZnO and SnO2 films were polycrystalline with preferential growth of (002) and (110) planes respectively, whereas, an amorphous structure was observed for TiO2 films. In addition, morphological properties confirms that the surfaces of all the films  are conformed with nano grains in round and irregular shapes. Based on all results reported in this work, that authors believe that the degradation efficiency of MB depends on the thickness of the film and the type of semiconductor material used as a catalyst. The highest degradation efficiencies were recorded with an exposure time of 120 min and with an initial concentration of 10 mg/L for ZnO, SnO2, and TiO2 films were: 100, 88 %, and 76 %, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bbc6022693bc75fccecdd6d54b3c80938bb1913fa35531615c45d056b8302a6a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
