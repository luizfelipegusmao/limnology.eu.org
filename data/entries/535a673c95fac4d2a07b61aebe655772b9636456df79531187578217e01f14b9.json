{"title":"High-Throughput Sequencing Reveals New Viroid Species in Opuntia in Mexico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1823/v1","date":1719384148000,"content":"In the main prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) producing region in the State of Mexico, fruit production (tunas) occupies the largest cultivated area with 15,800 ha, while 900 ha are cultivated for fresh consumption (“nopal” or “nopalitos”). Two composite samples consisting of prickly pear cactus cladodes (n=6) and another of nopal vegetable (n=6) showing virus-like symptoms were collected. Both sample sets were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to identify the viruses and viroids present. The HTS results were verified using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Subsequently, 86 nopal samples (nopal vegetable, prickly pear cactus, xoconostle and wild) were analyzed via RT-PCR with specific primers for the viruses and viroids previously detected via HTS. Three viruses were discovered [Opuntia virus 2 (OV2), cactus carlavirus 1 (CCV-1), and Opuntia potexvirus A (OPV-A)], along with a previously reported viroid [Opuntia viroid 1 (OPVd-1)]. Additionally, two new viroid species were identified, provisionally named Mexican opuntia viroid (genus Pospiviroid) and Opuntia viroid 2 (OVd-2). Phylogenetic analysis, pairwise identity comparison, and conserved structural elements analysis confirmed the classification of these two viroids as new species within the Pospiviroidae family. This is the first report of a pospiviroid and two apscaviroids infecting prickly pear in the world. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the virome associated with nopal in Mexico.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"535a673c95fac4d2a07b61aebe655772b9636456df79531187578217e01f14b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
