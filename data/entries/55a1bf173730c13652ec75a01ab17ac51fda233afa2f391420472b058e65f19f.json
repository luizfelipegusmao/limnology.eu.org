{"title":"Medicine Non-adherence: A New Viewpoint on Adherence Arising From Research in Sub-Saharan Africa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0576/v1","date":1710131897000,"content":"Adherence is vital for medicine to have an effect, yet adherence is considered to be low. However, research into adherence tends to focus on quantitative analysis of performance, something which fails to perceive how people are adherent in their many different environments. As a contribution to gaining a deeper understanding, interviews were held with 30 individuals in UK, Egypt, Kazakhstan and 6 countries in sub-Saharan Africa to understand their perceptions on adherence for a range of drugs, and these were compared with an existing well-regarded list. New reasons for non-adherence were discovered, and a new viewpoint on adherence derived which considers adherence to be a single act and therefore as an individual opportunity to be adherent, permitting greater focus on the enablers and inhibitors of adherence at a point in time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55a1bf173730c13652ec75a01ab17ac51fda233afa2f391420472b058e65f19f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
