{"title":"Advances in Robotic Surgery: A Review of new Surgical Platforms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0121/v1","date":1727863227000,"content":"In recent decades, the development of surgical systems that minimize patient impact has been a major focus for surgeons and researchers, leading to the advent of robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery. These technologies offer significant patient benefits, including enhanced outcome quality and accuracy, reduced invasiveness, lower blood loss, decreased postoperative pain, diminished infection risk, and shorter hospitalization and recovery times. Surgeons benefit from the elimination of human tremor, ergonomic advantages, improved vision systems, better access to challenging anatomical areas, and magnified 3DHD visualization of the operating field. \nSince 2000, Intuitive Surgical has developed multiple generations of master-slave multi-arm robots, securing over 7,000 patents, which created significant barriers for competitors. This monopoly resulted in the widespread adoption of their technology, now used in over 11 million surgeries globally. With the expiration of key patents, new robotic platforms featuring innovative designs, such as modular systems, are emerging.\nThis review examines advancements in robotic surgery within the fields of general, urological, and gynaecological surgery. The objective is to analyse the current robotic surgical platforms, their technological progress, and their impact on surgical practices. By examining these platforms, this review provides insights into their development, potential benefits, and future directions in robotic-assisted surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c85f939c071dd91c1d074cc98c65277acf484bfa97ef9c26ca43a2de9ed73833","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
