Due to its inherent advantages over the microscopy technique, several brands of the kit have flooded malaria endemic countries, without prior in-country evaluation. Two of such mRDT kits are <i>Oscar</i> (India) and <i>Standard Q</i> (Korea Republic). In this study, the performance of <i>Oscar</i> and <i>Standard Q</i> mRDT kits were compared to <i>First Response</i> (India) and <i>CareStart</i> (USA) mRDTs, which have been evaluated and deployed for use approved by the Ministry of Health (MOH). In this comparative study, whole blood samples were collected from patients suspected of malaria. <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> was detected in each sample using nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR), microscopy and the four mRDTs. The sensitivities, specificities, accuracies, positive and negative predictive values and accuracies of the mRDTs were determined using nPCR as a reference technique. Kappa statistic was used to determine the level of agreement among the techniques. Two hundred (200) blood samples were analyzed in this study. The overall detection rates of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> by microscopy, <i>First Response</i>, <i>CareStart</i>, <i>Oscar-PfHRP2</i>, <i>Standard Q</i> mRDT kits and nPCR were 31.5%, 34.5%, 33.5%, 32%, 31% and 43% (<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> = 6.1, p = 0.046), respectively. The accuracies of <i>CareStart</i> and <i>First Response</i> were comparable (90.5% vs. 89.5%). Further, comparing their sensitivities, <i>Oscar-PfHRP2</i> was 74.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 63.9–83.2) while that of <i>Standard Q</i> was 72.1% (95% CI: 61.4–81.2), with comparable accuracies (<i>Oscar-PfHRP2</i>–89% and <i>Standard Q</i> -88%). Apart from <i>First Response</i> that was 98.3% specific, the others were 100% specific. Kappa test revealed perfect diagnostic agreement (κ = 0.90–0.98) among the four mRDTs. That notwithstanding, <i>Oscar-PfHRP2</i> agreed better with <i>CareStart</i> (κ = 0.94) and <i>First Response</i> (κ = 0.92) compared to the agreement between <i>Standard Q</i> and, <i>CareStart</i> (κ = 0.92) and <i>First Response</i> (κ = 0.90). Taken together, the diagnostic performance of the four mRDT kits were statistically similar. That notwithstanding, new mRDT kits should be evaluated prior to deployment for use.","author":"Enoch Aninagyei","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e9e3778e898b52324c2709469657d4adb4f57b3542ced311e41dd6d9db047e58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
