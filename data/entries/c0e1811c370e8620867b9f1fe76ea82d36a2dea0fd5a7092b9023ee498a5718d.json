{"title":"Enhancing Submandibular Gland Resection: A Retrospective Study on the Efficacy of the ORBEYE 3D Exoscope","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1802/v1","date":1721743206000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Conventional surgery gland using the naked eye remains the standard for submandibular gland resection. Owing to its excellent automatic focus and high magnification, the ORBEYE 3D system introduces precise submandibular resection with less stress. Therefore, we examined the usefulness of the exoscope in submandibular gland resection for the first time. Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 12 patients who underwent submandibular gland resection using an ORBEYE exoscope at the Department of Head and Neck Surgery and Otorhinolaryngology at Kansai Medical University from April 2021 to March 2024. Surgical outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. Results: The mean age of the 12 patients (six females and six males) was 58.5 years (23–83 years). The final histopathology showed pleomorphic adenoma in eight cases, non-sebaceous-type lymphadenoma and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma in one case each, and sialolithiasis with chronic inflammation in two cases. We performed facial artery and vein sparing in all cases except one in which level I neck dissection, including the submandibular gland, was performed. In all cases, we identified the marginal mandibular branches of the facial, hypoglossal, and lingual nerves, as well as the submandibular duct. No postoperative complications occurred in any patient. The mean operative time was 104 min (80–129 min). The mean blood volume lost was 20 mL (5–43 mL). Conclusions: Using ORBEYE in submandibular gland resection will contribute to preserving the mandibular marginal branch of the facial and lingual nerves and the facial artery and vein, and visualizing the submandibular duct, which are important structures surrounding the submandibular gland.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c0e1811c370e8620867b9f1fe76ea82d36a2dea0fd5a7092b9023ee498a5718d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
