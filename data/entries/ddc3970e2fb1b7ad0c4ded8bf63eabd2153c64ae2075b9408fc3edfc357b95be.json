{"title":"Angiographic Correlation of Angina Topography in Patients Presenting with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) -Can the Location of Angina Predict the Site of Coronary Artery Occlusion? &ndash; The ACOLYTE Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0500/v1","date":1723019640000,"content":"Aim: To study the relationship between the location of chest pain (topography) and site of coronary artery involvement in patients of Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Materials and Method: This observational study analyzed 589 angina topographic sites in 411 consecutive patients hospitalized for Acute Coronary syndrome (ACS) who underwent PTCA at a tertiary care center between January 2017 and December 2019. All parameters including the characteristics and site of the anginal pain, Electrocardiogram (ECG), and Coronary angiography (CAG) findings were recorded and analyzed for their topographical correlation with site of culprit vessel involvement. Result: Out of 411 patients, 337 were Males (82.0%) and 74 (18.0%) were females with 589 topographic sites of angina. The mean age of the study subject was 57.03Â± 11.28 years. In both ST elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) and Non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI), the Left anterior descending (LAD) was the most affected vessel in 201(63.4%) and 49(53.3%) respectively. The correlation coefficient for LAD occlusion was 0.298 (p=0.001) for the Retrosternal site. The Left Circumflex (LCX) artery showed a positive correlation of 0.647 (p= 0.001) for Jaw with Neck pain and of 0.585 (p=0.001) for Backache with Shoulder pain. The Right Coronary Artery (RCA) showed a positive correlation of 0.713 (p=0.001) for Retrosternal plus Jaw and Neck pain and of 0.719 (p=0.001) for Retrosternal plus Backache. Conclusion: The study reveals a significant correlation between chest pain topography and site of coronary artery involvement. It provides a basis for future research to develop tools that help healthcare professionals quickly identify culprit artery in ACS.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ddc3970e2fb1b7ad0c4ded8bf63eabd2153c64ae2075b9408fc3edfc357b95be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
