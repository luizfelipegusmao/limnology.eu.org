{"title":"A Comprehensive Analysis of the Genomic and Expressed Repertoire of the T Cell Receptor Beta Chain in Equus caballus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0599/v1","date":1723099717000,"content":"In this paper, we report a comprehensive and consistent annotation of the locus encoding the horse T cell receptor b-chain (TRB), as inferred from the most recent genome assembly. The horse TRB locus spans approximately 1 Mb, making it the largest locus among the mammalian species stud-ied to date, with a significantly higher number of genes related to extensive duplicative events. In the region, 136 TRBV, belonging to 29 subgroups, 2 TRBD, 13 TRBJ and 2 TRBC genes, were iden-tified. The general genomic organization resembles that of other mammals, with a V-cluster of 135 TRBV genes, located upstream of two in-tandem aligned TRBD-J-C clusters, and an inverted TRBV gene at the 3’ end of the last TRBC gene. However, the horse b-chain repertoire would be affected by a high number of non-functional TRBV genes. Thus, we queried a transcriptomic da-taset derived from splenic tissue of a healthy adult horse, using each TRBJ gene as a probe to ana-lyse clonotypes encompassing the V(D)J junction. This analysis provided insights into the usage of the TRBV, TRBD and TRBJ genes and the variability of the juxtaposition region. Our results clearly demonstrated that the horse β-chain constitutes a complex level of variability broadly like that described in other mammalian species.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed70de85f96eb7b6494ca59042916245b8e5aa88fff176a16e80712bce547570","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
