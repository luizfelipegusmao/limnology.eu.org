{"title":"GPU Accelerated Volume Renderer for Use with MATLAB","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1960/v1","date":1719506860000,"content":"Visualization of volumetric data holds great importance, particularly in medical and biomedical applications. Various imaging techniques, such as FMRI and 3D microscopy, are employed to generate volumetric data, used in medical practice, research, and teaching. Commonly utilized tools like 3D Slicer, Fiji, and MATLAB ® aid in rendering and analyzing 3D images. However, these tools may lack comprehensive rendering functionality and face challenges in handling computational demands as data sizes grow. To address these limitations, this work introduces a GPU-supported renderer with a MATLAB ® interface. This solution gives the user flexible control over rendering parameters and optimizes data transfer through a memory management system. By leveraging the computational power of NVIDIA GPUs, the renderer enables complex and high-quality renderings, enhancing speed and efficiency. It therefore facilitates the analysis and visualization of volumetric data within an integrated environment, namely MATLAB ®, streamlining their workflows. This advancement provides valuable opportunities for researchers and medical professionals to explore and comprehend volumetric data effectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61f76c09abc8ed5a491d349a60762fb50ce231c103f72f07fec05d8ac4fdf069","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
