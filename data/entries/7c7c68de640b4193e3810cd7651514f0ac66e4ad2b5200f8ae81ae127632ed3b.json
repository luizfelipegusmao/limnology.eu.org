{"title":"State-of-the-Art Review &ndash; Effects of Using Cool Building Cladding Materials on Roofs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0431/v1","date":1720089405000,"content":"Cool roofs are roofing systems designed to reflect significant solar radiation, reducing heat absorption and subsequent cooling energy demands in buildings. This paper provides a comprehensive review of cool roof technologies, covering performance standards, material options, energy-saving potential, and hygrothermal considerations. The review examines provisions in current codes and standards, which specify minimum requirements for solar reflectance, thermal emittance, and solar reflectance index (SRI) values. These criteria often vary based on factors like roof slope, climate zone, and building type. Different cool roof materials are explored, including reflective paints and coatings that can be applied to existing roofs as cost-effective solutions. Several studies demonstrated the energy performance benefits of cool roofs, showing significant reductions in cooling loads, indoor air temperatures, peak cooling demand, and overall cooling energy consumption compared to traditional roofs. However, hygrothermal performance must be evaluated, especially in cold climates, to optimize insulation levels and avoid moisture accumulation risks, as reduced heat absorption can alter moisture migration patterns within the building envelope. While cool roofs provide substantial energy savings in hot climates, further research is needed to validate modeling approaches against real-world studies, investigate the impact of seasonality and green spaces on cool roof efficacy and urban heat island mitigation, and explore energy savings potential, moisture control, and condensation risks in cold and humid environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c7c68de640b4193e3810cd7651514f0ac66e4ad2b5200f8ae81ae127632ed3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
