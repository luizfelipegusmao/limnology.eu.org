{"title":"Role of formyl peptide receptor 2 in steatosis of L02 cells exposed to Mono‐(2‐ethylhexyl) phthalate","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24256?af=R","date":1718077862000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) can accumulate in the liver and then lead to hepatic steatosis, while the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Inflammation plays an important role in the disorder of hepatic lipid metabolism. This study aims to clarify the role of the inflammatory response mediated by formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) in steatosis of L02 cells exposed to MEHP. L02 cells were exposed to MEHP of different concentrations and different time. A steatosis model of L02 cells was induced with oleic acid and the cells were exposed to MEHP simultaneously. In addition, L02 cells were incubated with FPR2 antagonist and then exposed to MEHP. Lipid accumulation was determined by oil red O staining and extraction assay. The indicators related to lipid metabolism and inflammatory response were measured with appropriate kits. The relative expression levels of FPR2 and its ligand were determined by Western blot, and the interaction of them was detected by co-immunoprecipitation. As a result, MEHP exposure could promote the occurrence and progression of steatosis and the secretion of chemokines and inflammatory factors in L02 cells. MEHP could also affect the expression and activation of FPR2 and the secretion of FPR2 ligands. In addition, the promotion effect of MEHP on the secretion of total cholesterol and interleukin 1β in L02 cells could be significantly inhibited by the FPR2 antagonist. We concluded that FPR2 might affect the promotion effect of MEHP on steatosis of L02 cells by mediating inflammatory response.</p>","author":"Xuemin Feng, \nRuxuan Zhang, \nXiaohan Miao, \nXu Li, \nJianwei Cui, \nHang Xu, \nXiaoqi Fang, \nChunkui Zhou, \nLin Ye, \nLiting Zhou","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"6ad2e729f41b5f4f557564d246d87245df6151f9fd9ae72f4c12eea17aab7280","category":"Environment"}
