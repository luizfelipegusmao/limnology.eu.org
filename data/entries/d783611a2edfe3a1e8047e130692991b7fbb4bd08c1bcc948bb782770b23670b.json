Amentoflavone (AF) possesses the characteristics of marginal toxicity, stable curative effect, and good anti-HCC activity. This study aimed to evaluate the molecular mechanism of AF inhibiting HCC and provide a new idea for HCC treatment. Methods: Clinical tissue of HCC was collected. AF was given with HCC cells, and transfected with corresponding vectors. MiR-124-3p expression in HCC clinical samples and cells was ascertained by qRT-PCR assay. HCC cells viability was identified by CCK-8 assay. LC3 protein expression was ascertained by immunofluorescence assay. The expressions of CAPN2, β-catenin and mitochondrial autophagy-related proteins were detected by western blot. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed the targeting relationship of miR-124-3p and CAPN2. Results: MiR-124-3p expression was inhibited and CAPN2 expression was increased in HCC tissues and cells. AF decreased HCC cell viability, up-regulated miR-124-3p expression, and inhibited CAPN2 expression and β-catenin nuclear transcription. Moreover, AF could activate the mitochondrial autophagy of HCC cells. MiR-124-3p specifically regulated CAPN2 expression. This study found that CAPN2 could promote β-catenin nuclear translocation, thus activating wnt/β-catenin pathway to inhibit mitochondrial autophagy in HCC cells. MiR-124-3p mimics enhanced AF function in promoting mitochondrial autophagy in HCC cells. However, CAPN2 overexpression, miR-124-3p inhibitor and SKL2001 attenuated the effectiveness of AF. Conclusion: This study confirmed that AF regulated miR-124-3p/CAPN2 axis to restraint β-catenin nuclear translocation and then inhibit the wnt/β-catenin pathway, thereby promoting mitochondrial autophagy in HCC.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"d783611a2edfe3a1e8047e130692991b7fbb4bd08c1bcc948bb782770b23670b","category":"Environment"}
