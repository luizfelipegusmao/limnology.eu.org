We examine local and global clustering coefficient measures with respect to the lexicographic graph product. As a preliminary condition, we analyze the $K_3$ subgraph structure focused on vertex inclusion with respect to the product graph. From this structure, we determine both the clustering coefficient for the product graph vertices and the average clustering coefficient for the product graph.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8953a03047c683b1003950e48ecf97befbe94406aad2d1fa7991e819927e0d4b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
