{"title":"How teleworking adoption is changing the labor market and workforce dynamics?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299051","date":1710856800000,"content":"<p>by Yousif Elsamani, Yuya Kajikawa</p>\r\n\r\nThis article investigates how teleworking adoption influenced the labor market and workforce dynamic using bibliometric methods to overview 86 years of teleworking research [1936–2022]. By grouping the retrieved articles available on the Web of Science (WOS) core collection database, we revealed a holistic and topical view of teleworking literature using clustering and visualization techniques. Our results reflect the situation where the adoption of teleworking in the last three years was accelerated by the pandemic and facilitated by innovation in remote work technologies. We discussed the factors influencing one’s decision to join the workforce or a specific company, besides the unintended consequences of the rapid adoption of teleworking. The study can aid organizations in developing adequate teleworking arrangements, enhancing employee outcomes, and improving retention rates. Furthermore, it can help policymakers design more effective policies to support employees, improve labor force participation rates, and improve societal well-being.","author":"Yousif Elsamani","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7c2d74b06ee854975f28858279b8b0a782f71c366a89cf49f8226d289be29b27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
