{"title":"Shaping leaves through TALE homeodomain transcription factors","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/11/3220/7634734?rss=1","date":1711324800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The first TALE homeodomain transcription factor gene to be described in plants was maize <span>knotted1</span> (<span>kn1</span>). Dominant mutations in <span>kn1</span> disrupt leaf development, with abnormal knots of tissue forming in the leaf blade. <span>kn1</span> was found to be expressed in the shoot meristem but not in a peripheral region that gives rise to leaves. Furthermore, KN1 and closely related proteins were excluded from initiating and developing leaves. These findings were a prelude to a large body of work wherein TALE homeodomain proteins have been identified as vital regulators of meristem homeostasis and organ development in plants. KN1 homologues are widely represented across land plant taxa. Thus, studying the regulation and mechanistic action of this gene class has allowed investigations into the evolution of diverse plant morphologies. This review will focus on the function of TALE homeodomain transcription factors in leaf development in eudicots. Here, we discuss how TALE homeodomain proteins contribute to a spectrum of leaf forms, from the simple leaves of <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span> to the compound leaves of <span>Cardamine hirsuta</span> and species beyond the <span>Brassicaceae</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"7c4caad7c2597cd2e39b683894a452e7f2e657dd4df54699918e4a4cb0d68dc9","category":"Environment"}
