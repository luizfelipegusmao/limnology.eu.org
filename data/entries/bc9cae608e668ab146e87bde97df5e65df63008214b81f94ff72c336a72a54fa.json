{"title":"Statistical Analysis-Based Prediction Model for Fatigue Characteristics in Lap Joints considering Weld Geometry, including Gaps","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1463/v1","date":1724156711000,"content":"This study proposed a regression model for predicting fatigue properties based on crucial weld geometry factors in lap-welded joints with gaps using statistical analysis. Welding conditions were varied to build various weld geometries in joints configured in a lap from with gaps of 0, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mm, and 87 S-N curves for the lap-welded joints were derived. As input variables, 17 weld geometry factors (7 lengths, 7 angles, and 3 area factors) were selected. The slope of the S-N curve using Basquin model from the S-N curve and the safe fatigue strength were selected as output variables for prediction to develop the regression model. Multiple linear regression models, multiple non-linear regression models, and second-order polynomial regression models were proposed to predict fatigue properties. Backward elimination was applied to simplify the models and reduce overfitting. Among the three proposed regression models, the multiple non-linear regression model had a coefficient of determination greater than 0.86. In lap-welded joints with gaps, the weld geometry factors representing fatigue properties were identified through standardized regression coefficients, and four weld geometry factors related to stress concentration were proposed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc9cae608e668ab146e87bde97df5e65df63008214b81f94ff72c336a72a54fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
