Recent advancements in lipid biosensor technology and imaging modalities now allow for direct observation of phospholipid distribution, trafficking, and dynamics in living cells. These innovations have markedly advanced our understanding of phospholipid function and regulation at both cellular and subcellular levels. Herein, we summarize the latest developments in phospholipid biosensor design and application, emphasizing the contribution of cutting-edge imaging techniques to elucidating phospholipid dynamics and distribution with unparalleled spatiotemporal precision.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Life Metabolism Current Issue","siteHash":"d3cf61b7d69b232b580c1102d6441106867080e8dca2814adef0cc08b7e63ed3","entryHash":"7e125b97731ff7e23ef99523dcc757f5cf2d8862b9f3ea157deb98b767d552ea","category":"Environment"}
