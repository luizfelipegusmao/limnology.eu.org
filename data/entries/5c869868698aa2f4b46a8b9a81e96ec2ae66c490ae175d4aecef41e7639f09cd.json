The purpose of the study is to determine the frequency at which these behavioural disorders appear in elite footballers and evaluate their relationship with other addictions. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2020 and January 2022 on 306 participants. The variables of gambling and gaming were studied. The different groups were compared using Chi-squared tests. Probabilities exceeding 95% (p-values &amp;lt; 0.05) and residuals results greater than 2 or less than −2 were considered significant. (3) Results: There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of alcohol (p &amp;lt; 0.001), tobacco (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and cannabis (p &amp;lt; 0.018) consumption. We also found differences between those who had a history of a nervous disease (p &amp;lt; 0.015). 6.6% of the of football players had a probable diagnosis of gambling disorder compared to 1% in the general population (p &amp;lt; 0.007). Among the pathological and non-pathological cases of gambling in the football population, significant differences were found between those with a salary of €900–1,500/month (p &amp;lt; 0.033) or a history of a nervous pathology (p &amp;lt; 0.001). (4) Conclusions: This study showed that professional football players were vulnerable to mental health pathologies related to gaming.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c869868698aa2f4b46a8b9a81e96ec2ae66c490ae175d4aecef41e7639f09cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
