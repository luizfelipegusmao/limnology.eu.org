{"title":"Kinematic Analysis of 4 Bar Mechanisms Applying for Solar Tracking","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0165/v1","date":1719924588000,"content":"In the present investigation, the crank-slider and crank-rocker off-center mechanisms are used to control 1-DOF in a solar tracker focused on improving the conversion of solar to electrical energy. Likewise, the kinematic equations of these mechanisms are presented that allow us to know their operating pattern in the work range of the follower and their comparative analysis between them. Finally, the scale construction with 3D printing is shown to verify the functionality of each 4-bar system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"99b5d3a372fa450337eaf680d4acfbf73c60076eed26aadce890032808d4f2f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
