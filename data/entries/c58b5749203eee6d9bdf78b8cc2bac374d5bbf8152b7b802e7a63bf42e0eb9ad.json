Electron tomography on soft materials, such as polymers and biomaterials composed of low atomic weight (low-Z) elements, is challenging due to their low contrast and sensitivity to damage when exposed to the electron beam. Our previous work used strategies of defocusing (to create a Fresnel fringe) and a low dose of the electron beam to tomographically reconstruct the 3D morphology of biological and synthetic soft materials with nanometer resolutions [<a href=\"#ozae044.893-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.893-B4\">4</a>]. Moreover, using the 3D reconstructions we developed a morphometric workflow to quantify the nanomorphology, followed by relating the nanomorphology to the morphogenesis and mechanical properties [<a href=\"#ozae044.893-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c58b5749203eee6d9bdf78b8cc2bac374d5bbf8152b7b802e7a63bf42e0eb9ad","category":"Environment"}
