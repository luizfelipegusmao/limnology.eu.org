{"title":"Advances in Structural Health Monitoring: Bio-Inspired Optimization Techniques and Vision-Based Monitoring System For Damage Detection Using Natural Frequency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0858/v1","date":1720648537000,"content":"This paper introduces the improvements in the natural frequency based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by applying bio-inspired optimization methods and the vision-based monitoring system for the effective damage detection. This paper proposes a natural frequency extraction method using the motion magnification based vision monitoring system with bio-inspired optimization techniques to estimate the damage location and depth in a cantilever beam. The proposed optimization techniques are inspired by natural processes and biological evolution including Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, Sea Lion Optimization, and Coral Reefs Optimization. To verify the performances of each bio-inspired optimization methods, the eigenvalues of a two-bay truss structure are used for estimating the damaged elements. Then, using the proposed video motion magnification method, the natural frequency for each of undamaged and damaged cantilever beam have been extracted and compared with the LDV sensor to verify the proposed vision-based monitoring system. The performance of each bio-inspired optimizer for the damage detection has been compared. As a result, Coral Reefs Optimization has showed the lowest average error, around 1%, in the damage detection using natural frequency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aac4903904e35d1d2eef776553e571a8be7ee2734d837cd803cd3a70a1c29adb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
