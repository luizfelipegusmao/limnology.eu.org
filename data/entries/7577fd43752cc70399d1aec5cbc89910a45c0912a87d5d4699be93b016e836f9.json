In Switzerland, healthcare stakeholders have called to address the health workforce crisis and have pointed out the scarcity of data on the conditions of healthcare professionals (HCPs). Hence, the Swiss Cohort of Healthcare Professionals and Informal Caregivers (SCOHPICA) was developed to study the career trajectories, well-being, intention to stay in or leave the position/profession/health sector, and their determinants, of HCPs and informal caregivers, respectively. This paper describes the protocol for the HCPs cohort of SCOHPICA and discusses its implications.</p> Methods <p>SCOHPICA is a prospective open cohort using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design. All types of HCPs working directly with patients and practicing in Switzerland are eligible, irrespective of their healthcare setting and employment status. Baseline and annual follow-up electronic surveys will take place once a year, featuring both core questions and modules developed according to information needs. While outcome variables are HCPs’ trajectories, well-being, intention to stay in or leave the position/profession/health sector, independent variables include organizational, psychosocial, and psychological determinants, as well as occupational (professional) and sociodemographic factors. The qualitative phase will be organized every two years, inviting participants who agreed to take part in this phase. The findings from quantitative analyses, along with the issues raised by healthcare stakeholders in the field, will guide the topics investigated in the qualitative phase.</p> Discussion <p>Using innovative methodologies, SCOHPICA will gather nationwide and longitudinal data on HCPs practicing in Switzerland. These data could have numerous implications: promoting the development of research related to HCPs’ well-being and retention intentions; supporting the development of policies to improve working conditions and career prospects; contributing to the evolution of training curricula for future or current healthcare professionals; aiding in the development of health systems capable of delivering quality care; and finally, providing the general public and stakeholders with free and open access to the study results through an online dashboard.</p>","author":"Isabelle Peytremann-Bridevaux","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7577fd43752cc70399d1aec5cbc89910a45c0912a87d5d4699be93b016e836f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
