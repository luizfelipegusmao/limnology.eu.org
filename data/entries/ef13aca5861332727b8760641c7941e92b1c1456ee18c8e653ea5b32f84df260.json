{"title":"Timing and Graded BMP Signalling Determines Fate of Neural Crest and Ectodermal Placode Derivatives from Pluripotent Stem Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0914/v1","date":1726119672000,"content":"Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) hold many potential research and clinical benefits due to their ability to differentiate into nearly every cell type in the body. They are often used as model systems for early stages of ontogenesis to better understand key developmental pathways, and for drug screening. However, in order to fully realise the potential of PSCs and their translational applications, a deeper understanding of developmental pathways, especially in humans, is required. Several signalling molecules play important roles during development and are required for proper differentiation of PSCs. The concentration and timing of signal activation is important, with perturbations resulting in improper development and/or pathology. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) is one such key signalling molecule involved in the specification and differentiation of various cell types and tissues in the human body including tooth and otic development. In this review, we describe the role of BMP signalling and its regulation, the consequences of BMP dysregulation in disease and differentiation, and how PSCs can be used to investigate the effects of BMP modulation during development, mainly focusing on otic development. Finally, we emphasise the unique role of BMP4 in otic specification and how refined knowledge in controlling its regulation could lead to the generation of more robust and reproducible human PSC-derived otic organoids for research and translational applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef13aca5861332727b8760641c7941e92b1c1456ee18c8e653ea5b32f84df260","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
