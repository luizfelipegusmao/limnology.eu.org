{"title":"First-Trimester Preeclampsia-Induced Disturbance in Maternal Blood Serum Proteome: A Pilot Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1802/v1","date":1724726072000,"content":"Preeclampsia (PE) is a complex and multifaceted obstetric syndrome characterized by several distinct molecular subtypes. It complicates up to 5% of pregnancies and significantly contributes to maternal and newborn morbidity, thereby diminishing the long-term quality of life for affected women. Due to the widespread dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of existing approaches for assessing PE risk, there is a pressing need for ongoing research to identify newer, more accurate predictors. This study aimed to investigate early changes in the maternal serum proteome and associated signaling pathways. The levels of 125 maternal serum proteins at 11-13 weeks of gestation were quantified using liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-MRM MS) with the BAK-125 kit. Ten serum proteins emerged as potential early markers for PE: Apolipoprotein M (APOM), Complement C1q subcomponent subunit B (C1QB), Lysozyme (LYZ), Prothrombin (F2), Albumin (ALB), Zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (AZGP1), Tenascin-X (TNXB), Alpha-1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1), Attractin (ATRN), and Apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4). Notably, nine of these proteins have previously been associated with PE in prior research, underscoring the consistency and reliability of our findings. These proteins play key roles in critical molecular processes, including complement and coagulation cascades, platelet activation, and insulin-like growth factor pathways. To improve the early prediction of PE, a highly effective Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was developed, analyzing 19 maternal serum proteins from the first trimester. This model achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.91, with 87% sensitivity and 95% specificity, and a hazard ratio (HR) of 13.5 (4.6 - 40.8) with p&amp;lt;0.001. These findings demonstrate that serum protein-based SVM models possess significantly higher predictive power compared to the routine first-trimester screening test, highlighting their superior utility in the early detection and risk stratification of PE.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d440b2a9fd67a748433157e0abbbc50739ff3918b8fa03fab8ea959198ac228c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
