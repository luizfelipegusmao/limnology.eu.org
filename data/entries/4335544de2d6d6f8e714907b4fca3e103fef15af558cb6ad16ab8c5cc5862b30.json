{"title":"Hydric physiology and ecology of a federally endangered desert lizard","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae019/7665352?rss=1","date":1714953600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Animals can respond to extreme climates by behaviourally avoiding it or by physiologically coping with it. We understand behavioural and physiological thermoregulation, but water balance has largely been neglected. Climate change includes both global warming and changes in precipitation regimes, so improving our understanding of organismal water balance is increasingly urgent. We assessed the hydric physiology of US federally endangered blunt-nosed leopard lizards (<span>Gambelia sila</span>) by measuring cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL), plasma osmolality and body condition. Measurements were taken throughout their active season, the short period of year when these lizards can be found aboveground. Compared to a more mesic species, <span>G. sila</span> had low CEWL which is potentially desert-adaptive, and high plasma osmolality that could be indicative of dehydration. We hypothesized that throughout the <span>G. sila</span> active season, as their habitat got hotter and drier, <span>G. sila</span> would become more dehydrated and watertight. Instead, CEWL and plasma osmolality showed minimal change for females and non-linear change for males, which we hypothesize is connected to sex-specific reproductive behaviours and changes in food availability. We also measured thermoregulation and microhabitat use, expecting that more dehydrated lizards would have lower body temperature, poorer thermoregulatory accuracy and spend less time aboveground. However, we found no effect of CEWL, plasma osmolality or body condition on these thermal and behavioural metrics. Finally, <span>G. sila</span> spends considerable time belowground in burrows, and burrows may serve not only as essential thermal refugia but also hydric refugia.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"4335544de2d6d6f8e714907b4fca3e103fef15af558cb6ad16ab8c5cc5862b30","category":"Environment"}
