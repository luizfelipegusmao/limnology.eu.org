{"title":"Effects of Including Resource Intermittency ofWind and Solar Technologies in OSeMOSYS Modelling Tool","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0346/v1","date":1728043738000,"content":"This study proposes a simplified and fully renewable energy system, composed of two intermittent energy sources (wind and solar) and a long-duration energy storage technology using pumped hydro storage. The impact of intermittency on the medium- and long-term design of the energy matrix is evaluated using the OSeMOSYS model. The findings indicate that omitting intermittency results in a significant underestimation of costs and an inability to manage the variability of renewable energies effectively. Incorporating intermittency, although increasing the installed capacity and the amount of wasted energy, enhances the system's reliability. The inclusion of energy storage demonstrates the need to redistribute installed capacity in favor of solar energy to meet higher daytime demand. The study concludes that considering intermittency and storage is crucial for improving the accuracy of energy models, reducing losses, and optimizing operational costs in renewable energy-based systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"725f41f7b900f63308daf281307466de1d7ddb2d0d0bf0a8de0f7a82837204db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
