{"title":"Development of a PCR-based assay for specific and sensitive detection of <i>Fusarium buharicum</i> from infected okra plant","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302256","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Swapan Kumar Paul, Dipali Rani Gupta, Masatoshi Ino, Makoto Ueno</p>\r\n\r\nFusarium wilt, caused by the fungus <i>Fusarium buharicum</i>, is an emerging disease of okra in Japan. The disease was first reported in Japan in 2015, causing significant damage to okra seedlings. Due to the potential threat in okra cultivation, the development of an accurate detection method for <i>F</i>. <i>buharicum</i> is needed for the surveillance and management of the disease. In this study, we designed a primer set and developed conventional and nested PCR assays for the specific detection of <i>F</i>. <i>buharicum</i> in infected okra plants and contaminated soil, respectively. We compared the diversity of the translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1Î±) gene of <i>F</i>. <i>buharicum</i> with 103 other fungal species/isolates to design a species-specific primer. This primer pair successfully amplified approximately 400 bp of PCR product that was only detected in the <i>F</i>. <i>buharicum</i> isolate, not in the other fungal isolates. The developed nested PCR method was highly sensitive and could detect the fungus from a 0.01 fg DNA sample. The primer successfully detected the pathogen in artificially infected plants and soil by conventional and nested PCR, respectively. This is the first report of the development of the <i>F</i>. <i>buharicum</i>-specific primer set and detection assays, which can be used for the specific and sensitive detection of <i>F</i>. <i>buharicum</i> in field samples and for taking early control measures.","author":"Swapan Kumar Paul","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8426f476c58788769e268cf16f5a5375878e57f8134067c3085246159c4e571a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
