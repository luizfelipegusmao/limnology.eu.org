{"title":"The Fabaceae in northeastern Mexico II (Subfamilies Caesalpinioideae, Cercidoideae, and Detarioideae)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0408/v1","date":1712301830000,"content":"As part of the Fabaceae project of northeastern Mexico, today we present the compendium of legumes of the subfamilies Caesalpinioideae, Cercidoideae and Detarioideae from this region. As in our previous work on the Mimosoideae Clade, new nomenclatural changes and retypification of genera of the subfamily Caesalpinioideae are included. Also, based on new scientific information published, the taxonomic changes in new genera, recently segregated from the genus Caesalpinia (Conzattia, Coulteria, Denisophytum, Erythrostemon, Guilandina, Hoffmannseggia, and Pomaria) are included. Based on field work, collection of botanical samples over the past 37 years, and reviewing botanical materials in national and international herbaria, the diversity of legumes of the subfamilies Caesalpinioideae, Cercidoideae, and Detarioideae in northeastern Mexico has been recorded. The subfamily Caesalpinioideae includes two tribes, the tribe Caesalpinieae with 12 genera (Caesalpinia, Ceratonia, Coulteria, Delonix, Denisophytum, Erythrostemon, Gleditsia, Guilandina, Hoffmannseggia, Haematoxylum, Parkinsonia, and Pomaria), and 26 species and the tribe Cassieae, which includes three genera (Cassia, Chamaecrita, and Senna) and 28 species. The subfamily Cercidoideae include two genera (Bauhinia and Cercis), and eight species and the subfamily Detarioideae, includes only one genus and one species (Tamarindus indicus). The total flora of these three subfamilies comprize 18 genera and 63 species, it includes 56 native species and seven exotic ones: Bauhinia variegata, Cassia fistula, Ceratonia siliqua, Delonix regia, Erythrostemon gilliesii, Senna alata, and, Tamarindus indicus. The endemism of both subfamilies includes a total of 20 species and 10 infraspecific categories.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea43998a1b09543c0607b71858bcb0b5fbf9aca4033641e34294b88c406fe8ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
