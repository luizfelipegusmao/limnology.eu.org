{"title":"Emerging Risk to Dengue in Asian Metropolitan Areas Under Global Warming","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024EF004548?af=R","date":1721752716000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Aedes</i> sp. mosquitoes are changing their geographic range in response to climate change. This is of concern because these mosquitoes can carry dengue fever and other viral diseases. Changing weather patterns can also increase the numbers of <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes, leading to greater human exposure and enhancing population health risks. We project the geographic distribution of <i>Aedes</i> and associated changes in populations exposed to dengue in Asian metropolitan areas under warming scenarios from 1.5°C to 5.0°C above pre-industrial temperatures, using multi-model ensembles. With global warming, the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, the coast of the Arabian Sea in southern Iran, southern Pakistan in West Asia, the Korean Peninsula, most of the Japanese islands, and parts of North China in East Asia are projected to become suitable for dengue transmission. The numbers of metropolitan areas exposed to dengue is projected to change from 142 (48%) in the reference period (1995–2014) to 211 (71%) at 5.0°C warming. With the combined impact of socioeconomic and climate change, population exposure to dengue in Asian metropolitan areas is projected to increase from 263 (multi-model range 252–268) million in 1995–2014 to 411 (394–432) million, 446 (420–490) million, 509 (475–601), 558 (493–685) and 587 (529–773) million, respectively, at 1.5°C, 2.0°C, 3.0°C, 4.0°C and 5°C warming, with an average of 2.9 million new people exposed to dengue fever in metropolitan areas each year.</p>","author":"Cheng Jing, \nGuojie Wang, \nKristie L.
