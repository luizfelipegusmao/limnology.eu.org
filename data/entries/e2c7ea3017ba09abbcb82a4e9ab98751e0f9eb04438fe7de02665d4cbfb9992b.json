{"title":"Lianas in tropical dry seasonal forests have a high hydraulic efficiency but not always a higher embolism resistance than lianas in rainforests","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/134/2/337/7667522?rss=1","date":1715212800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>Lianas have higher relative abundance and biomass in drier seasonal forests than in rainforests, but whether this difference is associated with their hydraulic strategies is unclear. Here, we investigate whether lianas of seasonally dry forests are safer and more efficient in water transport than rainforest lianas, explaining patterns of liana abundance.<div>Methods</div>We measured hydraulic traits on five pairs of congeneric lianas of the tribe Bignonieae in two contrasting forest sites: the wet ‘Dense Ombrophilous Forest’ in Central Amazonia (~2 dry months) and the drier ‘Semideciduous Seasonal Forest’ in the inland Atlantic Forest (~6 dry months). We also gathered a broader database, including 197 trees and 58 liana species from different tropical forests, to compare hydraulic safety between habits and forest types.<div>Key Results</div>Bignonieae lianas from both forests had high and similar hydraulic efficiency but exhibited variability in resistance to embolism across forest types when phylogenetic relationships were taken into account. Three genera had higher hydraulic safety in the seasonal forest than in the rainforest, but species across both forests had similar positive hydraulic safety margins despite lower predawn water potential values of seasonal forest lianas. We did not find the safety–efficiency trade-off. Merging our results with previously published data revealed a high variability of resistance to embolism in both trees and lianas, independent of forest types.<div>Conclusions</div>The high hydraulic efficiency of lianas detected here probably favours their rapid growth across tropical forests, but differences in hydraulic safety highlight that some species are highly vulnerable and may rely on other mechanisms to cope with drought. Future research on the lethal dehydration threshold and the connection between hydraulic resistance strategies and liana abundance could offer further insights into tropical forest dynamics under climatic threats.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"e2c7ea3017ba09abbcb82a4e9ab98751e0f9eb04438fe7de02665d4cbfb9992b","category":"Environment"}
