{"title":"Advancing BiVO4 Photoanode Activity for Ethylene Glycol Oxidation via Strategic pH Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1127/v1","date":1715899225000,"content":"The photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion of organic small molecules offers a dual benefit of synthesizing value-added chemicals and concurrently producing hydrogen (H2). Ethylene glycol, with its dual hydroxyl groups, stands out as a versatile organic substrate capable of yielding various C1 and C2 chemicals. In this study, we demonstrate that pH modulation markedly enhances the photocurrent of BiVO4 photoanodes, thus facilitating the efficient oxidation of ethylene glycol while simultaneously generating H2. Our findings reveal that in a pH=1 ethylene glycol solution, the photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE can attain an impressive 7.1 mA cmâˆ’2, significantly surpassing the outputs in neutral and highly alkaline environments. The increase in photocurrent is attributed to the augmented adsorption of ethylene glycol on BiVO4 under acidic conditions, which in turn elevates the activity of the oxidation reaction, culminating in the maximal production of formic acid. This investigation sheds light on the pivotal role of electrolyte pH in the PEC oxidation process and underscores the potential of the PEC strategy for biomass valorization into value-added products alongside H2 fuel generation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a99016f1d4181f99016a6df948a486c38e6b1f5a5bb2c8887c02bd71bfe482bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
