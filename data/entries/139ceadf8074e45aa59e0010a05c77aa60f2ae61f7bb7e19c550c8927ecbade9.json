{"title":"Role for gene conversion in the evolution of cell-surface antigens of the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002507","date":1709820000000,"content":"<p>by Brice Letcher, Sorina Maciuca, Zamin Iqbal</p>\r\n\r\nWhile the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> has low average genome-wide diversity levels, likely due to its recent introduction from a gorilla-infecting ancestor (approximately 10,000 to 50,000 years ago), some genes display extremely high diversity levels. In particular, certain proteins expressed on the surface of human red blood cellâ€“infecting merozoites (merozoite surface proteins (MSPs)) possess exactly 2 deeply diverged lineages that have seemingly not recombined. While of considerable interest, the evolutionary origin of this phenomenon remains unknown. In this study, we analysed the genetic diversity of 2 of the most variable MSPs, DBLMSP and DBLMSP2, which are paralogs (descended from an ancestral duplication). Despite thousands of available Illumina WGS datasets from malaria-endemic countries, diversity in these genes has been hard to characterise as reads containing highly diverged alleles completely fail to align to the reference genome. To solve this, we developed a pipeline leveraging genome graphs, enabling us to genotype them at high accuracy and completeness. Using our newly- resolved sequences, we found that both genes exhibit 2 deeply diverged lineages in a specific protein domain (DBL) and that one of the 2 lineages is shared across the genes. We identified clear evidence of nonallelic gene conversion between the 2 genes as the likely mechanism behind sharing, leading us to propose that gene conversion between diverged paralogs, and not recombination suppression, can generate this surprising genealogy; a model that is furthermore consistent with high diversity levels in these 2 genes despite the strong historical <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> transmission bottleneck.","author":"Brice Letcher","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"139ceadf8074e45aa59e0010a05c77aa60f2ae61f7bb7e19c550c8927ecbade9","category":"Environment"}
