{"title":"Crop-Derived Biochar for Removal of Alachlor from Water","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1277/v1","date":1729078440000,"content":"The presence of various pesticides in natural streams and wastewater is a significant environmental issue due to their high toxicity, which causes harmful consequences even at low quantities. One cost-effective method to remove these pollutants from water could be through adsorption using inexpensive, easily obtained adsorbent - biochar. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using biochar produced from wheat grains to eliminate alachlor from water. The sorption properties of the biochar and the likely removal mechanisms have been defined. The study found that the biochar removed 76-94% of alachlor, depending on the initial concentration of the pesticide in water. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R² = 0.999) and the Langmuir isotherm model (R² = 0.996) effectively characterized the elimination of alachlor by wheat grains biochar. The analyzed biochar, with its micropores and various surface functional groups, can effectively adsorb alachlor and trap it within its structure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6945f9da189d8e39810fa0f787c812719c64529db763b12f3b4328bcfca9bf4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
