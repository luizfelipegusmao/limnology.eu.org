Thus, it predicts increased occurrence of residence at reproductive age. In contrast, the body size hypothesis proposes age-independent benefits of residence for large individuals, who should exhibit greater winter tolerance. Despite different expectations in age patterns for the two hypotheses in long-lived partially migrant species, there is little empirical work investigating the ontogeny of migratory phenotypic expression, that is the expression of residence or migration.\n\nWe investigated the influence of age, sex and body size on migratory phenotype throughout ontogeny (from first year to early adulthood) in a long-lived partially migrant species, the red kite <i>Milvus milvus</i>. We GPS-tracked 311 individuals tagged as juveniles and 70 individuals tagged as adults over multiple years, yielding 881 observed annual cycles. From this data, we estimated age-dependent probabilities of the transition to residence and of survival in migrants and residents using a Bayesian multistate capture-recapture model, as well as the probability of resuming migration once resident. We then calculated the resulting proportion of residents per age class.\n\nIn both sexes, almost all juveniles migrated in their first winter, after which the probability of becoming resident gradually increased with age class to approximately 0.3 in adults (&gt;3 calendar years). A size effect in third calendar year females suggests that large females adopt residence earlier in life than small females. The transition from residence back to migration only occurred with a probability of 0.15 across all resident individuals. In addition, survival was notably reduced in adult male migrants compared to adult male residents. These results are largely consistent with the arrival-time and body size hypotheses, simultaneously.\n\nOur results reveal a plastic, yet primarily directional within-individual change in migratory phenotype towards more residence with increasing age, varying between sexes and between individuals of different size. This study highlights that different individual characteristics can jointly shape the ontogeny of migratory behaviour and result in complex within-population patterns and persistence of migratory phenotypes.\n</p>","author":"Stephanie Witczak, \nUrs Kormann, \nMichael Schaub, \nSteffen Oppel, \nMartin U.
