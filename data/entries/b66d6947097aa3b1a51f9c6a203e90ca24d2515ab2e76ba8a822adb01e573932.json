{"title":"Organic Acids as Antibiotics Alternatives in Poultry Field: Recent Advances","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1770/v1","date":1724634252000,"content":"Feed additive antibiotics have been used for many decades as growth promotors or antibacterial substances world-wide. However, the adverse impacts of using antibiotics in animal or poultry feeds were informed. Therefore, searching for alternatives such as probiotics, prebiotics, phytobiotics, post-biotics, bacteriophages, enzymes, essential oils, or organic acids (OAs) became urgent. The OAs are produced by beneficial intestinal bacteria through the fermentation process of carbohydrates. The OAs and their salts are still used as feed preservatives. They have been long added to feed in order to minimize contamination and growth of harmful bacteria and fungi, reduce the deterioration, as well as prolong the shelf life of feed commodities. Moreover, they have been mostly added to poultry feed as a blend to obtain a maximum beneficial effects. The supplementation of poultry with OAs could improve the growth performance parameters and carcass traits, promote utilization of nutrients, boost the immune response, and inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, this review article provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of using OAs-antibiotics alternative in reducing the microbial load, enhancing the performance parameters in broilers and layers, improving the gut heath, as well as boosting of the immune response.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b66d6947097aa3b1a51f9c6a203e90ca24d2515ab2e76ba8a822adb01e573932","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
