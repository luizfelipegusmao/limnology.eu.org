{"title":"Seasonality of Psoriasis: From Genes to the Clinical Phenomena","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1222/v1","date":1724031217000,"content":"Psoriasis is a multifactorial, chronic, and inflammatory disease that severely impacts patientsâ€™ quality of life. The disease is caused by genetic irregularities affected by the epigenetic and environmental factors. Some of these factors may include the seasonal changes, such as solar radiation, air pollution and humidity, and changes in circadian rhythm, especially in the temporal and polar zones. Thus, some psoriasis patients report seasonal variability of symptoms. Through a comprehensive review, we aim to delve deeper into the intricate interplay between seasonality, environmental factors, and the genetic and epigenetic landscape of psoriasis. By elucidating these complex relationships, we strive to provide insights that may inform targeted interventions and personalized management strategies for individuals living with psoriasis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7fc55e24ae2622c63b2bca2c1428db9e66cf75d5ad8436614bde9c8ddc0e0ee4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
