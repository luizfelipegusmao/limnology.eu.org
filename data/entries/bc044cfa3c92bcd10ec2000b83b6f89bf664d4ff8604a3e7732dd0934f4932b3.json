{"title":"The Effects of Lactobacillus Plantarum and Cellulase on Mixed Silages of Amaranthus Hypochondriacus and Corn Meal: Fermentation Characteristics, Nutritional Value and Aerobic Stability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0639/v1","date":1718099765000,"content":"The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effects of moisture content, additives and their interactions on the fermentation quality, aerobic stability and in vitro digestibility of mixed silage of amaranth and corn meal. Amaranths and corn meal were mixed in mass ratios of 69:31, 76:24 and 84:16, and the silage water content was adjusted to 60% (W1), 65% (W2) and 70% (W3), respectively. Silage treatments included no additives (U), the addition of Lactobacillus plantarum (L), the addition of cellulase (E), and the addition of Lactobacillus plantarum + cellulase (M) mixed reagents. The results showed that pH and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N/TN) levels were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) in W1 compared to W2 and W3. At the same time, dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), in vitro dry matter digestibility (ivDMD), in vitro dry matter digestibility (ivDMD), in vitro organic matter digestibility (ivOMD), and in vitro crude protein digestibility (ivCPD) were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, the aerobic stability of mixed silage of seed amaranth and corn meal decreased with increasing water content. The aerobic stability of the L, E, and M treatment groups was improved by 15, 105, and 111 hours, respectively, compared to the control group at W1. pH and NH3-N/TN levels were lower in the addition of E (E and M) than in the absence of E (U and L) (3.73, 20.1 g kg−1DM vs. 3.64, 22.9 g kg−1 DM, p &lt; 0.05).NDF and ADF were significantly lower with the addition of E than without the addition of E (598 g kg−1 DM, 145 g kg−1 DM vs. 632 g kg−1 DM, 160 g kg−1 DM, p &lt; 0.05). However, CP, ivDMD, ivOMD, and ivCPD were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05). AA and NH3-N/TN were significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) with the addition of L (L and M) compared to without the addition of (U and E). In conclusion, the best fermentation quality, in vitro digestibility and aerobic stability of amaranth and cornmeal mixed silage treated with Lactobacillus plantarum + cellulase (M) were achieved at 60% water content.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc044cfa3c92bcd10ec2000b83b6f89bf664d4ff8604a3e7732dd0934f4932b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
