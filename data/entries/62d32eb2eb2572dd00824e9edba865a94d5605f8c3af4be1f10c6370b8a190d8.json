Due to growing risk, there is a need for a variety of accessible flood inundation services and information to improve resilience and adaptation outcomes. To better understand these needs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office for Coastal Management and the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services collaborated to host five virtual workshops during the COVID-19 pandemic to understand inundation needs and deficits of five professional sectors: coastal planning, transportation and navigation, realty and insurance, health and human services, and natural resource and floodplain managers. This paper outlines the information collected from these workshops, shares recommendations for future research to improve equitable coastal resilience and highlights the value of remote engagement for knowledge coproduction. From the project results, we share cross-cutting topics that emerged and propose a need for greater equity, inclusive engagement, interagency coordination and future research directions through scientist-stakeholder coproduction workshops for improved coastal resilience.</p>","author":"Brenna M.
