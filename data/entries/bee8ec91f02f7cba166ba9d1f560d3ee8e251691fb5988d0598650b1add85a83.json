{"title":"Hydroxycinnamic Acid Oligomers-Based Biostimulant Nurspray&reg; Enhances Tomato Yield, Fruit Quality, and Reduces Blossom-End Rot","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1463/v1","date":1726712986000,"content":"Nowadays, the global tomato production must cope with divers challenges including a high cost of inputs, losses due to pests and diseases and unfavourable climate changes. Although coping with climate change as a plant stressor may be an area that requires multifaceted commitment, using biostimulants emerges as an interesting option. Here, we aimed to determine the effect of Nurspray速, composed by hydroxycinnamic acid oligomers, on the yield and fruit quality of tomatoes grown under open-field conditions. Different application timing was tested to define strategies that lead to improving their agronomic impact and yield. The assessments were composed by the analysis of plant development (root systems, canopy, and flowering), plant physiological status, fruit quality and yield. The results showed the great potential of Nurspray速 as biostimulant, as they enhance crop growth, flowering, fruiting, yield, and yield quality, as well as promoting plant defence. Also, Nurspray速 showed a good level of biostimulant effect at different plant stage being the best application strategy the use of three doses at different times: early, intermediate, and advanced stages of the crop. With great clarity, we can affirm the huge potential of Nurspray速 and above all, the significant merit of being able to use this fertilizer in organic farming.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bee8ec91f02f7cba166ba9d1f560d3ee8e251691fb5988d0598650b1add85a83","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
