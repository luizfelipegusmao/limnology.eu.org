{"title":"Mechanistic insights into Retama raetam’s anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in A549 lung cancer cells: targeting PI3K/Akt pathway and ROS production","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae137/7747852?rss=1","date":1725235200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-cancer effects of the tropical desert plant <span>Retama raetam (R. raetam)</span> on the A549 NSCLC cell line. The research examined <span>R. raetam's</span> anti-proliferative effects, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cell morphology in NSCLC A549 and L-132 cells. In addition, the influence of <span>R. raetam</span> on DNA fragmentation, apoptotic signaling, and PI3K/Akt pathways for its anti-cancer mechanism was examined. Our results indicated that <span>R. raetam's</span> effects were dose- and time-dependent to exhibit anti-proliferative effects on A549 cells. <span>R. raetam</span> treatment promoted apoptotic cell death cycle arrest, increased apoptotic cells, depolarized the mitochondrial membrane, and induced morphological alterations in cells and nuclei. It also inhibited A549 cell migration (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), colonization, and invasiveness. Moreover, the study demonstrated that <span>R. raetam</span> treatment resulted in the upregulation of Bax expression, downregulation of Bcl-2 expression, and apoptotic fragmented DNA in A549 cells. The top five bioactive compounds derived from <span>R. raetam</span> exhibited molecular interactions that inhibit PIK3CA and AKT1. This inhibition leads to an increased frequency of apoptosis and subsequent death of cancer cells. Additionally, <span>R. raetam</span> extract induced an increase in ROS formation and cytochrome c levels, indicating that its toxic effects on A549 cells involve both ROS-dependent cytotoxicity through the disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential ΔΨm and ROS-independent cell cycle arrest through downregulation BCL-2, PARP, E-Cadherin, PI3K, and Akt expressions pathways.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"cc6825258cece67437abfe5ddf935770672806ae837b067ed376d00ebaed489d","category":"Environment"}
