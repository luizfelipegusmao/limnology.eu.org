{"title":"Impact of Feeding Vitamin D3 Encapsulated by Sulfur-Saturated Bovine Lactoferrin-Alginate Complex Coacervates Using Microbial Transglutaminase on the Immune Response of Late-Lactating Dairy Goats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1269/v1","date":1713441922000,"content":"Mastitis-causing bacteria can establish persistent infections in the mammary gland of commercially important dairy animals despite the presence of strong specific humoral and cellular immune mechanisms. The aim of this study was to encapsulate vitamin D3 by complex coacervation with sulfur-saturated bovine lactoferrin-alginate using microbial transglutaminase-catalyzed crosslinking and investigate the oral administration of encapsulated vitamin D3 in blood serum biomarkers of the immune response in late-lactating dairy goats. Dairy goats (n = 18) in late lactation were randomly assigned to three experimental groups (n = 6), after balancing weight. Dairy goats were orally administered with 0.35 mg vitamin D3/day in the unencapsulated form and 0.35 mg vitamin D3/day in the encapsulated powder form. Another group received the basal diet. The experimental period lasted 6 weeks. The blood serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25-(OH)-D3], lactoferrin, immunoglobulin A (IgA), and interferon-gamma (INF-γ) were measured. The delivery of vitamin D3 to dairy goats resulted in a marked increase of 25-(OH)-D3 concentration in serum while the serum level of lactoferrin also increased. Alternatively, the serum levels of IgA and the immunomodulatory cytokine INF-γ were elevated following supplementation with the encapsulated vitamin D3. Overall, the capsules in the powder form used in this study kept vitamin D3 highly bioavailable.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"12c42f7bc70e2a312d7a28f58a684599c41675a3b75bebf975eaaeaeeae72646","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
