Typically, this formation is undesirable and may be a source of pain, discomfort, paralysis, or even death for the organism, yet some organisms use this process to grow useful components. In response, particles of biomineralized tissue have been studied historically, and continue to hold significant research interest across the scientific, medical, and commercial communities.
