However, disruptions in TB and HIV treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic threatened to reverse this. This study aimed to identify adaptations in HIV and TB service delivery models in response to COVID-19 and government restrictions. This information informed the development of an online survey, which was utilized as part of a consultation exercise to further capture adaptations made to HIV/TB service delivery within the South African context. The literature review involved screening 380 titles and abstracts, identifying 30 HIV and TB studies across 19 countries, and categorizing 90 individual interventions into ten thematic areas. Common themes included interventions addressing screening, testing, diagnosis, medication collection and delivery support, and virtual models. Digital health interventions and adaptations to medication collection/delivery were reported in 38% of studies. Analysis of survey responses from 33 stakeholders in South Africa revealed that 47% of interventions targeted HIV, 11% TB, and 23% HIV/TB integrated service delivery. Most interventions (81%) were integrated into the national HIV or TB program, with implementation occurring at various levels: 39% at facility level, 35% at sub-district or district level, and 18% at provincial level. Programmatic data was available for 86% of interventions, with 50% being funded. This study demonstrated that services can be delivered in locations other than in health facilities (e.g., community-based or home-based) and that integrated services can also free up additional resources. Although studies varied, COVID-19 accelerated the adoption of differentiated service delivery (DSD) models for TB care, including multi-month dispensing (MMD) for TB preventative therapy (TPT) and TB treatment, home-based or mobile outreach screening and testing, and community pickup points (PuP) for TB medications. These initiatives had previously lagged behind HIV-focused DSD models, and it is crucial to sustain these services beyond the pandemic. To achieve universal health coverage, it will also be important to capitalize on these experiences and learn from HIV-focused DSD models so programs can deliver integrated person-centered chronic care services for TB, HIV, and non-communicable diseases.","author":"Michael Galvin","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"b1afe667b5ad78ee43f831d2360304e6f9309522d0e13f9496682b6163d6ded3","category":"Environment"}
