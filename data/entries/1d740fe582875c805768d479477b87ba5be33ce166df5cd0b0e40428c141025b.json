{"title":"Strophantus (Apocynaceae): Composition and Biochemical Properties with a Focus on S. sarmentosus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1390/v1","date":1716286371000,"content":"The genus Strophantus belongs to the Apocynaceae family of flowering plants which grows primarily in tropical Africa. The plants are widely used in traditional herbal medicine. S.Â sarmentosus, in particular, is used for the treatment of, e.g., joint pain and rheumatoid arthritis, wound infections, head lice, diarrhoea, snake bite, and eye conditions. Despite the widespread use, dedicated research characterizing bioactive plant components is scarce. Investigations focussed mainly on the cardenolides, because of their cardioactivity and historical use as cardiotonic. There are also studies concerning the antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of plant extracts. This review summarizes the present knowledge about the biochemical and analytical reserach on Strophantus, in general, and S. sarmentosus, in particular, and describes the current state-of-the-field based on the available sientific literature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d740fe582875c805768d479477b87ba5be33ce166df5cd0b0e40428c141025b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
