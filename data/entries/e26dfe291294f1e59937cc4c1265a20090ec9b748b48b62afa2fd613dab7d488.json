{"title":"Interventions targeting young people not in employment, education or training (NEET) for increased likelihood of return to school or employment—A systematic review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306285","date":1719496800000,"content":"<p>by Tonje Holte Stea, Thomas Bjerregaard Bertelsen, Liv Fegran, Ellen Sejersted, Annette Løvheim Kleppang, Tonje Fyhn</p>\r\n\r\nThe present systematic review aims to identify, synthesize, and evaluate evidence of effects from interventions targeting youth not in education, employment, or training (NEET). We searched relevant multidisciplinary databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized re-engagement trials. Primary outcomes were participation in education and employment, and training status. Secondary outcomes included changes in financial status, quality of life and well-being, social functioning, and physical, psychological, and behavioral outcomes. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and PRISMA guidelines were applied. Eligible studies were screened, included, and extracted for data. Nine trials were included (eight RCTs and one quasi-experimental study), in which samples ranged from 96 to 7346 participants. Results on primary outcomes showed that five studies found an effect of interventions on employment outcomes, while three studies indicated an effect on education or training. Results on secondary outcomes included effects on mental health, subjective health complaints, drug use, self-esteem, and self-efficacy. Studies with other main outcomes than re-engagement showed an effect of interventions on pass rates for the driving test, independent housing, and increased job-seeking activities. Limitations and future directions are discussed, including the lack of rigorous studies, theoretical underpinnings, and standardized measures for re-engagement outcomes.\r\nSystematic review registration: registered in PROSPERO, CRD42023463837.","author":"Tonje Holte Stea","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e26dfe291294f1e59937cc4c1265a20090ec9b748b48b62afa2fd613dab7d488","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
