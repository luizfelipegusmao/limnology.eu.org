{"title":"Anatomy, Histology, and Function of the Major Pelvic Ganglion Across Various Animal Species","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0892/v1","date":1723534655000,"content":"This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the pelvic plexus and its regulation across various mammalian species, including rats, cats, dogs, and pigs. The pelvic and hypogastric nerves play crucial roles in regulating pelvic functions such as micturition, defecation, and erection. The anatomical organization of these nerves varies, forming either well-defined ganglia or complex plexuses. Despite these variations, the neurons within these structures are consistently regulated by key neurotransmittersâ€”norepinephrine and acetylcholine. These neurons also possess receptors for testosterone and prolactin, particularly in rats, indicating the significant role of these hormones in neuronal function and development. Moreover, neuropeptides such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P, neuropeptide Y (NPY), somatostatin (SOM), galanin (GAL), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are co-released with neurotransmitters to modulate pelvic functions. This review highlights the complex interplay between neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and hormones in regulating pelvic physiology and emphasizes the importance of hormonal regulation in maintaining the functionality and health of the pelvic plexus across different species.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00f8ef97acb409c424d1feffac7a17d63b10c4d5d103b93208a9d0ac46968701","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
