{"title":"Antibiotic Release and Mechanical Performance of PMMA Bone Cement: Findings from In Vitro Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2386/v1","date":1722404549000,"content":"Using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement is widespread in orthopedic surgeries for implant fixation and as a carrier for antibiotic delivery to prevent and treat infections. This review comprehensively evaluates in vitro studies investigating the antibiotic elution profiles and mechanical properties of PMMA bone cement. We explore the kinetics of antibiotic release, factors influencing elution efficiency, and the impact of various antibiotics on the mechanical properties of PMMA composites. At the same time, we examine how the inclusion of antibiotics affects the mechanical integrity of PMMA, including parameters such as compressive strength, tensile strength, and fatigue resistance. Through a detailed analysis of these studies, this review aims to provide insights into optimizing PMMA bone cement formulations for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and structural performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0563679b747b853d56d79258bdcd8e53dc0ba49c21e19677ad50183a4b195b6b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
