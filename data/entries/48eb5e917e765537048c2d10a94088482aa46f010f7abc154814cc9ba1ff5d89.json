This gives rise to macromolecular crowding (MC) effects, which include slower diffusion, formation of protein complexes and oligomers, and driving proteins into more compact shapes [<a href=\"#ozae044.394-B1\">1</a>]. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in MC. Due to high sensitivity of the MC effects to small perturbations in protein concentration, crowding is believed to directly control many biological processes [<a href=\"#ozae044.394-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"48eb5e917e765537048c2d10a94088482aa46f010f7abc154814cc9ba1ff5d89","category":"Environment"}
