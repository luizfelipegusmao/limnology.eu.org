{"title":"Incongruence between residential uses and perceptions of fertilizers and deicers","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306550","date":1721397600000,"content":"<p>by Heather D.

While fertilizer use is well researched, deicer use on private properties is not. This research aims to ascertain whether patterns of fertilizer use are different from those of deicer use in Hamilton County, Ohio, and determine what factors influence a resident’s decision to use these materials. Survey data were collected from 110 single-family households (38.9% response rate). Respondents are motivated by property appearance to apply fertilizers. Deicer use stems from safety concerns. Respondents were significantly more likely to consider the environmental impact of fertilizers than deicers. Respondents felt that using deicers is a more neighborly practice while using fertilizers reflects more positively on them in their neighborhood. This information can be used to develop outreach programs to reduce the environmental impacts of fertilizers and deicers.","author":"Heather D.
