{"title":"Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass-derived compounds to 2-ethylhexanol: a review","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10311-024-01710-w","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The demand for 2-ethylhexanol is rising in several sectors, yet this chemical is actuallyÂ almost exclusively produced from petroleum resources, calling for sustainable alternatives. Here we review the production of 2-ethylhexanol from lignocellulosic biomass-derived chemicals with emphasis on 2-ethylhexanol synthesis and applications. 2-Ethylhexanol can be synthesized from ethanol, butanol, butyraldehyde, and syngas. Applications comprise biofuels, lubricants, plasticizers, and surfactants.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"6011a23a10276560635b8ab7a1d54bb15c92e2546539e0b6f32f874108ced689","category":"Environment"}
