{"title":"Remote Sensing of River Discharge From Medium‐Resolution Satellite Imagery Based on Deep Learning","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036880?af=R","date":1726220274000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Accurate monitoring of river discharge variations is essential for managing floods and droughts and understanding the response of global river systems to climate change. Remote sensing of discharge (RSQ) offers a timely and efficient alternative for widespread monitoring, particularly in ungauged areas. Current methods often struggle with accuracy, especially when estimating the width of narrow rivers from medium-resolution images. We first observe that, although estimating the width variation of narrow rivers can be challenging from medium-resolution satellite imagery, river discharge still correlates with river surface color or reflectance. However, existing methods can only correlate river surface reflectance with discharge in gauged rivers. Here, we introduce a novel method employing an advanced Transformer architecture to map river discharge variations directly from time-series reflectance imagery. Our model, trained on quality-checked data from 2,036 discharge gauges, outperforms existing methods in discharge estimation accuracy and is less affected by the need for precise river width estimation. The proposed model yields positive Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) in 68.6% of ungauged rivers, a substantial improvement over the BAM and geoBAM methods, which show positive KGEs in only 28.4% and 33.1% of rivers, respectively. Notably, this performance is achieved despite two-thirds of the rivers being less than 100 m wide, a range where traditional RSQ methods typically struggle, and the RSQ performance does not show degradation for braided rivers. Our approach suggests a significant shift toward more efficient, extensive, and adaptable space-based river discharge monitoring.</p>","author":"Zhen Hao, \nNaier Xiang, \nXiaobin Cai, \nMing Zhong, \nJin Jin, \nYun Du, \nFeng Ling","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"562644c04c1212d97ee7c63358b35acee4870a5d4404f84e41d3175f4fd4c21c","category":"Environment"}
