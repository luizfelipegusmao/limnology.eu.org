{"title":"POI Culprit Is POSSIBLY Gene Mutation: A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0046/v1","date":1717395733000,"content":"This review article delves into the multifaceted nature of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition marked by diminished ovarian function before age 40, underscoring the complexity of its aetiology encompassing genetic, autoimmune, infectious, and environmental factors. A significant focus is placed on the potential role of single-gene mutations, such as those in FMR1, BMP15, and GDF9, in the pathogenesis of POI, highlighting the intricate interplay between genetics and ovarian health. The article also explores innovative therapeutic avenues, including the activation of dormant follicles in vitro, offering hope for fertility restoration in affected individuals. Despite the prevalence of traditional treatments, such as Chinese medicine and hormone therapy, in China, these approaches often need to meet therapeutic needs, underscoring the urgency for advanced research and tailored treatment strategies. The discovery of a pituitary tumour-associated POI case further complicates the diagnostic landscape, suggesting a broader diagnostic lens and more in-depth research to unravel the complex underpinnings of POI and enhance patient care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7335fd4527fe218c0d594a3261621e5cd749103e0e89e97a571e393f3910ada5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
