{"title":"Racial, Ethnic, and Socioeconomic Disparities in Access to Critical Procedures in Patients Hospitalized with Cirrhosis Complications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1425/v1","date":1726666212000,"content":"Cirrhosis is a critical global health issue, responsible for 2.4% of deaths worldwide in 2019. The Global Burden of Disease Study reported a near doubling of decompensated cirrhosis cases from 1990 to 2017. In the U.S., cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death and often requires hospitali-zation and procedural interventions for severe complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal bleeding. This study aims to identify racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in receiving critical interventions among U.S. patients with de-compensated cirrhosis during 2020-2021. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis using 2020-2021 National Inpatient Sample data of adult patients (â‰¥18 years) with cirrhosis-related and cirrhosis complication-related ICD-10 codes and who underwent procedures for cirrhosis-related indications such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for variceal hemor-rhage, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for variceal hemorrhage or refractory ascites, hemodialysis for acute kidney failure or hepatorenal syndrome, and liver transplantation We collected data on patient baseline clinicodemographic and procedural outcomes. Statistical analyses included multivariable logistic regression to assess for associations with outcomes. There were significant disparities in procedure utilization: White and Hispanic patients more likely than Black patients to receive EGD and TIPS, while Black and Hispanic patients had higher odds of receiving hemodialysis. Insurance type also influenced access, with Private/HMO insurance holders having higher odds of undergoing procedures. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address healthcare inequities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ab4c600cefb2cba07697b821fc287148cfecc554ec8a8017dcd144e98e79b08","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
