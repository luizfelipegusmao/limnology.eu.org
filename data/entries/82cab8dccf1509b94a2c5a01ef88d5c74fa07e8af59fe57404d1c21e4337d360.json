{"title":"Study on Local Vibration Control of 100m X-BOW Polar Exploration Cruise Ship","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1001/v1","date":1713260243000,"content":"A finite element model of 100m X-BOW polar exploration cruise is established. The entire ship frequency response analysis was carried out, comparing the simulated values with the test values, the maximum error is 22%, but only 0.24mm/s difference, the error can be ignored from the perspective of comfort, therefore, the simulation results meet the requirements of engineering accuracy and verify the effectiveness of the model. According to the solution method for global modal equivalent mass, combing the spatial distribution principle of local modal mass, the method for solving the equivalent mass of a single local mode in mixed mode is proposed, the equivalent mass of the local vibration region of 100m X-BOW polar exploration cruise ship is solved by this method, tuned mass dampers mass ratio parameters are calculated using the equivalent mass. According to the analysis, tuned mass dampers has 31dB vibration absorption effect at 13.4Hz when the mass ratio is 0.05, it also has certain control effect at 10Hz and 18.8Hz, the control effect is 3dB and 2dB respectively, the overall control frequency band is flat and robust.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"82cab8dccf1509b94a2c5a01ef88d5c74fa07e8af59fe57404d1c21e4337d360","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
