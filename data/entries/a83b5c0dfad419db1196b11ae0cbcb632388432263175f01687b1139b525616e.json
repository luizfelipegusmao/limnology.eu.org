During the rapid growth, antlers are prioritized above the internal skeleton, causing cyclic physiological osteoporosis which ends after the antlers have completed growth and the internal skeleton recovers [<a href=\"#ozae044.280-B2\">2</a>]. These extraordinary features usually grow on male deer species and are used in the rut as they compete for dominance to mate. The exception to this is the species <span>Rangifer tarandus</span> (Reindeer), where the females also possess antlers. Male reindeer shed their antlers after the rutting season in autumn, whereas the female reindeer keep their antlers throughout the winter, shedding them in spring, using their antlers to defend patches of food against other reindeer [<a href=\"#ozae044.280-B3\">3</a>]. Previous comparative studies of male and female antlers have recommended further analysis to investigate their mechanical properties. A factor that was not considered in these prior studies is whether the females were calving or not - a factor that may impact the prioritization of minerals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a83b5c0dfad419db1196b11ae0cbcb632388432263175f01687b1139b525616e","category":"Environment"}
