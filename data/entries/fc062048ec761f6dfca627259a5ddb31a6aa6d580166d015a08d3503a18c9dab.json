{"title":"Lack of population structure in an important fishery species of mud shrimp, Trypaea australiensis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12682?af=R","date":1704954564000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>From a conservation standpoint, species that are managed without consideration of their population sizes and connectivity have the potential to be over-exploited and/or incur population decline. The burrowing shrimp, <i>Trypaea australiensis,</i> is an important ecosystem engineer and fishery resource caught in large numbers for which population information is unknown for properly managing the species. Here, we determined the level of population structure of <i>T. australiensis</i> across three locations along the East Coast of New South Wales, Australia, using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained through double digest Restriction-site Associated DNA-sequencing (ddRAD-seq). Analysis of population structure, including pairwise Fst (−0.003 to −0.001), STRUCTURE (<i>K</i> = 2) and Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) showed no evidence of structure among locations. Our findings provide crucial preliminary population genetic data for a key cryptic species, that also suggests gene flow among sampling locations enables the management of fisheries throughout the study area as a single unit.</p>","author":"Renae L.
