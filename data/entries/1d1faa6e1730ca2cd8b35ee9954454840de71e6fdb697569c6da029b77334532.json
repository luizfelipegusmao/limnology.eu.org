{"title":"Factors Determining Unique Thermal Resistance and Surface Properties of Silicone-Containing Composites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0658/v1","date":1728464736000,"content":"This review discusses the key factors influencing the exceptional thermal resistance and surface properties of silicone-containing composites. Silicone polymers, known for their excellent chemical and physical proper-ties, are widely used in a number of innovative products. In order to make silicone composites suitable for innovative applications, it is essential to ensure that they have both very good thermal resistance and su-perhydrophobic properties. Identification of the key factors influencing these properties enables the use of these composites in coatings, electronics and photovoltaic panels. The discussion includes the role of or-ganosilicon polymer structures and the incorporation of micro- and nano-additives to enhance the perfor-mance of these materials. Different methods for the modification and production of silicone composites are analyzed, with an emphasis on achieving thermal stability and surface superhydrophobicity simultaneously. The review highlights the growing demand for silicone-based coatings, driven by technological advances and environmental concerns. Furthermore, the role of surface modification and hierarchical surface structures in achieving these unique properties is discussed, as well as the potential applications and challenges in the development of next-generation silicone-containing materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d1faa6e1730ca2cd8b35ee9954454840de71e6fdb697569c6da029b77334532","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
