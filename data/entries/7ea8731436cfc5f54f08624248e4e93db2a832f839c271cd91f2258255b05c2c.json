{"title":"Examination of Operational Methods for a Low-temperature Aquifer Thermal Storage Air Conditioning System Based on Operational Performance and Considerations of Thermal Storage and Pumping Volume Balance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0591/v1","date":1715255898000,"content":"Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) systems are garnering attention as high-efficiency air conditioning technologies that contribute to the realization of a carbon-neutral society. This study focuses on an ATES system constructed in Japan, characterized by its complex geological conditions and thin aquifer layers. Through performance analysis using four years of operational data, we achieved a Coefficient of Performance (COP) of 5 on the building load side. This paper confirms the equivalence of the dimensionless production temperature and heat recovery rate, observing nearly identical changes in the dimensionless production temperature over four cycles (eight seasons). Furthermore, we propose an operational method for the following fiscal year that maintains the balance between accumulated storage quantity and pumping volume, based on predictions from this plant's operational pattern.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ea8731436cfc5f54f08624248e4e93db2a832f839c271cd91f2258255b05c2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
