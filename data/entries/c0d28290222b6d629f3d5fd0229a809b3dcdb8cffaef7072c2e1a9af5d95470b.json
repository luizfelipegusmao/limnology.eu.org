{"title":"A viral small interfering RNA-host plant mRNA pathway modulates virus-induced drought tolerance by enhancing autophagy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3219/7683254?rss=1","date":1716768000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Virus-induced drought tolerance presents a fascinating facet of biotic–abiotic interaction in plants, yet its molecular intricacies remain unclear. Our study shows that cowpea mild mottle virus (CPMMV) infection enhances drought tolerance in common bean (<span>Phaseolus vulgaris</span>) plants through a virus-derived small interfering RNA (vsiRNA)-activated autophagy pathway. Specifically, a 21 nt vsiRNA originating from the <span>CPMMV Triple Gene Block1</span> (<span>TGB1</span>) gene targeted the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the host Teosinte branched 1, Cycloidea, Proliferating Cell Factor (TCP) transcription factor gene <span>PvTCP2</span>, independent of the known role of TGB1 as an RNA silencing suppressor. This targeting attenuated the expression of <span>PvTCP2</span>, which encodes a transcriptional repressor, and in turn upregulated the core autophagy-related gene (ATG) <span>PvATG8c</span>, leading to activated autophagy activity surpassing the level induced by drought or CPMMV infection alone. The downstream EARLY RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION (ERD) effector PvERD15 is a homologue of <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span> AtERD15, which positively regulates stomatal aperture. PvERD15 was degraded in PvATG8c-mediated autophagy. Therefore, we establish a TGB1-PvTCP2-PvATG8c-PvERD15 module as a trans-kingdom fine-tuning mechanism that contributes to virus-induced drought tolerance in plant–drought–virus interactions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"c0d28290222b6d629f3d5fd0229a809b3dcdb8cffaef7072c2e1a9af5d95470b","category":"Environment"}
