The <span>Journal</span> serves both the Society of American Foresters (SAF) members and the larger science community in ensuring that information that can be used in management, policy, and future research will be of the highest quality and utility. My goal as EIC will be to ensure that quality remains high and that the utility increases to meet the ever-increasing demand for reliable information in a rapidly changing world.
