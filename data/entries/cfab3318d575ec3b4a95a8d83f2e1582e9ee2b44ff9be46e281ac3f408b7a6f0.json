{"title":"Design and Analysis of Novel Anti-rocking Bearing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1616/v1","date":1713949523000,"content":"In order to tackle the issue of severe rocking phenomenon under seismic conditions in structures equipped with steel spring isolation bearings, this paper investigates a novel type of anti-rocking bearing. Firstly, the structural configuration and working principle of the novel anti-rocking bearing are introduced, and a design method for bearing parameters is proposed. Secondly, a finite element analysis model is established using SAP2000 software to conduct nonlinear dynamic time history analysis under seismic loading. The analysis results show that the structural arrangement of the novel anti-rocking bearing reduces both the vertical displacement difference and the rocking angle of the isolation layer. The bearing exhibits a certain level of anti-rocking effect, but it may cause significant tensile forces in some bearings, necessitating the installation of anti-tensile reinforcement. The effectiveness of the anti-rocking effect improves as the stiffness of the steel tension rod in the bearing increases; however, it also leads to higher maximum tension in individual bearings as well as the total tension in all bearings. For structures equipped with the novel anti-rocking bearing, the acceleration amplifies under most cases, with amplification coefficients ranging from 0.82 to 1.55. The performance of the novel anti-rocking bearing varies significantly for different seismic waves. The stiffness of the steel tension rod should be determined considering the reference pressure of the bearing and the maximum designed tension of the bearing. Through the finite element simulation of the bearing, the mechanical properties of the bearing are basically the same as the theoretical analysis results. For the cylinder and the joint bearing, certain structural measures need to be taken to ensure its strength and stiffness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cfab3318d575ec3b4a95a8d83f2e1582e9ee2b44ff9be46e281ac3f408b7a6f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
