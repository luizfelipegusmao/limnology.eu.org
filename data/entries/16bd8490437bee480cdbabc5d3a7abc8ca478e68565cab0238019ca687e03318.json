{"title":"Thermodynamic Models of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC): A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0999/v1","date":1728898079000,"content":"In the delicate context of climate change and global warming new technologies are being investigated in order to reduce pollution. The solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stands out as one of the most promising fuel cell technologies for directly converting chemical energy into electrical energy, with the added benefit of potential integration into co-generation systems due to its high-temperature waste heat. They also offer multi-fuel flexibility, being able to operate on hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and more. Additionally, they could contribute to carbon sequestration efforts and, when paired with a gas turbine, achieve the highest efficiency in electricity generation for power plants. However, their development is still challenged by issues related to high-temperature materials, the design of cost-effective materials and manufacturing processes, and the optimization of efficient plant designs.To better understand SOFC operation, numerous mathematical models have been developed to solve transport equations coupled with electrochemical processes for three primary configurations: tubular, planar, and monolithic. These models capture reaction kinetics, including internal reforming chemistry. Recent advancements in modeling have significantly improved the design and performance of SOFCs, leading to a sharp rise in research contributions. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current state of SOFC modeling, highlighting key challenges that remain unresolved for further investigation by researchers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16bd8490437bee480cdbabc5d3a7abc8ca478e68565cab0238019ca687e03318","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
