Taurine plays an important role in metabolic processes such as osmoregulatory, cytoprotective, and antioxidant effects. The study aimed to investigate the protective effect of taurine in Sprague Dawley male rats exposed to pyraclostrobin. The rats were separated into 6 groups and were found 8 animals in each group. Rats were given 30 mg/kg pyraclostrobin and pyraclostrobin together with three different taurine concentrations (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) via oral gavage for 28 days. While pyraclostrobin increased biochemical parameters, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage, it decreased glutathione levels and enzyme activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase. Pyraclostrobin increased apoptotic, proinflammatory, and <span>CYP2E1</span> mRNA expression levels, whereas antiapoptotic gene <span>Bcl-2</span> mRNA expression levels decreased in liver tissue. Additionally, pyraclostrobin caused histopathological alterations in tissues. Taurine in a dose-dependent manner reversed the changes caused by pyraclostrobin. As a result, taurine exhibited a cytoprotective effect by showing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic activities against oxidative damage caused by pyraclostrobin.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"93a3aa08224c919667ac468bca602b3b9feb5c7f8318f7c920e88cf0ee196295","category":"Environment"}
