At present, there were few studies on benzene-induced neurological damage. This research aimed to identify the protein biomarkers to explore the mechanism of nervous system damage caused by benzene. We established a benzene poisoning model of C57 mice by gavage of benzene-peanut oil suspension and identified differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in brain tissue using tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics. The results showed a significant weight loss and decrease in leukocyte and neutrophil counts in benzene poisoning mice compared to the control group. We also observed local cerebral oedema and small vessel occlusion in the cerebral white matter of benzene poisoning mice. TMT proteomic results showed that a total 6,985 proteins were quantified, with a fold change (FC) &gt; 1.2 (or &lt; 1/1.2) and P value &lt;0.05 were considered as DEPs. Compared with the control group, we identified 43 DEPs, comprising 14 upregulated and 29 downregulated proteins. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis results showed that the candidate proteins were mainly involved in cholesterol metabolism, complement and coagulation cascades, african trypanosomiasis, PPAR signaling pathway, and vitamin digestion and absorption. Three proteins, 2-hydroxyacylsphingosine 1-beta-galactosyltransferase (UGT8), Apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) and Complement C3 (C3) were validated using immunoblotting and immunohistochemical. In conclusion, our study preliminarily investigated the mechanism of benzene toxicity to the nervous system by analyzing DEPs changes in the brain.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"240bbda082722e15a6ed45b195c4d742785dee6398dea04d213c765980b12348","category":"Environment"}
