{"title":"Urine 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid Negatively Correlates with Migraine Occurrence and Characteristics in the Interictal Phase of Episodic Migraine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0703/v1","date":1712738056000,"content":"Although migraine belongs to the main causes of disability worldwide the mechanisms of its pathogenesis are poorly known, which is among the reasons that this disease is underdiagnosed and undertreated. As migraine diagnosis is based on the subjective assessment of symptoms, there is a need to establish objective markers of its occurrence and severity. Tryptophan (TRP) metabolism has been associated with the pathogenesis of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In the present work, we investigated an association between migraine and the urine concentration of TRP and its metabolites 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA) and quinolinic acid (QA) in 21 low-frequency episodic migraine patients and 32 controls. Migraine patients displayed lower urinary levels of 5-HIAA and KYNA, but KYN and QA were enhanced as compared with the controls. Consequently, the patients were characterized by different values of the 5-HIAA/TRP, KYN/TRP, KYNA/KYN, and KYNA/QA ratios. Furthermore, urinary concentration of 5-HIAA was negatively correlated with Migraine Disability Assessment score, monthly migraine, and monthly headache days. A negative correlation between Patient Health Questionnaire 9 scores assessing depression. In conclusion, the urinary 5-HIAA level may be an easy-to-determine marker of migraine occurrence and severity and may contribute to the identification of migraine patients with depression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84e0cb51a4f97c27f0047b64cb6cded3278989eff270b3dd6a8db363710a28a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
