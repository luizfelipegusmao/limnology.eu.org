Therefore, grain boundary enrichment is often an emphasis of materials design, and the extent of interfacial segregation is measured to identify grain boundary related processing-microstructure-property relationships. Recent examples of controlling grain boundary behavior have been focused on promoting intergranular fracture in ultrahard ceramics, particularly boron carbide [<a href=\"#ozae044.092-B2\">2</a>] and boron suboxide [<a href=\"#ozae044.092-B3\">3</a>]. The aim was to improve fracture toughness by driving enrichment of Si and/or other glass forming additives to grain boundaries in B<sub>4</sub>C and B<sub>6</sub>O, thereby weakening interfacial strength and enabling crack deflection mechanisms. Grain boundary segregation can be qualitatively confirmed using high-resolution imaging (i.e., scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)), but there is a greater need to quantify enrichment using microanalysis (i.e., X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (XEDS)) to relate material response to processing and structure. However, there are significant challenges in accurately quantifying grain boundary enrichment using microanalysis, particularly for low-Z materials such as borides, carbides, and oxides. The goal of this work was to develop STEM-XEDS microanalysis methods to quantify grain boundary enrichment and obtain a fundamental understanding of grain boundary composition driven grain growth and intergranular fracture behaviors in boron-rich ceramics.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"92f3cda400de3fa9f4c9181062fada96e2d75b45472002f0295631e5fd0e05b6","category":"Environment"}
