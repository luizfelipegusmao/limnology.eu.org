{"title":"Design and Development of a Low-Cost Parabolic Type Solar Dryer and Its Performance Evaluation in Drying of King Fish &ndash; Case Study in Oman","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0620/v1","date":1725864189000,"content":"Dry Fish is a rich source of proteins and nutrients and can be eaten in many forms. Oman is one of the important fish producers in the world and having high demand in neighboring countries for Oman’s fish. Fishery sector is considered as one of the important economic development sector in sultanate of Oman. In the fishery sector, use of technology is not up to the mark because of less awareness of technology application among Omani fishermen. Also, there is a demand for a greater number of cold storages in different regions to store fresh fishes which is not materialized yet. Similarly, there is a demand of perfect and cheap technology in Oman to dry fishes to improve the profit to the fishermen. Solar energy is abundantly available in Oman and there are high possibilities in Oman to use solar energy in domestic and industrial applications. Since the sunlight is available throughout the year, it is possible to convert in to thermal energy or electrical energy. Electricity can be produced from photovoltaic principle (PV) or indirectly with concentrated solar power. Similarly, we can use solar concentrators for many thermal applications. The solar dryer is a device which is used to dry fruits, vegetables, leaves, clothes etc. If any of the items are dried with the help of solar energy, then we can save lot of non-renewable source of energy and can help to improve economy of the country. The sun can, at least seasonally at Oman’s latitudes, provide a substantial part of the energy needed for various applications. In this work, we used solar dryer to make dry fish with high quality. Use of parabolic type concentrator to dry the fish is an effective solution which is an innovative idea to the fishermen. The temperature variation in dryer is directly proportional to the intensity of solar. The tracking mechanism is a combination of electronic and mechanical design which tracks the sun automatically. In this work, a parabolic concentrator with automatic tracking mechanism was designed and the performance analysis have been done. In the design, copper tubes are used for heat transfer and then the hot fluid is circulated in the box which is used to dry the fishes. As per the experiment, fish drying efficiency obtained from solar dryer is 77.9% and it took 3 days to dry king fish of 20kg. There are many advantages in parabolic type solar concentrators relate to the quality of dryness in the fishes and time taken to dry the fishes which are elaborately discussed in this paper. This solar dryer technology will improve green environment and also will save non-renewable sources of sultanate of Oman for longer period of time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68404dbadabefe4e94b2259e5bacb8666c196fb74214f688c3c9c5d15b6004d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
