Its unique capabilities and the significant role it plays in enhancing the performance and functionality of these products have attracted considerable interest worldwide. This is especially true due to the remarkable properties that are exhibited by nanoparticles of Nd(OH)<sub>3</sub>, which can drastically influence the efficiency and quality of the final products. The preparation methods and the significance of its applications have been the subject of extensive research and discussion. Various synthesis techniques have been developed to produce Nd(OH)<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles, each with its own set of advantages and limitations. Among these methods are electron-beam evaporation, thermal evaporation, sol-gel auto-combustion, and hydrothermal synthesis. These methods offer different pathways to achieve nanoparticles with desired sizes, shapes, and distributions, thereby tailoring their properties for specific applications. In this study, we delve into a novel aspect of Nd(OH)<sub>3</sub> by examining its behavior under an electron beam during in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization [<a href=\"#ozae044.832-B1\">1-3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6d7682ce0da3592c884ebfd18e49e22bd31fd7ab865ddd958f09a03a4c1742d0","category":"Environment"}
