{"title":"In Situ Time-Resolved Atomic-Scale Response of 2D TMD WSe2 under High-Frequency AC Electric Fields","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.779/7719754?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Simultaneous characterization by (S)TEM and application of electrical bias is a powerful platform to study real-space dynamic electronic couplings at nanoscales. For adequate signal/noise the required acquisition times for typical single-shot data capture in most STEM modes are amenable to only quasi-static in-situ biasing experiments. However, dynamics of high-speed reversible phenomena can be cyclically probed, the response measured repeatedly across space and over time. Here, the characteristic temporal resolution is instead the minimum per-pixel integration time. Compared to typical full-frame STEM acquisitions this is can be extremely fast, e.g. of the order of 100 ns / 10 MHz frequencies for a HAADF detector. Thus, a normally fitted and operated STEM is capable of such time-resolution without specialized sources, electron optics, or detectors. It necessitates that a repeated dataset is collected, can be synchronized to the in-situ stimuli, and encompasses enough cycles / integration time for good signal to noise. The rest is post-processing. In this work we utilize this approach on an unmodified STEM to demonstrate time-resolved atomic-scale motion of a 2D semiconductor WSe2 under a 25kHz AC electrical bias.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2e4d9f84efcf09d52591e5a843f609d0331125770924ed3cfc195d8d297e17d5","category":"Environment"}
