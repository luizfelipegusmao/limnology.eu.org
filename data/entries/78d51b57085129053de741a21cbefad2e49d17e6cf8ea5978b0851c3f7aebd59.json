{"title":"Comparison of Intra-operative Blood Loss in Patients Undergoing Mono-Polar TURP with and without Pre-operative 2 Weeks Use of Finasteride","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0906/v1","date":1710494281000,"content":"This study was conducted to determine the role of pre-operative 2 weeks use of Finasteride in reducing intra-operative blood loss in patients undergoing monopolar TURP. Number of enrolled patients were 120, on the basis of inclusion criteria. Patients who were candidates of monopolar TURP were given 5mg Finasteride for 2 weeks before the surgery. On the 13th day of medicine, they got admitted in ward and prepared for surgery. During surgery intra-operative irrigation fluid was measured and gathered, then tested for Hemoglobin and the blood loss was calculated with equation formula. Blood loss evaluation was done on the basis of irrigation fluid, hemoglobin in irrigation fluid, preoperative hemoglobin and resected tissue weight. Significant reduction in blood loss was observed in interventional group as compared to the control group. Mean blood loss was 296ml in Group-A and 370ml in Group-B while blood loss per gram was 11.7ml/g in Group-A and 14.7 ml/g in Group-B. Mean operative time was measured 42 minutes in Group-A and 49 minutes in Group-B. This research proclaims a clear-cut supremacy of pre-operative use of Finasteride for two weeks. It significantly reduces intraoperative blood loss and blood loss per gram in patients undergoing monopolar TURP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78d51b57085129053de741a21cbefad2e49d17e6cf8ea5978b0851c3f7aebd59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
