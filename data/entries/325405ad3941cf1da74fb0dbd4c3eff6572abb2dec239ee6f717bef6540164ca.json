{"title":"The Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Inclusive Education: A Scoping Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1386/v1","date":1729471966000,"content":"This scoping review seeks to map the landscape of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is leveraged within educational environments to support students with disabilities and inclusive strategies and experiences. The research question concerns the role and impact of AI across diverse educational settings and in particular: “How is Artificial Intelligence (AI) being utilized within educational settings to support individuals with disabilities and promote inclusive education?”. The review explores this question under four pivotal dimensions: Educational Context, Disabilities and Special Needs, Artificial Intelligence Technologies, and Inclusivity and Inclusive Practice. Each contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of this inquiry. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, four major research databases have been used: Scopus, EBSCO, ERIC, and Web of Science (WoS). This robust search strategy enabled us to capture a wide array of relevant literature. The review also addresses ethical considerations essential for the responsible integration of AI in education, such as privacy, accessibility, and bias. By mapping existing research and identifying gaps, this scoping review lays the groundwork for future advancements in AI-driven inclusive educational practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"325405ad3941cf1da74fb0dbd4c3eff6572abb2dec239ee6f717bef6540164ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
