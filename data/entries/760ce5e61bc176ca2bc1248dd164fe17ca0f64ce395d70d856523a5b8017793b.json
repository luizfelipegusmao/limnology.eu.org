{"title":"Use of Laccase Enzymes as Bio-Receptors for the Organic Dye Methylene Blue in a Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1618/v1","date":1729574036000,"content":"Methylene blue is a cationic organic dye found in wastewater, groundwater, and surface water, due to industrial release in the environment. This emerging pollutant is very persistent and, depending on the doses, can harm human and environmental health. In this work, a Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensor using a BK7 prism with a coating of 3 nm chromium and 50 nm of gold in the Kretschmann configuration was developed for the detection of methylene blue, using for the first time, laccases immobilized on a gold surface as bio-receptors for this organic dye. The enzyme immobilization through carbodiimide bonds, using EDC/NHS crosslinkers, and allowed to analyze samples with minimal preparation. The method was validated, achieving a LOD of 4.61 mg L-1 and LOQ of 15.37 mg L-1, a working range from 0-100 mg L-1, and a R2=0.9614 in a real-time analysis. A sample of rainwater spiked with methylene blue was analyzed, and a recovery of 122.46 Â± 4.41% was obtained.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"760ce5e61bc176ca2bc1248dd164fe17ca0f64ce395d70d856523a5b8017793b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
