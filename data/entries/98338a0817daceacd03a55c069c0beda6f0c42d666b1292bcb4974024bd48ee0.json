{"title":"Distribution of Heavy Metals in Surrounding Mining Region of Kizhnica in Kosovo","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0455/v1","date":1720099297000,"content":"In this study the distribution of heavy metal in the agricultural soils in the vicinity of 3 large mine-landfills around Kizhnica mine in Kosovo was investigated. The mining sector is one of the most important sectors of the economic development of Kosovo. The Kizhnica mine is one of the main ore producers in Kosovo. In addition to the positive aspects of production development it has its own side effects such as: industrial waste and the possibility of contamination of sur-rounding areas including the agricultural lands in the surrounding region. Ten sampling sites close to the Kizhnica mining complex were selected. These sampling sites have been characterized and evaluated as the most critical points, due to the anthropogenic influences of the discharge of industrial water from mining flotation and open tailing dumps in the Kizhnica. Concentration of Pb, Zn, Cu, As, Cd, Ni, Mn and Sb in selected samples was carried out by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES). Obtained data were used in order to generate geochemical maps and for calculatation the contamination factor (CF), pollution load index (PLI) and geo-accumulation index (Igeo). The statistical clustering analysis (CA), Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and air spatial distribution patterns using AERMOD View-Gaussian air dispersion model are used to perform evaluation within the area. The results demonstrated higher contents of the heavy metals in the vicinity of the mining area. It may be concluded that the heavy metal contents are impacted by anthropogenic nature of the contamination that confirms a current eco-logical threat of the mining activities in the region. Finally, a paper proposes the potential reas-signment of the deposed waste material into different combinations in construction in order to enhance the waste management and reduce the continued risk to: residents, lands and all living beings in the region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"98338a0817daceacd03a55c069c0beda6f0c42d666b1292bcb4974024bd48ee0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
