{"title":"Comprehensive Review of Canine Entropion: Types, Surgical Techniques, and Prognosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0291/v3","date":1716889947000,"content":"Entropion is a condition characterized by the total or partial inversion of the eyelid margin, resulting in contact between the outer skin and the corneal or conjunctival surface, and sometimes both. This condition can affect various animals, including horses, pigs, goats, sheep, rabbits, felines, and particularly canines. It typically manifests in the lower lid's lateral portion but can affect any part of the lid. This contact between eyelashes or facial hair and the cornea or conjunctiva leads to severe irritation, causing self-inflicted trauma, as evidenced by clinical signs of pain, irritation, ulcerations, and vision loss. Entropion can be classified as primary (congenital or developmental) or secondary (spastic and scarring). Diagnosis relies on clinical signs, the animal's history, and its breed. It's essential to assess the degree of entropion in the dog without applying topical anesthesia. This study conducts a literature review on surgical techniques for correcting various types of entropion in canines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db59ecca54d8038d09af760f9460ef7e2aefabd437e6f4c62cd5ff9f7cb9fbd1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
