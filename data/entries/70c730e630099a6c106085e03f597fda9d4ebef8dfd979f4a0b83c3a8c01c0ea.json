{"title":"Exploring the Versatile Nature of Resveratrol: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1394/v1","date":1713794112000,"content":"Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol found in various plants and fruits such as blackberries, blueberries, currants, strawberries, peanuts, and most especially in grapes. It is also present in red wine, although its content varies greatly depending on its origin. It is a phytoalexin produced by plants in response to stress, aggression from pathogens such as bacteria or fungi, or physical damage such as injury. In addition to its involvement in plant defence responses, resveratrol has been the subject of research interest due to its potential health benefits, including antioxidant properties and potential positive effects on the cardiovascular system, among others. Initial interest in its research stemmed from the so-called 'French paradox', in certain regions of France, where despite high intakes of saturated fats there was a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease. Science wondered the factor that might be protecting the French from inflammation, vascular damage and playing a role in their longer lifespan. Thus, in the 1990s, it was hypothesized that a component of wine could be the key element. Epidemiological studies began to suggest that moderate consumption of wine, especially red wine, was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. In vitro laboratory research supported this idea, demonstrating that resveratrol could inhibit processes involved in the development of atherosclerosis or the formation of arterial plaques, such as platelet aggregation in blood vessels and oxidative damage to LDL cholesterol. A plausible mechanism for heart protection thus emerged. Since then, an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo studies have been carried out to unravel the mechanism by which resveratrol can slow down the aging process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70c730e630099a6c106085e03f597fda9d4ebef8dfd979f4a0b83c3a8c01c0ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
