Before the appearance of albuminuria, there are genetic mutations that can predispose the development of kidney disease.</p> Material and methods <p>The study included 130 adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of microalbuminuria. This study was performed to examine clinical and laboratory differences between adolescents with type 1 diabetes with and without microalbuminuria and the distribution of the ACE, AGTR1, and MTHFR gene polymorphisms.</p> Results <p>The mean microalbuminuria in the first group 6.41±7.35 significantly differs from the second group 0.82±0.48 (p&lt;0.001). HbA1c, 24-hour proteinuria, and day-time systolic blood pressure were significantly higher in the MA group (p&lt;0.05). Smaller systolic blood pressure percentage nocturnal decline was observed in the microalbuminuric group (p 0.030). The frequencies of the ACE DD, ID, and II genotypes were 12.5%, 50.0%, and 37.5%, respectively, among T1D patients with MA, and 19.3%, 56.1%, 24.6%, in the control group without MA (P = .510). The frequencies of the AGTR1 AA, AC, and CC genotypes were 62.5%, 25.0%, and 12.5% among TID patients with MA, and 49.1%, 43.9%, 8.0%, in the group without MA (p 0.326). The frequencies of the MTHFR CC, CT and TT genotypes were 37.5%, 50.0%, 12.5% among TID patients with MA, and 37.7%, 45.6%, 16.7% in the group without MA (p 0.901).</p> Conclusion <p>Our data suggest that common variants in the <i>AGTR1</i>, <i>ACE</i>, and <i>MTHFR</i> genes are not strongly associated with diabetic nephropathy in our patients with type 1 diabetes.</p>","author":"Smiljka Kovacevic","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"da03bcbac203190837f4d715450439da23c40c9ad7325fa9dd703809f9ddc895","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
