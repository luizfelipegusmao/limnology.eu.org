{"title":"Anti-Senescence Effects of Porcine Placental Extracts and Stem Cell-derived Exosomes on Skin Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1917/v1","date":1724752451000,"content":"To verify the efficacy of placental extracts (Pla-Ext) and human mesenchymal stem-cell-derived exosomes (hMSC-Exo) against human skin aging, we investigated the human dermal fibroblast (HDF) response following hMSC-Exo and Pla-Ext treatment and whether they elicited resistance to damage when HDFs were subjected to several types of aging stresses. The effect of hMSC-Exo alone, the combined effect of Pla-Ext and hMSC-Exo, and the effect of hMSC-Exo (Pla/MSC-Exo) recovered from cultures with Pla-Ext added to hMSC were verified using collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid synthase mRNA levels for each effect. Cells were subjected to photoaging (UV radiation), glycation (glycation end product stimulation), and oxidation (H2O2 stimulation) as HDF stressors. Pla-Ext did not significantly affect normal skin fibroblasts considering intracellular parameters; however, a pro-proliferative effect was observed. Pla-Ext induced resistance to several stresses in skin fibroblasts (UV irradiation, glycation stimulation, H2O2 stimulation) and inhibited reactive oxygen species accumulation following H2O2 stimulation. Although the combined efficacy of hMSC-Exo and Pla-Ext was unclear, some changes resulted in senescence stress resistance due to preconditioned hMSC-Exo stimulated by Pla-Ext. This suggests that Pla-Ext supplementation may cause some changes in the surface molecules or hMSC-Exo content (e.g., microRNA).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db528e75d8aaf3682ea151d7a7b852566890be10f39a78a4809cb8ea17252d5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
