Here, we expound the advantages of microbial agents composting compared with conventional organic solid waste treatment technology, and review the important role of microbial agents composting in organic solid waste composting from the aspects of screening and identification, optimization of conditions, mechanism of action, combination with other technologies and ultra-high-temperature and ultra-low-temperature microbial composting. We discuss the value of microorganisms with different growth conditions in organic solid waste composting, and put forward a seasonal multi-temperature composite microbial composting technology. Provide new ideas for the all-round treatment of microbial agents in organic solid waste in the future.
