In general, this research paper carried out a comprehensive review of the literature published in scientific journals in the world in recent years on the process of neutralizing surface waters with traditional disinfectant reagents, which are subject to environmental problems. For example, we have highlighted the disadvantages and advantages of oxidizing agents and disinfectant reagents such as chlorine (Cl), chloramin (NH2Cl), chlorine dioxide (ClO2), ozone (O3) and ultraviolet (UV). However, among these reagents, considering the advantages of ozone technology, according to the research work, there is a special Current to ozone technology. The scientific novelty of the research work was the creation of a modern ozonator unit Etro – 02 based on an electric corona discharge with a frequency of 13 kHz, a voltage of 21 kV. For testing the installation, surface water was taken from the Kapshagai and Vyacheslav reservoirs, where aranai was exposed to environmental problems, and expert samples were carried out. The number of microbiological indicators that do not meet the standards found in the composition of water is as follows: total number of microbes 130-160 (1 ml of CFU (Colony-forming unit)), TCB (Thermotolerant coliform bacteria) 270-370 (100 ml of CFU), CCB (Common Coliform Bacteria) 650-800 (100 ml of CFU), coliphages 135-170 (100 ml of PFU (plaque – forming units)). To completely neutralize and clean these bacteria, the amount of ozone consumed per 1m3 of water was enough for 0.5 – 0.8 g/hour of ozone. And it turned out that the decontamination time will be enough 20 – 25 minutes. In addition, the obtained data were used to compile a mathematical model using the programs “Mathcad 14” and “SMath Solver”.</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Keywords</h3>\n<p><span>Electric discharge, ozone, UV radiation, primary water, purified water, sorption.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>1. INTRODUCTION</strong></h3>\n<div>\n<p>Depending on the human development strategy, it is estimated that by 2030 and 2040, water reserves in 167 countries will be 40% less than today (World Economic Forum, 2022). According to such statistics, water scarcity can have a negative impact on overall economic development (Maddocks et al., 2015). This issue is also relevant for Kazakhstan. After all, in the 1950s in Kazakhstan 120 billion. there are about 100 billion cubic meters of water reserves. there are also assumptions that the Cube was reduced to a meter (UN., 2022). This is because drinking water is obtained in most cases through surface reservoirs. Therefore, it is necessary to protect the environment and restore resources (Estévez et al., 2022). One of the reservoirs affected by environmental problems is Kapshagai and Vyacheslav reservoir (KZ News, 2022). On the shore of the kapshagai reservoir is the “training and drilling test site” of the Satbayev University. Due to the scarcity of drinking water in the landfill, surface water is used for drinking purposes. The content of harmful microbacteria in water is higher than the maximum permissible concentration (MPC) established by sanitary rules and norms [Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan, 2015; Siberian Ecology company, 2022). For example, the total number of microbes (TNM) i.e. the number of colony – forming bacteria in 1 ml 130 – 160 met. Modern articles on the effectiveness of the destruction of such harmful bacteria are currently published in foreign and domestic publications. For example, the effectiveness of technologies for disinfection of harmful bacteria in water by chlorine, ozone and ultraviolet rays is being considered (Diana and Yuly, 2021). However, these mentioned reagents have their own advantages and disadvantages (Figure 1) (Novikov and Prodous, n.d)</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"386\" height=\"206\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture1.png\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture1.png 386w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture1-300x160.png 300w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 1: </strong>The main types of water disinfection methods</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p><strong>1.1 Chlorination of water</strong><br />\nAdvantages: effective against many types of microorganisms, widely used in large water treatment systems (Novikov and Prodous, n.d.; Limarenko and Novikov, 2014)<br />\nDisadvantages: chlorides and trichloromethane can form, which are dangerous to health. The taste and smell of chlorine in the water will appear (Limarenko and Novikov, 2014).<br />\n<strong>1.2 UV light treatment</strong><br />\nAdvantages: effective against bacteria, viruses and simple organisms without chemical additives. Does not change the chemical composition of water (Seleznev et al., 2007).<br />\nDisadvantages: does not remove particles and toxins, requires electricity and is effective only under direct radiation.<br />\n<strong>1.3 Ozone disinfection</strong><br />\nAdvantages: Ozone is effective against bacteria, viruses, fungi and organic pollution (Dan Kroll, 2007; Draginsky et al., 2007). Leaves no residue in the water.</p>\n<p>Disadvantages: ozone requires special equipment to produce. The formation of some nitrogen oxides is possible.<br />\nWater disinfection is selected depending on the scope of the task (Bakhir, 2003;2007). Also, by water content and quality requirements (Dan Kroll, 2007 Zheldakova and Tulskaya, 2010). Chlorination is suitable for large water systems, UV treatment is suitable for small water systems and home use, and ozone disinfection is more environmentally friendly than chlorine (Bonnelye and Richard, 1997).</p>\n<p>In recent years, there has been significant research and notable advancements in plasma disinfection technologies (Takuya Kuwahara, 2018). Ozone (O3) is an effective disinfectant in the process of destroying viruses among the reagents mentioned above (Figure 1) (Lin et al., 2007; Wigginton and John 2012). Therefore, it is widely used as a strong oxidizer of water. Ozone is usually formed in a cold plasma (NTP) with a dielectric barrier discharge from oxygen (O2) (Suan Tial and Mistugi, 2022). Therefore, when designing the design of ozonators, it is worth considering the cooling system of the electrodes in it. Considering the unique properties of ozone, we’ve embarked on a new ozonator project, with a keen focus on integrating ozone technology based on scientific research.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. MATERIALS AND METHODS</strong></h3>\n<p>The elimination of harmful microbacteria contained in surface water, which are subject to environmental problems, by means of an electric discharge is currently under rapid development (Tian et al., 2015; Parpiev et al., 2021). Overall, surface water is vital for supporting life on Earth. However, the existence of microorganisms like bacteria and viruses can endanger human health (Bakhir 2003;2007). Utilizing ozone generated through electric discharge emerges as one of the most efficient methods for eradicating microorganisms in water. (Khainatsky et al., 2018; Abdelaziz, 2016). In a scientific study, we will consider the mechanisms of action of ozone, the tendency of its formation in an electric discharge, and also evaluate the effectiveness of this method in the destruction of microorganisms in water [24]. In order to effectively remove harmful microorganisms contained in water in general with ozone, it is advisable to first thoroughly analyze the solubility and self-distribution of ozone in water.</p>\n<p><strong>2.1 The solubility and self-distribution of ozone in water</strong><br />\nAs ozone dissolves in water, its concentration steadily rises until it reaches the required threshold for a specific condition (Egorova et al., 2015).<br />\nThe solubility of ozone in water depends on different conditions, i.e. the volume of water (voz/vw),), the temperature of the water (Т,0С) and the value of рН (Draginsky et al., 2007; Lunin, 2015). The concentration volume of dissolved ozone (measured in mg/l) in water is determined by the Bunsen coefficient. (Eike Breitbarth et al., 2004). At the same time, the tendency of ozone to dissolve in water can be explained by Henry’s law, which is proportional to the pressure of dissolved ozone and gaseous ozone in solution (Egorova et al., 2015). This pattern is written as:</p>\n<p>C=β⋅М⋅Рγ,g/l</p>\n<p>Where, C is the solubility of ozone in water, g/l; β-Bunsen coefficient, M is the density of ozone 2.14 g/l [16.31], Рγ – is the partial pressure of ozone in the melting gas medium. The solubility of ozone in water is very high compared to oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere (Battino,1983; Wei et al., 2017). Its solubility property in water increases with a decrease in water temperature (Egorova et al., 2015). Such research works Horvath M.L., Bilitrki Land Hutter., W. J. Considered in the experimental research works of Masschelein and B. F. Kogan (Table 1) (Draginsky et al., 2007).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"712\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Capture.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Capture.jpg 712w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Capture-300x112.jpg 300w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 2: </strong>Distribution of published study locations related to Ephemeroptera as bioindicator for surface water habitat in Indonesia</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>This can be seen from the experimental research work in Table 1 Above: as the water temperature (Т,оС) increases, the solubility of ozone in water (g/l) and the Bunsen coefficient β (l O3/ l H2O) decrease. Ozone is less soluble in acidic and salt water than in distilled water (Epelle et al., 2022). Sander R. on questions about the stability of Henry’s law, from the research work, it was also considered in connection with pH (Sander, 2015). In this research paper, the change in Henry’s constant due to pH at different temperatures can be expressed by the following equation.</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"175\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture2-1024x175.png\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture2-1024x175.png 1024w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture2-300x51.png 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture2-768x131.png 768w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture2.png 1246w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"242\" height=\"31\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture3.png\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>Where, Ha is the Henry coefficient at the molar amount of ozone; T is the absolute temperature (K). It is observed that at a temperature of 300 K or 270С, the solubility property of ozone in water is very poor. That is, it is determined that LnHa =8.9 at pH=2 and LnHa =8.5 at pH=7 (Epelle et al., 2022; Sander, 2015).</p>\n<p>During the dissolution of ozone in water, there is not only a tendency to react with chemical (Lim et al., 2022) substances present in the water, but also its own distribution (Yudianto et al., 2023). These two processes occur simultaneously and depend on the water temperature, pH environment (Sofia, 2020; Galdeano, 2018). At this point, it begins to affect microbiological indicators in drinking water (Sofia, 2020).<br />\nIn general, the rate of propagation of ozone in water can be written as (Draginsky et al., 2007; Li et al., 2022).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"112\" height=\"35\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture4.png\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>where, Кр is the constant of the rate at which ozone is dissipated in water.</p>\n<p>The quantitative characteristic and important feature of dissolved ozone to improve the process of decontamination and purification of surface waters can be seen in some studies (Jin et al., 2022):</p>\n<p>О_3+Н_2 О→2ОН^*+О_2</p>\n<p>О_3+ОН^-→〖О_2〗^(-*)+НО_2</p>\n<p>О_3+ОН^*→О_2+Н〖О_2〗^*⇔〖О_2〗^(-*)+Н^±</p>\n<p>О_3+Н〖О_2〗^*→2О_2+ОН^*</p>\n<p>2Н〖О_2〗^*→О_2+Н_2 О_2</p>\n<p>This can be traced to the formation of the OH* radical and hydrogen oxide from the above expressions.<br />\nThe electrochemical decomposition of ozone by ozone occurs faster in an alkaline medium than in an acid (Bavasso et al., 2020), the rate of its dissolution under such conditions is expressed as:</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"231\" height=\"31\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture5.png\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>where, Кр and Кa are stability in a wide range of pH in water.

There is a certain experimental assessment of the main ways of ozone dissolution. In the simplest case, half of the ozone is molecular, and the rest is transformed into radicals. However, the transformed  radicals act on harmful microorganisms contained in water by different mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>2.2 Mechanisms of action of ozone by microorganismsr</strong><br />\nOzone (O3) in water is a powerful oxidizing agent capable of destroying the cellular structures of microorganisms (Abdykadyrov et al., 2023). In the process of introducing ozone into water, the oxidation of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids contained in water, as a result of which microorganisms are destroyed (Abdykadyrov et al., 2023; Rangel et al., 2021). This mechanism is an effective solution for disinfecting water with ozone. In general, the effectiveness of the destruction of harmful microorganisms contained in surface water is currently one of the most pressing problems (Gorito et al., 2021). However, in the data of recent scientific publications, the treatment of water with ozone based on an electric discharge provides a high degree of disinfection (Qasim et al., 2022). Efficiency in research work depends on parameters such as ozone concentration, processing time and characteristics of microorganisms (Tao et al., 2021, Xue et al., 2023). The high reactivity of ozone ensures the destruction of a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and fungi (Rangel et al., 2021).</p>\n<p>The tendency to remove microorganisms with ozone can expose water to oxidizing agents (Rangel et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2023). Which can also affect water quality. Therefore, it is important to balance the ozone concentration and monitor the quality of water after treatment (Spiliotopoulou et al., 2018).</p>\n<p>A study of the process of destruction of microorganisms in water using ozone based on electric discharge shows the prospects for this method in ensuring the safety of Water Resources (Abdykadyrov et al., 2023; Qasim et al., 2022). Mechanisms of action and optimization of process parameters help to develop effective and sustainable methods of disinfection of water and other products in various situations (Botondi et al., 2023; Seridou and Kalogeraki, 2021). In general, below is a diagram of the mechanism of action of ozone by microorganisms (Figure 3).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"967\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture11-1024x967.png\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture11-1024x967.png 1024w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture11-300x283.png 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture11-768x725.png 768w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture11.png 1148w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 3: </strong>Diagram of the mechanism of action of ozone by microorganisms</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>As we conclude from the diagram presented in the figure, it can be seen that it is worth paying special attention to the factors that affect the destruction of microorganisms with the help of ozone.</p>\n<p><strong>2.3 Factors affecting the destruction of microorganisms using ozone</strong><br />\nThe effectiveness of ozone in killing microbes is influenced by various<br />\nfactors, including water quality parameters, ozone dose, contact time, and organic matter availability (Rangel et al., 2021; Davidson et al., 2011). The type and concentration of microorganisms also play an important role in determining the effectiveness of ozone treatment (Rangel et al., 2021; Takizawa et al., 2023; Thanomsub et al., 2002). The interaction of these factors and their general tendency to destroy microorganisms can be observed in Table 2 (Epelle et al., 2022).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"710\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Capture2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Capture2.jpg 710w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Capture2-300x102.jpg 300w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>What we can see from this table is that ozone can be a powerful disinfectant, but it is important not to forget that it is essential to use it correctly and that it works optimally. Therefore, before applying in the technological process, it is better to conduct a comparative analysis of ozone technology with traditional methods.</p>\n<p><strong>2.4 Comparative analysis of ozone technology with traditional methods</strong><br />\nComparison of ozone treatment with traditional water disinfection methods such as chlorination (Al-Abri et al., 2019). And ultraviolet irradiation, filtration works gives an idea of the benefits and limitations of the destruction of microorganisms by ozone (Soboksa et al., 2020; Cescon and Jiang, 2020; Zinn et al., 2018; Castro et al., 2023). Ozone’s ability to quickly inactivate a wide range of microorganisms without leaving harmful byproducts makes it a suitable option for surface water treatment (Castro et al., 2023; García-Araya and Beltrán, 2023). To compare ozone technology with traditional methods, let’s divide it into the main categories (Table 3).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"708\" height=\"372\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Capture3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Capture3.jpg 708w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Capture3-300x158.jpg 300w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"574\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture12.png\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture12.png 574w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture12-300x298.png 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture12-150x150.png 150w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture12-100x100.png 100w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture12-40x40.png 40w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 4: </strong>Strategic future directions of water ozonation technology</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>The table showed a comprehensive comparative analysis of ozonation technology and traditional methods in various aspects (chlorine and UV).

However, special attention should be paid to the strategic future directions of water ozonation technology.</p>\n<p><strong>2.4 Strategic future directions of water ozonation technology</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p>Disinfection of water from microbes, ozone has a very high property in the process of purification (Ngwenya et al., 2012; Muzafarov et al., 2021). It also aims to break down organic pollutants and improve the overall water quality (Mouele et al., 2015). The elimination of microorganisms through ozone is a promising method for improving the quality of surface water (Santos et al., 2021). The process contributes to the development of strategies for active water treatment, solving mechanisms and factors. Some research papers consider a solution to the strategy of increasing the activity of photocatalytic ozonation of g-C3N4 by halogen doping for water purification (Tan et al., 2022). A diagram of the strategic future directions of total water ozonation technology is presented in Figure 4 below</p>\n<p>This figure presents a simplified diagram of the strategic future direction of water ozonation technology. It highlights the interrelated strategic directions of water ozonation technology for the future, highlighting key areas such as the improvement of ozone production, integration with intelligent systems, safety measures, environmental sustainability, integration with other technologies, miniaturization, study of ozone reaction kinetics, public awareness, education and cooperation. Each cell here represents a strategic direction, and the language lines indicate the relationships and influence between these directions.</p>\n<p>Taking into account the previously studied scientific information in the above materials and methods, we paid special attention to the process of destroying harmful microbacteria in surface water with the help of ozone technology, which is subject to environmental problems.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS</strong></h3>\n<p>In the process of decontaminating surface water from harmful microorganisms, a number of advantages of ozone (O3) over traditional methods such as chlorine (Cl) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation have been identified (Summerfelt, 2003). For instance, ozone exhibits a significantly faster effect on harmful microorganisms in water, approximately 15 to 20 times faster than chlorine. Specifically, while ozone at a concentration of 0.45 mg/l can destroy the polio virus within 2 minutes, chlorine requires a dose of 2 mg/l and takes 3 hours to achieve the same result. Consequently, the necessary amount of ozone is approximately 2.5 times less than chlorine. Overall, the advantages of ozone over chlorine and UV radiation are as follows (Ishaq et al., 2018; Voukkali and Zorpas., 2015).<br />\n– High oxidation potential: Ozone has a high oxidation potential compared to chlorine and ultraviolet radiation. This allows ozone to effectively degrade and oxidize a wide range of organic and inorganic pollutants in water, including bacteria, viruses, and pollutants (Voukkali and Zorpas., 2015).</p>\n<p>– Absence of harmful by-products after the oxidation process: unlike chlorine, which can form potentially harmful disinfectant by-products when interacting with organic substances, ozone does not form such by-products (Sassi et al., 2005).<br />\n– Effectively destroys pathogens: Ozone is a more powerful disinfectant than chlorine or ultraviolet radiation, capable of destroying a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. This makes ozone a reliable solution to prevent water-borne diseases (Ishaq et al., 2018).<br />\n– Lack of residual taste and smell: Ozone does not give the treated water a residual taste or smell, which is especially effective when treating drinking water, as consumers prefer water with a stable taste and no smell (Voukkali and Zorpas., 2015; Sassi et al., 2005)</p>\n<p>– Wide range of pollution removal: Ozone effectively decomposes and removes a wide range of pollutants, including organic pollutants, pesticides, and pharmaceutical waste. UV radiation may not be effective against certain types of pollutants, and chlorine may require additional treatment steps for complete removal (Ishaq et al., 2018).<br />\n– Short contact time: Ozone disinfection usually requires a shorter contact time compared to chlorine. This can lead to more efficient water treatment processes and a shorter overall treatment time, which contributes to energy savings (Voukkali and Zorpas., 2015).<br />\n– PH flexibility: Ozone remains effective in a wider pH range compared to chlorine. This provides flexibility when treating water at different pH levels without compromising disinfection efficiency (Sassi et al., 2005).</p>\n<p>– Eco-friendly: Ozone decomposes into oxygen without leaving harmful waste, making it an environmentally friendly disinfectant. On the contrary, disinfection with chlorine can lead to the formation of chlorinated by-products that can affect the environment. Although UV radiation is effective in disinfection, it does not provide a residual disinfecting effect. Ozone, on the other hand, can have a residual disinfectant effect that provides permanent protection against the regrowth of microorganisms in the distribution system (Draginsky et al., 2007; Sassi et al., 2005).</p>\n<p>Thus, the advantages of ozone over chlorine and UV radiation in water treatment include high disinfection capabilities, the absence of harmful by-products, flexibility in the pH range and an integrated approach to removing pollutants. These factors contribute to an increase in the preference for ozone in various areas of water preparation.</p>\n<p><strong>3.1 The tendency to destroy harmful microorganisms contained in water with ozone</strong><br />\nOzone destruction of microorganisms involves oxidative reactions in which ozone reacts with various components of microbial cells (Martinelli et al., 2017; Rosenblum et al., 2012). Specific chemical reactions can vary depending on the nature of microorganisms and the composition of cells (Ngwenya et al., 2013; Banach et al., 2015). The ozone concentration can be determined according to the stage of the technological process as follows (Chasanah et al., 2019):</p>\n<p>d[O_3 ]/dt=-k_1 [O_3]<br />\nWhere k1 is a constant rate due to the decay of ozone.</p>\n<p>The concentration of lipids in the total [L] microbial cell membranes can be determined as follows (Barák and Muchová, 2013; Lakey et al., 2017).</p>\n<p>d[L]/dt=-k_2 [O_3][L]<br />\nWhere k2 is the constant reaction rate between ozone and lipids.</p>\n<p>Similarly ,the concentration of proteins in [P] microbial cells can be determined as follows (Cataldo, 20005).</p>\n<p>d[P]/dt=-k_3 [O_3][P]<br />\nWhere k3 is the constant reaction rate between ozone and proteins.</p>\n<p>Reaction equation with nucleic acids (Hoigné and Bader, 1983, Portjanskaja, 2010):</p>\n<p>d[NA]/dt=-k_4 [O_3][NA]<br />\nWhere [NA] is the concentration of nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) in microbial cells. k4 is a constant reaction rate between ozone and nucleic acids.</p>\n<p>Microbial inactivation equation (Brodowska, 2017):</p>\n<p>d[M]/dt=-k_5 [O_3][M]<br />\nWhere [M] refers to the concentration of microorganisms. k5 is a constant rate of total inactivation of microorganisms by ozone.</p>\n<p>These equations describe changes in the concentration of ozone and the concentration of lipids, proteins, nucleic acids and microorganisms over time. Based on these theoretical data, a system for eliminating harmful microorganisms contained in water with ozone was identified below (Figure 5). Let us consider the algarity of the basic system of equations that take into account the reactions in which ozone and various components of microorganisms are involved during the general technological process.</p>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"915\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture13-1024x915.png\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture13-1024x915.png 1024w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture13-300x268.png 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture13-768x686.png 768w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture13.png 1311w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 5: </strong>The system of equations of contact of ozone with the destruction of microorganisms.</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p><strong>3.2 Design of a new pilot ozonator installation Etro-02</strong><br />\nBased on the theoretical data and methodological instructions given in the previous sections, a special installation of the Etro – 02 ozonator was developed at the K. I. Satpayev Kazakh National Research Technical University (KazNRTU) based on an electric corona discharge with a frequency of 13kHz and a voltage of 21 kV (Abdykadyrov et al., 2014). The general sketch scheme of the installation is presented in Figure 6 a,b below. For practical testing, the unit was installed in a scientific laboratory located near the Kapshagai reservoir, which was exposed to environmental problems. There, scientific research was carried out on the process of destroying harmful microbacteria contained in surface water using ozone technology.</p>\n<p>The Etro-02 unit belongs to ozone extraction devices and can be used in the field of Ecology, in the treatment and disinfection of drinking water and wastewater, as well as in medicine, water channels, drainage, food industry, etc. The voltage between the corona electrodes in the ozonator is 21 kV, the length of the electrodes in it is 40 m, and the cooling system is carried out using nitrogen or transformer oil.

In the course of the general process, our goal in using ozone in reagents (chlorine and UV radiation, etc.) was to find that the oxidizing and disinfecting properties of ozone are higher than others. This is because it was effective for disinfecting surface water from harmful microorganisms, removing odors, changing the color of water, and removing impurities (Ding et al., 2019; Morrison et al., 2022). For example the elimination of bacteria, spores, germs and viruses in water (inactivation). To do this, a disinfectant reagent (ozone, chlorine, UV, etc.) is usually introduced into the water (Abdykadyrov et al., 2023). The dose of reagent in water treatment processes and disinfectants varies depending on the content of organic matter in the water, the temperature of the water, and the time of active reaction of the water with the disinfectant (Collivignarelli et al., 2018). When using chlorine, the higher the dose, the fewer bacteria will live, but at the same time unpleasant side effects will occur (Morrison et al., 2022). Heavy metals and bactericidal effects with the use of ozone begin when a certain critical dose is reached, equal to 0.3 – 0.6 mg per liter of treated water (Abdykadyrov et al., 2023). In addition, complete inactivation (disinfection) of water occurs.</p>\n<p>The mechanism of action of ozone in general consists in the breakdown of bacterial proteins and is carried out by the diffusion of ozone through the cell membrane into the cytoplasm, after which the life centers are damaged. The action takes place quickly-if its required concentration in water is maintained. If ozone has an effective effect on almost all bacteria, then chlorine selectively poisons the life centers of bacteria due to the low rate of diffusion in the cytoplasm (Broséus et al., 2009). The time it takes to reduce the concentration of bacteria to the allowable amount is called the inactivation (disinfection) time. For chlorine, the inactivation time is 30 min. when the chlorine content in water is in the range of 0.05 – 0.2 mg/l. For ozone, this time is 12 min. when the ozone content in water is 0.2 – 0.3 mg/l. In France, a time equal to 4 min is taken for water inactivation (ozone concentration 0.4 mg/l) [16].</p>\n<p>According to the technological scheme, the process begins with the formation of ozone. Ozone (O3) is formed by passing oxygen molecules through a high – voltage electrical discharge(as can be seen in Figure 6 (B)). The ozone then enters the water through a tube using a compressor. That is, at this time, there is a process of neutralization of harmful microorganisms contained in the water. When ozone comes into contact with pollutants in water, such as organic matter, bacteria, viruses, and other impurities, it breaks them down by giving them highly reactive oxygen atoms. This process effectively neutralizes and removes these pollutants. In general, ozone in water not only fights microorganisms, but also helps to remove particles and turbidity. The oxidizing power of ozone causes aggregation of small particles, making them easier to settle or filter during subsequent water treatment steps.</p>\n<p><strong>3.3 Testing the unit</strong><br />\nFor testing the installation, special research works were carried out on the Kapshagai reservoir located on the coast of the city of Kunaev and on the Vyacheslav reservoir located on the coast of Astana (Republic of Kazakhstan) (Wikipedia; ADB, 2021; CAWater-info).<br />\nDuring the technological process, the amount of ozone (0.3 – 0.6 g/hour) is consumed depending on the content of surface water in the warehouse. The treated water from the facility retained a residual ozone concentration ranging from approximately 0.09 to 0.3 mg/l. Presently, ozone technology stands as one of the contemporary approaches to water disinfection and purification. Ozone exerts both organoleptic and chemical effects on harmful bacteria present in water throughout the technological process. Its impact on waterborne microorganisms varies depending on factors such as pH level (pH = 6 – 10) and temperature (ranging from 0°C to 37°C). It’s challenging to assert that ozone selectively targets microorganisms in water: initially, it acts on dissolved organic impurities before affecting microorganisms (Abdykadyrov et al., 2023).</p>\n<p>Among the methods of surface water disinfection, ozone technology is very effective. For example, it can be observed in Figure 8 and Table 4 below (Draginsky et al., 2007; Abdykadyrov et al., 2023). Table 4 uses various disinfection methods (temperature 220C. pH = 6.8 – 7.0) from microorganisms (E. coli) and viruses can be observed with a decontamination efficiency of up to 97 – 99% percent.</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"707\" height=\"138\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Captuhre.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Captuhre.jpg 707w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Captuhre-300x59.jpg 300w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"459\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture15-1024x459.png\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture15-1024x459.png 1024w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture15-300x134.png 300w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture15-768x344.png 768w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture15-1536x688.png 1536w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture15.png 1931w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div><strong>Figure 8: </strong>K·T (concentration·time) values of various disinfectants for virus disinfection</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>What we see in Figure 8 is that chlorine is suitable for neutralizing bacteria and viruses, but should not be used to deactivate protozoa.

The protozoa contained in water (Cryptosporidium) actually react slowly with chlorine and chloramine. The K·T (concentration·time) values for chlorine deactivation are equal to 3000 – 4000 mg·min/l for 1 – log deactivation (90% deactivations.</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<div><img width=\"708\" height=\"138\" src=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ll.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ll.jpg 708w, https://www.watconman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ll-300x58.jpg 300w\" /></div>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>“Giardia cysts” refer to an intestinal infection caused by Giardia parasites, characterized by symptoms such as stomach cramps, bloating, nausea, and episodes of watery diarrhea.

Here ozone has little effect on ph and temperature. However, as the temperature increases, the solubility of ozone decreases, the level of disinfection increases at 10°C, in the range of 0 – 30°C, these two factors reduce each other. in the pH = 6 – 8.5 range, the ozone disinfection rate hardly changes. For some resistant microorganisms (such as Giardia Muris), the disinfection rate increases when the pH is high. For other types of microorganisms, the opposite is true.</p>\n<p>To determine the efficiency of oxidizing agents and destruction of microorganisms contained in surface water in the warehouse, it was necessary to develop a sanitary reliability criterion, taking into account<br />\nvarious reagents, their doses, the length of the water supply network, quality indicators. Such research work has already been adopted in the United States in previous centuries, that is, in the 1960s (Корко, 2020).</p>\n<p>According to scientific research, the ozonator plant was tested, special water was removed from the surface reservoirs of Kapshagai (Kunayev city) and Vyacheslav (Astana city), ozonation was carried out. Scientific research was carried out in the “sanitary and hygienic Laboratory” of the RSE (Republican State enterprise) of Almaty and in the scientific laboratories “Astana Su Arnasy” of Astana. The microbial parameters of water quality do not align with the Maximum Permissible Concentration (MPC), as demonstrated in the table provided below (Table 6).</p>\n</div>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pages</strong></td>\n<td>326-330</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Year</strong></td>\n<td>2024</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Issue</strong></td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Volume</strong></td>\n<td>8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n<div><h2>Download</h2><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a href=\"https://www.watconman.org/download/8475\" target=\" _blank\"><i></i>PDF Files</a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><a href=\"https://www.watconman.org/xml/3wcm2024/3wcm2024-331-351.xml\" target=\" _blank\"><i></i>XML Files</a></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div>\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div></div></div></div>","author":"dgnoraina","siteTitle":"Water Conservation and Management (WCM)","siteHash":"4b40cdd0834294d8593f52ee7e7261a0ac8d56f637281fa24c6ad595afc9ba11","entryHash":"20273b304deaa71ba53fd93bb88c32fc5ce652bb62df702586dcfc354a9cfc30","category":"Environment"}
