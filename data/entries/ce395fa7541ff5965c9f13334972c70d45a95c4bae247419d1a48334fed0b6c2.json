{"title":"Innovative Thinking in Volunteer Organizations and Leaders: Addressing the Impact of Psychological Ownership on Volunteer Commitment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0567/v1","date":1715238936000,"content":"This study encourages volunteer managers to innovate when enhancing volunteers' organizational commitment by adopting the new variable of psychological ownership, thus creating new management practices and systems. The findings indicate that psychological ownership significantly affects organizational commitment and can also enhance it through the partial mediating effect of volunteer motivation. Evidently, psychological ownership can become a major factor influencing volunteer retention. Consequently, two innovative management strategies are suggested to foster volunteer organizational commitment: Firstly, construct a diverse knowledge base for volunteer managers, facilitating a cognitive shift in leaders to enhance leadership, achieve better information sharing, and collaboration using diverse knowledge. Secondly, treat the organization's volunteers as a subsystem, develop psychological ownership as the foundation for system operations, integrate the volunteer system with the staff system through a decentralized decision-making structure, 'empower' the volunteer system, and stimulate members' sense of participation and responsibility, thereby fostering innovation and continuous improvement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce395fa7541ff5965c9f13334972c70d45a95c4bae247419d1a48334fed0b6c2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
