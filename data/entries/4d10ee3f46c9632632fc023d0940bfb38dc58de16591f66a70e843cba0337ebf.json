{"title":"Post‐release mortality of line‐caught snapper Chrysophrys auratus depends on hook site and capture depth","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12702?af=R","date":1710745200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Catch-and-release angling is common in recreational fisheries, but post-release mortality (PRM) may be high. We conducted a controlled field experiment to estimate mortality of released snapper <i>Chrysophrys auratus</i>. Recreational fishers caught 960 snapper from three depth strata (&lt;15, 15–25, 26–40 m) that were either lip-hooked, foul-hooked or gut-hooked. A bottom longline vessel caught 162 lip-hooked fish in shallow water to serve as controls. Fish were held in 15-m deep holding nets. All control fish and 80% of treatment fish survived, with anatomical hook site and capture depth significantly predicting mortality. Probability of mortality was lowest for lip-hooked fish in shallow water (5 m = 0.00, 95% CI [0.00, 0.03]), but increased rapidly to 20 m (0.24, 95% CI [0.2, 0.3]). Mortality of foul-hooked fish increased steadily with depth from 0.05 (95% CI [0.00, 0.78]) at 5 m to 0.65 (95% CI [0.13, 0.96]) at 40 m. Gut-hooking resulted in high mortality at all depths but a low sample size resulted in high uncertainty of estimates. Our results indicate that snapper PRM can be reduced by fishing in shallow water and by mitigating gut-hooking, possibly by using large circle hooks.</p>","author":"Jade Q.
