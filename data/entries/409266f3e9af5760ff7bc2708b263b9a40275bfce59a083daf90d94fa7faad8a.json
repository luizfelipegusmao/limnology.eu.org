{"title":"Influence of desert dust on the development of premature coronary disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1090/v1","date":1710822015000,"content":"Objectives: Recently, desert dust in Europe has been recognized as a cardiovascular health problem. In Spain, desert dust inflows in recent years have been associated with worsening air quality. The present study examines whether desert dust events are related to the incidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients under 55 years of age.\nMethods: Data from 2416 consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary hospital due to ACS were prospectively analyzed. A case-crossover time-stratified design using Poisson conditional regression models was applied to estimate the impact of desert dust events involving particulate matter concentrations of aerodynamic diameter &lt; 10 μm (PM10) on the incidence of ACS.\nResults: Desert dust intrusion on days 0 to 5 after ACS onset showed no significant association with the incidence of ACS in patients under 55 years of age. The incidence rate ratios of PM10 concentrations 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 and 5 days before ACS onset (for changes of 10 µg/m3) were 1.02 (95% CI 0.97-1.1; p = 0.41), 1.01 (95% CI 0.96-1.07; p = 0.66), 0.99 (95% CI 0.94-1.05; p = 0.78), 0.96 (95% CI 0.9-1.02; p = 0.18) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.91-1.04; p = 0.41).\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that desert dust is unlikely to be related to the incidence of premature coronary heart disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"409266f3e9af5760ff7bc2708b263b9a40275bfce59a083daf90d94fa7faad8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
