{"title":"Revealing the algicidal characteristics of Maribacter dokdonensis: An investigation into bacterial strain P4 isolated from Karenia mikimotoi bloom water","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13441?af=R","date":1712751025000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a global environmental concern, causing significant economic losses in fisheries and posing risks to human health. Algicidal bacteria have been suggested as a potential solution to control HABs, but their algicidal efficacy is influenced by various factors. This study aimed to characterize a novel algicidal bacterium, <i>Maribacter dokdonensis</i> (P4), isolated from a <i>Karenia mikimotoi</i> (Hong Kong strain, KMHK) HAB and assess the impact of P4 and KMHK's doses, growth phase, and algicidal mode and the axenicity of KMHK on P4's algicidal effect. Our results demonstrated that the algicidal effect of P4 was dose-dependent, with the highest efficacy at a dose of 25% v/v. The study also determined that P4's algicidal effect was indirect, with the P4 culture and the supernatant, but not the bacterial cells, showing significant effects. The algicidal efficacy was higher when both P4 and KMHK were in the stationary phase. Furthermore, the P4 culture at the log phase could effectively kill KMHK cells at the stationary phase, with higher algicidal efficacy in the bacterial culture than that of the supernatant alone. Interestingly, P4's algicidal efficacy was significantly higher when co-culturing with xenic KMHK (~90% efficacy at day 1) than that with the axenic KMHK (~50% efficacy at day 1), suggesting the presence of other bacteria could regulate P4's algicidal effect. The bacterial strain P4 also exhibited remarkable algicidal efficacy on four other dinoflagellate species, particularly the armored species. These results provide valuable insights into the algicidal effect of <i>M. dokdonensis</i> on <i>K. mikimotoi</i> and on their interactions.</p>","author":"Thomas Chun‐Hung Lee, \nWinnie Lam, \nNora Fung‐Yee Tam, \nSteven Jing‐Liang Xu, \nWing Lam Chung, \nFred Wang‐Fat Lee","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"ac9419f597bad7fdb6bd3ddec1df6a5cdcfd1f392092164792b77f3dceee79f4","category":"Environment"}
