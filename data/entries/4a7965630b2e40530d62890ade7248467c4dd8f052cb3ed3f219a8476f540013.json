The currently used high temperature superalloys have reached their temperature limit, requiring increased use of silicon-based ceramics in the hot-sections of these gas turbines. These ceramics are susceptible to hot-corrosion and recession attack from the harsh environments, and thus require protective coatings.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4a7965630b2e40530d62890ade7248467c4dd8f052cb3ed3f219a8476f540013","category":"Environment"}
