{"title":"Improved Experimental Yield of Temperature Cycle Induced Deracemization (TCID) with Cooling and Crystal Washing: Application of TCID for the Industrial Scale.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0632/v1","date":1718096553000,"content":"Temperature Cycle Induced Deracemization (TCID) offers a promising approach to obtain enantiopure solids from racemic mixtures. By combining rapid racemization in solution and temperature swings, homochirality is theoretically achieved. Despite theoretical expectations of doubled yields compared to traditional chiral separation methods, such as in Preferential Crystallization, experimental validation remains lacking. We applied TCID to (1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) pentan-3-one) (Cl-TAK), introducing a post-TCID cooling step to enhance yield and a washing step to augment enantiopurity. This refinement yielded an 89.8% mass yield with 99.1% enantiomeric excess in the crystal phase (c.e.e.) within 24 hours on an 8.75g scale, showcasing improved performance with insignificant process duration extension. Additionally, we explored the stochasticity of deracemization, observing the development from low initial crystal enantiomeric excesses(1-6% c.e.e0) at a 2.5 g scale. Kinetic analysis revealed that a 2% c.e.e0 effectively mitigates chiral flipping risks and induction time in our system. Our study underscores the potential for reduced initial c.e.e. to expedite deracemization and presents a straightforward method to optimize yield and purity, facilitating industrial application.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d87e4896539c7c600462dcbfe5a58f72d3db9d3d659433832f59e7c4dc6e5593","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
