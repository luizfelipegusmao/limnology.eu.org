{"title":"Role of IL-27 in COVID-19: A Thin Line Between Protection and Disease Promotion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1973/v1","date":1717044708000,"content":": Cytokine storm is usually described as one of the main reasons behind COVID-associated mor-tality. Cytokines are essential protein molecules engaged in immune responses; they play a critical role in protection against infections. However, they also contribute to inflammatory reactions and tissue damage, becoming a double-edged sword in the context of COVID-19. Recent studies have suggested various cytokines and chemokines that play a crucial role in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. One such cytokine is Interleukin 27 (IL-27), which has been found to be elevated in the blood plasma of patients with COVID-19. Within this study, we will explore the role of IL-27 in immune responses and address our own findings concerning this cytokine in COVID-19. It affects a wide variety of immune cells; regardless of the pathological process it is involved in, IL-27 is critical for upholding the necessary balance between tissue damage and cytotoxicity against in-fectious agents and/or tumors. In COVID-19, it is involved in multiple processes, including antiviral cytotoxicity via CD8+ cells, IgG subclass switching, and even the activation of Tregs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"299f7ed41a91ce711cbb6dc86446952ee1c63649e3f208780452084413cf640a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
