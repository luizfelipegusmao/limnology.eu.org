A donor funded programme, GP Care Cell, offered free HIV testing at selected private doctor-led clinics but uptake was low. We investigated whether HTS demand creation materials that used behavioural economics principles could increase demand for HIV testing at these clinics. We conducted a randomised controlled trial in Johannesburg, South Africa (January-April 2022) distributing brochures promoting HTS to adults in five private doctor-led clinic catchment areas. Individuals were randomised to receive three brochure types: (1) “Standard of care” (SOC) advertising a free HIV test and ART; (2) “Healthy lifestyle screening” promoted free low-cost health screenings in addition to HTS; and (3) “Recipient of care voucher” leveraged loss aversion and the endowment effect by highlighting the monetary value of free HTS. The primary outcome was presenting at the clinic following exposure to the brochures. Logistic regression compared outcomes between arms. We found that of the 12,129 brochures distributed, 658 were excluded because of errors or duplicates and 11,471 were analysed. About 59% of brochure recipients were male and 50,3% were aged 25–34 years. In total, 448 (3.9%) brochure recipients presented at the private doctor-led clinics of which 50.7% were males. There were no significant differences in clinic presentation between the healthy lifestyle screening and SOC arm (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 1.02; 95% CI 0.79–1.32), and similarly between the recipient of care voucher and SOC arm (AOR 1.08; 95% CI 0.84–1.39). Individuals were more likely to attend centrally-located clinics that had visible HTS branding (AOR = 5.30; 95% CI: 4.14–6.79). Brochures that used behavioural insights did not increase demand for HTS at private doctor-led clinics. However, consistent distribution of the brochures may have potential to increase HIV testing uptake at highly visible private doctor-led clinics.","author":"Simamkele Bokolo","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"c00d9e4bb4297a27100eaa1f21cac5e8b2f8ee2ddcfb2fb2e668cd3774594bcc","category":"Environment"}
