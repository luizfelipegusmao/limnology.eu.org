{"title":"Juvenile Osteochondritis Dissecans: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0198/v1","date":1722908512000,"content":"(1) Background: This report aims to illustrate the development, progression, diagnosis and treatment of chronically present articular surface lesions; (2) Methods: In this report, two patients are described from the point of initial presentation of symptoms to surgical consultation based on radiologic findings. These patients underwent corrective surgery in the form of mosaicplasty to repair the lesion present at the articular surface and the underlying subchondral bone. (3) Discussion: Diagnosing juvenile OCD remains challenging due to variable clinical presentation and minute radiologic discoveries. X-rays are useful, however, the gold standard remains to be arthroscopy which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Future prospects include the use of novel sonographic methods and the use of artificial intelligence within the given modalities. (4) Conclusions: The detailed imaging provided by MRI, combined with the insights from X-rays and potentially other modalities, allows for a nuanced understanding of the disease. This comprehensive approach ensures that treatment decisions are well-informed, optimizing outcomes for young patients with this condition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a905d59bb949187df82f032770a3248dd08a89d39b199009d41c29717d2113cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
