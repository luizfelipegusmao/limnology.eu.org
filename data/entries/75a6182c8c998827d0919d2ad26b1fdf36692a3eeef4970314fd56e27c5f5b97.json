{"title":"A Blockchain-Based Fish Supply Chain Framework for Maintaining Fish Quality and Authenticity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1560/v1","date":1711454598000,"content":"The fish supply chain (FSC) industry faces a significant challenge in terms of maintaining fish quality and authenticity throughout the chain. The main goal of modern FSC systems is tracking and tracing the fish product at each stage, from harvester to end customer, as well as assessing its quality and authenticity. Integrating FSC with new technologies, such as Blockchain (BC), Big Data, Artificial intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT), enhances fish product traceability, authenticity, visibility, and security. We propose a BC-based FSC framework that follows a layered architecture consisting of a SC layer, an IoT layer, and a BC layer. We integrate a new AI-based hand-held device, a Quality, Adulteration &amp; Traceability (QAT) device, that can identify fish species and assess fish quality. We leverage the key features of BC and smart contracts, deployed over the Ethereum platform for the proposed framework integrated with QAT technology. Extensive validation of smart contracts is conducted to prove its practical feasibility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75a6182c8c998827d0919d2ad26b1fdf36692a3eeef4970314fd56e27c5f5b97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
