Rapid identification of this variant is essential for pandemic assessment and containment. However, variant identification is mainly being performed using expensive and time-consuming genomic sequencing. In this study, we propose an alternative RT-qPCR approach for the detection of the Omicron BA.1 variant using a low-cost and rapid SYBR Green method. We have designed specific primers to confirm the deletion mutations in the spike (S Δ143-145) and the nucleocapsid (N Δ31-33) which are characteristics of this variant. For the evaluation, we used 120 clinical samples from patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, and displaying an S-gene target failure (SGTF) when using TaqPath COVID-19 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) that included the ORF1ab, S, and N gene targets. Our results showed that all the 120 samples harbored S Δ143-145 and N Δ31-33, which was further confirmed by whole-genome sequencing of 10 samples, thereby validating our SYBR Green-based protocol. This protocol can be easily implemented to rapidly confirm the diagnosis of the Omicron BA.1 variant in COVID-19 patients and prevent its spread among populations, especially in countries with high prevalence of SGTF profile.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"c19318df8b8c24129434f0b4030909ade937e05c1e3e93309c6923e16d2b866f","category":"Environment"}
