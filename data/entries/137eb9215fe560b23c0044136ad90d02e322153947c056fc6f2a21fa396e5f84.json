{"title":"BMD, CTX-1, and Osteocalcin as Monitoring Parameters of Bone Remodelling in CML Patients Undergoing Imatinib Therapy: From Basic Science to Clinical Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1641/v1","date":1726837577000,"content":"Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is one of the most commonly found types of myeloproliferative neoplasms, characterized by increased proliferation of granulocytic cells without losing their differentiation ability. Imatinib, a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI), can be effectively used as therapy for CML. However, imatinib can affect bone turnover, thus having clinical implications on the bones of CML patients undergoing long-term imatinib therapy. However, parameters that can accurately describe the bone condition in CML patients receiving imatinib still need further study. A combination of imaging techniques such as Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and bone turnover activity markers such as C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-1) and Osteocalcin has the potential to be used as monitoring parameters for bone density abnormalities in CML patients receiving imatinib. This article explains the rationale for using BMD, CTX-1, and Osteocalcin as monitoring parameters of bone remodeling in CML patients receiving imatinib. First, the physiological process of bone turnover will be explained. Then, we describe the role of tyrosine kinase in bone metabolism. Next, the impact of imatinib on BMD, CTX-1, and Osteocalcin will be explained. In conclusion, the assessment of bone health of CML patients on Imatinib should include both BMD tests and bone turnover marker assays such as CTX-1 and Osteocalcin.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"137eb9215fe560b23c0044136ad90d02e322153947c056fc6f2a21fa396e5f84","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
