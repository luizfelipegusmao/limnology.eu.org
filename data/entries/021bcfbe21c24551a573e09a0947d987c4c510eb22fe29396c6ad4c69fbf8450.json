{"title":"First Description of a Thermophilic, Endophytic Aspergillus brasiliensis Strain from a Volcanic Ecosystem: Genomic Analysis and Plant Growth Benefits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0871/v1","date":1718257052000,"content":"Abstract: Thermophilic fungi constitute an interesting study model for understanding ecologi-cal mechanisms of adaptation in diverse environments and have attractive toolboxes with a wide range of biotechnological applications. This work describes for the first time an endophytic and thermophilic strain of Aspergillus brasiliensis that was isolated in the crater of the active volcano \"El Chichonal\" in Mexico. The average temperature of the collection site was around 60 Â°C and the soil pH was moderately acidic. The complete genome of A. brasiliensis E_15.1 was sequenced and assembled in about 37 Mb of genomic DNA. We performed a comprehensive phylogenomic anal-ysis for the precise taxonomic identification of this species as a novel strain of Aspergillus brasil-iensis. Likewise, the predicted coding sequences were classified according to various functions including Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZymes), biosynthetic gene clusters of secondary metabolites (BGCs), and metabolic pathways associated with plant growth promotion. Among the functional traits identified was the degradation of chitin, chitooligosaccharides, xylan, and cellulose, as well as the biosynthesis of clavaric acid, a triterpene with antitumor activity due to its ability to inhibit Farnesyl-protein transferase. In addition to the genomic analysis, a set of en-zymatic assays confirmed the thermostability of extracellular xylanases, cellulases of A. brasili-ensis E_15.1. Our findings suggest that the enzymatic repertoire of A. brasiliensis E_15.1 has a high potential for industrial application due to its thermostability and can promote plant growth at high temperatures. Finally, this strain constitutes an interesting source of terpenoids with pharmacological activity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"021bcfbe21c24551a573e09a0947d987c4c510eb22fe29396c6ad4c69fbf8450","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
