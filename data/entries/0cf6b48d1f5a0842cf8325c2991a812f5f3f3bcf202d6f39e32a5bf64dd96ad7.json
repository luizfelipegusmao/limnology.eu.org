{"title":"502 Cat and mouse: The effect of consuming four different diet formants (intact mice, raw, canned wet and kibble) on energy expended to consume a meal and immediately post-prandial in domestic cats","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/136/7757281?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cats are obligate carnivores; however, we feed them a variety of different diet formats without a clear understanding of feeding behavior and metabolism among diet formats. Whole-prey or raw diets may mimic a more natural diet and require more energy to consume. However, there is currently a dearth of literature examining feline energy expenditure (EE) during the consumption of and immediate post-prandial period when fed different diet formats. The present study aimed to investigate differences in the energetics of adult cats consuming four different diet formats in isocaloric offerings: raw intact mice, commercial raw, canned wet, and kibble diets. Adult neutered male cats [n = 12; body weight (BW) = 4.82 ± 0.164 kg) were used in a 4 x 4 replicated Latin square design and adapted to consuming each diet format before the initiation of the study. Following a 2-d adaptation period, cats were fed 25% of their daily caloric requirement (50.77 ± 1.549 kcal) in indirect calorimetry chambers in which VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub> exchange were measured. Energy expenditure (kcal/BW<sup>0.67</sup> kg) was calculated for the consumption period, 15 min immediately post-prandial and 2 h post-prandial. Respiratory gases were measured for one fasted reading, followed by the first feeding. During each feeding, measurements were taken during the consumption period and 15 min post-prandial. For the following 2 h, respiratory gases were measured every 25 min for an additional 4 measures of respiratory gases. All data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model considering the effects of treatment, time and their interaction as fixed, and the effects of cat and period as random. A spatial power covariance structure was used to model repeated measures. Significance was considered at <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05 and Tukey’s post-hoc test was performed to separate means. Energy expenditure during consumption and 15 min post-prandial was similar among treatments, and EE for 15 min post-prandial was greater than EE during consumption (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). During the 2 h post-prandial, EE for the mice diet was greater than the kibble and canned wet diets (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001), while EE for the raw diet was only greater than the kibble diet (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). Energy expenditure was similar between the kibble and canned wet diets (<span>P</span> = 0.919) and between the mice and raw diets (<span>P</span> = 0.598). Among all treatments and time periods, the mouse diet had the greatest mean EE. An increase in EE during the feeding period and post-prandial could benefit sedentary indoor cats who may be in positive energy balance. Feeding cats a naturalistic diet, such as intact mice or a raw diet, may increase activity levels and EE, but the longer-term effects of these feeding formats on energy balance need to be explored.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"0cf6b48d1f5a0842cf8325c2991a812f5f3f3bcf202d6f39e32a5bf64dd96ad7","category":"Environment"}
