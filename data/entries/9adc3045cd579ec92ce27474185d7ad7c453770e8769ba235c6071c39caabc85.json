{"title":"Diagnosis of Wilkie&rsquo;s Syndrome Associated with Nutcracker Syndrome: A Case Report and Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0919/v1","date":1718273553000,"content":"Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome or Wilkieâ€™s syndrome is a vascular compression disorder that causes abnormal compression of the third portion of the duodenum by the SMA. It has a low incidence rate, higher in young women, and is rarely associated with the Nutcracker phenomenon: a condition of compression of the left renal vein between the SMA and the aorta, which manifests as pain in the left flank and pelvis. Here we report the case of a 54-year-old woman with a history of repeated episodes of abdominal pain caused by the Nutcracker syndrome and Wilkie's syndrome.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9adc3045cd579ec92ce27474185d7ad7c453770e8769ba235c6071c39caabc85","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
