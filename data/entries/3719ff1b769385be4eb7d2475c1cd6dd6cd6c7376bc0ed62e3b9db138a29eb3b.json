{"title":"Effect of an Applied Magnetic Field on Joule Heating-Induced Thermal Convection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0456/v1","date":1728295548000,"content":"Thermal convection induced by Joule heating in weak electrical conducting liquid such as molten salts with symmetric thermal boundary conditions is investigated using linear stability analysis. We  show that the effect of the magnetic field consists on the delay of the threshold of thermal convection and show that for intense magnetic field, the size of thermoconvective rolls increases. Analysis of the budget of the perturbations kinetic energy reveals that the Lorentz force contributes to the dissipation of the kinetic energy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3719ff1b769385be4eb7d2475c1cd6dd6cd6c7376bc0ed62e3b9db138a29eb3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
