{"title":"The Oxidation Sequence of Ultrathin Hafnium Metal on Graphene","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.539/7719973?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Direct growth of high-Îº dielectric hafnium dioxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>) on two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors such as MoS<sub>2</sub> is challenging due to the dangling bond-free surface of 2D materials. Introducing quasi-van der Waals epitaxy between Hf metal and the 2D material, followed by a controlled oxidation process, offers a possible pathway towards scalable formation of a conformal HfO<sub>2</sub> dielectric [<a href=\"#ozae044.539-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.539-B2\">2</a>]. Towards this end, understanding the oxidation of ultrathin Hf film at atomic level is highly required for kinetic control. In addition, hafnium oxides with rich crystal phases are also of interest because of their ferroelectricity and potential application in resistive switching random access memory [<a href=\"#ozae044.539-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.539-B4\">4</a>]. Therefore, oxidation studies of Hf on 2D materials will also contribute to the phase engineering of hafnium oxides towards different applications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7eba35257723cc78749d5a50a542c0f6896baef6e5ecc153001139ae274093d2","category":"Environment"}
