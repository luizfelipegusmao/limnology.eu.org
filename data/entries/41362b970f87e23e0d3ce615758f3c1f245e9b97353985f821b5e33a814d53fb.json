{"title":"Ecuadorian Provinces with High Morbidity and Mortality Rates due to Asthma among Working-Age Population: An Ecological and Exploratory Study to Promoting Respiratory Health","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1247/v1","date":1716213995000,"content":"Asthma is a significant public health concern. This study identified the provinces with the highest morbidity and mortality rates due to asthma among the working-age population (15-69 years) in the Republic of Ecuador. The secondary objective was to explain the possible differences attribut-able to occupational exposure. This nationwide ecological and exploratory study was conducted in 24 provinces between 2016 and 2019. Government databases were used as sources of infor-mation. Standardized rates were calculated for codes the J45 and J46. The hospitalization mor-bidity rate for asthma decreased from 6.51 to 5.76 cases per 100,000 working-age population, and the mortality rate has consistently been low and stable from 0.14 to 0.15 deaths per 100,000 working-age population. Geographic differences between the provinces were evident. The risk of hospitalization and death due to asthma was higher in the Pacific coast (five provinces) and the Andean region (two provinces). The high rates observed in provinces with greater agricultural and industrial development could be the main determinants of national heterogeneity and could act as occupational risk factors. The contribution of occupational hazards in each province should be examined in depth through ad hoc studies. These findings provide valuable information for creating public policies aimed at promoting and safeguarding the respiratory health of the popu-lation, particularly that of workers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"41362b970f87e23e0d3ce615758f3c1f245e9b97353985f821b5e33a814d53fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
