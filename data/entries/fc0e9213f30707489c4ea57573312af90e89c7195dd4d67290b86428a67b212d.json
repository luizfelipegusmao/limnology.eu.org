{"title":"Exploring the Role of PD-1 in the Autoimmune Response: Insights into Its Implication in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1533/v1","date":1718981531000,"content":"Despite advances in our knowledge of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has increased over time, there are still many challenges in deciphering the precise mechanisms involved in the development and progression of the disease. Recent evidence has raised questions about the effectiveness of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) in suppressing autoreactive CD4+ T cells during the autoimmune response. Research has ventured into investigate the potential impact of PD-1 on various CD4+ T cell subpopulations, including T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells, and T peripheral helper (Tph) cells, all of which exhibit substantial PD-1 expression and have been closely related with several autoimmune disorders including SLE. This review aims to highlight the complex role of PD-1 in autoimmunity and emphasizes the imperative for further research to elucidate its functions during autoreactive T-cell response. Additionally, we address the potential of PD-1 or its ligands as a possible therapeutic target in SLE.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc0e9213f30707489c4ea57573312af90e89c7195dd4d67290b86428a67b212d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
