{"title":"Systematic Review on SEO and Digital Marketing Strategies for Enhancing Retail SMEs' Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1715/v1","date":1729763971000,"content":"The retail industry's shift from traditional to online platforms has heightened the need for effective search engine optimization (SEO) strategies to improve digital marketing outcomes. SEO involves optimizing a website's technical and content features to increase its visibility in search engine results, potentially driving traffic, enhancing brand awareness, and boosting revenue. This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of various SEO tactics on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the retail sector, focusing on key performance metrics such as website traffic, search engine rankings, conversion rates, and overall business growth. A comprehensive search was conducted across major academic databases, including Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science, resulting in 102 studies published between 2014 and 2024. The methodological approach utilized both narrative synthesis and quantitative analysis to evaluate the quality and findings of the selected studies, following PRISMA2020 guidelines. The analysis shows that effective SEO practices, such as robust content marketing, technical SEO enhancements, and precise keyword optimization, lead to significant improvements in digital performance metrics. Specifically, up to a 30% increase in website traffic was observed, and keyword optimization improved click-through rates by 20% to 40%. The impact on conversion rates was more variable, with improvements ranging from 10% to 25%, influenced by factors like SEO quality and market conditions. Furthermore, integrating SEO with digital marketing strategies within e-business models enhanced operational efficiency by up to 15% and increased revenue growth by 25%. However, biases in the literature, such as the selective reporting of positive outcomes, may affect the overall reliability of these findings. While SEO strategies effectively drive website traffic and improve search engine rankings, their direct influence on conversion rates is less consistent. A balanced approach, combining SEO practices with strategic IT alignment, is crucial for sustained business success in the retail industry. Future research should address the variability in conversion outcomes and investigate the conditions under which SEO tactics are most effective.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e1d7d0627a4428b6641b2e23f4d559ea61dbb426550d5ff3e7684e486f4e22c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
