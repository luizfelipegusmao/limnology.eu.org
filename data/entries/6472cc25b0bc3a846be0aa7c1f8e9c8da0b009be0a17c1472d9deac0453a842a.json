{"title":"Sea turtle bycatch in Argentina: A qualitative assessment in commercial vessels","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4157?af=R","date":1713423600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>1. The Northern Argentine continental shelf is a sea turtle feeding ground that overlaps with important fisheries. Few studies assessed bycatch impact, especially on commercial vessels. 2. This work documents sea turtles' bycatch, fishery involved, species captured and crew actions. 3. Bycatch in four fisheries were registered at the 107 interviews to fishers conducted between 2021 and 2023, showing the urgency to research bottom trawling for demersal multi-species. Fishers frequently recognize <i>Caretta caretta</i>, and positive and negative practices towards animals have been documented on-board. 4. These results will help focus researches on fisheries with the greatest impact on sea turtles in the region. They also underscore the necessity for implementing commercial vessel monitoring programmes and improving on-board handling practices.</p>","author":"Sofía Jones, \nRodrigo Calvo, \nMelisa Celia Jazmin Rolón, \nGermán Tettamanti, \nDavid Gustavo Vera, \nLaura Prosdocimi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems: Table of Contents","siteHash":"53f1a0c472ad7591633d0b281e1df2834126145a77ec9c0585f4049ad3e52c8f","entryHash":"6472cc25b0bc3a846be0aa7c1f8e9c8da0b009be0a17c1472d9deac0453a842a","category":"Environment"}
