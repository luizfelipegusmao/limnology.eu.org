{"title":"Temperature analysis of a custom-built electric vehicle at two different speeds","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0804/v1","date":1715596201000,"content":"In this paper, we examined the temperature variations of key constituents during the operational cycle of a custom-built electric vehicle. The vehicle was made employing a motor of 10kW, a KLS7275D controller, and a lithium-ion battery. Temperature sensors for monitoring was affixed to the motor, controller, and battery, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of thermal behaviors. A controlled 20 minute driving tests encompassing both high and low speeds were executed to scrutinize temperature variations. Our findings reveal that the controller exhibited the most substantial temperature fluctuation compared to the battery and motor. Results shows the importance of thermal management strategies for components to ensure optimal driving performance and component reliability in electric vehicles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"252860ff22566d376e7c2cd9de701692d101a9ec6cff4b8f8f27200a9c129488","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
