{"title":"Production and characterization of homologous protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO) proteins: Evidence that small N-terminal amino acid changes do not impact protein function","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311049","date":1727359200000,"content":"<p>by Cunxi Wang, Meiying Zheng, Chandler Est, Remi Lawal, Wenguang Liang, David A.

PPO is a membrane-associated protein with an intrinsic tendency for aggregation, making expression, purification, and formulation at high concentrations difficult. In this study, transgenic PPO expressed in three crops was demonstrated to exhibit up to a 13 amino acid sequence difference in the N-terminus due to differential processing of the chloroplast transit peptide (CTP). Five PPO protein variants were produced in and purified from <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>, each displaying equivalent immunoreactivity and functional activity, with values ranging from 193 to 266 nmol min<sup>-1</sup> mg<sup>-1</sup>. Inclusion of an N-terminal 6xHis-tag or differential processing of the CTP peptide does not impact PPO functional activity. Additionally, structural modeling by Alphafold, ESMfold, and Openfold indicates that these short N-terminal extensions are disordered and predicted to not interfere with the mature PPO structure. These results support the view that safety studies on PPO from various crops can be performed from a single representative variant. Herein, we report a novel and robust method for large-scale production of PPO, enabling rapid production of more than 200 g of highly active PPO protein at 99% purity and low endotoxin contamination. We also present a formulation that allows for concentration of active PPO to &gt; 75 mg/mL in a buffer suitable for mammalian toxicity studies.","author":"Cunxi Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0678a2507182ae5881e1bfa9183572d37704dba5d20f6ba86cd4a525c10f1e40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
