{"title":"Project Requirements for Wireline Method of HDD","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0023/v1","date":1725260033000,"content":"This paper gives a brief insight of project requirements for “Wireline” method of Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD). In any drilling project, it is extremely important to know the precise location of existing lines, know the precise location of the advancing drill bit and know the precise location of the newly installed line. The wireline method is mainly used to accurately steer during medium (Midi-HDD), and large (Maxi-HDD). Today, there are two methods of HDD wireline steering: magnetic and gyro. The magnetic steering tool uses a surface tracking system to verify the tool’s precise underground position. Sensors located within the down-hole provide constant updates of Inclination, Azimuth and Tool Face orientation to the surface via a wireline. The data is processed utilizing computers from the surface and specialized Steering software to provide information on depth, course length and distance off the predetermined azimuth. In addition to a great steering method, HDD projects require the presence of well-trained and experienced steering technicians. Those people are specifically trained to operate the machinery, and it would be counterproductive to work with such great equipment without the help of the correct operators. In conclusion, the wireline method of HDD has a unique capability to track the location of the cutterhead and steer it during the drilling process. The result is a greater capability in placing the necessary utilities in difficult underground conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a9f146ae8de41de685c16835bc76f4e21782af7e1f5f3df67230b1850605ba58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
