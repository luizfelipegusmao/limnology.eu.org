{"title":"Optimization of a Sonophotocatalysis Water Treatment Process Using Inverse Artificial Neural Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1066/v1","date":1718606093000,"content":"Modeling the reaction time required for the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from wastewater is important because can be an indicator of harmful pollutants that may pose risks to human health..  Here, we evaluate the use of an  inverse artificial neural network (ANNi) to optimize  the removal of COD from aqueous herbicide solutions using sonophotocatalysis as the treatment process.. This algorithm takes the operating conditions as input and estimates the optimal reaction time to reach the required effluent COD. This model was validated by comparison with both experimental measurements and simulated analysis, resulting in low  error (0.5%), high Pearson correlation (R2 = 0.9956), and short computing time (less than one minute). The results for the proposed methodology (ANNi-GAs) were efficient and attractive in a reasonable way providing a satisfactory picture of the relationships between the optimal input parameters. Such parameters control the degradation process of herbicides online and can be used to predict the behavior of COD removal, thus taking actions to reduce the impact of aqueous treatment with alazine and gesaprim herbicides on aquatic, soil biota, and human health. Therefore, this technique constitutes a promising framework for predicting the environmental impact of herbicides within a tolerable degree of error.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5de21a462806c7de9f5a9484d72c17f07f8335f6647d1c9b892407932347ee33","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
