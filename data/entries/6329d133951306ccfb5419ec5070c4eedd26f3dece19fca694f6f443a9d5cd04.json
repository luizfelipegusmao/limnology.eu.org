{"title":"Revealing a Binary Pattern Validates 3n+1 Problem for All Positive Integers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0943/v1","date":1713171315000,"content":"This study delves into a unique binary pattern found within the wellknown 3n+1 problem, or Collatz conjecture. Through careful analysis of the steps in the 3n+1 sequence, we have discovered a special binary representation that captures the behavior of all positive integers undergoing this transformation. With this new understanding, we have provided a solid proof confirming the validity of the 3n+1 problem for all positive integers. Our method goes beyond the need for extensive computational confirmation, providing a simple and elegant resolution to a long-standing mathematical mystery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6329d133951306ccfb5419ec5070c4eedd26f3dece19fca694f6f443a9d5cd04","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
