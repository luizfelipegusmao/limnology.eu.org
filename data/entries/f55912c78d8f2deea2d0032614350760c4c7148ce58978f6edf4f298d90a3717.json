{"title":"Comparison of Survival Outcomes between Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreato-Splenectomy and Conventional Distal Pancreato-Splenectomy for Pancreatic Body and Tail Cancer: Korean Multicenter Propensity Score Match Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0794/v1","date":1710342440000,"content":"(1) Background: The aim of this study was to compare the survival benefit of radical ante-grade-modular pancreato-splenectomy (RAMPS) with conventional distal pancreato-splenectomy (cDPS) in left-sided pancreatic cancer. (2) Methods: A retrospective propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was conducted on 333 patients who underwent RAMPS or cDPS for left-sided pancreatic cancer at four tertiary cancer centers. The study assessed prognostic factors and com-pared survival and operative outcomes. (3) Results: After PSM, 99 patients were matched in each group. RAMPS resulted in a higher retrieved lymph node count than cDPS (15.0 vs. 10.0, p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of R0 resection rate, blood loss, hospital stay, or morbidity. The 5-year overall survival rate was similar in both groups (cDPS vs. RAMPS, 44.4% vs. 45.2%, p = 0.853), and disease-free survival was also comparable. Multivariate analysis revealed that ASA score, preoperative CA19-9, histologic differentiation, R1 resection, adjuvant treatment, and lymphovascular invasion were significant prognostic factors for overall survival. Preoperative CA19-9, histologic differentiation, T-stage, adjuvant treatment, and lymphovascular invasion were independent significant prognostic factors for disease-free survival. (4) Conclusions: Although RAMPS resulted in a higher retrieved lymph node count, survival outcomes were not different between two groups. RAMPS was a surgical option to achieve R0 resection rather than a standard procedure. Adjuvant treatment was an independent prognostic factor for both overall and disease-free survival.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f55912c78d8f2deea2d0032614350760c4c7148ce58978f6edf4f298d90a3717","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
