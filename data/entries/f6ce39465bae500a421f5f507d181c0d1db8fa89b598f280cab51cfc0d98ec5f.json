{"title":"Spatio‐temporal variation in reproductive characteristics of invasive fish Pseudorasbora parva (Temmick & Schlegel, 1846) in the lakes region of Türkiye","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15932?af=R","date":1728536752000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Invasive species present a serious peril to aquatic ecosystems worldwide, thus it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the reproductive dynamics, spreading characteristics, and biological properties of these species in order to effectively manage their population structure and mitigate both the ecological damage and economic loss they can cause. For this reason, we delved into the reproductive dynamics of <i>Pseudorasbora parva</i>, an invasive species of inland water fish found in Türkiye. We focused on three populations inhabiting Beyşehir (Konya, Isparta) and Eğirdir Lakes (Isparta) and Onaç Reservoir (Burdur). Sampling was carried out on a monthly basis from March 2021 to June 2022, utilizing a variety of tools such as multimesh nets, seine nets, and electrofishing. The developmental stages of gonads and reproductive cells were determined through morphological and microscopic examinations. A total of 1186 <i>P. parva</i> individuals were captured from all three lakes. Our results showed that the Beyşehir Lake population spawned from March to July, while the Eğirdir Lake population did so between May and October, and the Onaç Reservoir population laid their eggs from June to August. Female individuals in Beyşehir Lake, Eğirdir Lake, and Onaç Reservoir had initial breeding lengths of 3.49, 4.89, and 5.35 cm, respectively. In comparison, male individuals measured 5.56, 4.80, and 5.40 cm. Interestingly, the Beyşehir Lake population exhibited the highest egg fecundity, with each individual at 2 years producing a remarkable 2949 eggs. The present findings provide valuable information for us to further understand the reproductive biology and dynamics of <i>P. parva</i>, which could be useful in managing and preventing the spread of this invasive species in inland aquatic ecosystems.</p>","author":"Fahrettin Küçük, \nErgi Bahrioğlu, \nSalim Serkan Güçlü, \nMevlüt Nazıroğlu, \nİskender Gülle, \nSera Övgü Kabadayı Yıldırım","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"f6ce39465bae500a421f5f507d181c0d1db8fa89b598f280cab51cfc0d98ec5f","category":"Environment"}
