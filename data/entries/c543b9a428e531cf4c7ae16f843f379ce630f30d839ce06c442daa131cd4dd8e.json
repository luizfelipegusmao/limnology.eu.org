We show that architected materials, which have macroscopic properties that differ from those of their constituent components, can increase wave energy dissipation by more than an order of magnitude over both natural and existing artificial reefs, while providing a biocompatible environment. We present a search that optimized their design through proper hydrodynamic modeling and experimental testing, validated their performance, and characterized sustainable materials for their construction.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"c543b9a428e531cf4c7ae16f843f379ce630f30d839ce06c442daa131cd4dd8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
