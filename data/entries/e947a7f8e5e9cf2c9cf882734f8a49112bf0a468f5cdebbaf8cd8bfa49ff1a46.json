Double reduction method is a structured and systematic approach in the analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs). We first identify the Lie point symmetries of the K-B system and construct four non-trivial conservation laws using the multiplier method. The association between the Lie point symmetries and the conservation laws is established, and the generalized double reduction method is then applied to transform the B-K system into second-order differential equations or algebraic equations. The reduction process allowed us to derive two exact solutions for the K-B system, illustrating the methodâ€™s effectiveness in handling nonlinear systems. This work highlights the effectiveness of the generalized double reduction method in simplifying and solving nonlinear nonlinear systems of PDEs, contributing to a deeper understanding of the systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e947a7f8e5e9cf2c9cf882734f8a49112bf0a468f5cdebbaf8cd8bfa49ff1a46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
