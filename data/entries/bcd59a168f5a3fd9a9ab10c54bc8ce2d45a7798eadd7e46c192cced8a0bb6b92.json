{"title":"Effects of different pretreatment methods on the degree of substitution, structure, and physicochemical properties of synthesized malic acid sweet potato starch ester","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13766?af=R","date":1721985976000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The preparation of malic acid starch ester (MSE) is mostly carried out using a high temperature method, but there are problems such as high energy consumption, long preparation time, and uneven heating. Microwave technology can be used to overcome these limitations. The semi-crystalline structure of starch granules hinders the modifier's access to the matrix, thus limiting the esterification reaction. Physical techniques can act on the interior of the starch to create a number of active sites, thereby facilitating the reaction of the starch with esterification reagents. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of starch pretreatment by microwave, heat-moisture, and ultrasonic techniques on the degree of substitution (DS), structure, and physicochemical properties of MSE synthesized by the microwave method.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The DS of MSE was increased after pretreatments. The modified starch obtained by different pretreatment methods did not show new characteristic peaks, while the MSE synthesized showed new absorption peaks near 1735 cm<sup>−1</sup>. The granular structure and morphology of the modified starch obtained by microwave and heat-moisture pretreatment were gelatinized and aggregated, while some of the starch particles of the modified starch obtained by ultrasonic pretreatment appeared pore-sized. The relative crystallinity and gelatinization enthalpy of the MSE were reduced, but the crystallization pattern remained as A-type.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Overall, the results suggest that various pretreatment methods can enhance the DS of MSE by disrupting the structure of starch. The findings of this study provide theoretical support for improving the DS of esterified starch. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Wei Wang, \nShiwei Liu, \nYu Li, \nJiatian Yan, \nAijun Hu, \nJie Zheng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"bcd59a168f5a3fd9a9ab10c54bc8ce2d45a7798eadd7e46c192cced8a0bb6b92","category":"Environment"}
