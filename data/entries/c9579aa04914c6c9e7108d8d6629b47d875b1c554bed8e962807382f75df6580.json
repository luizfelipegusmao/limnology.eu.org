The administration of antiplatelet agents before endovascular treatment for ruptured cerebral aneurysms may reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications.</p> Aim <p>This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of preoperative aspirin administration in endovascular treatment for ruptured cerebral aneurysms.</p> Sample size estimates <p>Assuming a 15% incidence rate of both intraoperative thromboembolic morbidity and symptomatic ischemic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging diffusion-weighted imaging scans assessed by an Independent Review Committee, a sample size of 484 will be required to detect a 10% improvement with aspirin administration with 90% power using the Pearsonâ€™s chi-square test at a two-sided significance level of 2.5% for each primary outcome, after accounting for a 5% dropout rate.</p> Methods and design <p>ASTOP is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 484 patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms receiving coil embolization within 72 h of onset will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 200 mg of aspirin or placebo before the procedure.</p> Study outcomes <p>The primary outcomes will be the incidence rates of intraoperative thromboembolic complications and symptomatic ischemic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging diffusion-weighted imaging scans evaluated by the Independent Review Committee. The secondary outcomes will be the incidence rate of cerebral ischemic events and all bleeding events within 14 days of enrollment and functional outcomes defined by the modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days.</p> Discussion <p>This trial will provide valuable data on the role of antiplatelet agents during endovascular treatment for ruptured cerebral aneurysms.</p> Trial registration <p>Registration: Japan Registry of Clinical Trials, Identifier: jRCTs031210421.</p>","author":"Sakyo Hirai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c9579aa04914c6c9e7108d8d6629b47d875b1c554bed8e962807382f75df6580","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
