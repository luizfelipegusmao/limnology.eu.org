{"title":"Integrating phylogenies into single-cell RNA sequencing analysis allows comparisons across species, genes, and cells","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002633","date":1716559200000,"content":"<p>by Samuel H.

Dunn</p>\r\n\r\nComparisons of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across species can reveal links between cellular gene expression and the evolution of cell functions, features, and phenotypes. These comparisons evoke evolutionary histories, as depicted by phylogenetic trees, that define relationships between species, genes, and cells. This Essay considers each of these in turn, laying out challenges and solutions derived from a phylogenetic comparative approach and relating these solutions to previously proposed methods for the pairwise alignment of cellular dimensional maps. This Essay contends that species trees, gene trees, cell phylogenies, and cell lineages can all be reconciled as descriptions of the same conceptâ€”the tree of cellular life. By integrating phylogenetic approaches into scRNA-seq analyses, challenges for building informed comparisons across species can be overcome, and hypotheses about gene and cell evolution can be robustly tested.","author":"Samuel H.
