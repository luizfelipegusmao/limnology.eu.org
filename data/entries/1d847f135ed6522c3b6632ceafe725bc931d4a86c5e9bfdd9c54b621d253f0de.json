{"title":"Seismic Vulnerability of Florence, Italy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0966/v1","date":1728866960000,"content":"In recent years, the assessment of damage scenarios of urban communities has become one of the central themes in local government policies, aimed at promoting effective seismic risk mitigation and improving the efficiency of rescue systems to manage emergencies. In Italy, the seismic hazard has become a topic issue since the 1982 Irpinia earthquake, and several ventures have been promoted to face the seismic mitigation of complex residential districts. The objective of this research is to define the damage scenarios of the city of Florence, where 97% of the building stock is designed without anti-seismic prescriptions. The urban vulnerability of Florence has been assessed on the basis of the current approaches available in technical literature, and it has been combined with the knowledge provided by the recent investigation on the subsoil. Once the possible damage scenarios have been defined, the resilience of the area has been determined and the population involved in the evacuation has been estimated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d847f135ed6522c3b6632ceafe725bc931d4a86c5e9bfdd9c54b621d253f0de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
