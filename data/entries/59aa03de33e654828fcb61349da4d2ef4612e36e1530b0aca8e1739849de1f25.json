{"title":"The Effect of Different Seeding and Fertilizer Rates on Agronomic Traits, Yield and Yield Components of Two Fodder Oat(Avena Sativa) Varieties in Highlands of North Shewa, Oromia, Ethiopia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.0917/v2","date":1713928866000,"content":"The experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of seed and fertilizer rates on biomass yield and other agronomic treats of two oat varieties (Bona-bas and Bate) at the Kuyu sub-site of Fitche Agricultural Research Center in 2022. Four levels of Nitrogen fertilizer rates (0, 23, 46, and 69 kg ha-1) and three levels of seed rates (60, 80, and 100 kg ha-1) with two oat varieties (Bona-bas and Bate) were using randomized complete block design in factorial arrangement with three replications. Soil samples before and after were collected and analyzed. The analysis of soil samples before planting indicated that the soil pH was strongly acidic (5.16) and after harvest, it raised to a strongly acidic level (5.29). The interaction effect of varieties, seed rates, and fertilizer rates showed highly significant (p&lt;0.001) variation on the number of tillers per plant, leaf area per plant, leaf-to-stem ratio, fresh biomass yield, dry matter yield, days to maturity, and seed yield. The treatment combination of Bona-bas: FR46:SR100 has produced the highest dry matter yield (5.1 t/ha), followed by Bona-bas: FR46:SR60 and Bona-bas: FR69:SR80 which produced the same value of 4.9 t/ha dry matter yield. This study recommends that for the better agronomic performance of oat varieties, 46 kgha-1 N of fertilizer with 60 kgha-1 of seed rate is preferable to use by farmers in the study area and other areas having similar agroecologies and soil types. In addition, it is essential to conduct the year-over location to confirm the present findings and the result needs to be supported with animal evaluation trials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59aa03de33e654828fcb61349da4d2ef4612e36e1530b0aca8e1739849de1f25","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
