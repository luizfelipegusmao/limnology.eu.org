{"title":"Evaluating Governmental Constraints on Construction in Nigeria: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1636/v1","date":1724319974000,"content":"The construction industry is a cornerstone of Nigeria's economic growth, yet it faces significant hurdles, particularly from governmental constraints. This research aims to (1) identify the primary governmental constraints impacting the Nigerian construction sector and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of existing government interventions in addressing these challenges. Employing a comprehensive literature review, this study analyzes regulatory frameworks, bureaucratic processes, corruption, political instability, and infrastructure deficiencies. It also examines the consequences of these constraints on project costs, timelines, and quality. Key findings reveal that bureaucratic red tape and corruption are the most pervasive constraints, significantly hindering project execution. Consistent government policies and adequate infrastructure also contribute to project delays and cost escalation. To enhance the construction sector's performance, it is imperative to (1) streamline bureaucratic procedures and strengthen anti-corruption measures and (2) develop and implement consistent, long-term sector-specific policies. By addressing these recommendations, the government can create a more favorable environment for construction businesses, stimulate investment, and accelerate Nigeria's overall development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b32ffdcdd5e7486743e3cf1d7f99be5e1e52bc3cf35c6b6254c0e9c6f750508","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
