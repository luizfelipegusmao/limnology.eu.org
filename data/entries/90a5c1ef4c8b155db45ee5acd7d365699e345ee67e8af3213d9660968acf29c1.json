{"title":"Copper Supplementation in Young Wistar Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0396/v1","date":1717721486000,"content":"Supplementation with 200% of the recommended daily dietary quantity of copper modified vascular contraction and relaxation through increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and prostaglandin formation, which modified the antioxidant status of middle–aged rats. In this study, young (1 month old) male Wistar rats (n/group = 10) received a diet supplemented with 6.45 mg copper/kg (100%—Group A) for 8 weeks. The experimental group received 12.9 mg copper/kg of diet (200%—Group B). Experimental supplementation with 200% copper increased the copper concentration in the blood, liver, and kidneys; increased the ROS concentration in the aortic rings; and enhanced the sensitivity of the aortic rings to acetylcholine. We observed increased participation of nitric oxide (NO) derived from inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in vascular contraction and a decreased net effect of vasodilator prostanoids derived from cyclooxygenase–2 (COX–2) in vascular relaxation. Supplementation with 200% copper was less significant than expected after previous studies conducted with middle–aged rats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90a5c1ef4c8b155db45ee5acd7d365699e345ee67e8af3213d9660968acf29c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
