However, the impact of surrounding vegetation on cushion dynamics remains poorly understood, particularly in terms of allelopathic potentials. To investigate the allelopathic potentials of surrounding vegetation on seedling establishment of the typical cushion plant <span>Arenaria polytrichoides</span> Edgew. along an elevational gradient, we extracted potential allelopathic compounds and tested their impacts on seed germination and seedling growth of <span>A. polytrichoides</span>. In addition, exclusion experiments using activated carbon were conducted to further elucidate these effects. Our results demonstrate that surrounding vegetation exhibits certain allelopathic potentials on <span>A. polytrichoides</span> seedling establishment, with variations observed based on elevation, source and concentration of allelopathy compounds, as well as growing season. Specifically, low-elevation vegetation exerts pronounced suppression on seedling establishment. Conversely, higher-elevation vegetation generally shows no effect on seed germination but stimulates seedling growth through allelopathy mechanisms. Moreover, aboveground vegetation predominantly inhibits both seed germination and seedling growth in low-elevation communities; however, the effects of belowground vegetation depend on elevation and extract concentration levels. The identified allelopathic potentials of surrounding vegetation significantly influence the population dynamics of cushion <span>A. polytrichoides</span> by potentially accelerating population degeneration in lower-elevation communities while ensuring consistent population recruitment and expansion in higher-elevation communities.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plant Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"532f26bf1ba0f166bd6491390ce5cd237faca477af455cac49d2509f7b38d556","entryHash":"306ccb3001e45e4f433431305fda5beea32f440a68ba158de2ec0a13cb036958","category":"Environment"}
