{"title":"A Structured Light 3D Reconstruction Method Based on Neural Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1992/v1","date":1719569318000,"content":"The monocular structured light measurement system has low cost, simple algorithms, and a wide measurement range, making it widely applicable in multiple fields. However, in practical applications, the system may be affected by various factors including noise, non-linear intensity, changes in the reflectivity of the object being measured, and the calibration method and accuracy of the system, thereby reducing the measurement accuracy. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a new monocular structured light measurement method, mainly comprises the following two points: (a) A denoising algorithm for phase images based on DAE is proposed, which calculates the wrapped phase of the phase-shifted fringes after initial denoising by DAE. Then, a new phase-shifted fringe pattern is generated and input into DAE for iterative denoising, achieving high-performance image denoising and high-precision wrapped phase solution. (b) A new absolute phase height calibration algorithm is proposed, which introduces camera internal and external parameters and uses a two-layer feedforward network to directly establish the relationship between phase and the 3D coordinate system. Without the need for high-precision motion platforms, high-precision phase height calibration is attainable. In general, compared to conventional methods, the experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method for low-quality phase-shifted fringe 3D reconstruction. In addition, the measurement method described in this article also demonstrates effectiveness in high-dynamic scenes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa993da326d57e29163d25e60a7ffd8ce70461f7ed71a883abc9b23a61e60113","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
