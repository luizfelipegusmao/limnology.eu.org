{"title":"Can Tumour Antigens Provide Diagnostic Biomarkers for Early-Stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1720/v1","date":1711615250000,"content":"Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality globally. Pulmonary nodules are one of the risk factors and their discovery rate has been increasing. Based on the nodule size and growth rate, their malignancy propensity is determined; however, it is very challenging to distinguish between benign and cancerous nodules. Many tumour-associated antigens (TAA) have been studied as blood biomarkers for lung cancer, most commonly the Cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC Ag), carbohydrate antigen (CA19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Due to their low sensitivity, TAAs are not recommended as tools for the early detection of lung cancer. However, cancer testis antigens (CTAs) are highly specific for carcinomas but their expression is more commonly associated with advanced stages of cancer and poor prognosis. Despite the fact that TAAs may provide useful insights for the diagnosis and prognosis of early lung cancer, their potential to do so has yet to be demonstrated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ad64de90908c9fac04a9dfb6ee9fda467cde254753193e624af815655477156","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
