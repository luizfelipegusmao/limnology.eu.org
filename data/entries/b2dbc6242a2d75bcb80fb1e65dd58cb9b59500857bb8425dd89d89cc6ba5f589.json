{"title":"Association between CH4 uptake and N2O emission in grassland depends on nitrogen inputs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jpe/article/doi/10.1093/jpe/rtae078/7740479?rss=1","date":1724457600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Increasing nitrogen (N) input has been recognized as one of the important factors inï¬‚uencing methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) uptake and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emission in arid and semiarid grasslands. Numerous studies have examined the spatiotemporal variations of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes in various ecosystems; however, the variation of the interplay between CH<sub>4</sub> uptake and N<sub>2</sub>O emission with increasing N has not yet been well understood. This study explored the relationship between CH<sub>4</sub> uptake and N<sub>2</sub>O emission in a semiarid grassland in Inner Mongolia, northern China, under a gradient of 12-year N additions. We found a synergistic relationship at low-N levels, where CH<sub>4</sub> uptake and N<sub>2</sub>O emission are positively correlated. Conversely, an antagonistic interaction emerged with a negative correlation between CH<sub>4</sub> uptake and N<sub>2</sub>O emission observed at high-N levels, which was evidenced by a 33.62% decrease in CH<sub>4</sub> uptake and a 264.91% increase in N<sub>2</sub>O emission. Further independent analysis, covering at least five N addition levels across grassland ecosystems in China, confirmed the general pattern: three of four cases showed a synergistic relationship at low-N levels and an antagonistic relationship at high-N levels. Given the increasing N deposition in the future, the dynamics between CH<sub>4</sub> uptake and N<sub>2</sub>O emission are critical for understanding the impact of external N input on net greenhouse gas emission and consequent global climate change.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plant Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"532f26bf1ba0f166bd6491390ce5cd237faca477af455cac49d2509f7b38d556","entryHash":"b2dbc6242a2d75bcb80fb1e65dd58cb9b59500857bb8425dd89d89cc6ba5f589","category":"Environment"}
