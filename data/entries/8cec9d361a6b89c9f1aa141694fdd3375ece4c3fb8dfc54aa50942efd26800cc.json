{"title":"Low sucrose availability reduces basal spikelet fertility by inducing abscisic acid and jasmonic acid synthesis in wheat","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/7/1967/7465001?rss=1","date":1702080000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Within a spike of wheat, the central spikelets usually generate three to four fertile florets, while the basal spikelets generate zero to one fertile floret. The physiological and transcriptional mechanism behind the difference in fertility between the basal and central spikelets is unclear. This study reports a high temporal resolution investigation of transcriptomes, number and morphology of floret primordia, and physiological traits. The W6.5–W7.5 stage was regarded as the boundary to distinguish between fertile and abortive floret primordia; those floret primordia reaching the W6.5–W7.5 stage during the differentiation phase (3–9 d after terminal spikelet stage) usually developed into fertile florets in the next dimorphism phase (12–27 d after terminal spikelet stage), whereas the others aborted. The central spikelets had a greater number of fertile florets than the basal spikelets, which was associated with more floret primordia reaching the W6.5–W7.5 stage. Physiological and transcriptional results demonstrated that the central spikelets had a higher sucrose content and lower abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation than the basal spikelets due to down-regulation of genes involved in ABA and JA synthesis. Collectively, we propose a model in which ABA and JA accumulation is induced under limiting sucrose availability (basal spikelet) through the up-regulation of genes involved in ABA and JA synthesis; this leads to floret primordia in the basal spikelets failing to reach their fertile potential (W6.5–W7.5 stage) during the differentiation phase and then aborting. This fertility repression model may also regulate spikelet fertility in other cereal crops and potentially provides genetic resources to improve spikelet fertility.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"8cec9d361a6b89c9f1aa141694fdd3375ece4c3fb8dfc54aa50942efd26800cc","category":"Environment"}
