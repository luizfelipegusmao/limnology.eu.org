{"title":"Upgrading Maize Cultivation in Bosnia and Herzegovina from Rainfed to Irrigated Systems: Use of Remote Sensing Data and the Dual Crop Coefficient Approach to Estimate Evapotranspiration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0673/v1","date":1715330165000,"content":"A two-year experiment was conducted with a local maize hybrid under full irrigation (F), deficit irrigation (D) and rainfed conditions (R) to estimate maize evapotranspiration in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Three approaches (Allen &amp; Pereira (A&amp;P), SIMDualKc (SD), and Vegetation Index (VI)) were used to estimate the actual crop coefficient (Kc act), actual basal crop coefficient (Kcb act), and actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act) were applied with the dual crop coefficient method and remote sensing (RS) data. While Kcb act from all approaches matched FAO56 tabulated values, SD showed differences, in comparison to A&amp;P, of up to 0.24 in D and R conditions, especially in initial and mid-season stages. VI demonstrated very good performance in all treatments. In F, the obtained Kc act for all approaches during the initial and end stages were higher than the tabulated values, ranging from 0.71-0.87 for Kc ini act and from 0.80-1.06 for Kc end act, while the mid-season period showed very good agreement with the literature. Maize crop evapotranspiration range is 769-813 mm, 480-752 mm, and 332-618 mm for F, D and R, respectively. The results confirmed the suitability of both approaches (SD and VI) to estimate maize crop evapotranspiration under F, with the VI approach demonstrating an advantage in calculating Kcb act, Kc act, and ETc act values under water stress conditions. The 67.6% increase in grain yields with irrigation emphasizes the need to transition from rainfed to irrigation-dependent agriculture, even for drought-resistant crops like maize.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"365c3c5298e6f0433c8155d43523ac9d55415248c7ef094783dc902b626f64ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
