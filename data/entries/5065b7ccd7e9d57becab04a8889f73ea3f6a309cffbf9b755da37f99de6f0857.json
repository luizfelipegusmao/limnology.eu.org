{"title":"Assessing Passenger Risks and Impact Incidents at the Platform-Train Interface: Insights from Valpara√≠so Metro","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0932/v1","date":1726148915000,"content":"The study focused on assessing passenger risks specifically at the platform-train interface (PTI). The primary aim of this investigation is to analyze how various factors, including station design, passenger flow, and weather conditions, impact the frequency and types of incidents occurring at this critical interaction point. To achieve this, the study utilized a comprehensive data analysis approach, examining records from the Valparaiso Metro for the period of 2022-2023. During this timeframe, a total of 361 incidents were documented, providing a substantial dataset for evaluating incident patterns and their correlations with different influencing factors. The analysis revealed that incidents are notably influenced by peak hour conditions and weekdays. Specifically, the study found that crowded conditions inside the train during peak hours, which typically occur in the morning and evening rush periods, contribute significantly to the occurrence of incidents. When examining incidents occurring on the platform, the study identified that these are closely related to the type of station and the presence of stairs for station access. Conversely, stations designed with more accessible features might experience fewer such incidents. Future studies will focus on incorporating additional factors and analysing new data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of incident dynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5065b7ccd7e9d57becab04a8889f73ea3f6a309cffbf9b755da37f99de6f0857","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
