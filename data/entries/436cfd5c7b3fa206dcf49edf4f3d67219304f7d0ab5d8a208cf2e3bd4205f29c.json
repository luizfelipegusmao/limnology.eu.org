{"title":"Analysis of the Financial and Non-Financial Indicators of the Beer Sector: Italy and Spain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1886/v1","date":1714360462000,"content":"A study analyzed financial statements in the beer sectors of Italy and Spain during 2019-2021 using compositional data analysis (CoDa) to gauge pre- and post-pandemic financial health and aid sector-level decision-making. Geometric averages were employed to mitigate statistical issues, offering more accurate insights than arithmetic averages. The exploratory, quantitative methodology calculated key financial ratios and profitability metrics. Results indicated satisfactory short-term solvency. Returns and margins remained subpar despite pandemic policies. Geometric averages proved essential in portraying sector health accurately, underscoring the need for their use in classic brewing sector ratios. The study also showcased CoDa's efficacy in diagnosing sectoral financial health for informed decision-making. Furthermore, a web analysis revealed varying transparency levels in communicating non-financial indicators, with Spain excelling in waste, water, and energy disclosures, while Italy prioritized energy and waste with less transparency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"436cfd5c7b3fa206dcf49edf4f3d67219304f7d0ab5d8a208cf2e3bd4205f29c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
