However, many organelles are heterogeneous and in the process of maturation and differentiation. Because traditional methods have a limited number of parameters and spatial resolution, they struggle to capture the heterogeneous landscapes of organelles. Here, we present a method for multiparametric particle-based analysis of organelles. After disrupting cells, fluorescence microscopy images of organelle particles labeled with 6 to 8 different organelle markers were obtained, and their multidimensional data were represented in two-dimensional uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) spaces. This method enabled visualization of landscapes of 7 major organelles as well as the transitional states of endocytic organelles directed to the recycling and degradation pathways. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulumâ€“mitochondria contact sites were detected in these maps. Our proposed method successfully detects a wide array of organelles simultaneously, enabling the analysis of heterogeneous organelle landscapes.","author":"Yoshitaka Kurikawa","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"1e2a7c79eb8cf018bf52cc55ba110562744795694f79482079fe9d135d0bf8a0","category":"Environment"}
