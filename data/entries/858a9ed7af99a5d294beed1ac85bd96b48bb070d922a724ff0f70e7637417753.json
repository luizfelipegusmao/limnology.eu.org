{"title":"Analysis, Design, and Experimental Validation of a High-Isolation, LowCross-Polarization Antenna Array Demonstrator for Software-Defined-Radar Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1892/v1","date":1716908320000,"content":"In a software-defined radar (SDR) system, most of the signal processing usually implemented\n in hardware is implemented by software, thus allowing for higher flexibility and modularity compared to\n conventional radar systems. However, the majority of SDR demonstrators and proofs-of-concept reported in the open literature so far have been based on simple antenna systems. As a result, the full potentialities of an  SDR approach have not been completely exploited yet. In this work, we propose a flexilbe antenna module to be integrated into an active electronically scanning array (AESA) with controlled sidelobe level over a wide angular range, exhibiting polarization reconfigurability with low cross-polarization level and high isolation. For this purpose, analytical and numerically efficient techniques for the synthesis of the aperture distribution and the correct evaluation of the radiating features (e.g., beamwidth, pointing angle, sidelobe levels, etc.) are presented in order to grant a real-time control of the digital beamforming network. A sub-array module demonstrator is fabricated and measured to corroborate the concept.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"858a9ed7af99a5d294beed1ac85bd96b48bb070d922a724ff0f70e7637417753","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
