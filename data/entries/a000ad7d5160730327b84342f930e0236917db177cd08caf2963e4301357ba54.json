{"title":"234 Evaluation of a phytogenic blend on post-weaning growth performance, health, and sera metabolite responses during the initial 56 d feedlot receiving period in newly weaned steers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/213/7665010?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to determine if a blend of capsicum oleoresin, clove essential oil, and garlic essential oil (CCG; Fytera Advance - Selko USA, Indianapolis IN) influences measures of cattle performance during the initial 56-d feedlot receiving phase. Newly weaned Charolais × Angus steers [n = 256; initial shrunk body weight (BW) = 273 ± 26 kg) were used in 56-d receiving phase experiment. Steers were transported 513 km to the Ruminant Nutrition Center in Brookings, SD on the day of weaning. Steers were individually weighed and allotted to 1 of 32 pens (n = 8 steers; 8 pens/treatment) in a randomized complete block design and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments: control diet with no test product (CON); CCG at 125 mg/steer daily (CCG1); CCG at 250 mg/steer daily (CCG2); or CCG at 500 mg/steer daily (CCG3). Steers were fed twice daily, and bunks were managed using a slick bunk system from d 14 to 56; feed deliveries during the first 14 d were managed by feedlot personnel to adapt cattle to a targeted dry matter intake (DMI). The basal diet provided: 13.8% CP, 1.74 Mcal/kg NEm, and 1.07 Mcal/kg NEg. Monensin sodium was fed to all steers at a rate of 25 g/907 kg (DM basis). Steers were individually weighed on d -1, 1, 14, 35, and 56. Daily dry matter intake (DMI) was influenced by dietary treatment (quadratic effect; <span>P</span> = 0.01) in which steers that were fed with CON or CCG3 had greater DMI than those subjected to CCG1 and CCG2 dietary regimens. However, CCG supplementation did not result in improvements in average daily gain nor gain to feed ratio (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.15). A tendency for a treatment × day interaction was noted for sera non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA; <span>P</span> = 0.06), on d 14, steers from CCG3 had greater NEFA compared with CON and steers from CCG1 and CCG2 were intermediate (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05). Dietary treatment influenced (<span>P</span> = 0.04) circulating concentrations of ceruloplasmin (CPL), where steers from CCG2 and CCG3 resulted in decreased circulating concentrations of CPL compared with CON and CCG1, indicating less inflammation. In conclusion, steers supplemented CCG3 had greater DMI and decreased ceruloplasmin suggesting an overall improvement in health status. Steers from CCG3 had increased NEFA on d 14, which could imply a catabolic state; However, sera NEFA decreased over time compared with the other treatments. More research is necessary to determine the consistency of the performance responses and better understand the correct dosage of CCG fed to newly weaned beef calves.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"a000ad7d5160730327b84342f930e0236917db177cd08caf2963e4301357ba54","category":"Environment"}
