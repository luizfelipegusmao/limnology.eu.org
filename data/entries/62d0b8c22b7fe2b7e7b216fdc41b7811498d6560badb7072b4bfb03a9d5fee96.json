{"title":"Neuroinflammatory Approach to Surgical Trauma: Biomarkers and the Mechanisms of the Immune and Neuroendocrine Response","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1931/v1","date":1719542045000,"content":"The severity and invasiveness of clinical outcomes from organic responses to trauma are influenced by individual, surgical and anesthetic factors. A stress response elicits neuroendocrine and immune reactions that may lead to multi-organ dysfunction. The degree of neuroinflammatory reflex activation from trauma can increase pro-inflammatory cytokine production, leading to endothelial dysfunction, glycocalyx damage, neutrophil activation and multisystem tissue destruction. A shift in patient treatment towards a neuroinflammatory perspective has prompted a new evaluation protocol for surgical patients, required to understand surgical pathogenesis and its link to chosen anesthesia-surgical methods. This study aims to provide a description of the mechanisms involved in the immune and neuroendocrine response and below is a summary of the main mediators, focusing on video laparoscopic surgeries, by examining its frequency usage by researchers. We performed a narrative review of data from databases like PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, high-impact journals, and studies from the past decade that used inflammatory mediator analysis to compare anesthetic and surgical strategies. Results showed preference for certain biomarkers more sensitive to tissue trauma. These markers display distinct behaviors, temporal fluctuations and their dosages serve as a tool to measure and validate therapeutic approaches in perioperative systemic inflammation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62d0b8c22b7fe2b7e7b216fdc41b7811498d6560badb7072b4bfb03a9d5fee96","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
