{"title":"Moderate Overweight of Male Rats Chronically Fed with a Hyperlipidic Diet Developed Early Silent Ang-(3&ndash;4)-Sensitive Myocardial Molecular Lesions and Preserved Echographic Parameters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1120/v1","date":1721032415000,"content":"Overweight/obesity and cardiovascular diseases are associated with high rates of mobility and mortality. We investigated inflammatory lesions and ionic transporters in the left ventricle of male rats chronically fed a high-fat diet (HL). They developed moderate overweight with early expansion of visceral adiposity. The inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), Na+-transporting ATPases, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a), and the abundance of Angiotensin II receptors were studied together with lipid and glycemic profiles, and the left ventricle echocardiographic parameters fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF). HL rats doubled IL-6 and TNF-, which returned to normal levels when signaling coupled to Angiotensin II type 2 receptors (AT2R) was supraregulated by Ang-(3–4) administration. The decreased glucose tolerance was accompanied by significantly reduced plasma triglycerides due to intense hepatic steatosis (Crisóstomo et al. Metabolism Open. 2022, 14, 100176). AT2R (and AT1R) abundance did not change. (Na++K+)ATPase and ouabain-resistant Na+-ATPase were downregulated and upregulated, respectively, normalized with Ang-(3–4). SERCA2a lost its most critical regulatory property, inhibition by excess substrate. The ultrasound showed no changes in FS and EF. We conclude that very moderate overweight can cause silent initial molecular tissue damage in heart, which can evolve to cause systolic dysfunction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aeeaa3151d3e25d03db2a576a711c46bf1b389903f1bcd99db2daf1f30aabc67","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
