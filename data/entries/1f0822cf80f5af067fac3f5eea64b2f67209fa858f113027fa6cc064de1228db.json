{"title":"A New-Type Dynamic Vibration Fiber Sensor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0318/v1","date":1725431676000,"content":"A new-type vibration sensor based on a fiber Bragg grating combining with a special structure-packaged design is proposed for monitoring the mechanical vibration signals. Three different sensing structures including the film squeeze type, new film squeeze type and elastic tape squeeze type are proposed for measuring the vibration signals with the frequency range from tens to thousands of Hz. In the comparison of experimental results, the new film squeeze structure has a nice sensing performance in the range from 100 to 1000 Hz with the sensitivity of 35 mV/V. For the elastic tape squeeze structure, the elastic tape is designed to encapsulate the optical fiber with a good frequency response from 1100 to 3100 Hz. In addition, by using the new film squeeze structure to measure the steady-state and non-steady-state vibration signals, the spectral components of sensing signals are analyzed by using the wavelet transformation for confirming the testing signals. These vibration fiber sensors can be applied in the measurement of high-end manufacture-facility vibration or earthquake vibrations etc.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f0822cf80f5af067fac3f5eea64b2f67209fa858f113027fa6cc064de1228db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
