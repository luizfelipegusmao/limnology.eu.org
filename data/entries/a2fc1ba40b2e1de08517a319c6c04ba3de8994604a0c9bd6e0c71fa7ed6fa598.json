{"title":"The Impact of Climate Change on Regional Microclimates and Its Influence on Agricultural Productivity: A Case Study ApproachInLiterature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2222/v1","date":1727437063000,"content":"Climate change is significantly reshaping global and regional climates, with profound impacts on local microclimates and agricultural productivity. This study investigates the effects of climate change on regional microclimates and examines how these shifts influence agricultural output, focusing on case studies from vulnerable regions. Utilizing secondary climate data from international agencies, this research applies statistical techniques, including time series analysis, correlation analysis, and extreme value theory, to assess changes in temperature, precipitation, and other environmental factors. The study employs spatial analysis to explore the geographic variability in these effects, and regression models to quantify the relationship between climatic changes and crop yields. Preliminary results indicate a marked shift in microclimate patterns, with significant consequences for farming practices, particularly in regions reliant on climate-sensitive crops. The findings underscore the need for adaptive strategies in agricultural sectors to mitigate the risks posed by climate change. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers and farmers, emphasizing the importance of localized climate data in developing sustainable agricultural frameworks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a2fc1ba40b2e1de08517a319c6c04ba3de8994604a0c9bd6e0c71fa7ed6fa598","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
