{"title":"Isohydricity and hydraulic isolation explain reduced hydraulic failure risk in an experimental tree species mixture","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2668/7674200?rss=1","date":1715731200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Species mixture is promoted as a crucial management option to adapt forests to climate change. However, there is little consensus on how tree diversity affects tree water stress, and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. By using a greenhouse experiment and a soil-plant-atmosphere hydraulic model, we explored whether and why mixing the isohydric Aleppo pine (<span>Pinus halepensis</span>, drought avoidant) and the anisohydric holm oak (<span>Quercus ilex</span>, drought tolerant) affects tree water stress during extreme drought. Our experiment showed that the intimate mixture strongly alleviated <span>Q. ilex</span> water stress while it marginally impacted <span>P. halepensis</span> water stress. Three mechanistic explanations for this pattern are supported by our modeling analysis. First, the difference in stomatal regulation between species allowed <span>Q. ilex</span> trees to benefit from additional soil water in mixture, thereby maintaining higher water potentials and sustaining gas exchange. By contrast, <span>P. halepensis</span> exhibited earlier water stress and stomatal regulation. Second, <span>P. halepensis</span> trees showed stable water potential during drought, although soil water potential strongly decreased, even when grown in a mixture. Model simulations suggested that hydraulic isolation of the root from the soil associated with decreased leaf cuticular conductance was a plausible explanation for this pattern. Third, the higher predawn water potentials for a given soil water potential observed for <span>Q. ilex</span> in mixture can—according to model simulations—be explained by increased soil-to-root conductance, resulting from higher fine root length. This study brings insights into the mechanisms involved in improved drought resistance of mixed species forests.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"9f93b7717d62f41f25fd1b16afd9fd8d46f7d4ad3ab3ff61a808561612cb6732","category":"Environment"}
