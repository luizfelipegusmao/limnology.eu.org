{"title":"Bag of Feature-Based Ensemble Subspace KNN Classifier in Muscle Ultrasound Diagnosis of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0925/v1","date":1726064392000,"content":"Muscle ultrasound quantification is a valuable complementary diagnostic tool for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). DPN significantly impacts the lives of individuals with diabetes, leading to pain, lower limb amputation, and disability, affecting patient quality of life. This work develops a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system based on muscle ultrasound that integrates the bag of features (BOF) and an ensemble subspace k-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm for DPN detection. The BOF creates a histogram of visual word occurrences to represent the muscle ultrasound images and trains an ensemble classifier through cross-validation, determining optimal parameters to improve classification accuracy for the ensemble diagnosis system. The dataset includes ultrasound images of six muscles from 53 subjects, consisting of 27 control and 26 patient cases. An empirical analysis was conducted for each binary classifier based on muscle type to select the best vocabulary tree properties or K values for BOF. The result indicates that ensemble subspace KNN classification, based on the bag of features, achieved an accuracy of 97.23%. This study suggests muscle ultrasound as a promising diagnostic tool with the potential for image recognition and interpretation. CAD systems can accurately diagnose muscle pathology, helping to overcome limitations and identify issues in individuals with diabetes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"20d7a9681d722f628004988716d828dc7a0497fc98372dfc6d8a3dcd47601c9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
