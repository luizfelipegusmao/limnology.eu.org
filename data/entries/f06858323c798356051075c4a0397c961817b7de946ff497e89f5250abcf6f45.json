{"title":"Quantitative trait loci analysis for molecular markers linked to agricultural traits of <i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308832","date":1723471200000,"content":"<p>by Jae-San Ryu, Bokyung Park, Arend F. van Peer, Kyeong Sook Na, Song Hee Lee</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i> is a global mushroom crop with nutritional and medicinal benefits. However, the genetic basis of several commercial traits remains unknown. To address this, we analyzed the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for two representative cultivars, \"Heuktari\" and \"Miso,\" with apparently distinct alleles. A genetic map with 11 linkage groups was constructed, in which 27 QTLs were assigned to 14 traits. The explained phenotypic variations in QTLs ranged from 7.8% to 22.0%. Relatively high LOD values of 6.190 and 5.485 were estimated for the pinheading period and the number of valid stipes, respectively. Some QTL-derived molecular markers showed potential enhancement rates of selection precision in inbred lines, especially for cap shape (50%) and cap thickness (30%). Candidate genes were inferred from the QTL regions and validated using qRT-PCR, particularly for the cysteine and glutathione pathway, in relation to cap yellowness. The molecular markers in this study are expected to facilitate the breeding of the Heuktari and Miso lines and provide probes to identify related genes in <i>P</i>. <i>ostreatus</i>.","author":"Jae-San Ryu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f06858323c798356051075c4a0397c961817b7de946ff497e89f5250abcf6f45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
