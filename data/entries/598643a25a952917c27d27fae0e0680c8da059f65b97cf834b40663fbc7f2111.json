{"title":"How to Make Your African Ecology Paper Stand Out to a Global Audience","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aje.13338?af=R","date":1728802800000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The discovery of the South East Africa Montane Archipelago has unveiled a biologically significant ecoregion with a high level of endemism, showcasing at least 127 endemic plants and 45 endemic vertebrates, including unique genera of both plants and reptiles. This remarkable find highlights Africa's ongoing contributions to global ecological knowledge, despite often being underrepresented in the international research sphere due to biases and marginalisation. To address these issues and enhance the visibility and impact of African ecological research, this Editorial outlines several key strategies. First, it emphasises the importance of making hypothesis-driven research in ecological studies, following Popper's philosophy of science. Second, it advocates for generalising research findings to broader contexts rather than focusing narrowly on local specifics. Additionally, it underscores the need use clear, generalised terminology and producing detailed, context-rich maps, so that the authors can enhance the comprehensibility and appeal of their research. Finally, the Editorial highlights the growing influence of African ecology, as evidenced by that the difference in impact factor between AJE and major international general ecology journals has decreased greatly. The Editorial also suggests that by adopting the strategies highlighted herein, African ecologists can further elevate their global presence and contribute more substantially to the field.</p>","author":"Luca Luiselli","siteTitle":"Wiley: African Journal of Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0a8ec0da97c05188d45f40eaa6dd19ed9528e14fad92d29cce59e67ce4030364","entryHash":"598643a25a952917c27d27fae0e0680c8da059f65b97cf834b40663fbc7f2111","category":"Environment"}
