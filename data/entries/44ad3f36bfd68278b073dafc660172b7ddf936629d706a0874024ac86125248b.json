{"title":"Effect of Various Mineral Admixtures on the Mechanical and Microstructural Properties of Self-Compacting Geopolymer Concrete","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0177/v1","date":1717505068000,"content":"An innovative concrete that incorporates the advantages of self-compacting concrete with geopolymer is called self-compacting geopolymer concrete. The objective of this study was the Manufacturing of M30-grade self-compacting geopolymer concrete by adding industrial materials like fly ash (FA), ultrafine ground granulated blast furnace slag (UFGGBS), and silica fume (SF) as minerals. The disposal of these industrial wastes can be substantially overcome, as they lead to land pollution. The fixed powder content was 500 kg/m3. A mixture of sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) created an alkaline solution that activated the cementitious binders. In this study, slump flow, L-box, V Funnel, T50 V Funnel, and J ring tests were carried out to determine the fresh qualities of the concrete. These tests were conducted under the regulations for self-compacting concrete provided by EFNARC (2005). To improve the flexural strength of the SCGC, 1.5 % glass fibre was added. This study illustrates how an artificial neural network (ANN) model can determine the concrete mix proportion. The characteristics of SCGC, both fresh and hardened properties test were investigated for molarities of 8, 10, and 12. The microstructural outcomes were determined using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44ad3f36bfd68278b073dafc660172b7ddf936629d706a0874024ac86125248b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
