{"title":"Identifying the Differences of Injury Patterns in Fatal Falls from Height and Pedestrian Traffic Accidents: An Autopsy Study and Comparison with Literature for Differential Diagnosis in Ambiguous Cases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1130/v1","date":1715943310000,"content":"This study examined injury patterns in fatal falls from heights and pedestrian traffic accidents, aiming to help in differential diagnoses in uncertain and rare cases where it is unclear whether the body may have fallen from nearby buildings or was left on the street after a traffic accident. A retrospective review of autopsy reports from the Institute of Legal Medicine of the University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\" between 2012 and 2023 was conducted. The analysis encompassed 232 cases, collecting data regarding internal organ injuries, bone fractures, and external skin injuries. Differences were observed in the presence of liver and lung injuries, cranial and forearm fractures, and the total injured skin area, proposing diagnostic markers. Statistical analyses highlighted the discriminative power of the \"Total Injured Skin Area (cmÂ²)\" with a quantitative approach, potentially providing an optimal cut-off value for distinguishing between the two event types. A comparison with literature highlights the extreme heterogeneity in injuries patterns and highlighted that a spatial approach, considering whether injuries are unilateral or bilateral, may provide more accurate distinctions. The findings suggest the potential for developing a diagnostic algorithm throughout the integration of qualitative, quantitative, and spatial data to improve the objectivity required in medico-legal contexts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1355463c98066009849491de2cb878e5a84edd78dba6b56351d5b780c4bf703f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
