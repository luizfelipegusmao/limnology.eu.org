{"title":"Microbial Dynamics in Fermented Foods: Health Implications, Cheese Production, and Advances in Analytical Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1687/v1","date":1724488677000,"content":"Foods that are fermented have a crucial role in global diets, these foods benefit from the process of fermentation, which enhances nutrition, flavor, and safety through the use of probiotics, anti-aging compounds, and antibiotics. Traditional fermentation is based on the spontaneous activity of microorganisms, while modern methods utilize defined cultures for consistency. The microorganisms in cheese are important for the flavor and texture of the product. These microorganisms are either non-starter or starter bacteria, yeast, and mold. The advances in sequencing technology have facilitated an increase in our understanding of these communities and their contribution to the quality and safety of cheese. Despite the health benefits of fermented dairy products, such as yogurt, they can pose a risk of contamination with pathogens. New methods of management and sequencing are crucial to ensuring the safety and quality of fermented foods, combining traditional methods with modern advances.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a3adca9f3ad6e78bb04ac69444cacf3f09c8b2d2b981b2352d98e4a63c72b6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
