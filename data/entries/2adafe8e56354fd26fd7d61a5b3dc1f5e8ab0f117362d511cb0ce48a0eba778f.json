{"title":"Sustainable Development and Transformative Change of Tibet in China from 1951 to 2021","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1575/v1","date":1714005156000,"content":"The year 2021 marks the 70th anniversary of establishing the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) within the People’s Republic of China. As with China as a whole, Tibet has experienced a tumultuous history over these past seventy years. Especially since the 1980s, the region has witnessed significant economic development, poverty alleviation, and increased social indicators such as life expectancy and healthcare. At the same time, substantial disparity within Tibet, as well as between Tibet and the rest of China, persists. This article tracks 16 social, economic, and ecological indicators for the past several decades, as well as levels of economic assistance provided to Tibet by other Chinese provinces and the Chinese central government in an attempt to narrow the development gap between Tibet and the rest of the country. The results show that since 1951, despite progress in many aspects, there remains a substantial gap between Tibet’s indicators and the average level of China, with the biggest gap being the illiteracy rate. Uneven development between regions within Tibet, especially between urban and rural areas, also persists.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2adafe8e56354fd26fd7d61a5b3dc1f5e8ab0f117362d511cb0ce48a0eba778f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
