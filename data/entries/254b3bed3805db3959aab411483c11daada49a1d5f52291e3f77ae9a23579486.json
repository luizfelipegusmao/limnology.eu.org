{"title":"Word Decoding Ability In The World Of Language Acquisition Process: A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1208/v1","date":1721082100000,"content":"The ability to decode words accurately at an early age strongly predicts reading competence later on. Decoding-challenged children may find it difficult to understand texts, which might impede their overall academic development. Strong word decoding skills accelerate the process of learning vocabulary and grammar rules in a variety of languages. The paper aimed to collect relevant literature regarding word decoding ability in the world of the language acquisition process. Policymakers and educators will be greatly impacted by realizing how crucial word decoding is to language learning. Providing targeted interventions for struggling readers, encouraging a positive reading culture, and explicitly teaching phonological and orthographic abilities are all essential components of effective reading education. Promoting decoding proficiency also requires making sure that people have access to excellent reading materials and tools. In order to enable learners to become great readers and communicators across linguistic and cultural boundaries, educators and policymakers should prioritize phonemic awareness from an early age and use effective teaching methodologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"254b3bed3805db3959aab411483c11daada49a1d5f52291e3f77ae9a23579486","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
