{"title":"171 Examining the role of vitamin E in ruminant livestock growth and production","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/211/7757480?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Vitamin E is necessary for health, growth, and reproduction in livestock. However, vitamin E requirements and supplement strategies for optimal livestock production and performance are poorly understood, and the role that it plays in skeletal muscle growth has not been thoroughly explored. Ideal vitamin E requirements for optimal skeletal muscle growth have yet to be identified in beef cattle or sheep. Because skeletal muscle growth is important for meat production in livestock, a more thorough understanding of postnatal skeletal muscle growth and the relationship with vitamin E is necessary. The goal of this presentation is to discuss what we currently understand about vitamin E and the relationship it has with skeletal muscle growth in ruminant livestock. This presentation will discuss previous research relating to vitamin E supplementation in beef cattle and sheep, and the resulting impacts on growth and production. Additionally, emerging research using both in vivo and in vitro methods to further explore the relationship between vitamin E and skeletal muscle growth and production of beef cattle and sheep will be presented.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"da1c02357fefc5a2ee6d9120466534dff3c7c9a713f9cbbd54e003720facf17e","category":"Environment"}
