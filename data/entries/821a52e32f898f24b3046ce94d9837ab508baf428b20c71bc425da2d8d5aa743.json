The objective of this study was to pilot test a person-centered, interprofessional intervention to improve identification and management of functional impairment among older adults in Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care practices. The four-component intervention included (1) an interprofessional educational session; (2) routine, standardized functional status measurement among patients aged ≥75; (3) annual screening by nurses using a standardized instrument and follow-up assessment by primary care providers; and (4) electronic tools and templates to facilitate increased identification and improved management of functional impairment. Surveys, semi-structured interviews, and electronic health record data were used to measure implementation outcomes (appropriateness, acceptability and satisfaction, feasibility, fidelity, adoption/reach, sustainability). We analyzed qualitative interviews using rapid qualitative analysis. During the study period, all 959 eligible patients were screened (100% reach), of whom 7.3% (n = 58) reported difficulty or needing help with ≥1 ADL and 11.8% (n = 113) reported difficulty or needing help with ≥1 IADL. In a chart review among a subset of 50 patients with functional impairment, 78% percent of clinician notes for the visit when screening was completed had content related to function, and 48% of patients had referrals ordered to address impairments (e.g., physical therapy) within 1 week. Clinicians highly rated the quality of the educational session and reported increased ability to measure and communicate about function. Clinicians and patients reported that the intervention was appropriate, acceptable, and feasible to complete, even during the COVID pandemic. These findings suggest that this intervention is a promising approach to improve identification and management of functional impairment for older patients in primary care. Broader implementation and evaluation of this intervention is currently underway.","author":"Rebecca T.
