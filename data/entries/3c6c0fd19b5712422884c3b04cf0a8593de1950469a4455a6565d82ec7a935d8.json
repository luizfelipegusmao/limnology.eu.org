To protect the environment and safeguard national interests, China implemented export controls on antimony on 15 September (2). Given Chinaâ€™s dominant position in the global antimony supply chain (3) and despite potential short-term global supply shortages and price hikes, this move is expected to trigger a long-term global redistribution of the antimony supply. By balancing competition and cooperation and incorporating environmentally responsible practices, the international community can diversify and secure the global antimony supply chain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"3c6c0fd19b5712422884c3b04cf0a8593de1950469a4455a6565d82ec7a935d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
