{"title":"Funding in IoMT research: Observations Based on Synthetic Knowledge Synthesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0176/v1","date":1727870412000,"content":"The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) represents a transformative technology that connects medical devices, sensors, and healthcare systems to enable real-time monitor-ing, data sharing, and advanced decision-making in healthcare. While the technical and clinical potential of IoMT has been explored extensively, research on the funding patterns and their implications remains sparse. This paper analyzes funding in IoMT research using bibliometric methods to assess the spatial dimensions of funded and non-funded research across different countries and regions. By employing Synthetic Knowledge Synthesis (SKS), the study triangulates quantitative and qualitative ap-proaches to provide insight into research trends, thematic differences, and the rela-tionship between funding and healthcare outcomes such as the Global Health Index (GHI). The results reveal that funded research exhibits higher publication rates in high-impact journals and is more concentrated in countries with stronger healthcare systems and higher R&amp;D expenditures. However, countries with lower healthcare in-vestments are also increasingly contributing to IoMT research, likely in pursuit of im-proving healthcare outcomes. Thematic analysis shows that funded projects empha-size artificial intelligence applications in e-health and telemedicine, while non-funded research tends to focus on IoMT's role in pandemic management. These findings pro-vide insights into the global landscape of IoMT research funding and its impact on public health advancements.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d5f0ccb8ee691d9d7cd463310547f75b0f188058b38ef4906a5b7f198694c147","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
