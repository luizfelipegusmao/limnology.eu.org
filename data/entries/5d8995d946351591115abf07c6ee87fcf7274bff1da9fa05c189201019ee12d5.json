{"title":"Understanding and Assessing the Interconnectedness of Motor and Cognitive Development: A Novel View on Complexity in Dual Task Paradigms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1790/v1","date":1721735299000,"content":"Human development encompasses the integration of neuromotor, psychological, social-emotional, and cognitive processes across time. However, a better understanding of the interconnectedness of motor and cognitive development throughout the lifespan is needed. The integrative and dynamic nature of short-term motor skill acquisition and long-term developmental processes may foster executive functions. Unfortunately, assessments of motor competence have traditionally focused on skillfulness from a movement perspective, using restrictive task protocols that decontextualize performance and limit cognitive involvement. Additionally, traditional motor-cognitive dual-task assessments centered on cognitive involvement during specific movement protocols, have minimized impacts of task complexity and motor competence on cognitive performance. To gain a more ecologically valid understanding of the relation between motor and cognitive development, a novel assessment paradigm using an integrative approach to motor-cognitive dual-tasking is needed. The purpose of the present paper is to: 1) provide a conceptual bridge, based on multidisciplinary evidence, to effectively link the concurrent development of motor competence and executive functions via learning-related and exercise-related neurotrophic mechanisms, and 2) use this conceptual bridge to inform the development of novel motor-cognitive dual-task assessments that account for the role of task complexity, current levels of motor competence, and the continuous decision-making inherent in “real world” performance environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d8995d946351591115abf07c6ee87fcf7274bff1da9fa05c189201019ee12d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
