{"title":"Synthesis of Ni@SiC/CNFs Composite and Its Microwave Induced Catalytic Activity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0347/v1","date":1720045072000,"content":"In this paper, a novel microwave catalyst Ni@SiC/CNFs (NSC), C/Ni (NC), and C/SiC (SC) were successfully synthesized by electrostatic spinning method, and proved to degrade methylene blue with high efficiency under microwave irradiation. The results imply that the catalyst Ni@SiC/CNFs with double shell structure gave a 99.99 % removal rate in 90 s for the degradation of methylene blue under microwave irradiation, outperformed the C/Ni and C/SiC and most other reported catalysts in similar studies. On the one hand, the possible mechanism of the methylene blue degradation should be ascribed to that double shell structure increases the polarization source of the material, resulting in excellent microwave absorption properties; and on the other, the in-situ generation of active species OHâ€¢ and O2 - under microwave radiation and the synergistic coupling effect of metal plasma greatly improved the degradation efficiency of methylene blue. The findings of this study could provide a valuable reference for the green degradation of industrial dye wastewater and its sustainable development process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a3622daa79259ff2cf20cf989f8922661cf8a282454579354280e43d382798a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
