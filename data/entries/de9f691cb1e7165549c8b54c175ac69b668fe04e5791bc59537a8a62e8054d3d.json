{"title":"Application of Metal Halide Perovskite in Internet of Things","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1371/v1","date":1724117971000,"content":"The Internet of Things (IoT) technology connects the real world and the network world by integrating sensors and internet technology, which has greatly changed people's lifestyles, showing its broad application prospects. However, traditional materials for the sensors and power components used in IoT limit its development to high-precision detection, long-term endurance, and multi-scenario applications. Metal halide perovskite, with the unique advantages such as excellent photoelectric properties, adjustable bandgap, flexibility, and mild process, exhibiting enormous potential to meet the requirements for IoT development. This paper provides a comprehensive review of metal halide perovskites' application in sensors and energy supply modules within IoT systems. Advances on perovskite-based sensors were discussed as to gas, humidity, photoelectric, and optical sensors. The application of indoor photovoltaics based on perovskite in IoT systems were also discussed. At last, the application prospects and challenges of perovskite-based devices in IoT are summarized.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de9f691cb1e7165549c8b54c175ac69b668fe04e5791bc59537a8a62e8054d3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
