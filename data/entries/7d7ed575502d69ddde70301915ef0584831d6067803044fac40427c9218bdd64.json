{"title":"Review of Relationships Between Human Gut Microbiome, Diet and Obesity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1884/v1","date":1729757626000,"content":"Obesity is a complex disease increasing risk of other pathologies. Its prevention or long-term weight loss maintenance is problematic. Gut microbiome is considered a potential obesity modulator. The objective of the present study was to summarize recent findings regarding relationships between obesity, gut microbiota and diet, with emphasis on dietary fiber and resistant starch. Composition of the human gut microbiome and methods of its quantification are described. Products of the gut microbiome metabolism, such as short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids including their effects on the gut microbiota, intestinal barrier function and immune homeostasis are discussed in the context of obesity. Importance of dietary fiber and resistant starch is emphasized as far as effects of the host diet on the composition and function of the gut microbiome are concerned. Complex relationships between human gut microbiome and obesity are finally summarized.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d7ed575502d69ddde70301915ef0584831d6067803044fac40427c9218bdd64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
