{"title":"Comparison of Adaptive Simulation Observation Experiments of the Heavy Rainfall in South China and Sichuan Basin","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00376-024-3114-1","date":1730419200000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>This study examines the effectiveness of adaptive observation experiments using the ensemble transformation sensitivity (ETS) method to improve precipitation forecasts during heavy rainfall events in South China and the Sichuan Basin. High-resolution numerical models are employed to simulate adaptive observations. By identifying the sensitive areas of key weather system positions 42 hours before heavy rainfall events, the adaptive observations improve the prediction of jet streams, strong winds, and shear lines, which are essential for accurate heavy rainfall forecasting. This improvement is reflected in both the precipitation structure and location accuracy within the verification region. In South China, targeted observations enhance rainfall predictions by improving water vapor transport. In the Sichuan Basin, adaptive observations refine water vapor transport and adjust vortex dynamics. This research highlights the importance of accurately predicting shear lines and jet streams for forecasting heavy rainfall in these areas. Overall, this study found that adaptive observation enhances the precipitation forecast skills of the structure and location for heavy rainfall in South China and the Sichuan Basin, emphasizing their potential utility in operational numerical weather prediction.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"1d8f34ce94b600c5d122236942660a13db8ab2059d16d91bcc5464bb634fee65","category":"Environment"}
