{"title":"Endemic and cryptic: different biogeographic histories of three Italian blister beetles of the genus Meloe (Coleoptera: Meloidae: Meloinae: Meloini)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/isd/article/doi/10.1093/isd/ixae003/7624035?rss=1","date":1709856000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Italian geographic region is characterized by complex and diversified biogeographic patterns and is represented by a high number of endemic species. Endemic species characterized by a limited distribution range should be a primary concern in conservation. This article aimed to investigate the phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships of 2 Italian endemic species of the wingless blister beetle genus <span>Meloe</span> Linnaeus, 1758: <span>Meloe</span> (<span>Eurymeloe</span>) <span>apenninicus</span> and <span>Meloe</span> (<span>E.</span>) <span>baudii</span>. Our inferences, based on morphological characters, 2 mitochondrial (16S and COI) and 2 nuclear (CAD and 28S) markers and the use of 3 species delimitation analyses approaches, pointed out the presence of a new Italian endemic species (<span>M.</span> (<span>E.</span>) <span>digiuliorum</span><strong>sp. n.</strong>), here described, and 3 different patterns of phylogenetic and biogeographic affinities. <span>M. digiuliorum</span> is close to the Spanish endemic <span>M. orobates</span><strong>comb. n.</strong>, revealing a possible fragmentation of the ancestor range in the Pleistocene (ca. 0.84 Mya) followed by isolation in Italy and Spain. <span>M. apenninicus</span> is the sister species of the European-Anatolian <span>M. rugous</span> and <span>M.</span> cfr<span>. rugosus</span>, and this pattern originated around the Plio-Pleistocene boundary (ca. 2.83 Mya) likely influenced by the climatic fluctuations and the presence of the Alpine barrier. Finally, 2 subspecies were referred to <span>M. baudii</span>: the nominal one, endemic to Italy, and the Turanian-E European <span>M. b. glazunovi</span><strong>stat. n.</strong>, disclosing a third more recent (ca. 0.64 Mya) pattern of biogeographic disjunction.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Insect Systematics and Diversity Current Issue","siteHash":"d4d59e2090793e303021830a9c164d689828dc5448b6052be7ec32e87f45cab0","entryHash":"a032b93a0fd2e2b0ebf0472978f812013eba90403108a5789799d31dc9af1e38","category":"Environment"}
