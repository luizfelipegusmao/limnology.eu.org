{"title":"Chaplain development in Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) in healthcare settings in England: A mixed methods study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310085","date":1726063200000,"content":"<p>by Csaba Szilagyi, Mark Newitt, Daniel Nuzum</p>\r\nBackground <p>Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) is the predominant specialised training for healthcare chaplains in several national contexts. CPE is spiritual care education that uses experiential and action-reflection learning methods to train diverse participants. However, CPE is not established for chaplaincy training in England. Currently, chaplaincy education in England lacks standardisation, leading to inequalities in entry into the profession and inconsistent training and career pathways. CPE has the potential to address these issues. We examined changes associated with participating in CPE and participantsâ€™ perceptions about their learning experience. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of CPE as a viable chaplaincy education model in healthcare settings in England.</p> Methods <p>Convergent mixed methods involved pre-post surveys and focus group sessions to examine the experiences and development of seven chaplains, with diverse experience levels and backgrounds, who participated in the pilot CPE unit in NHS England. We integrated thematic analysis and survey results.</p> Results <p>We identified four overarching themes: Development pathways, Catalysts for development, Advantages of CPE for chaplaincy education, and Experiences with CPE course structure. Participants developed along various pathways: confidence, reflective practice, emotional intelligence, listening and attending skills, diversity in chaplaincy care, and spiritual assessment. Survey results confirmed several themes, indicating gains in chaplaincy capabilities, emotional intelligence, and counselling self-efficacy. Participants emphasised the advantages and effectiveness of the CPE model.</p> Conclusions <p>Quantitative and qualitative findings converged to provide rich evidence that CPE generated personal and professional development, improving chaplaincy practice. General learning pathways moved from personal development, through the interpersonal learning context, and translated into chaplain competency. Participants endorsed CPE, as a robust and effective training model for chaplaincy in the English context, for those entering the profession and experienced chaplains alike. We conceptualised preliminary models for chaplain development and learning pathways in CPE that need validation and refinement by future research.</p>","author":"Csaba Szilagyi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c9fadfc754cd20ae95b145a76f053bf979b81038eb2f6ceec5dc7d015de6b18c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
