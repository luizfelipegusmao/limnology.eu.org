Understanding the microstructure and its influence on material properties is crucial for designing and optimizing these materials. Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) have gained prominence in materials science and engineering due to their exceptional properties and diverse applications. Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) represent a class of materials with remarkable mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. These composites consist of a metallic matrix reinforced with ceramic or other non-metallic phases. In this study, we delve into the comprehensive characterization of Ni-Ti-C-based MMCs fabricated using the laser engineered net shaping (LENS) process using X-ray microscopy. The LENS process involves the deposition of metal powder layers using a laser beam, allowing precise control over the composition and microstructure. In our study, we synthesized Ni-Ti-C-based composites by selectively melting nickel and titanium carbide powders layer by layer. These composites exhibit intriguing hierarchical microstructures, characterized by an in-situ-formed and uniformly distributed titanium carbide (TiC) phase reinforcing the nickel matrix [<a href=\"#ozae044.109-B1\">1</a>]. Additionally, by tailoring the Ti/C ratio, an additional graphitic phase can be engineered into the microstructure. The resulting three-phase Ni-TiC-C composites demonstrate outstanding tribological properties, including an exceptionally low coefficient of friction while maintaining relatively high hardness. Among various MMCs, Ni-Ti-C-based composites have garnered significant attention due to their unique microstructural features and exceptional performance. The resulting microstructures were characterized using X-ray Microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a86d97e7dc6dc8fd8bc46b65db7ecef07f95cd826474fa0f859dabb1fb38d59d","category":"Environment"}
