{"title":"Does Genetic Background of Rainbow Trout Impact Growth and Feed Utilisation following Fishmeal Substitution by Partly Defatted Insect Meal (Hermetia illucens) or Microalgae Powder (Arthrospira platensis)?","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/4774048?af=R","date":1683702000000,"content":"<p>A growth trial was carried out to evaluate differences in feed utilisation and growth performance in response to substitution of fishmeal (FM) by either partly defatted insect meal or microalgae powder in different strains of rainbow trout. Three iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic diets were fed to 495 juvenile rainbow trout with initial weight of 150 ± 37 g. Whereas, the control diet included 20% FM, the two experimental diets were free of FM. Instead of that, an equal amount of spray-dried Spirulina powder (SP) or partly defatted <i>Hermetia</i> meal (HM) was applied as alternative protein source. Feed utilisation and growth response were investigated in a commercial breed (TL) and three local strains (HK3, HK7, and HK8) over a period of 56 days using three replicates per diet. Diets were fed relative to fish body weight throughout at a constant rate of 1.0%. Although growth was comparable among diets, growth and feed utilisation differed between breeds. The strain TL tended to express the highest specific growth rate, however, associated with lower feed conversion. Protein utilisation was superior in local strains irrespective of diet, most pronounced between strains HK7 and TL. Due to large differences in initial body weights, compensatory growth might have affected the study’s outcome. Both alternative protein sources showed to be adequate to fully replace FM in diets for rainbow trout. Improved adaption to diets including high levels of HM or SP might be achieved by selective breeding.</p>","author":"Carsten Dietz, \nStephan Wessels, \nAngela Sünder, \nReza Sharifi, \nJakob Gährken, \nFrank Liebert, \nCarlos Rosas Vázquez","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"fbe33cfb0b65ff3533775f41db95476e82f208bba99d81a2623b90da1a34ecaf","category":"Environment"}
