{"title":"Cerebral Amyloid-β Deposition, Axial Features and Cognitive Alterations in Parkinson’s Disease Patients Treated with Bilateral STN-DBS: A Long-term Cohort Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1353/v1","date":1729152710000,"content":"Objectives: To evaluate the possible long-term cerebral deposition of amyloid-β in PD patients treated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and its possible influence on axial and cognitive variables. Methods: Consecutive PD patients treated with bilateral STN-DBS with a long-term follow-up were included. Amyloid-β deposition was evaluated postoperatively through a 18F-flutemetamol positron emission tomography (PET) study. Axial symptoms have been assessed using a standardized clinical-instrumental approach. Speech was assessed by perceptual and acoustic analysis while gait by means of the instrumented timed up and go test (iTUG). Motor severity was evaluated applying the UPDRS part III score and subscores while cognitive functions through a complete neuropsychological assessment. Different stimulation and drug conditions were assessed: on-stimulation/off-medication, off-stimulation/off-medication, on-stimulation/on-medication conditions (single and dual task). Results: 19 PD patients (male: 11; age: 63.52 years; on-stimulation/on-medication UPDRS-III: 17.05) with a five-year postoperative follow-up were included. Amyloid-β deposition was found in 21% of patients (4/19) with a prevalent involvement of prefrontal, limbic and parietal areas. Compared with patients without amyloid-β deposition, PD patients with positive 18F-flutemetamol PET study showed higher preoperative UPDRS-I (p=.037) score and lower postoperative Raven's matrices scores (p=.05). Conclusions: Our results suggest that in the long-term after STN-DBS a significant percentage of PD patients may present brain amyloid-β deposition. However, larger samples are needed to evaluate the possible role of amyloid-β deposition in the development of axial and cognitive alterations after surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f4ee7fa9ee5560d50d40b8ad0fe358e494cbd4d2bc5ba430eb46ab8107593b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
