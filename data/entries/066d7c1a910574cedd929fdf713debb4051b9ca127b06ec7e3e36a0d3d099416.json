It is wasteful, slow and difficult to master and extended exposure of the sample to interfaces leads to artifacts that limit its applicability. Commercially available equipment aimed to simplify and standardize plunging is expensive and still requires dexterity. All this reduces reproducibility, requiring hours of microscope time for screening. New approaches are appearing in the market, but they are even more expensive and restrictive from an experimental point of view.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"066d7c1a910574cedd929fdf713debb4051b9ca127b06ec7e3e36a0d3d099416","category":"Environment"}
