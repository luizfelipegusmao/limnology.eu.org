{"title":"Yellow mustard gum: pilot‐scale production and characterization","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13374?af=R","date":1707489205000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Yellow mustard gum (YMG), which is extracted from the mucilaginous part of yellow mustard bran, has been considered an emerging natural hydrocolloid gum but lacks commercial development and production. To promote commercial utilization of YMG, this study developed a pilot-scale YMG production protocol in an economic and environmentally-friendly way to produce a clean-label YMG product. This pilot-scale produced YMG (YMW) was characterized in terms of chemical composition, rheological properties, and interaction with a commercial gum, κ-carrageenan and was compared with purified YMG through EtOH precipitation (YME).</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The protocol processed up to 100 L of raw material with zero solvent and minimal steps and showed great quasi-industrial potential. YMW showed a similar chemical composition as YME. However, YMW contained a slightly lower content of carbohydrates and a much larger amount of ash and potassium than YME. The rheological results concluded both YMW and YME solutions exhibited a shear-thinning flow behavior and a weak gel with YME showing higher viscosity and stronger gel structure. Most interestingly, YMW could form unpourable gels when blended with native κ-carrageenan while YME barely achieved this despite the equivalent total gum concentration.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This study demonstrated the feasibility of YMG production at a large scale with economic and green procedures and discovered its new functionality for commercial utilization. The gelling ability could provide YMG with wider applications as a result of a new potential synergistic combination. All this information should accelerate the process of full commercialization of YMG as a clean-label functional ingredient.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
