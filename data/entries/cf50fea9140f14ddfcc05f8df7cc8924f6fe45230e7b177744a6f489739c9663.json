Here, we elaborated in situ experiments on coastal sea bottom covered with cohesive sediments, to obtain intermittency parameters. The variable “waiting time” between turbulence bursts was utilized to capture the occurrence of sediment initiation events in natural waters. A relationship between waiting time and shear stress reveals the different intermittency features of sediment flux time series before and after reaching the threshold, which can be used to determine the initiation threshold of sediment motion. Multi-site results demonstrate the limitations of traditional empirical formulae for fine-grained sediments, where cohesiveness becomes more pronounced as grain size decreases and the deviation can reach 600%. The empirical formula was modified using grain size, and the modified calculations were in good agreement with observed values, which will greatly assist in sediment transport and geomorphology model predictions.</p>","author":"Renzhi Li, \nYa Ping Wang, \nShu Gao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"cf50fea9140f14ddfcc05f8df7cc8924f6fe45230e7b177744a6f489739c9663","category":"Environment"}
