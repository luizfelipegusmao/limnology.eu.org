{"title":"Important Repercussions of the COVID-19 Pandemic Lifestyle Avoided by Researchers? Face Masks and Temporomandibular Disorders: A Systematic Search and Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1212/v1","date":1716201443000,"content":"Since December 2019, the COVID-19 virus has rapidly spread worldwide, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a pandemic and advocate for the widespread use of face masks to mitigate transmission. In this review, we delve into the potential impact of prolonged face mask use on temporomandibular joint (TMJ) health, an area that has garnered limited attention amidst COVID-19 research. Research has revealed that improper mask fit, and constant readjustment can lead to TMJ abnormalities. Similarly, there is a demonstrated correlation between continuous mask usage and increased incidence of headaches, temporomandibular pain, and diminished quality of life. Many studies have highlighted discomfort in the preauricular area, headaches, TMJ noises, headache, jaw pain, and muscle fatigue, as well as dermatological disorders that have been attributed to prolonged mask wear and its impact on TMJ. Our study catalyzes future research endeavors, urging a deeper exploration of the implications of long-term mask wear, not only in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic but also among occupational groups regularly exposed to extended mask use. By unraveling the complexities of TMJ health in the face of evolving preventive measures, we aim to enhance our understanding and safeguard the well-being of mask-wearers worldwide.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2df33d418339f70fa34baba699b69ccd330e1f616ee9da03cd67ab60dc69dfed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
