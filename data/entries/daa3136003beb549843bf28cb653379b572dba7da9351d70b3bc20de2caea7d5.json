{"title":"Vector competence of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> field populations from Reunion Island exposed to local epidemic dengue viruses","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310635","date":1726754400000,"content":"<p>by Sarah Hafsia, Tatiana Barbar, Haoues Alout, Fiona Baudino, Cyrille Lebon, Yann Gomard, David A. Wilkinson, Toscane Fourié, Patrick Mavingui, Célestine Atyame</p>\r\n\r\nDengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne <i>Flavivirus</i> that affects humans worldwide. <i>Aedes albopictus</i>, which is naturally infected with the bacteria <i>Wolbachia</i>, is considered to be a secondary vector of DENV. However, it was responsible for a recent DENV outbreak of unprecedented magnitude in Reunion Island, a French island in the South West Indian Ocean. Moreover, the distribution of the cases during this epidemic showed a spatially heterogeneous pattern across the island, leading to questions about the differential vector competence of mosquito populations from different geographic areas. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the vector competence of the <i>Ae</i>. <i>albopictus</i> populations from Reunion Island for local DENV epidemic strains, while considering their infection by <i>Wolbachia</i>. Experimental infections were conducted using ten populations of <i>Ae</i>. <i>albopictus</i> sampled across Reunion Island and exposed to three DENV strains: one strain of DENV serotype 1 (DENV-1) and two strains of DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2). We analyzed three vector competence parameters including infection rate, dissemination efficiency and transmission efficiency, at different days post-exposition (dpe). We also assessed whether there was a correlation between the density of <i>Wolbachia</i> and viral load/vector competence parameters. Our results show that the <i>Ae</i>. <i>albopictus</i> populations tested were not able to transmit the two DENV-2 strains, while transmission efficiencies up to 40.79% were observed for the DENV-1 strain, probably due to difference in viral titres. Statistical analyses showed that the parameters mosquito population, generation, dpe and area of sampling significantly affect the transmission efficiencies of DENV-1. Although the density of <i>Wolbachia</i> varied according to mosquito population, no significant correlation was found between <i>Wolbachia</i> density and either viral load or vector competence parameters for DENV-1. Our results highlight the importance of using natural mosquito populations for a better understanding of transmission patterns of dengue.","author":"Sarah Hafsia","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"daa3136003beb549843bf28cb653379b572dba7da9351d70b3bc20de2caea7d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
