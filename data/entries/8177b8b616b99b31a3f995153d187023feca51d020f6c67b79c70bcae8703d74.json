{"title":"Federated Learning in Dynamic and Heterogeneous Environments: Advantages, Performances, and Privacy Problems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2125/v1","date":1724915928000,"content":"Federated Learning (FL) represents a promising distributed learning methodology, particularly suitable for dynamic and heterogeneous environments characterized by the presence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Edge Computing infrastructures. In this context, FL allows you to train machine learning models directly on edge devices, mitigating data privacy concerns and reducing latency due to transmitting data to central servers. However, the heterogeneity of computational resources, the variability of network connections, and the mobility of IoT devices pose significant challenges to the efficient implementation of FL. This work explores advanced techniques for dynamic model adaptation and heterogeneous data management in edge computing scenarios, proposing innovative solutions to improve the robustness and efficiency of federated learning. We present an innovative solution based on Kubernetes which enables the fast application of FL models to Heterogeneous Architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposals can improve the performance of FL in IoT and edge environments, offering new perspectives for the practical implementation of decentralized intelligent systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8177b8b616b99b31a3f995153d187023feca51d020f6c67b79c70bcae8703d74","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
