{"title":"Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry profile and antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiproliferative, and enzyme activities of Thymus pectinatus and Thymus convolutus: in vitro and in silico approach","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13286?af=R","date":1712768606000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The objective of this study is to investigate the antiproliferative, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and enzyme activity capacities and phytochemical compositions of <i>Thymus pectinatus</i> (TP), <i>Thymus convolutus</i> (TC), which are endemic to Türkiye. Quantitative analysis of phenolic compounds in the extracts was conducted using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, targeting 53 phenolic compounds.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Rosmarinic acid, quinic acid, and cynaroside were identified as the major compounds, exhibiting quantitative variation in both extracts. The extracts had a high total phenolic content, with 113.57 ± 0.58 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g extract for TP and 130.52 ± 1.05 mg GAE/g extract for TC. Furthermore, although both extracts exhibited high total flavonoid content; the TP extract (75.12 ± 1.65 mg quercitin equivalents (QE)/g extract) displayed a higher flavonoid content than the TC extract (30.24 ± 0.74 mg QE/g extract) did. The extracts had a promising antiproliferative effect on C6, HeLa, and HT29 cancer cell lines with a less cytotoxic effect (10.5–14.2%) against normal cells. Both extracts exhibited very potent inhibitory activity against the xanthine oxidase enzyme, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of respectively 2.07 ± 0.03 μg mL<sup>−1</sup> and 2.76 ± 0.06 μg mL<sup>−1</sup> and moderate activity against tyrosinase and <i>α</i>-glucosidase. Docking simulations proved that rosmarinic acid and cynaroside, the major components of the extracts, were the most potent inhibitors of xanthine oxidase. According to antimicrobial activity results, the TC extract exhibited moderate activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and the TP extract had strong activity against both <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> and <i>S. aureus</i>.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These findings emphasize the beneficial effects of the two endemic <i>Thymus</i> species on human health and suggest their potential use as plant-derived bioactive agents. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Tuğrul Çağrı Akman, \nSamed Şimşek, \nZeynep Akşit, \nHüseyin Akşit, \nAli Aydin, \nAli Riza Tüfekçi, \nSevki Adem, \nMustafa Abdullah Yilmaz","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"44426091f1cf37f8c3b4c61c52755f3e5df08f56e25c56990603cf1d9d5d74a3","category":"Environment"}
