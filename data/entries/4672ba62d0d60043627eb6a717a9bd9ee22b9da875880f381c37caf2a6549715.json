{"title":"A Four-Wave Cross-Lagged Study of Exposure to Violent Contexts, Cognitive Distortions, and School Bullying during Adolescence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1989/v1","date":1717063431000,"content":"School bullying represents a widespread expression of violence in the peer context. Guided by the social-ecological model, this study investigated the longitudinal and transactional pathways linking domestic and neighborhood/community violence exposure (through direct victimization and witnessing), self-serving cognitive distortions (CDS), and school bullying perpetration. Furthermore, the cognitive desensitization hypothesis that the literature has supposed to develop in response to chronically violent contexts was examined. Two four‐wave cross-lagged panel mediation models were tested in a sample of 778 high school students (28.1% males; Mage [Time 1; T1] = 14.20, SD = 0.58). The results showed that both domestic and neighborhood/community violence exposure, as a victim and as a witness, respectively, were associated to self-serving CDs and bullying perpetration over time. Moreover, significant associations between CDs and bullying perpetration over time were found, with bidirectional effects for each of these longitudinal patterns. Finally, self-serving CDs were found to significantly mediate the relationships between both domestic violence victimization and community violence witnessing and school bullying perpetration. These findings highlight the need to consider school bullying as a social phenomenon stemming from a complex and bidirectional interplay between the individuals and the environments they inhabit confirming a basic postulate that “violence breeds violence”.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4672ba62d0d60043627eb6a717a9bd9ee22b9da875880f381c37caf2a6549715","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
