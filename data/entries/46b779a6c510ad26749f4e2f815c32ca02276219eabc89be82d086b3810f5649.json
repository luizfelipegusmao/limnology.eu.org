{"title":"A new chromosome-scale genome of wild Brassica oleracea provides insights into the domestication of Brassica crops","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/2882/7616234?rss=1","date":1709164800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The cultivated diploid <span>Brassica oleracea</span> is an important vegetable crop, but the genetic basis of its domestication remains largely unclear in the absence of high-quality reference genomes of wild <span>B. oleracea</span>. Here, we report the first chromosome-level assembly of the wild <span>Brassica oleracea</span> L. W03 genome (total genome size, 630.7 Mb; scaffold N50, 64.6 Mb). Using the newly assembled W03 genome, we constructed a gene-based <span>B. oleracea</span> pangenome and identified 29 744 core genes, 23 306 dispensable genes, and 1896 private genes. We re-sequenced 53 accessions, representing six potential wild <span>B. oleracea</span> progenitor species. The results of the population genomic analysis showed that the wild <span>B. oleracea</span> populations had the highest level of diversity and represents the most closely related population to modern-day horticultural <span>B. oleracea</span>. In addition, the <span>WUSCHEL</span> gene was found to play a decisive role in domestication and to be involved in cauliflower and broccoli curd formation. We also illustrate the loss of disease-resistance genes during selection for domestication. Our results provide new insights into the domestication of <span>B. oleracea</span> and will facilitate the future genetic improvement of <span>Brassica</span> crops.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"46b779a6c510ad26749f4e2f815c32ca02276219eabc89be82d086b3810f5649","category":"Environment"}
