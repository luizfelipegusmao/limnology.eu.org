{"title":"Cadmium Exposure in Male Rats Results in Ovarian Granulosa Cell Apoptosis in Female Offspring and Paternal Genetic Effects","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24375?af=R","date":1729043194000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether the damage to male offspring induced by cadmium (Cd) exposure during embryonic period leads to the apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells (OGCs) in the next generation of female offspring, and whether this apoptosis in the offspring was due to paternal genetic effects. Pregnant Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to CdCl<sub>2</sub> (0, 0.5, 2.0, or 8.0 mg/kg) by gavage daily for 20 days to produce the filial 1 (F1) generation. F1 males were mated with newly purchased females to produce the F2 generation, and the F3 generation was generated in the same way. No apoptotic bodies were observed in the OGCs of either the F2 or F3 generation as shown by electron microscopy, and a reduced OGC apoptosis rate (detected by flow cytometry) was observed in F2 OGCs from the Cd-exposed group. Moreover, the mRNA (qRT-PCR) levels of Bax and Bcl-2 and the protein (western blotting) level of pro-caspase-8 increased in the F2 generation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The expression of apoptosis-related miRNAs (qRT-PCR) and methylation of apoptosis-related genes (determined via bisulfite-sequencing PCR) in OGCs were further determined. Compared with those of the controls, the expression patterns of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the F2 offspring were different in the Cd-exposed group. The miR-92a-2-5p expression levels were decreased in both the F2 and F3 generations (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), while the average methylation level of apoptosis-related genes did not change significantly (except for individual loci). In summary, this study showed that the paternal genetic intergenerational effect of male Cd exposure during embryonic period induced apoptosis of OGCs in the offspring was weakened, and the transgenerational effect disappeared; nevertheless, intergenerational and transgenerational changes in apoptosis-related genes, epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation, and miRNAs were observed, and may be important for understanding the homeostatic mechanisms of the body to alleviate the intergenerational transmission of Cd-induced damage.</p>","author":"Qingyu Li, \nYuchen Li, \nJianlin Zhu, \nZhangpin Liu, \nYi Sun, \nYake Lv, \nJingwen Li, \nLingfeng Luo, \nChenyun Zhang, \nWenchang Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"0fdfc085ed139a030276590dc5339bf50b17c3296e6176dd6ff4be9f9e38f4a4","category":"Environment"}
