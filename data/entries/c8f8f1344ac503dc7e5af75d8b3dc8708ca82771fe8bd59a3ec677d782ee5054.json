{"title":"Historical and Contemporary Debates in Canal Opening Surgeries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2369/v1","date":1722317204000,"content":"Glaucoma is one of the primary causes of blindness worldwide. Canal opening surgery, a type of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) applied in cases of mild to moderate glaucoma, has gained increasing popularity in recent years due to its efficacy in reducing intraocular pressure, its safety profile, the simplicity of its technique, and the reduced likelihood of compromised vision. Nevertheless, the existing body of histopathological studies remains insufficient for a comprehensive understanding of post-surgical wound healing. Consequently, debates persist among researchers regarding the mechanism through which Schlemm’s canal opening surgery reduces intraocular pressure, as well as the surgical techniques that may impact the outcomes and the factors influencing surgical success. \nAs the history of MIGS is relatively short and lacks sufficient systemic reviews or meta-analysis evaluating the influence of individual factors, this review was conducted to illuminate disparities in the researchers’ opinions at the current stage of research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c8f8f1344ac503dc7e5af75d8b3dc8708ca82771fe8bd59a3ec677d782ee5054","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
