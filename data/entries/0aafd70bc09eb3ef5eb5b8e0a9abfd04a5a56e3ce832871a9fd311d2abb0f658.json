(2024), we contrasted the effects of climate and habitat alteration on white-tailed deer density, recognizing the role of both these factors. Barnas et al.'s (2024) critique raised concerns about data transformations, model overfitting, and inference methods, but our analysis demonstrates that these criticisms are either unfounded or align with our original conclusions. We reaffirm that while both climate and habitat alteration contribute to deer densities, management decisions cannot ignore the strong role of climate, which is only predicted to increase in coming decades.</p>\n<br />","author":"Melanie Dickie, \nRobert Serrouya, \nMarcus Becker, \nCraig DeMars, \nMichael J.
