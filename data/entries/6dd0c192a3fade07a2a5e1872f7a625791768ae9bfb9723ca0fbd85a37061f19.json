{"title":"Optimization of Acid-Producing Culture Medium for Collaborative Fermentation of Three Pit Mud Anaerobic Functional Bacteria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0012/v1","date":1725276679000,"content":"Acid-producing bacteria in pit mud play a crucial role in the fermentation of Chinese liquor, significantly influencing its flavor, taste, and overall quality. This study investigates three strains of anaerobic acid-producing bacteria from pit mud to optimize both single and combined bacterial fermentations for enhanced acid production. Acid production levels were quantitatively measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The Design Expert software was employed to identify significant nutritional factors affecting the production of hexanoic and butyric acids. These factors were optimized through climbing tests and response surface analysis. The Box-Behnken Design (BBD) experimental design and variance analysis were used to determine the optimal levels of each significant factor. The SJ-1/SJ-3/SJ-8/enriched solution exhibited the highest acid production, with a total acid production of 2216.07±0.10 mg/100 ml. The yields of caproic acid and butyric acid were 801.94±0.11 mg/100 ml and 1167.33±0.14 mg/100 ml, respectively. The optimized fermentation medium for caproic and butyric acid production consisted of 5.1 g/L peptone, 5.04 g/L sodium acetate, and 4.45 g/L sodium butyrate, with a pH of 6.4. Under these conditions, the production of caproic acid and butyric acid reached 1172.73 mg/100 ml and 2382.45 mg/100 ml, respectively. These values represent significant increases (P&lt;0.05) of approximately 46.24% for caproic acid and 104.09% for butyric acid compared to initial levels. The model predicts caproic and butyric acid production to be 1184.21 mg/100 ml and 2387.84 mg/100 ml, respectively, which closely aligns with experimental results. This indicates the model’s effectiveness and provides valuable insights for enhancing acidity in liquor production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6dd0c192a3fade07a2a5e1872f7a625791768ae9bfb9723ca0fbd85a37061f19","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
