{"title":"Eco-Efficient Concrete for Sustainable Construction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0957/v1","date":1713181970000,"content":"Cement production contributes to about 7% of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Despite our best efforts, we cannot find a competitive substitute that is both reliable and environmentally friendly. The simplest way to solve the problem is to rationalize the resources and try to minimize its use by substitute them with other materials. A concrete that contains a substantial amount of fly ash is already available, but its use is limited by the current shortage in the market and reduced initial resistance. In this context, ternary mixtures have been used to conduct an experiment. A significant volume of cement has been replaced with fly ash and metakaolin, which serves as a correction factor for the performance. In this work the main advantages and disadvantages of the simultaneous use of these two additions, which may reveal to be very interesting with high volumes of substitution will be presented. The performance of this ternary mixture is very promising. Provide a wide range of possibilities for replacing cement, maintaining or even improving its mechanical and durability properties. A solution for an ecological concrete with enhanced performance for general use in construction as an alternative to conventional concrete.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0e4ba7bae38e6ab16877485138af3a83eaa6c4332f5acac57031ddd5a96d1a20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
