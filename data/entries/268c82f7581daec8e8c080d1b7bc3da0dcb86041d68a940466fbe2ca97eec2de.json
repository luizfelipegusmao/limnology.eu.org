{"title":"Focus Group Discussion Method as a Tool for Eliciting Local Community Views for Decision Making; a Case of the Save Valley Conservancy in the Southeast Lowveld of Zimbabwe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0870/v1","date":1723531743000,"content":"Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) are widely employed in qualitative research to delve into complex social issues, yet their application in conservation studies lacks standardised guidelines and thorough evaluation. This review assesses the utilisation of FGDs in biodiversity and conservation research from 2000 to April 2022, identifying 170 pertinent articles, primarily published between 2015 and 2022. FGDs, often integrated with other methodologies, predominantly sought to understand community perspectives, evaluate conservation practices, explore challenges, and document indigenous knowledge. Despite their extensive use, methodological intricacies were frequently underreported. This paper underscores the necessity for enhanced reporting standards and comprehensive guidelines to optimise the effectiveness and reliability of FGDs in conservation research.  By means of critically investigating existing literature, this study contributes critical important insights into the strengths and limitations of FGDs, ultimately advocating for greater methodological rigour and transparency in their application within the realm of conservation science.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"268c82f7581daec8e8c080d1b7bc3da0dcb86041d68a940466fbe2ca97eec2de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
