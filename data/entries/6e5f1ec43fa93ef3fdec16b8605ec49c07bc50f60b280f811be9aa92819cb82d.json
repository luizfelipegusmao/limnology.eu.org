{"title":"Sensor-Acquired Reachable Workspace (RWS) Correlates with Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Function in Stroke Patients as Measured by Functional Independence Measure (FIM) Self-Care Score","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1794/v1","date":1727139657000,"content":"Optimal upper extremity motor control and range of motion are necessary to achieve even the basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL) function. Stroke, with resulting hemiparesis, can significantly and negatively impact an individual’s ADL function. Functional Independence Measure (FIM) self-care score can provide assessment of what aspects and to what degree ADL functions are impaired. FIM self-care assessment can also track changes in ADL function during stroke recovery and rehabilitation. Recently, sensor-acquired 3D motion analysis of stroke patients’ upper extremity has shown promise as a potential alternative to assess ADL function. This observational study evaluates whether the sensor-acquired upper extremity reachable workspace (RWS) measure correlates with clinician-evaluated FIM self-care score in stroke patients. Seventeen patients with stroke were enrolled in the study. FIM self-care, NeuroQoL upper extremity, and reachable workspace outcome measures (relative surface area, RSA) were collected upon rehabilitation hospital admission, at discharge, and at 3-month visit. Pearson and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients as well as multiple linear regression analyses were used to determine the relationships between FIM self-care, NeuroQoL, and reachable workspace RSAs. Moderately strong correlation between total reachable workspace RSA and total FIM self-care score at discharge and at 3-month were noted (r=0.619, r=0.661, p&amp;lt;0.05), and similarly strong correlation was also noted with the upper extremity NeuroQoL total score (r=0.690, r=0.815, p&amp;lt;0.05). Multiple linear regression analyses revealed a change in bilateral total RSA of 0.1 unit from admission to 3-month follow up correlated with respective change in FIM self-care score of 2.011 points (95%CI: 0.663-3.360). Longitudinal improvement in ADL function during stroke rehabilitation and recovery process is correlated with improvement in reachable workspace.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e5f1ec43fa93ef3fdec16b8605ec49c07bc50f60b280f811be9aa92819cb82d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
