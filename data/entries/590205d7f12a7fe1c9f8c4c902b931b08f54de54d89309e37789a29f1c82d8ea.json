{"title":"Central Nervous System Fungal Diseases in Children with Malignancies: A 15-Year Study from the Infection Working Group of The Hellenic Society of Pediatric Hematology Oncology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0531/v1","date":1723112809000,"content":"We analyzed data of pediatric invasive fungal diseases of the central nervous system (CNS-IFDs) reported by five of total eight Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Departments in Greece for 15 years (2007-2022). A total of twelve patients (11 boys, median age: 9.5yrs range: 2-16) were reported suffering from CNS-IFDs. Underlying malignancy was acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 9/12, and acute myeloid leukemia, Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma in one each. Eleven patients presented with CNS-related symptoms (i.e seizures, headache, cerebral palsy, ataxia, hallucination, seizures, blurred vision, amaurosis). All patients had pathological MRI findings. Multifocal fungal disease was observed in 6/12 patients. Nine proven and three probable CNS-IFD cases were diagnosed. Causative pathogens in proven cases were Aspergillus spp. and Candida albicans (n=2 each), Mucor spp., Rhizopus arrhizus, Absidia spp., Fusarium oxysporum and Cryptococcus neoformans (n=1 each). Causative pathogens in probable cases were Aspergillus spp. (n=2) and Candida spp. (n=1). All patients received appropriate antifungal therapy (median duration: 69.5 days, range 19-364). Two patients underwent additional surgical treatment. Six patients admitted to ICU due to complications. Three patients (25%) died, two due to IFD and one due to underlying disease. Early recognition and prompt intervention of CNS-IFDs may rescue the patients and improve overall survival.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"590205d7f12a7fe1c9f8c4c902b931b08f54de54d89309e37789a29f1c82d8ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
