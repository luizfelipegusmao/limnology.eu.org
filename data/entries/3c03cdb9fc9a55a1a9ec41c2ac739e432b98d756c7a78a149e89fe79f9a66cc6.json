A growing amount of interest has been exhibited in using aptamers as target ligands for targeted cancer therapy and specific cancer cell identification due to their distinct benefits. Aptamer-conjugated nano-materials have recently provided new prospects in cancer treatment with their improved therapeutic efficacy and capability of reducing toxicity. Consequently, they are not perceived as alien substances our body, which allows their comfortable acceptance. Several tumor markers such as nucleolin, mucin, and the epidermal growth factor receptor can be effectively recognized by aptamers. In addition, glycoproteins on the surface of tumor cells can be recognized using aptamers. So surface modification of drug by aptamer are accomplished for enhanced tumor-specific recognition by which drug-specific accretion, internalization, and drug retention in tumors increased through specific ligand-mediated interactions and thus therapeutic index is increased. Here, we highlight some promising classes of aptamer-conjugated nanoparticles for the specific recognition of cancer cells and targeted drug delivery and the molecular mechanism and immunomodulatory regulation of these aptamer have been focused.</p>","author":"Sounik Manna, \nRumi Mahata, \nSurya K.
