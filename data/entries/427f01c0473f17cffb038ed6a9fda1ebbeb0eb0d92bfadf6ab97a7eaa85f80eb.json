{"title":"Spring resting egg production of the calanoid copepod, Eurytemora affinis, in a freshet-dominated estuary","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/5/475/7717619?rss=1","date":1721433600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Seasonal peaks in river discharge, such as snowmelt-dominated freshets, are predictable events that can have a large effect on flushing rates and salinity in estuaries. Resting eggs, which many coastal and estuarine copepods produce for overwintering or aestivation, could also serve to bridge predictable peaks in river discharge. We assessed the timing of resting egg production of the egg-carrying estuarine copepod, <span>Eurytemora affinis</span> (Poppe), in relation to river discharge in the Fraser River Estuary, Canada. Approximately 30 field-collected females were individually incubated on 12 occasions over the period February 2015–May 2016. <span>Eurytemora affinis</span> abundance and population structure were investigated from vertical net tow samples collected twice monthly to monthly. Resting eggs occurred primarily in May 2015 and May 2016 (6.5 and 9.2 eggs day<sup>−1</sup>, respectively), a month prior to peak flows, and the proportion of offspring that were resting eggs increased with river discharge. <span>Eurytemora affinis</span> reached a minimum abundance in July 2015, when the population was dominated by adults (86%). Resting egg production in <span>E. affinis</span> is typically considered an overwintering mechanism but we suggest that the ultimate driver of resting egg production in this population is avoidance of flushing and/or low salinities.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"427f01c0473f17cffb038ed6a9fda1ebbeb0eb0d92bfadf6ab97a7eaa85f80eb","category":"Environment"}
