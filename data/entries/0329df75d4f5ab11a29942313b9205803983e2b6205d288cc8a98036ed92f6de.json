{"title":"Multisensor Analysis for Biostimulants Effect Detection in Sustainable Viticulture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1137/v1","date":1728987267000,"content":"Biostimulants are organic agents employed for crop yield enhancement, quality improvement, and environmental stress mitigation, reducing, at the same time, reliance on inorganic inputs. With advancements in sustainable agriculture, data acquisition technologies have become crucial for monitoring the effects of such inputs. This study evaluates the impact of four biostimulant application rates on grapevines, using vegetation indices derived from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), proximal and manual sensing tools, and qualitative and quantitative production assessments. The research was conducted over two seasons in a Malvasia Bianca vineyard in Sardinia, Italy. Results indicated that UAS-derived vegetation indices, consistent with traditional ground-based measurements, effectively monitored vegetative growth over time but revealed no significant differences between treatments, suggesting either a lack of vegetative indices sensitivity or that the applied biostimulant rates were insufficient to elicit a measurable response in the cultivar. Among the tools employed, only the SPAD 502 meter demonstrated the sensitivity required to detect treatment differences, primarily reflected in grape production outcomes. Future research will focus on validating these technologies for precision viticulture, particularly on long-term benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0329df75d4f5ab11a29942313b9205803983e2b6205d288cc8a98036ed92f6de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
