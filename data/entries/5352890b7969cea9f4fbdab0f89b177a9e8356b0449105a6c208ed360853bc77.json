{"title":"Modulatory potential of Bacopa monnieri against aflatoxin B1 induced biochemical, molecular and histological alterations in rats","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae060/7655605?rss=1","date":1713657600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Oxidative injury is concerned with the pathogenesis of several liver injuries, including those from acute liver failure to cirrhosis. This study was designed to explore the antioxidant activity of <span>Bacopa monnieri</span> (BM) on Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) induced oxidative damage in <span>Wistar</span> albino rats. Aflatoxin B1 treatment (200 μg/kg/day, p.o.) for 28 days induced oxidative injury by a significant alteration in serum liver function test marker enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, LDH, albumin and bilirubin), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) along with reduction of antioxidant enzymes (GSH, SOD, CAT), GSH cycle enzymes and drug-metabolizing enzymes (AH and AND). Treatment of rats with <span>B. monnieri</span> (20, 30 and 40 mg/kg for 5 days, p.o.) after 28 days of AFB1 intoxication significantly restored these parameters near control in a dose-dependent way. Histopathological examination disclosed extensive hepatic injuries, characterized by cellular necrosis, infiltration, congestion and sinusoidal dilatation in the AFB1-treated group. Treatment with <span>B. monnieri</span> significantly reduced these toxic effects resulting from AFB1. <span>B. monnieri</span><span>per se</span> group (40 mg/kg) did not show any significant change and proved safe. The cytotoxic activity of <span>B. monnieri</span> was also evaluated on HepG2 cells and showed a good percentage of cytotoxic activity. This finding suggests that <span>B. monnieri</span> protects the liver against oxidative damage caused by AFB1, which aids in the evaluation of the traditional usage of this medicinal plant.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"5352890b7969cea9f4fbdab0f89b177a9e8356b0449105a6c208ed360853bc77","category":"Environment"}
