{"title":"Ni-based Semiconductors From Ldh-precursors Synthetized Using Amines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2236/v1","date":1722243593000,"content":"NiO nanoparticles have been synthetized by calcination of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) precursors prepared using dimethylamine (DMA) as a precipitating agent. The incorporation of Ce and La oxides to the structure was investigated. The samples were characterized by element chemical analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy, thermal analysis and specific surface area analysis. Furthermore, the optical band gaps of the semiconductor samples were estimated by ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The results showed that it is possible to obtain Ni-LDHs precursor with good crystallinity and a small crystal size, which can be used as precursors of NiO nanoparticles with â‰ˆ3.7 nm of crystal size. The semiconductors obtained have good values of band gaps with rather large specific surface areas, which make them suitable for their use as photocatalysts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e405361ca4a719956352905497450cec82e766deee54930f666e3d96d2427bc9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
