{"title":"New Tests on Lorentz Invariance Violation Using Energy-Resolved Polarimetry of Gamma-Ray Bursts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1597/v1","date":1726809021000,"content":"One of the manifestations of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) is vacuum birefringence, which leads to an energy-dependent rotation of the polarization plane of linearly polarized photons arising from an astrophysical source. Here we use the energy-resolved polarization measurements in the prompt $\\gamma$-ray emission of five bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to constrain this vacuum birefringent effect. Our results show that at the 95\\% confidence level, the birefringent parameter $\\eta$ characterizing the broken degree of Lorentz invariance can be constrained to be $|\\eta|&lt;\\mathcal{O}(10^{-15}-10^{-16})$, which represent an improvement of at least eight orders of magnitude over existing limits from multi-band optical polarization observations. Moreover, our constraints are competitive with previous best bounds from the single $\\gamma$-ray polarimetry of other GRBs. We emphasize that, thanks to the adoption of the energy-resolved polarimetric data set, our results on $\\eta$ are statistically more robust. Future polarization measurements of GRBs at higher energies and larger distances would further improve LIV limits through the birefringent effect.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e801c3c6f2c5b972cb547faef7c37c67550f76e5affa818316895c253ad492a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
