{"title":"Rooting for nitrates: ZmNLP3.2 positively regulates root biomass under low nitrogen conditions through ZmAux/IAA14 inhibition","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4278/7719053?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Plant roots are essential for resource uptake and anchorage to the soil. Root growth is dynamic and can be adjusted according to a plant's needs. For example, in the case of low nutrient availability, root growth can be promoted as a foraging response (<a href=\"#koae215-B3\">Lynch 2019</a>). Maize (<span>Zea mays</span>) possesses a primarily shoot-borne root system comprised of primary roots, seminal roots, crown roots, and lateral roots, which altogether contribute to successful plant growth (<a href=\"#koae215-B2\">Hochholdinger 2009</a>). Nitrogen (N) is an essential macronutrient for which sensing and uptake through the roots is partially regulated by NODULE INCEPTION-like proteins (NLPs). These NLPs bind nitrate and activate many downstream genes related to N signaling and assimilation (<a href=\"#koae215-B1\">Cao et al. 2017</a>). Despite their relevance, it remains unclear how NLPs contribute to root development mechanistically. Auxins are well-known hormones involved in almost all aspects of root growth and development (<a href=\"#koae215-B4\">Roychoudhry and Kepinski 2022</a>). However, no direct connection between NLPs and auxins in maize has been reported so far.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"812a41b1f06e66dba7b5eb86c9c80491cd39f1f2b18734cc2096b617bfec6ab6","category":"Environment"}
