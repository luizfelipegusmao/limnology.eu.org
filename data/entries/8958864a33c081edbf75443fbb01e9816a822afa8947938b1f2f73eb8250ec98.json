{"title":"A Comprehensive Review on the Current Status of Drinking Water Quality in Sindh Province of Pakistan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1230/v1","date":1726489771000,"content":"For predicting the current status about the quality of drinking water in the Sindh province about 140 research articles in which drinking water had been analysed, were systematically reviewed. The literature disclosed that the drinking water particularly groundwater in Sindh province is not suitable for drinking purposes in more than 70-80% of the area. It was also revealed that the major contaminants that are found excessively high in the drinking water of Sindh province are EC, Cl, Mg, Ca, TDS, As, F, Zn, TH, Ni, and other heavy metals. Overall, in Sindh province the concentration of water quality parameters such as Cl, EC, TDS, TH, SO4, NO2, NO3, Mg, Ca, Zn, Pb, F, and Fe, are beyond permissible limit. pH is found within allowable limits in Sindh province and As is found beyond allowable limits in regions located nearer to river and coastal side of Arabian sea such as Badin, Thatta, and Karachi.Total and fecal coliform had also been reported in the groundwater of Sindh province and thatâ€™s why waterborne diseases are common in Sindh province. The major reason behind the degrading quality of drinking water in Sindh province is the mixing of sewage and seawater with groundwater and surface water. Therefore, it has been recommended that proper monitoring of seawater and sewage should be ensured so that safe water should be supplied to the consumer in Sindh province.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8958864a33c081edbf75443fbb01e9816a822afa8947938b1f2f73eb8250ec98","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
