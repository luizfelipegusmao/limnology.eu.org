{"title":"Respiratory and physical health consequences in older adults in a high-risk volcanic area: Comparison of two rural villages","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310659","date":1726754400000,"content":"<p>by Vicente Benavides-Cordoba, Andres Suarez, Diana Guerrero-Jaramillo, Melissa Silva-Medina, Jhonatan Betancourt-Peña, Mauricio Palacios-Gómez</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Volcanism is an important natural producer of pollution that impacts health and the quality of the environment. Lung changes caused by exposure to volcanoes have been previously studied. However, limited information exists regarding the effects of prolonged exposure to volcanic compounds. So, this study aimed to analyze the pulmonary effects and stress tolerance in older adults for chronic exposure to the volcanic ashes of the Galeras volcano.</p> Methods <p>A descriptive cross-sectional study of association included rural inhabitants aged over 60 years from Genoy, a village located in a high volcanic hazard zone of Galeras volcano, 2603 meters above sea level. Those in this group, called exposed, were contrasted with a sample of El Encano inhabitants with similar socioeconomic and cultural characteristics. Both villages belong to the rural area of San Juan de Pasto in Colombia.</p> Results <p>It was found that of 31 exposed participants, 18 had obstructive alteration, and in the control group, it was found that of 31 subjects, 6 presented this alteration. The difference between the two groups was significant (p&lt;0.001). A similar situation occurred with distal airway obstruction assessed with the forced expiratory flow of 25–75%. No significant differences were found in restrictive alteration between the exposed and unexposed groups.</p> Conclusion <p>Chronic exposure to volcanic compounds has generated obstructive changes in the population, and these changes were greater in number and severity than those in the control group of unexposed people.</p>","author":"Vicente Benavides-Cordoba","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"da291b8997934f8e7972f2b73c33842fcb32cb763bab56193d9ea922ae8b7413","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
