{"title":"Chatbot Design and Implementation: Towards an Operational Model for Chatbots","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1883/v1","date":1711878281000,"content":"The recent past has witnessed a growing interest in technologies for creating chatbots. Advances in Large Language Models for natural language processing are underpinning rapid progress in chatbot development, and experts predict revolutionary changes in the labour market as many manual tasks are replaced by virtual assistants in a range of business functions. As the new technology becomes more accessible and advanced, more companies are exploring the possibilities of implementing virtual assistants to automate routine tasks and improve service. This article reports on qualitative inductive research undertaken within a chatbot development team operating in a major international enterprise. The findings identify critical success factors for chatbot projects, and, based on the in-depth case study, a model is put forward to aid the manageability of chatbot implementation. The presented model can serve as an exemplar guide for researchers and practitioners working on the design, development and implementation of virtual assistants. It is flexible and applicable in a wide range of business contexts, linking strategic business goals with execution steps. It is particularly applicable for teams with no experience of chatbot implementation, reducing uncertainty and managing decisions and risks throughout the project lifecycle, thereby increasing the likelihood of project success.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"efd38a3c2599ab3894ba1dc43e8b99d572bbdf91a6aa5f77dad194d8bef0ebfc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
