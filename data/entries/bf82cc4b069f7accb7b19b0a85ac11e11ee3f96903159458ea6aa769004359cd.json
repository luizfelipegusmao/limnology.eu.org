{"title":"Modeling and Simulation of a Hydro Generator Stator Bar","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1995/v1","date":1727279893000,"content":"As motor capacity and rated voltage increase, the demand for motor insulation also increases. Additionally, the electric field distribution at the end of a large-scale hydro generator is extremely non-uniform, and corona discharge readily occurs. This destroys the main insulation, which significantly affects the service life of electrical machinery. Thus, the regulation of the electric field concentration at the end of a large-scale hydro generator needs to be addressed. There are many problems in resistanceâ€“capacitance chain model research. Particularly, these models cannot accurately reflect the insulation, corona structure, and electric field distribution in electrical machinery. Additionally, the corner electric field and loss distributions cannot be obtained, leading to a higher calculation error. The electric field distribution at the motor end and the loss distribution were analyzed using the finite-element method. First, by applying the basic principles of electric circuits and electromagnetic field theory, we calculated the electric field distribution at the stator bar end. Second, a 3D model of the stator bar was built using Creo Parametric, yielding a model that is more closely related to the prototype wirebar model. Then, the potential, electric field, and loss distributions around the stator bar were simulated by using COMSOL simulation software. The effects of the circular arc corner, nonlinearity coefficient, anti-corona coating length, and resistivity of the stator bar on the electric field distribution at the motor end were explored.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf82cc4b069f7accb7b19b0a85ac11e11ee3f96903159458ea6aa769004359cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
