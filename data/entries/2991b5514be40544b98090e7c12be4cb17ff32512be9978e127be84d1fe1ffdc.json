Older adults who experience economic insecurity may refrain from seeking medical consultation or using long-term care insurance, and these behaviors may increase the incidence and progression of frailty. This study conducted a cross-sectional survey to identify factors related to a sense of economic insecurity among older adults who participate in social activities, and identified support measures. In total, 1,351 older adults aged ≥65 years who had participated in social activities voluntarily completed an anonymous self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire encompassed their physical, cognitive, social, and psychological conditions, and economic insecurity. We performed univariate analysis considering a sense of economic insecurity as the dependent variable, and conducted multiple logistic regression analysis (forced entry method) considering the independent variables with p&lt;0.1 as the covariates. Among the 872 filled questionnaires, 717 were analyzed as they had no missing data with respect to the responses to survey questions (valid response rate was 53.1%). Analysis results showed that 43.6% of the older adults had a sense of economic insecurity, which was most common among those aged 75–84 years, accounting for 47.3%, followed by those aged 65–74 years accounting for 44.1%, and those aged ≥85 years accounting for 31.5% (p&lt;0.05). The sense of economic insecurity was not associated with physical conditions, subjective symptoms of dementia, or social conditions; however, it grew with increased loneliness (OR: 1.71, 1.002–2.92, p = 0.049) and decreased with an increased subjective sense of well-being (OR: 0.86, 0.81–0.92, &lt;0.001). Economic insecurity among older adults was not associated with physical, cognitive, or social aspects, as reported in previous studies. The survey respondents constituted older adults who participate in social activities. Maintaining interactions within the community, even in old age, may prevent loneliness and improve subjective health.","author":"Yuriko Inoue","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2991b5514be40544b98090e7c12be4cb17ff32512be9978e127be84d1fe1ffdc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
