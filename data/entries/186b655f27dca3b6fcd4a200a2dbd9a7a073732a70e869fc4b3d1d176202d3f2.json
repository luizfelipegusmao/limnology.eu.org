{"title":"Meta-Analysis of N2O Emissions as Affected by Biochar Amendment in Northern China","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11270-024-07043-2","date":1712016000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Global warming is one of the eco-environmental problems of most concern to scientists. N<sub>2</sub>O, an atmospheric greenhouse gas, has been widely studied because of its high warming potential. As an excellent soil conditioner, biochar has a very broad research value and application path in the farmland. This work examined the impact of biochar application on N<sub>2</sub>O emissions reduction potential of farmland soils in northern China by meta analysis and path analysis. The results were as follows: the N<sub>2</sub>O emissions reduction potential changes corresponded with different biochar preparation materials, preparation temperature, C/N ratio and pH. Biochar is more suitable for application in soil with a bulk density &lt; 1.3 g cm<sup>−3</sup>, sandy loam texture, neutral pH, organic matter content 20–30 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, soil C/N ratio 10–20, and total nitrogen &lt; 2 g kg<sup>−1</sup>. At the same time, the maximum reduction of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions can be achieved in a scenario where the biochar is applied at 20 t ha<sup>−1</sup>- 40 t ha<sup>−1</sup> and the application of nitrogen fertilizer is 100–200 kg N ha<sup>−1</sup>. Under the above ideal conditions, this study selected the data of soil mineralized nitrogen (X<sub>1</sub>), soil organic matter content (X<sub>2</sub>), soil water content (X<sub>3</sub>), average temperature (X<sub>4</sub>), total nitrogen (X<sub>5</sub>), and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions (Y) for correlation analysis and path analysis, and finally obtained the multiple stepwise regression equation between N<sub>2</sub>O emissions and various impact factors as follows: Y = -45.9102 + 0.6874X<sub>1</sub> + 0.4634X<sub>2</sub> + 0.3249X<sub>3</sub> + 0.2698X<sub>4</sub> + 0.2218X<sub>5</sub> (<em>R</em><sup><em>2</em></sup> = 0.826, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01, <em>n</em> = 87). The direct relationships between N<sub>2</sub>O and soil mineralized nitrogen and soil organic matter content were very significant (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.01). The second is soil water content, average temperature and total nitrogen. Indirect relationships between N<sub>2</sub>O and average temperature, total nitrogen and mineralized nitrogen were significant (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.05).</p>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Graphical Abstract</h3>\n                      <p>\n      <span>\n                        <span>\n                          <img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/MediaObjects/11270_2024_7043_Figa_HTML.png\" />\n                        </span>\n                      </span></p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"186b655f27dca3b6fcd4a200a2dbd9a7a073732a70e869fc4b3d1d176202d3f2","category":"Environment"}
