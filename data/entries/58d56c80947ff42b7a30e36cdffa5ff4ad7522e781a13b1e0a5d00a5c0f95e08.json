{"title":"N‐Carbamylglutamate in ovo feeding improves carcass yield, muscle fiber development, and meat quality in broiler chickens","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13639?af=R","date":1718362131000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Insufficient endogenous nutrients in the broiler embryo can lead to muscle gluconeogenesis, which ultimately affects the post-hatching performance of chicks. This study investigated the effects of <i>in ovo</i> feeding (IOF) of <i>N</i>-carbamylglutamate (NCG) on the growth hormones, carcass yield, and meat quality in broilers. Fertile eggs from a 30-week-old Ross 308 breeder flock were divided into three treatment groups: NC (non-injection), SC (100 μL saline-injection), and NCG (2 mg NCG injection). Each group had six replicates, with 70 eggs per replicate during incubation. Injections were administered on the 17.5th day of embryonic development. After hatching, 270 chicks were selected for 42-day rearing for further sampling.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Chicks in the NCG group had significantly higher body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) at the growing phase, increased growth and testosterone hormone in both feeding phases (21 and 42 days), and improved average daily gain (ADG) and food conversion ratio (FCR) in both grower and entire feeding phases (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) and tetraiodothyronine (T<sub>4</sub>) levels, carcass yield, dressing, drum weight, breast muscle weight, drumstick weights, thighs, <i>pectoralis major</i>, and their part percentage of carcass were improved in the NCG group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), these effects were varied along feeding phases. Moreover, IOF of the NCG also improved <i>pectoralis</i> breast muscle color values at 24 h post mortem (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These results suggest that NCG injection at the late embryonic age of broiler enhances growth performance and meat quality throughout the lifespan and this can probably be attributed to an increase in thyroid and testosterone hormones, indicating potential involvement in metabolic and nutrient partitioning pathway regulation. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Wang Yuan‐hao, \nHabtamu Ayalew, \nJing Wang, \nShugeng Wu, \nKai Qiu, \nGuanghai Qi, \nHaijun Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"58d56c80947ff42b7a30e36cdffa5ff4ad7522e781a13b1e0a5d00a5c0f95e08","category":"Environment"}
