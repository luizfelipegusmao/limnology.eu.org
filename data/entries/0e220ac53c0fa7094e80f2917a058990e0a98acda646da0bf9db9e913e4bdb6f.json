{"title":"The role of natural resources and press freedom in sustainable development","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12466?af=R","date":1713319093000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Fostering sustainable development (SD) through the utilization of available resources, including natural resources, is a common global aspiration. This study delves into the intricate relationship between natural resource abundance (NRA), SD, and the moderating role of press freedom in this paradigm. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning 109 countries from 2001 to 2020, we employed fixed effect regression and two-step dynamic system GMM estimators. Our findings show that NRA has a negative impact on SD, posing a significant threat to the SD. We identify each individual type of natural resource that negatively influences SD, underscoring the need for sustainable management practices for these resources. On the other hand, press freedom is found to have a positive effect on SD, playing an influential role in promoting SD. The moderating effect of press freedom further emphasizes its vital role as a safeguard, mitigating the detrimental effects of resource abundance on the SD. Our study has important policy implications, suggesting that by adopting sustainable resource management practices and upholding press freedom, policymakers can pave the way for a more sustainable and environmentally responsible future.</p>","author":"Musa Khan, \nWu Chao, \nMuhammad Atif Khan, \nMohammed Arshad Khan, \nAhsanuddin Haider","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"0e220ac53c0fa7094e80f2917a058990e0a98acda646da0bf9db9e913e4bdb6f","category":"Environment"}
