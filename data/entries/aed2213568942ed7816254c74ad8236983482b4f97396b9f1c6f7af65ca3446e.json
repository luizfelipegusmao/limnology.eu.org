{"title":"Perceived Barriers and Enablers to Take Iron Supplementation Regularly Among Adolescent Girls in Indonesia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2318/v1","date":1727600870000,"content":"Non-compliance with iron supplementation consumption contributes to the high rate of anemia among adolescent girls in Indonesia. This study explores the barriers and enablers perceived by adolescent girls regarding regular iron supplement consumption. Using a qualitative design, eight focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted in Makassar and Padang involving 32 girls grade 8 and 9 from four junior high schools. Data on perceived barriers and enablers were collected using a social cognitive theory framework and analyzed thematically. The average age of the informants was 13,65±0,60 years. Although all participants received supplement at school, most did not consume them regularly. Key barriers include dislike of the taste and smell, parental prohibition negative experience consuming iron supplement, and the belief that iron supplements increase menstrual blood flow and volume. Enablers include self-awareness of the supplement’s benefits, trust in school-provided supplements, and positive support from parents and peers. Behavior change strategies are needed to address these barriers and strengthen supporting factors to improve iron supplementation consumption.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aed2213568942ed7816254c74ad8236983482b4f97396b9f1c6f7af65ca3446e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
