{"title":"Selected Physical and Mechanical Properties of Particleboards Manufactured from Plantation Willow and Poplar Wood","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1933/v1","date":1721810758000,"content":"The research focuses on the production of particleboards from the biomass of energetic willow (Salix viminalis L.) and energetic poplar (Populus spp.), aiming to explore their feasibility as sustainable materials for various applications. Energetic willow and energetic poplar are known for their rapid growth and suitability for energy production. They present an intriguing alternative as raw materials with added value for particleboard manufacturing. The study investigates the selected mechanical and physical properties of the produced particleboards, considering parameters such as density profile, bending strength, modulus of elasticity, water absorption, thickness swelling, and screw withdrawal resistance. During the research, the results were also compared between different mass shares of willow and poplar particles in the particleboards. The findings underscore the promising potential of willow and poplar-based particleboards as eco-friendly alternatives in the construction and furniture industries, contributing to resource efficiency and carbon emission reduction efforts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e09bd5c3fc081704999f1586978a08b5b159090f0c82c663cb9b68b8dbd66492","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
