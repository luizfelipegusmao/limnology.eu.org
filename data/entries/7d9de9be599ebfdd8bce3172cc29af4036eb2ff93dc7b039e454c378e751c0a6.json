{"title":"Relationship between protein conformational stability and its immunogenicity when administering antigens to mice using adjuvants—Analysis employed the CH<sub>2</sub> domain in human antibodies","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307320","date":1721656800000,"content":"<p>by Kosuke Oyama, Tadashi Ueda</p>\r\n\r\nAntigen-presenting cells (APCs) play a crucial role in the immune system by breaking down antigens into peptide fragments that subsequently bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Previous studies indicate that stable proteins can impede CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell stimulation by hindering antigen processing and presentation. Conversely, certain proteins require stabilization in order to activate the immune response. Several factors, including the characteristics of the protein and the utilization of different adjuvants in animal experiments, may contribute to this disparity. In this study, we investigated the impact of adjuvants on antigen administration in mice, specifically focusing on the stability of the CH<sub>2</sub> domain. Consequently, the CH<sub>2</sub> domain induced a stronger IgG response in comparison to the stabilized one when using Alum and PBS (without adjuvant). On the other hand, animal experiment using Freund’s adjuvant showed the opposite results. These findings indicate the significance of considering the intrinsic conformational stability of a protein when eliciting its immunogenicity, particularly within the context of vaccine development.","author":"Kosuke Oyama","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7d9de9be599ebfdd8bce3172cc29af4036eb2ff93dc7b039e454c378e751c0a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
