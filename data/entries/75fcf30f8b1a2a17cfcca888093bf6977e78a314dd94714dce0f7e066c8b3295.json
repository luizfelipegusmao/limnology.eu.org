{"title":"Second Order Terminal Sliding Mode Control for Trajectory-Tracking of a Differential Drive Robot","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1761/v1","date":1716811744000,"content":"Abstract. This paper proposes a Second Order Terminal Sliding Mode (2TSM) approach to the trajectory tracking of Differential Drive Mobile Robot (DDMR). Within this cascaded control scheme, the 2TSM dynamic controller, at the inner most loop, tracks the robot’s velocity quantities; while a kinematic controller, at the outer most loop, regulates the robot’s positions. In this manner, chattering is greatly attenuated and finite time convergence is guaranteed by the second order TSM manifold which involves higher order derivatives of the state variables, resulting in inherently robust as well as fast and better tracking precision. The simulation results demonstrate the merit of the proposed control methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75fcf30f8b1a2a17cfcca888093bf6977e78a314dd94714dce0f7e066c8b3295","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
