The strength of these alloys is attributed to the fine homogeneously dispersed precipitates in the Al matrix under conditions of heat treatment (T6) [<a href=\"#ozae044.1030-B1\">1</a>], where the three stages of precipitation hardening are solubilizing, quenching, and aging. Another hardening route used in aluminum alloys is plastic deformation, which introduces internal stresses and dislocation in the alloy [<a href=\"#ozae044.1030-B2\">2</a>]. In this sense, both hardening processes have a favorable effect on the mechanical properties of the material. However, very few studies have investigated the correlation between cold plastic deformation and the formation of precipitates on the mechanical properties and electrical conductivity [<a href=\"#ozae044.1030-B3\">3</a>]. With rapid industrialization development, the requirements of the integral properties of aluminum alloys, such as strength, hardness, conductivity, etc., are increasing [<a href=\"#ozae044.1030-B4\">4</a>]. According to relevant research, the conductivity depends on the materialÂ´s structure, which depends not only on the forming method but also on the heat treatment process [<a href=\"#ozae044.1030-B5\">5</a>]. For this reason, the present research is based on the study of two Al-Mg-Zn ternary systems, being these the main elements that constitute the 7XXX series alloys, where the cold plastic deformation-precipitation correlation (T8 heat treatment) and its effect on the microstructure, mechanical and electrical properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d217b42cf10cd7410dc726ed3c6b602a374c2c2a93ee6e1431308ee7f5c9512a","category":"Environment"}
