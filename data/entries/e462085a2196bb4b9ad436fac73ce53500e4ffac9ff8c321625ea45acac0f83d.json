{"title":"Tricuspid Regurgitation Associated with Implantable Cardiac Devices: A Double-Edged Sword","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0359/v1","date":1725458897000,"content":"The use of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) has increased considerably, becoming a cornerstone of management for patients with brady- or tachyarrhythmia or for the prevention of sudden cardiac death. On the other hand, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) associated with CIEDs is progressively accepted as a serious clinical issue; prognostic impact of TR is profound, as it is independently associated with increased mortality and a higher risk of heart failure hospitalization. Additionally, management of established CIED-related TR continues to be challenging, with limited options for intervention once significant TR has developed. The balance between the lifesaving benefits of CIEDs and the risk of TR underlines the necessity for cautious patient selection and innovative approaches to device implantation and management. This review highlighting the clinical importance, underlying mechanisms, and challenges associated with lead-related tricuspid regurgitation in patients with CIEDs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e462085a2196bb4b9ad436fac73ce53500e4ffac9ff8c321625ea45acac0f83d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
