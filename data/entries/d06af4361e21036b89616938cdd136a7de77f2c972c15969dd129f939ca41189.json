{"title":"Particles in Exhaled Air (PExA): Clinical Uses and Future Implications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0905/v1","date":1713163899000,"content":"Acute and chronic respiratory diseases impose a significant economic and health burden. Distal small airway assessment requires invasive procedures such as a bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. The Particles in Exhaled Air (PExA) device provides a non-invasive means of assessing small airways; it captures distal airway particles sized around 0.5-7m and contains particles of respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF) that originate during airway closure and opening. The PExA device can measure particle count and mass according to particle size. Subsequent capture of particles in a thin membrane enables application of various analytical methods to assess a broad range of biomolecules including phospholipids, proteins, inflammatory profile, and other metabolites to characterise inflammation and diseases processes such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung cancer, and more recently acute infections such as COVID-19. PExA analysis provides a promising alternative to traditional investigative methods in the assessment, diagnosis, and management of respiratory conditions. By evaluating specific biomarkers in the RTLF associated with airway inflammation, PExA may offer a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the molecular-level changes in the small airways of patients with acute and chronic lung diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d06af4361e21036b89616938cdd136a7de77f2c972c15969dd129f939ca41189","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
