{"title":"Evaluating Deep-Learning Resolution Recovery Algorithm Performance as a Function of Feature Size and Point Spread Function","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.1023/7720360?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>X-ray Microscopy has revolutionized non-destructive analysis across various disciplines, necessitating submicron-resolution X-ray imaging. Deep learning resolution recovery algorithms, such as DeepScout, have emerged to address the traditional trade-off between spatial resolution and field-of-view (FOV). This algorithm enhances resolution without sacrificing FOV. Its effectiveness relies on the precision of captured features and the image quality of the training datasets. It is important to study how such algorithms perform under suboptimal conditions. We systematically assess the performance of DeepScout in resolution recovery across different feature sizes by utilizing digitally simulated datasets with artificial noise/blurring and real-world datasets acquired at varying voxel sizes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"def5d98ef73a9e3eba5607d88e146a9c9101f883e8c18ca7130701c781417998","category":"Environment"}
