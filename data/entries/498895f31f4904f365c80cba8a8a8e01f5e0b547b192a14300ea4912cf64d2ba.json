{"title":"Understanding Trauma in IPV: Distinguishing Complex PTSD, PTSD, and BPD in Victims and Offenders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1987/v1","date":1719535585000,"content":"This work aims to shed light on the differential diagnosis of Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (cPTSD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) within the context of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV), which represents an extremely inno-vative field of clinical research. To this end, a critical review of the literature was conducted to identify and compare the clinical patterns and symptomatic overlaps among cPTSD, PTSD, and BPD, with an emphasis on their manifestation in both victims and offenders. The results show that despite some symptomatic similarities, cPTSD, PTSD and BPD have distinct clinical patterns in IPV. Disturbances in Self-Organization (DSO), are more commonly in offenders, while the di-agnosis of cPTSD is more aligned with the victims. In addition, cPTSD and characteristics of BPD, such as fear of rejection and instability of identity, constitute risk factors for IPV victimiza-tion. cPTSD is a predisposing factor not only for victims but also for offenders, while PTSD emerges as a consequential factor. The specific pathways linking PTSD, cPTSD, and BPD with IPV have significant implications for clinical practice. Further research is needed to understand these profiles and the mechanisms linking trauma-related features to IPV, which is crucial for imple-menting effective violence prevention programs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"498895f31f4904f365c80cba8a8a8e01f5e0b547b192a14300ea4912cf64d2ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
