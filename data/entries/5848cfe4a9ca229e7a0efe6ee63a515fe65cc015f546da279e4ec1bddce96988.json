Quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) utilizes the refractive index variations within the sample as its image contrast [<a href=\"#ozae044.392-B1\">1</a>]. By quantifying the phase shifts of light, QPM can visualize the intracellular features that are nearly optically transparent in conventional optical microscopy due to low scattering or light absorption. Without compromising cellular viability, QPM can allow the monitoring of biological processes in living systems for longitudinal studies. In addition, the measured phase value is proportional to dry mass of the object, or the biomass excluding water [<a href=\"#ozae044.392-B2\">2</a>], which also offers invaluable insights into cellular dynamics, allowing for the precise characterization of cellular states [<a href=\"#ozae044.392-B3\">3</a>] and responses to physiological conditions [<a href=\"#ozae044.392-B4\">4</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.392-B5\">5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5848cfe4a9ca229e7a0efe6ee63a515fe65cc015f546da279e4ec1bddce96988","category":"Environment"}
