{"title":"Long small RNA76113 targets CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE-GATED ION CHANNEL 5 to repress disease resistance in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1889/7394850?rss=1","date":1699488000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Small RNAs are widely involved in plant immune responses. However, the role of long small RNAs (25 to 40 nt) in monocot plant disease resistance is largely unknown. Here, we identified a long small RNA (lsiR76113) from rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) that is downregulated by <span>Magnaporthe oryzae</span> infection and targets a gene encoding CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE-GATED CHANNEL 5 (CNGC5). The <span>cngc5</span> mutant lines were more susceptible to <span>M. oryzae</span> than the wild type, while knocking down lsiR76113 in transgenic rice plants promoted pathogen resistance. A protoplast transient expression assay showed that OsCNGC5 promotes Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. These results demonstrate that OsCNGC5 enhances rice resistance to rice blast by increasing the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Importantly, exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> application enhanced rice <span>M</span>. <span>oryzae</span> resistance by affecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, <span>cngc5</span> mutants attenuated the PAMP-triggered immunity response, including chitin-induced and flg22-induced ROS bursts and protein phosphorylation in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, indicating that OsCNGC5 is essential for PAMP-induced calcium signaling in rice. Taken together, these results suggest that lsiR76113-mediated regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is important for PTI responses and disease resistance in rice.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"bad12f4c0be7d22e5f3527c280df0c2e4766076dc0c6820206b0a0b33a098154","category":"Environment"}
