{"title":"40 Two-week agriculture institute prepares Mississippi teachers to improve agricultural literacy in classrooms","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/12/7617936?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Agriculturally rich communities in Mississippi, particularly those with high minority populations, suffer from significant educational disparities, resulting in a median poverty rate 7.8% higher than the national average. Persistent unequal opportunities within the public school system, and a limitation of youth having access to advanced coursework and technology create challenges in improving the welfare of Mississippi communities. Despite being grossly underpaid, teachers in Mississippi remain passionate about agriculture education, often utilizing their personal finances to provide students with opportunities to succeed. Thus, an immersive learning agriculture science professional development program was created for 5<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th</sup> grade classroom teachers. The objective was to improve the quality of education for students by advancing the ability of teachers to foster understanding and practices in agriculture literacy. Teachers (n = 20; cohort 1, n = 12; cohort 2, n = 8) participated in a 2-wk summer institute. Teachers received continuing education credits for their teaching license, a stipend to alleviate associated costs, and supplies for their classroom. The teachers learned agriculture content (e.g., animal, plant, and soil sciences), engaged in hands-on learning labs (e.g., anatomy and immunology), participated in field excursions (e.g., animal handling), received literary instruction, and discussed teacher leadership. To determine if program outcomes were achieved, participants completed surveys (n = 3), interviews (n = 3), and submitted lesson plans (n = 2). Post-institute survey results of participating teachers indicated they were eager to implement their new knowledge in their classrooms, including but not limited to fetal pig dissections, reproductive tract anatomy, blue’s the clue, DNA extraction, carousel activity, mind mapping, and glow germ activity. Statistical analysis using one-way ANOVA was performed on pre- and post-survey knowledge assessment across both cohorts. Regarding agriculture content, self-assessment knowledge scores of both cohorts increased significantly (P ≤ 0.0001) during the post-survey. Both cohort 1 and 2 teachers responded with a score of 80% or higher to: “On an assessment where I had to, “Explain general livestock reproduction and reproductive management practices”; “Explain how a cow's immune system is similar to humans” and, “Explain why farmers work diligently to prevent disease”. In addition, cohort 2 teachers responded with a score of 80% or higher to: “On an assessment where I had to, “Accurately label the anatomical organs of a fetal pig”; “Correctly explain the basic function of fetal pig organs” and, “Explain pregnancy detection in animal science.” This professional development program successfully reached Mississippi teachers, equipping them with tools to increase agriculture literacy. The potential impact of this program extends to encourage more youth to pursue careers in agriculture, foster a more informed consumer base, and mitigate poverty rates within the state.
