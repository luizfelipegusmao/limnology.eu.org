{"title":"Optimization of division and reconfiguration locations of the medium-voltage power grid based on forecasting the level of load and generation from renewable energy sources","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0720/v1","date":1718153171000,"content":"The article discusses issues related to the optimization of the operation of medium voltage networks, focusing on the optimization of network division points and the selection of the optimal network configuration aimed at reducing power and energy losses. The article provides a critical review of selected scientific works from recent years on the issue of network configuration optimization. The developed solution uses non-deterministic network models and statistical and probabilistic approaches. Optimization studies were carried out using heuristic optimization methods and proprietary algorithms for forecasting the load and power generated from renewable energy sources. The solution proposed in the article has many application possibilities. It can be used to optimize the location of network division points (reducing economic costs related to the modernization of network infrastructure) as well as to optimize the reconfiguration process in order to reduce power losses while maintaining voltage criteria.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4bedf794499bc70c8419ee09de1b6a3c98ef19d30bd4531083c0a1bd3ab55c51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
