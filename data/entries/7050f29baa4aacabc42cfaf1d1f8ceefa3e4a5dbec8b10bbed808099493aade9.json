{"title":"Nutritional potential of organic matter for benthic macrofauna in the surface sediments of the East China Sea from the perspective of essential amino acids","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16113?af=R","date":1668758400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The purpose of this study was to explore whether essential amino acids (EAAs) in the particulate and sedimentary organic matter (OM) can potentially limit the nutritional needs for benthic macrofauna of different phyla, and which factors regulate the nutritional value with respect to EAAs in a large river-dominated shelf sea, the East China Sea. The EAA excess percentage of threonine, leucine, phenylalanine, histidine and arginine in suspended particles was significantly higher than those in surface sediments (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), suggesting that these EAAs for the macrofauna were from fresher suspended particles’ source, while methionine was from more degraded organic matter in surface sediments. The EAA excess percentage of valine, isoleucine and lysine showed no significant difference between suspended particles and sediments, indicating that macrofauna may uptake these EAAs from both suspended particle and sediment sources. Deeper offshore region had a lower nutritional potential for valine, leucine, isoleucine and phenylalanine. Bottom dissolved oxygen was not a regulator of the nutritional potential, due to dynamic oxygen conditions and much lower oxygen thresholds for the survival of most macrofauna.</p>","author":"Kui Wang, \nHaiyan Jin, \nQicheng Meng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"7050f29baa4aacabc42cfaf1d1f8ceefa3e4a5dbec8b10bbed808099493aade9","category":"Environment"}
