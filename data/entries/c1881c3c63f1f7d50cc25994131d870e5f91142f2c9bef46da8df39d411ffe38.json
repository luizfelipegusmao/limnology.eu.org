{"title":"Covers of Finitely Generated Acts over Monoids","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0268/v1","date":1712125684000,"content":"In (Semigroup Forum 77: 325-338, 2008) Mahmoudi M. and Renshaw J. solved a study that covers of cyclic $S$-acts over monoids. This article is an attempt to initiate the covers of finitely generated $S$-acts. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a monoid to have the properties that $n$-generated $S$-acts have strongly flat covers, Condition $(P)$ covers and projective covers. The main conclusions extend some known results. We show also that Condition $(P)$ covers of finitely generated $S$-acts are not unique, unlike the situation for strongly flat covers. Additionally, we demonstrate that the property of Enochs' $\\mathcal{X}$-precover of $S$-act $A$, where $\\mathcal{X}$ denotes a class of $S$-acts that are closed under isomorphisms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c1881c3c63f1f7d50cc25994131d870e5f91142f2c9bef46da8df39d411ffe38","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
