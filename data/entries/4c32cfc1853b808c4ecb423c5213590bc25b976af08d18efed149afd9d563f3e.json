{"title":"Exploring the Benefits of Natural Derived Bioconjugates from Hydroxy Cinnamates for Biomedical, Cosmetic, and Food Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1807/v1","date":1724684575000,"content":"This mini-review discusses the development and applications of naturally derived bioconjugates from hydroxycinnamic acids, such as coumaric, sinapic, ferulic, and caffeic acids, combined with various biomaterials. These bioconjugates offer a range of benefits including antioxidant properties, UV protection, customized hydrophilic-lipophilic balance, improved safety, solubility, emolliency, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and targeted delivery for biomedical, cosmetic, and food applications. The increasing demand for sustainable and natural products in the biomedical, cosmetic, and food industries has led to the exploration of these hydroxy cinnamic acids and their derivatives. We discuss the synthesis and modification of hydroxy cinnamic acids with biomaterials such as ω-hydroxy fatty acids, castor and lesquerella oils, glycerol, isosorbides, and synthetic polyethylene glycol to form functional phenolipids for biomedical, sunscreen and skincare applications. Techniques such as encapsulation with β-cyclodextrins and modification of biopolymeric supports like polysaccharides and starch are discussed for enhancing bioavailability and solubility. The fine-tuned development of bioconjugates from hydroxycinnamic acids using glycerol to modify the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance, substitution by water-soluble carboxylic acid groups, vegetable oil-based phenolipids, polysaccharides, PEGylation provide enhanced functionalities and offers a promising avenue for creating sustainable and effective products across various applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c32cfc1853b808c4ecb423c5213590bc25b976af08d18efed149afd9d563f3e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
