{"title":"Transmission Mechanism of Influencing Factors in the Promotion and Application of Whole Process Engineering Consulting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1961/v1","date":1714458489000,"content":"To facilitate the promotion and application of the whole process engineering consulting (WPEC) model, the transmission mechanism of influencing factors in WPEC's promotion and application is investigated. It identifies and categorizes the influencing factors within the framework of \"external environment-project factors-stakeholders\", systematically organizing and summarizing ten primary categories and thirty-eight secondary influencing factors of WPEC's promotion and ap-plication. Utilizing the complex network analysis method, a network of influencing factors in the promotion and application of WPEC is constructed. The network is then converted into three binary networks based on weight, which are subjected to structural analysis and motif analysis. On this basis, the transmission mechanism of influencing factors in WPEC's promotion and applica-tion and its causations are explored.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"378aa790d1b7ac14f5a243de3dfa1d22e027516e92555fa4912070a669da93bc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
