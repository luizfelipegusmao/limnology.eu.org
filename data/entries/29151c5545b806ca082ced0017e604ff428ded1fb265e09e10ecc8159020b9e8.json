{"title":"Susceptibility of Foodborne Pathogens to Milk-Origin Lactic Acid Bacteria Supernatants: A Comprehensive Meta-Regression Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2076/v1","date":1719585593000,"content":"This systematic review and meta-analysis compile the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) supernatant against three common dairy product pathogenic bacteria. After screening and analysis of full papers, identified by searches in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, thirty-nine studies were regarded as relevant, and a total of 510 were extracted thereof. The effects of moderators, namely, pathogen’s concentration, susceptibility test method, agar type, incubation time and temperature, LAB supernatant pH and aliquot volume, on inhibition diameters were assessed by adjusting three pathogen-specific meta-regression models. Results showed that, in general terms, strains from the Enterococcus genus (15.90 ± 2.138 mm) displayed the highest inhibition values against L. monocytogenes, whereas Lacticaseibacillus strains were more effective against Staphylococcus aureus (11.89 ± 0.573 mm). Whereas the well diffusion test outperformed spot and disk diffusion tests; the pH of LAB supernatant resulted in high measurements of inhibition diameters (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"29151c5545b806ca082ced0017e604ff428ded1fb265e09e10ecc8159020b9e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
