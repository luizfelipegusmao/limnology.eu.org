The conventional method, which calculates each emission point one by one, produces many unuseful calculations and has low computational efficiency. To solve this problem, given the characteristic that the velocity distribution of a model does not change during a single iteration of forward modeling, an improved algorithm was proposed based on the reciprocity principle and Fermatâ€™s principle. The ray tracing results of a small number of emission points were used to constrain the calculation area of other emission points, which reduced the number of unuseful calculations and improved the calculation efficiency of a single-iteration tomographic forward modeling simulation. Theoretical analysis and numerical examples showed that for a homogeneous model, when the transmitting and receiving points were located on two long sides, three adjacent sides (i.e., two long sides and one short side), and four sides, the computational efficiency of the improved algorithm was about 2 times, 2 times, and 1.5 times, respectively, that of the conventional method. For heterogeneous models, the computational efficiency of the improved algorithm was usually more significant.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"4b429b201621c2f197a2c5f08d8eab663c1f05be149a0eb2dfab3cfbb3ba22eb","category":"Environment"}
