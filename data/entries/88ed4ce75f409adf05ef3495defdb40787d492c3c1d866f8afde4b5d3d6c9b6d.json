{"title":"Centenary Dynamics in Physical Development of Moscow School Girls","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0655/v1","date":1710172485000,"content":"This article objective was to identify a centenary trend in the growth and development of girls in the metropolis of Moscow. Material and methods — The physical development (body length and weight, chest circumference, right hand muscle strength, and menstrual function development) of Moscow girls was studied during the period from 1920 to 2020. The amount of own observations was 4581 girls aged 8-17 years. Results – A comparative analysis of the physical development of Moscow school girls of different decades revealed a statistically significant increase in body length by 3-5 cm and a significant increase in chest circumference in all age groups of girls of the beginning of the XXI century, compared with their peers in the 1960s and 1980s, which indicates the completion of the gracialization processes that have been observed since the 1980s. However, in all age groups, a decrease in the muscle strength of the right hand is still being noticed. Earlier terms of menarshe onset in modern Moscow school girls (12 years 9 months) and a shift in growth jumps to earlier terms were established. It is shown that the age of menstruation depends on the level of family wealth. Conclusions. In Moscow girls in the centenary dynamics, a tendency to increase the total body size and shift the terms of biological maturation to earlier terms was revealed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88ed4ce75f409adf05ef3495defdb40787d492c3c1d866f8afde4b5d3d6c9b6d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
