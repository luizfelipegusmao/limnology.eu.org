To target these dual VTA<sup>VGluT2-VGaT</sup> neurons specifically, we developed transgenic mouse lines with dual recombinase and injected INTRSECT2.0 vectors into mouse VTA [<a href=\"#ozae044.225-B2\">2</a>]. To examine the ultrastructural properties of axon terminals from these dual VTA<sup>VGluT2-VGaT</sup> neurons in the LHb, we employed a novel experimental pipeline combining (i) selective viral vector tracing, (ii) correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), and (iii) super-resolution microscopy. This allowed us to reconstruct distinct types of axon terminals containing both VGluT2 (associated with asymmetric synapses) and VGaT (associated with symmetric synapses).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1cf261be3b297398b70303ea097a5fd100d319d36400d8c5eb3c828f6171cf9a","category":"Environment"}
