These were found to yield expected functional enhancements consistent with a more mature iPSC-CM phenotype, with potentially desirable properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"98cbe1c7f81b514f3e1ba962a7b75dd5891ab528d18341f7d3343fe2e0e28586","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
