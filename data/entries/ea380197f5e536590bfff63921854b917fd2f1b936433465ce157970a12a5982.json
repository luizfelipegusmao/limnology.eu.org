Research Topic This research aims to explore tailored skincare and wellness solutions for HIV-positive individuals, specifically focusing on addressing skin conditions, joint pains, and memory loss. The research question revolves around developing innovative and effective medical approaches to improve the quality of life for this population. Research Importance The topic is crucial as it addresses the unique challenges faced by HIV-positive individuals, highlighting the need for tailored healthcare solutions. By understanding and addressing the physical symptoms associated with HIV, such as skin conditions, joint pains, and memory loss, the research contributes to enhancing the overall well-being and quality of life of individuals living with HIV. Research Method The research encompasses a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, including studies on dermatological problems, musculoskeletal issues, and cognitive impairments in HIV-positive individuals. Additionally, the development of a proposed skincare and serum line, RadientResilience, is based on a careful consideration of pharmacological effects and the unique skin conditions of this population. Research Findings The research findings emphasize the prevalence of dermatological conditions as a significant marker for HIV in affected populations. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of thorough clinical assessment and the potential use of specific compounds and ingredients to alleviate joint discomfort in HIV-positive individuals. Research Conclusions The interpretations and conclusions drawn from the research underscore the need for tailored medical approaches to address the unique healthcare needs of HIV-positive individuals. The proposed skincare and serum line, RadientResilience, represents an innovative and empowering solution providing effective care for this targeted audience. Research Implications The research has implications for the development of specialized skincare and wellness products tailored to address the specific needs of HIV-positive individuals. Potential challenges in developing and implementing tailored skincare and wellness solutions for HIV-positive people include stigma and discrimination, as well as logistical and financial constraints. As Bouabida, Chaves, and Anane (2023) noted, “Stigma and discrimination are major barriers to HIV care engagement and adherence” (Challenges and barriers to HIV care engagement and care cascade: viewpoint, para. 3). Additionally, the authors highlight that “logistical and financial constraints can limit access to necessary healthcare services” (para. 5). Logistical and financial constraints can limit access to necessary healthcare services for individuals living with HIV by creating barriers such as transportation challenges, limited availability of healthcare professionals, and financial strain related to medical expenses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea380197f5e536590bfff63921854b917fd2f1b936433465ce157970a12a5982","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
