{"title":"Evaluating the drivers of B2B performance: An empirical analysis based on Alibaba","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306919","date":1720792800000,"content":"<p>by Miao Feng, Haoran Si, Yang Li, Junrui Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nThe rapid development of B2B has brought about fierce competition among suppliers, and how to gain customer attention and improve performance has become a common concern in academia and industry. This study examined the drivers and mechanisms of B2B performance from an enterprise capability perspective. We collected transaction and enterprise data from 325 suppliers on Alibaba 1688 platform and constructed a structural equation model (SEM). Results showed that supplier service capability, logistics capability, and production capacity all positively impacted B2B performance through the mediating role of customer attention. In addition, we found that service and logistics capabilities are more critical for attracting customer attention for Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) suppliers than for non-OEM suppliers. The findings contribute to understanding B2B commerce and provide constructive directions for B2B suppliers to improve their performance.","author":"Miao Feng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8ac1bd826fa8ef9d9ff203263834be291926d531bb5948c03342fcd248d2f05b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
