{"title":"Evaluation of biocontrol efficacy of rhizosphere <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> for management of <i>Phytophthora capsici</i> of pepper","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309705","date":1726840800000,"content":"<p>by Chenzhen Li, Xianghui Gao, Yunfeng Huo, Tahani A.

To explore the potential of rhizosphere soil microorganisms as biocontrol agents against pepper blight, a bacterial strain Pa608 was screened from rhizosphere soil of pepper and identified as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> through morphological characteristics and 16S rRNA sequences. The result showed that the strain Pa608 demonstrated antagonistic activity against <i>Phytophthora capsici</i>, effectively suppressing mycelial growth. The potted experiment showed a high control efficacy of 88.0%. Remarkably, the strain Pa608 also reduced the disease index of pepper blight in the field, resulting in control efficiencies of 74.9%. Moreover, the strain Pa608 also enhanced pepper plant height and yield. GC-MS analysis revealed the production of numerous secondary metabolites by the strain Pa608, with Î±-pinene displaying potent anti-oomycete activity by inhibiting <i>P</i>. <i>capsici</i> growth. In conclusion, <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> Pa608 exhibited high biocontrol activity against <i>P</i>. <i>capsici</i> and can be utilized for the management of <i>P</i>. <i>capsici</i> in pepper cultivation.","author":"Chenzhen Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9ff250514801dfb1ef59b56a91471b121ca5c94e5fe31b6ca690bdb84a687c27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
