{"title":"In Situ TEM Study and Control of Octahedral Units’ Migration in Rutile TiO2","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.799/7720036?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The advancement of ultra-small electronic and spintronic devices relies on high-quality semiconducting or magnetic thin films. Precise control of each atomic layer’s growth is essential to improve the quality of few-nm-thick films during material synthesis. This requires a deep understanding of the nanometer-scale material migration under different conditions. However, directly observing the motion of individual atomic units along the surface of crystalline materials in response to applied fields presents a significant challenge. Here, we used <span>in-situ</span> electrical biasing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to study the atomic units’ movements in rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film with nano-meter-width cracks under applied electric fields. Distinct materials migration processes were observed, different from previously observed electron-beam-radiolysis driven movements [<a href=\"#ozae044.799-B1\">1</a>]. These new observations obtained by operando TEM are promising for improving thin film synthesis and providing insights into atomic migration mechanisms in electronic devices.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4fc337a83e2a6a3b37b5b42e7d5484a7c98caafa469866f290debbf0d71247df","category":"Environment"}
