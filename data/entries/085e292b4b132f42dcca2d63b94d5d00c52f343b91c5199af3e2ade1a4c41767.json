{"title":"Dietary Vitamin D Intake in Premenopausal Moroccan Women: Food Sources, Socio-Demographic Determinants and Correlation with 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1606/v1","date":1726817544000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Women's reproductive and overall well-being are intricately associated to vitamin D levels. In Morocco, vitamin D deficiency is a major issue for premenopausal women, yet little data exists on their dietary intake of this nutrient. This study explores vitamin D dietary intake, socio-demographic determinants, and its correlation with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D3] in premenopausal Moroccan women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 355 women aged 18-49 in Meknes, Morocco, using validated questionnaires to assess dietary intake and sun exposure. Potential covariates such as physical activity and BMI were also assessed . Serum 25(OH)D was measured via chemiluminescence immunoassay. Chi-square tests and Spearman correlation were used to identify socio-demographic factors influencing vitamin D intake. Linear and multivariate regression analysis determined the main predictors of serum 25(OH)D levels. Results :The median (interquartile range) vitamin D dietary intake was 2.8 (2.7) µg/day , with less than 20% of women meeting the recommended 5 µg/day. Major dietary sources were fish (48%), dairy (24.3%), and meat (9.4%), with fortified foods contributing only for 7%. Lower intake was linked to younger age (p=0.004) and rural living (p=0.024). While no significant association was found between dietary intake and serum 25(OH)D ((β(SE): 0.155(0.094), p=0.340 ) , sun exposure positively predicted serum levels(β(SE): 0.343 (0.128), p=0.008) , and BMI negatively affected them (β(SE): -1.128 (0.337), p=0.001). Conclusions: Our findings highlight insufficient vitamin D intake among premenopausal Moroccan women, especially younger and rural women. Nutritional interventions are needed to address this deficiency, promoting better dietary habits, sun exposure, and healthy weight.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"085e292b4b132f42dcca2d63b94d5d00c52f343b91c5199af3e2ade1a4c41767","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
