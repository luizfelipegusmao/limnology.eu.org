{"title":"Factors in COVID-19 vaccine uptake in five racial/ethnic Colorado communities: A report from the Colorado CEAL project","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305160","date":1718200800000,"content":"<p>by Sarah E. Brewer, Kaitlyn B. Bertin, Krithika Suresh, Crystal LoudHawk-Hedgepeth, Montelle Tamez, Jenna E. Reno, Bethany M. Kwan, Donald E. Nease</p>\r\nPurpose <p>To understand motivators, concerns, and factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine initiation for adults in five racial/ethnic communities across Colorado.</p> Methods <p>Community-based data collectors surveyed participants from five Colorado communities (urban and rural Latina/o/x, urban Black, rural African American immigrant, and urban American Indian) about vaccine attitudes, intentions, and uptake from September to December 2021. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine factors associated with the primary outcome of COVID-19 vaccine “initiation.”</p> Results <p>Most participants (71.1%) reported having initiated COVID-19 vaccination; vaccine series completion was 65.1%. Both motivators and concerns about COVID-19 vaccines were prevalent. Vaccine hesitancy (OR: 0.41, 95% CI:0.32–0.53; p &lt; .001) and low perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination social norms (OR: 0.48, 95% CI:0.27–0.84; p = .01) were associated with vaccine initiation.</p> Conclusion <p>Despite the limitation of a moderate sample size, our findings support the need for further interventions to increase vaccination against COVID-19 by reducing vaccine hesitancy and improving perceived social norms of vaccination in underserved Colorado communities.</p> Implications <p>To improve trust in vaccines and promote vaccine uptake, community messaging should be tailored to vaccination motivators and concerns and demonstrate COVID-19 vaccination as the community default.</p>","author":"Sarah E.
