{"title":"The Usefulness of the Regression-Based Normed SKT Short Cognitive Performance Test in detecting Cognitive Impairment in a Community Sample","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1006/v1","date":1723599730000,"content":"(1) Background The SKT is a short cognitive performance test designed to assess impairments in memory and cognitive abilities such as attention and speed of information processing. In 2019, new regression-based norms for the English version of the SKT were calculated applying data from older cognitively healthy adults living in the US, Ireland and Australia (the norming sample) The study has two aims: to establish valid cut-offs for distinguishing between no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (1), and to cross-validate the new norms for detecting MCI and dementia (2) in a community sample of older adults with clinical diagnoses; (2)Methods: The validation sample included 142 older adults (mean age=87.7, SD=3.55) from the Sydney Memory and Aging Study (MAS Study). Participants were classified as having normal cognition, MCI, or dementia through a consensus diagnosis as well as by the SKT; (3)Results: The sensitivity of the SKT for the differentiation of cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia) from normal cognition was 80.6%. The convergence between the SKT and the consensus diagnoses was 60.1% for all three diagnostic groups. The correlation between the SKT and the Addenbrookeâ€™s Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III), a well validated measure of cognitive ability in older adults, was r = 0.3;. (4) Conclusions: In sum, it can be stated that the SKT is a valid tool for detecting early stages of cognitive impairment, performing very well in discriminating between no cognitive impairment and cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a026d1c6250cecfc8d624b003a66fe68f690b60b1dfb57942743f3809a0eaf0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
