However, the fundamental understanding of the varying mechanical properties exhibited by different compositions is still largely missing. Investigating the structure of BMGs in terms of structural heterogeneity, or medium-range ordering (MRO), and correlating it to the deformation behavior has been very challenging. Recently, 4D-STEM has evolved the way we perform what had previously been known as fluctuation microscopy [<a href=\"#ozae044.951-B1\">1</a>], and we have been able to successfully employ it to extract the hidden MRO symmetry information by means of angular correlation (AC) analysis conducted on 4D-STEM nanodiffraction patterns (Fig. 1a) [<a href=\"#ozae044.951-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.951-B3\">3</a>]. This enables us to acquire vital insights into the origin of the structural heterogeneity of amorphous materials and its relationship to the observed properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"43629d42d98ca7b934be60a1126b0bddbcadb64c24882a5c4f4f0285ef185be1","category":"Environment"}
