{"title":"The acute hypoalgesic effects of active head-mounted display virtual reality games","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308064","date":1723644000000,"content":"<p>by Keith E. Naugle, Xzaliya A. Cervantes, Carolyn L. Boone, Brandon Wind, Kelly M. Naugle</p>\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this study was to determine: (1) whether physically active virtual reality (VR) games exert an acute hypoaglesic effect on the thigh and bicep compared to a non-active VR game and an exercise only condition matched for exercise intensity in healthy individuals, and (2) whether movement variables during gameplay are associated with the hypoalgesic effect of the games. Twenty young adults completed five separate study sessions, with each session devoted to playing one head-mounted display VR game or stationary cycling for 15 minutes. The games included Holopoint at level 2 and level 3, Hot Squat, and Relax Walk. Pressure pain thresholds at the thigh and bicep were measured pre and post VR gameplay and cycling. Participants wore a heart rate monitor and accelerometers on the wrist and thigh during play to measure the intensity and quantity of movement. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that pressure pain thresholds on the bicep increased from pre to posttest for each condition. The results also revealed that pressure pain thresholds on the thigh increased only for the conditions eliciting the greatest cardiovascular response, which included Holopoint at level 3, Hot Squat, and cycling. Bivariate correlations indicated that moderate to vigorous physical activity of the thigh was associated with pain reduction at the thigh during Holopoint. These results revealed that active VR games and exercise exerted a more widespread hypoalgesic effect compared to the non-active VR game, which was likely driven in part by the intensity and quantity of movement during gameplay.","author":"Keith E.
