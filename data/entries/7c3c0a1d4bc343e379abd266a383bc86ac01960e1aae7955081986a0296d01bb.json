{"title":"Possible measure of soil factors in the Italian seismic code","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10518-024-02021-9","date":1727827200000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                  <p>The Italian seismic code provides a simplified approach to account for the effect of local seismostratigraphical configuration on the expected ground motion. This approach, common with other seismic codes, provides specific ‘soil factors’ as a function of a set of reference subsoil conditions (soil classes): these factors are considered in 1D subsoil configurations to modify the uniform probability hazard spectrum deduced from probabilistic seismic hazard at reference soil conditions. It is inferred that, to provide a coherent management of uncertainty affecting the response spectrum to be used for the design, the contribution of uncertainty affecting soil factors must be carefully considered to avoid biases in the hazard evaluation. In the present study, variability of soil factors representative of each soil class has been explored by numerical simulation relative to many seismostratigraphical configurations inferred from seismic microzonation studies available in Italy relative to 1689 municipalities. This analysis shows that variability of soil factors is of the same order of magnitude of variability affecting reference response spectra, which implies that the former cannot be neglected as presently happens in the common practice. It is also shown that neglecting this contribution can lead to underestimate the impact of subsoil configuration on the regularized response spectrum provided by the norm, in particular, in the short period range.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"7c3c0a1d4bc343e379abd266a383bc86ac01960e1aae7955081986a0296d01bb","category":"Environment"}
