{"title":"A Brief Review on the Cell Culture History: From Harrison to Organs-on-a-Chip","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0169/v1","date":1725341414000,"content":"This comprehensive overview of the historical milestones in cell culture underscores key breakthroughs that have shaped the field over time. It begins with Wilhelm Roux's seminal experiments in the 1880s, followed by the pioneering efforts of Ross Granville Harrison, who initiated groundbreaking experiments that fundamentally shaped the landscape of cell culture in the early 20th century. Carrel's influential contributions, notably the immortalization of chicken heart cells, mark a significant advancement in cell culture techniques. Holtfreter, Moscona, and Leighton introduced innovations such as 3D cell culture, laying the groundwork for further exploration. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cells by Takahashi and Yamanaka in 2006 was revolutionary, enabling the reprogramming of differentiated cells into a pluripotent state. Since then, recent innovations include spheroids, organoids, and organ-on-a-chip technologies, aiming to mimic the structure and function of tissues and organs in vitro, pushing the boundaries of biological modeling and disease understanding. In this review, we overview the history of cell culture shedding light on the main discoveries, pitfalls and hurdles that were overcome during the transition from 2D to 3D cell culture techniques. Finally, we discussed the future directions for cell culture research that may accelerate the development of more effective and personalized treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8d2de93300b9467940e4f9e9732f2301abb88dccdcf89571778d540bee47c81","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
