{"title":"A Sex‐Specific Trade‐Off Between Pesticide Resistance and Tolerance to Heat‐Induced Sterility in Tetranychus urticae","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.70014?af=R","date":1727334011000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Current pest management relies extensively on pesticide application worldwide, despite the frequent rise of pesticide resistance in crop pests. This is particularly worrisome because resistance is often not costly enough to be lost in populations after pesticide application, resulting in increased dependency on pesticide application. As climate warming increases, effort should be put into understanding how heat tolerance will affect the persistence of pesticide resistance in populations. To address this, we measured heat tolerance in two populations of the spider mite crop pest <i>Tetranychus urticae</i> that differ in the presence or absence of a target-site mutation conferring resistance to etoxazole pesticide. We found that developmental time and fertility, but not survival, were negatively affected by increasing temperatures in the susceptible population. Furthermore, we found no difference between resistant and susceptible populations in all life-history traits when both sexes developed at control temperature, nor when females developed at high temperature. Resistant heat-stressed males, in contrast, showed lower fertility than susceptible ones, indicating a sex-specific trade-off between heat tolerance and pesticide resistance. This suggests that global warming could lead to reduced pesticide resistance in natural populations. However, resistant females, being as affected by high temperature as susceptible individuals, may buffer the toll in resistant male fertility, and the shorter developmental time at high temperatures may accelerate adaptation to temperature, the pesticide or the cost thereof. Ultimately, the complex dynamic between these two factors will determine whether resistant populations can persist under climate warming.</p>","author":"Sofia G.
