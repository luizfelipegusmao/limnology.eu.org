{"title":"Compound Crises: A Review of the Impact of Emergencies and Disasters on Mental Health Services in Puerto Rico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0292/v1","date":1717592052000,"content":"Mental health in Puerto Rico is a complex and multifaceted issue that has been shaped by the islandâ€™s unique history, culture, and political status. Recent challenges, including disasters, economic hardships, and political turmoil, have significantly affected the mental well-being of the population coupled with the limitations in the accessibility of mental health services. Puerto Rico has fewer mental health professionals per capita than any other state or territory in the United States. This comprehensive review examines the impact of disasters on mental health and mental health services in Puerto Rico. Given the exodus of Puerto Ricans from the island, the review also provides an overview of mental health resources available on the island as well as the continental United States. The review identifies efforts to address mental health issues, with the intent of gaining a proper understanding of the available mental health services, key trends, as well as observable challenges and achievements within the mental health landscape of the Puerto Rican population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"08b1ed2dc51cae6da0dc115c2d1ec2ceedca6fe983f4838f71b9daeba35d2d5b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
