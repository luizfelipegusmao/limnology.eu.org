{"title":"Angle-Resolved Fluorescence of a Dye Coupled to a Plasmonic Nanohole Array","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1082/v1","date":1710855344000,"content":"Gold nanohole arrays are periodic metastructures gathering huge interest for biosensing applica-tions. The grating-like structure defines their plasmonic mode features and their angular disper-sion can be used to highlight efficiently their interaction with the fluorescence emission of a properly tuned fluorophore. Resorting to a properly tuned/engineered/optimised plasmonic na-nohole array and a commercial organic dye, we performed an accurate resolved angle-resolved optical characterization. The plasmonic fingerprints was consequently identified as a modification of the dye photoluminescence signal in terms of both spectral redistribution and enhancement. Interestingly, by analyzing the results, an advantageous measurement configuration can be iden-tified to better engineer a suitable platform for efficiency maximization in plasmon-enhanced flu-orescence-based applications. Therefore, the coupling mechanism with the plasmonic modes, and nanostructure properties can be carefully co-optimized.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"862c5eea984cdd1e52741d84ba8e9d54e52e843a976c19dbed314e3afe85ac83","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
