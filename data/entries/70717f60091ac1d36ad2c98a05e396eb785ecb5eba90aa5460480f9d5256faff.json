{"title":"Diffuse Neurofibroma of the Scalp Associated with Debilitating Headaches: A Case Report and Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1584/v1","date":1726804621000,"content":"Abstract: Neurofibroma is a type of benign tumor that affects the peripheral nerves. It can be classified into three subtypes: localized, diffuse, and plexiform, with localized being the most prevalent. Although uncommon, neurofibromas can appear as diffuse tumors that impact the skin and underlying tissues of the head, neck, and body in young individuals and children. Diffuse neurofibromas are characterized by thickened, indurated, and ill-defined skin lesions that often invade underlying tissues. We present a unique case of a 45-year-old Caucasian woman who developed debilitating headaches caused by a gradually enlarging diffuse neurofibroma on her scalp and a comprehensive review of diffuse neurofibroma and its differential diagnosis. Although diffuse neurofibromas are less common in middle-aged individuals, they should still be considered a possible diagnosis in infiltrative and indurated skin lesions. Identifying its characteristic histopathological findings to diagnose diffuse neurofibroma accurately is crucial since its clinical presentations can vary.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70717f60091ac1d36ad2c98a05e396eb785ecb5eba90aa5460480f9d5256faff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
