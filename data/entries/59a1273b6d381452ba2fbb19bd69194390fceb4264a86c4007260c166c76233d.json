Previous research has found that high foliar phosphorus concentrations reduce the level of the alkaloid ergovaline, thereby reducing the endophyte-mediated herbivore resistance. Yet, the impact of phosphorus on ergovaline biosynthesis versus its influence on endophyte growth and synthesis of other fungal alkaloids remains unresolved. Our objective was to elucidate these relationships.\n\nWe grew endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic <i>Festuca arundinacea</i> plants and fertilised them with different doses of phosphorus. Later, half of the plants from each treatment were challenged with larvae of the generalist chewing insect <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i>. We assessed the relationships between foliar phosphorus levels, fungal mycelium and alkaloid concentrations, as well as their impacts on larvae performance, herbivore-caused damage and plant biomass.\n\nEndophyte mycelial biomass in plant tissue was found to be independent of foliar phosphorus concentration. The alkaloids lolines and peramine showed a linear relationship with mycelial biomass but no correlation with foliar phosphorus. Surprisingly, high ergovaline concentrations were positively associated with an interaction between endophyte mycelial biomass and foliar phosphorus concentration. Although herbivory increased loline concentration, only high concentrations of ergovaline and peramine were related to reduced <i>S. frugiperda</i> larvae weight gain. However, endophyte presence did not reduce herbivory damage on plants.\n\nContrary to expectation, we did not find a negative but a positive association between concentrations of foliar phosphorus and ergovaline alkaloid, through its interaction with endophyte mycelial biomass. Alternatively, our findings suggest that phosphorus plays a crucial role in modulating the <i>Epichloë</i>-mediated defensive mutualism, primarily through its effects on ergovaline rather than on endophyte concentration or production of other alkaloids.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/07/03/phosphorus-modulates-the-defense-provided-by-a-symbiotic-fungus-in-grasses/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"F.
