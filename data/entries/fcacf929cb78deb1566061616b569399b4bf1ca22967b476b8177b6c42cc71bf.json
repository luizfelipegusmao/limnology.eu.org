{"title":"Biophysics of ACL Injuries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0988/v2","date":1729243427000,"content":"Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries rank among the most prevalent and severe types of injuries, significantly impacting both athletes and non-athletes alike. These injuries not only result in immediate physical impairment, such as intense pain, substantial swelling, and a marked loss of mobility, but also carry long-term health consequences that can alter a person's quality of life. Chronic pain, persistent instability, and an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis are among the lasting effects that can follow an ACL injury. An in-depth understanding of the biophysics behind ACL injuries is paramount for devising effective prevention and treatment protocols. Biophysics, which combines principles from physics with biological systems, provides crucial insights into the mechanical and structural integrity of the ACL and its susceptibility to injury under various conditions. This systematic review aims to collate and synthesize the current knowledge surrounding the biophysical mechanisms that underlie ACL injuries.\nThe review encompasses a range of factors, including the biomechanical forces that place stress on the ligament, anatomical structures that may predispose individuals to injury, and physiological conditions that affect ligament health and resilience. Each of these factors plays a crucial role in the incidence and severity of ACL injuries. Biomechanical forces, for example, can involve sudden changes in direction or impact during physical activity, leading to excessive stress on the ACL. Anatomical factors might include variations in bone structure or ligament alignment that inherently increase the risk of injury. Additionally, physiological conditions such as muscle strength, flexibility, and overall ligament health can influence the likelihood and extent of an ACL injury.\nThe findings of this review underscore the necessity of adopting integrated approaches in both injury prevention and rehabilitation. Such approaches must consider the multifaceted nature of ACL injuries, involving not only mechanical and anatomical aspects but also physiological and possibly even genetic factors. By emphasizing a multi-faceted understanding, interventions can be more effectively tailored to address the complex interplay of elements that contribute to ACL injuries. This holistic approach can lead to better outcomes for those at risk of or recovering from ACL injuries, enhancing the efficacy of prevention strategies and rehabilitation protocols.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fcacf929cb78deb1566061616b569399b4bf1ca22967b476b8177b6c42cc71bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
