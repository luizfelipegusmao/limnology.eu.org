{"title":"Vertical and horizontal variations in phytoplankton chlorophyll a in response to a looping super typhoon","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12651?af=R","date":1722319809000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Previous studies suggested that the increase in surface chlorophyll <i>a</i> (Chl <i>a</i>) is due to nutrient upwelling or to the upward mixing of the subsurface Chl <i>a</i> maximum layer under the influence of tropical cyclones, while often ignoring the influence of the subsurface Chl <i>a</i> minimum layer and horizontal advection on Chl <i>a</i>. In this study, we show the important roles of the upward mixing of the subsurface Chl <i>a</i> minimum layer, horizontal advection, as well as the upwelling of the subsurface Chl <i>a</i> maximum layer, taking a looping super typhoon “Saola” in the northwest Pacific in August 2023 as an example. The temporal and spatial changes of Chl <i>a</i> and its physical properties were investigated by combining satellite, Argo, reanalysis, and model data. The results indicate that the combined effects of the upwelling of the subsurface Chl <i>a</i> maximum layer caused by wind stress curls and concurrent near-surface wind mixing were responsible for the surface Chl <i>a</i> increase in the looping area during the typhoon, while the 13% increase in the depth-integrated Chl <i>a</i> after the typhoon is mainly due to the nutrients brought by upwelling and subsequent biochemical processes. In the edge area affected by the typhoon, the surface Chl <i>a</i> decrease during the typhoon was mainly due to the upward mixing of the subsurface Chl <i>a</i> minimum layer (the effect of upwelling in this area is relatively weak). Furthermore, the horizontal advection led to a continuous surface Chl <i>a</i> decrease in the edge area after the typhoon. These findings could enhance understanding of Chl <i>a</i> dynamics post-tropical cyclones, aiding marine ecosystem prediction.</p>","author":"Ying Chen, \nHui Zhao, \nGuoqi Han","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"483837404a651916bc0fc2a986656bb768431b5eda97cb95890947a6f32d3b51","entryHash":"604041e1a6b168167ec60407da5a77d1e837fb44600e247d5f175620266aea2a","category":"Environment"}
