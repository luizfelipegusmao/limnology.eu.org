{"title":"A Versatile 100 Hz Laser System with Few-Cycle and TW Pulses for Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0243/v1","date":1727949973000,"content":"We developed a versatile 100 Hz laser system based on negatively and positively chirped pulse amplification. The few-cycle output provides pulses with 7.1 fs and 0.25 mJ, while the power output supports 26 fs pulses with 50 mJ. The energy as well as the pulse duration stability of the system is below 1%, while the pointing stability is within 25% of the diffraction limited spot size. We also show applications in high repetition rate target development and preparation for a laser-generated X-ray source for industrial CT imaging.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c1153d04881b8fc2e3119f25b6dab9edac4291b665c2d0fbf78931e24f1bbc61","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
