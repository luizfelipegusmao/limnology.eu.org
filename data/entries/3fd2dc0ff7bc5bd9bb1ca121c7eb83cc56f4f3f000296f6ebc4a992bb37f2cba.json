By conducting both a precipitation gradient experiment and a long-term observational study in the Inner Mongolia grassland, we addressed that f<sub>BNPP</sub> is not constant but decreased linearly along the precipitation gradient, this can increase the inaccuracy of grassland carbon estimation. Thus, under the ongoing climate change scenario, variability in f<sub>BNPP</sub> should be incorporated into grassland carbon sink estimation; failure to do so will lead to underestimation or overestimation of the carbon sink in drought or wet years.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The fraction of net primary productivity (NPP) allocated to belowground organs (<i>f</i>\n<sub>BNPP</sub>) in grasslands is a critical parameter in global carbon cycle models; moreover, understanding the effect of precipitation changes on this parameter is vital to accurately estimating carbon sequestration in grassland ecosystems. However, how <i>f</i>\n<sub>BNPP</sub> responds to temporal precipitation changes along a gradient from extreme drought to extreme wetness, remains unclear, mainly due to the lack of long-term data of belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) and the fact that most precipitation experiments did not have a gradient from extreme drought to extreme wetness. Here, by conducting both a precipitation gradient experiment (100–500 mm) and a long-term observational study (34 years) in the Inner Mongolia grassland, we showed that <i>f</i>\n<sub>BNPP</sub> decreased linearly along the precipitation gradient from extreme drought to extreme wetness due to stronger responses in aboveground NPP to drought and wet conditions than those of BNPP. Our further meta-analysis in grasslands worldwide also indicated that <i>f</i>\n<sub>BNPP</sub> increased when precipitation decreased, and the vice versa. Such a consistent pattern of <i>f</i>\n<sub>BNPP</sub> response suggests that plants increase the belowground allocation with decreasing precipitation, while increase the aboveground allocation with increasing precipitation. Thus, the linearly decreasing response pattern in <i>f</i>\n<sub>BNPP</sub> should be incorporated into models that forecast carbon sequestration in grassland ecosystems; failure to do so will lead to underestimation of the carbon stock in drought years and overestimation of the carbon stock in wet years in grasslands.</p>","author":"Jiamei Sun, \nYue Yan, \nBin Zhang, \nWei Liu, \nShande Dou, \nXiaoliang Wang, \nJianhui Huang, \nDima Chen, \nChanghui Wang, \nXingguo Han, \nQingmin Pan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"3fd2dc0ff7bc5bd9bb1ca121c7eb83cc56f4f3f000296f6ebc4a992bb37f2cba","category":"Environment"}
