Both compounds have a very simple structure, with litharge having a tetragonal cell (P4/nmm) and massicot having an orthorhombic cell (Pbma). α – β transformation usually occurs at around 490 <sup>o</sup>C. However, β-PbO can also exist at room temperature [<a href=\"#ozae044.609-B1\">1</a>]. Depending on the synthesis parameters, a larger yield of either litharge or massicot can be obtained using specific wet chemical routes. Many reports have mentioned an incommensurate phase transition of the litharge at low temperatures (≈ 208 K) [<a href=\"#ozae044.609-B2\">2</a>]. A wide variety of chemical oscillations exist between the litharge and massicot with possible chaotic states [<a href=\"#ozae044.609-B3\">3</a>]. In this study, we have synthesised PbO using a wet chemical route, which yielded mixed α and β phases. A detailed TEM study has been done to understand these nanosheets' structure and crystallographic features.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"42d32a720fcc92bbccc9b3faafa54ae99f804e3eb4342f9be4597b4630e97f7f","category":"Environment"}
