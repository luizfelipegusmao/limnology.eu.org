{"title":"Retrieval-Augmented Medical Large Language Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1658/v1","date":1729588675000,"content":"Biomedical large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides, but their reliance on external retrieval mechanisms presents challenges in accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these issues, we propose MedRAG-Refine, a generative LLM designed specifically for the biomedical domain. Our model integrates a two-stage fine-tuning process, incorporating a self-reflection mechanism to improve reasoning quality. We evaluate our model on MedQA, MedMCQA, and MMLU datasets, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, human evaluations confirm the enhanced accuracy and reasoning quality of our model in real-world medical tasks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d18d00ac8814633cbdadbb8fe2307001ad09630f25b08f4b8998b0f2af3a14f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
