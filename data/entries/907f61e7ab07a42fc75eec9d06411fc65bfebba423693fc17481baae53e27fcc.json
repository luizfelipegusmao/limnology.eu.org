A better understanding of water sources can help improve models and ultimately contribute to more accurate forecasts of water availability, food production, carbon sequestration or ecosystem status. Over the years, several methods have been developed and applied to water source partitioning, and Gai et al.

For that study area, the combination of <sup>2</sup>H and <sup>18</sup>O with the MixSIAR mixing model is recommended. Importantly, the systematic assessment provides a framework that can be applied to select a suitable combination of tracers and mixing models for different ecosystems and climate zones.
