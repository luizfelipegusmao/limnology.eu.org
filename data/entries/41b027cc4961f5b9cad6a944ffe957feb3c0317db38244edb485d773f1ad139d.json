Consuming food generates odor–taste associations that shape our perceptual judgements of chemosensory stimuli, such as their intensity, familiarity, and pleasantness. The process of making consummatory choices relies on a network of brain regions to integrate and process chemosensory information. The mediodorsal thalamus is a higher-order thalamic nucleus involved in many experience-dependent chemosensory behaviors, including olfactory attention, odor discrimination, and the hedonic perception of flavors. Recent research has shown that neurons in the mediodorsal thalamus represent the sensory and affective properties of experienced odors, tastes, and odor–taste mixtures. However, its role in guiding consummatory choices remains unclear. To investigate the influence of the mediodorsal thalamus in the consummatory choice for experienced odors, tastes, and odor–taste mixtures, we pharmacologically inactivated the mediodorsal thalamus during 2-bottle brief-access tasks. We found that inactivation altered the preference for specific odor–taste mixtures, significantly reduced consumption of the preferred taste and increased within-trial sampling of both chemosensory stimulus options. Our results show that the mediodorsal thalamus plays a crucial role in consummatory decisions related to chemosensory preference and attention.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"41b027cc4961f5b9cad6a944ffe957feb3c0317db38244edb485d773f1ad139d","category":"Environment"}
