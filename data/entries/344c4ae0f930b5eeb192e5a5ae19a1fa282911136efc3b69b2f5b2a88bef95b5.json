{"title":"Difficulties associated with the interpretation of postmortem toxicology","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/6/405/7690001?rss=1","date":1717804800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>While postmortem (PM) toxicology results provide valuable information towards ascertaining both the cause and manner of death in coronial cases, there are also significant difficulties associated with the interpretation of PM drug levels. Such difficulties are influenced by several pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors including PM redistribution, diffusion, site-to-site variability in drug levels, different drug properties and metabolism, bacterial activity, genetic polymorphisms, tolerance, resuscitation efforts, underlying conditions, and the toxicity profile of cases (i.e. single- or mixed-drug toxicity). A large body of research has been dedicated for better understanding and even quantifying the influence of these factors on PM drug levels. For example, several investigative matrices have been developed as potential indicators of PM redistribution, but they have limited practical value. Reference tables of clinically relevant therapeutic, toxic, and potentially fatal drug concentrations have also been compiled, but these unfortunately do not provide reliable reference values for PM toxicology. More recent research has focused on developing databases of peripheral PM drug levels for a variety of case-types to increase transferability to real-life cases and improve interpretations. Changes to drug levels after death are inevitable and unavoidable. As such, guidelines and practices will continue to evolve as we further our understanding of such phenomena.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"344c4ae0f930b5eeb192e5a5ae19a1fa282911136efc3b69b2f5b2a88bef95b5","category":"Environment"}
