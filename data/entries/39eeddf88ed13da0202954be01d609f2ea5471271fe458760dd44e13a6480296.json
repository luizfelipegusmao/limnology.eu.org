{"title":"Analyzing green and sustainable land use in China’s coal cities: Insights from industrial transformation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301836","date":1713967200000,"content":"<p>by Hongfeng Zhang, Yinuo Zhao, Fangteng Yang</p>\r\n\r\nDriven by the goal of achieving sustainable development and carbon neutrality. Addressing environmental pollution and remediating land damage have become critical challenges in resource-based cities and regions with low land use efficiency. As a response, this study focuses on the 23 provinces where China’s coal resource-based cities are situated. Utilizing data from 2014 to 2020, this research employs the SBM-Undesirable model, which considers undesirable outputs in efficiency calculations, and the Tobit regression test. It aims to explore the spatio-temporal variations in industrial transformation within resource-based cities and its impact on the efficiency of green space utilization. Furthermore, it analyzes the characteristics and the extent of the influence of factors such as industrial structure adjustments on urban land use efficiency, maximizing the output of land as a factor of production. The results show that: (1) Over the 7-year period studied, China consistently made nationwide adjustments to land area and land use structure to meet the needs of urban development (2) The regression test results show that the industrial transformation of resource-based cities can promote the improvement of green space utilization efficiency. The positive influence coefficient is 0.064 and is significant at a 1% level. (3) Environmental regulation, government expenditure, international trade, and green cover play a positive role in promoting green land use. The study provides valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners seeking to foster sustainable development in resource-based cities.","author":"Hongfeng Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"39eeddf88ed13da0202954be01d609f2ea5471271fe458760dd44e13a6480296","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
