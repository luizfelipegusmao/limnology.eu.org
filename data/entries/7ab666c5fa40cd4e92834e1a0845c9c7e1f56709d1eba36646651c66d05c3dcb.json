This approach facilitates comprehensive visualization of both internal and external features of the sample and allows for the assembly of image stacks to generate accurate 3D representations. The capability for 3D reconstruction offered by FIB-SEM is invaluable for elucidating intricate details of the subject under study [<a href=\"#ozae044.899-B1\">1</a>]. Porous particles play pivotal roles across a spectrum of applications including dental care [<a href=\"#ozae044.899-B2\">2</a>], drug delivery [<a href=\"#ozae044.899-B3\">3</a>], and diagnostics [<a href=\"#ozae044.899-B4\">4</a>], etc. Their unique morphology and porosity are paramount for their functional efficacy. Hence, there exists a pressing demand for precise and accessible methods to visualize 3D structures of porous particles. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology reliant on 3D FIB-SEM tomography for visualizing porous silica shells. Our proposed method promises to offer novel insights into the evaluation of porous materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7ab666c5fa40cd4e92834e1a0845c9c7e1f56709d1eba36646651c66d05c3dcb","category":"Environment"}
