{"title":"Challenges and Advances in Cervical Cancer Prevention for HIV-Positive Individuals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2238/v3","date":1727173808000,"content":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a well-known cause of cervical cancer, with HIV infection exacerbating the prevalence of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). ART has been shown to reduce the likelihood of developing squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) and HR-HPV prevalence, although its impact on invasive cervical cancer remains inconclusive. In a study in Accra, 250 sexually active HIV-positive women exhibited a high HPV prevalence, emphasising the need for regular screening. HPV testing, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), and cytology-based tests are primary screening methods, each with specific advantages and limitations. Cervical cancer rates in sub-Saharan Africa are alarmingly high, necessitating targeted vaccination and prevention strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbd7f80a213de8bb355b796e2f658c48599a2c25100ed08738640412f901ca52","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
