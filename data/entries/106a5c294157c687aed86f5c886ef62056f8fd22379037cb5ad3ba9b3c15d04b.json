{"title":"Research on the Effective Use of Energy-Saving Building Materials in Vietnam","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1683/v1","date":1714041716000,"content":"Low energy consumption is a significant contribution of new and retrofitted buildings that place an emphasis on energy efficiency. Although the mandatory requirements of the U-factor and R-value are described in the Vietnamese National Technical Regulation on the energy efficiency of buildingsâ€”QCVN09:2017/BXD, these values are not widely publicized, leading to designers facing difficulties when choosing suitable materials at the design stage. This study focuses on the method used to declare the heat transfer values of building materials based on the energy labeling process in order to create an energy labeling program for building materials. To accomplish this objective, criteria and labeling procedures for windows, doors, walls, and building roofs have been developed. In addition, a case study of insulation product labeling was used to evaluate the applicability of the developed labeling program in the implementation phase.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"106a5c294157c687aed86f5c886ef62056f8fd22379037cb5ad3ba9b3c15d04b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
