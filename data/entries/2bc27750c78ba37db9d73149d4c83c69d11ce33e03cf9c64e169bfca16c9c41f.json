{"title":"Melatonin Receptor Expression in Primary Uveal Melanoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0594/v1","date":1720422283000,"content":"Uveal melanoma (UM) poses a significant clinical challenge due to its high metastasis rate and poor prognosis. Melatonin, noted for its anti-cancer properties in various malignancies, including cutaneous melanoma, shows promise in UM treatment. This study aimed to evaluate melatonin receptor expression in primary UM and its association with UM-related mortality and prognostic factors. Immunohistochemical analysis of 47 primary UM tissues showed low expression of MTNR1A and MTNR1B receptors, with MTNR1A significantly higher in patients who succumbed to UM. Analysis of TCGA data from 80 UM patients revealed RNA expression for MTNR1A, RORα, and NQO2, but not MTNR1B or GPR50. Higher MTNR1A RNA levels were observed in patients with a BAP1 mutation, and higher NQO2 RNA levels were noted in patients with the epithelioid tumor cell type. However, Kaplan-Meier analysis did not show distinct survival probabilities based on receptor expression. The study concludes that UM clinical samples express melatonin receptors, suggesting a potential mechanism for melatonin's anti-cancer effects. Despite finding higher MTNR1A expression in patients who died of UM, no survival curve differences were observed. Further research is needed to explore additional mechanisms of melatonin’s oncostatic effects, including its antioxidant properties and immune modulation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2bc27750c78ba37db9d73149d4c83c69d11ce33e03cf9c64e169bfca16c9c41f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
