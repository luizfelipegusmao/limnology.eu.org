{"title":"Navigating Purchase Intentions: The Influence of Reviewersâ€™ Comments on Consumer Behavior","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0903/v1","date":1715667628000,"content":"For most people, using social media to research products has become common. Despite previous research, there is a gap in understanding reviewers' product-related comments and how they lead to purchase intentions. In terms of contributions, this study analyses people's dependence on social media for product information in purchase intention while considering the moderating impact of risk and trust on the link between purchase intention and social media. The data were collected quantitatively using surveys. The sample consisted of 384 students. The study hypotheses were tested using the PROCESS macro after exploratory factor analysis and correlation analysis were conducted. Among those surveyed, it was confirmed that most people sought product-related comments on social media when seeking information about a product they might be interested in purchasing. It was also observed that the risk factor reduced the impact of other variables in the model presented in this study. In conclusion, this investigation is more reliable, and its outcomes benefit scholars, supervisors, merchants, and webmasters, for instance, in establishing a study for future research efforts and providing practical guidance that could boost promotional efforts and marketing activities, especially in this era of artificial intelligence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07c4e6b0235cc0cfa41ba3b7ffc2dabcd4de9b78fa2d94e6252821a45267d3f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
