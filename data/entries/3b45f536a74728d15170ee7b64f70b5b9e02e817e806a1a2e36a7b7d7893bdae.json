{"title":"GnRH Vaccine could Suppress Serum Testosterone in Stallion Mules","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0791/v1","date":1710342781000,"content":"Stallion mules have been used as working equids in several countries. Aggressiveness, under the influence of testosterone, resulted in the necessity for surgical castration before work training. The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccine may be an alternative method for immunocastration in mules. The objectives were to evaluate the effect of GnRH vaccine on anti-GnRH antibody production, serum testosterone level, clinical adverse effects, and behavior toward human manipulation. Twenty-five mules were separated into 3 groups: Control-intact, Control-castrated, and Treatment. Treatment was further divided into subgroups according to condition (intact or unilateral cryptorchid) and age. Treatment received 195 Âµg GnRH vaccine intramuscularly at week 0, 4, and 8. Anti-GnRH antibody increased at week 6 and 10, then gradually decreased to baseline at week 22. Treatment-intact-young had the highest anti-GnRH antibody, resulting in lower serum testosterone levels during week 2-6 and 12-16 compared to Control-intact. Subcutaneous edema adjacent to the injection site was detected only in Treatment-intact after booster vaccination. During week 6-22, the behavioral scores of Treatment significantly changed toward at ease with human contact compared to a score before vaccination. In conclusion, mules responded to GnRH vaccine, which could temporarily suppress testosterone for up to 16 weeks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b45f536a74728d15170ee7b64f70b5b9e02e817e806a1a2e36a7b7d7893bdae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
