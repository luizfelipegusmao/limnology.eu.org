This study offers a comprehensive analysis of ccRCC by leveraging both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data, with a specific aim to unravel the complexities of sphingolipid metabolism and the intricate dynamics within the tumor microenvironment (TME). By examining ccRCC samples sourced from public databases, our investigation delves deep into the genetic and transcriptomic landscape of this cancer type. Employing advanced analytical techniques, we have identified pivotal patterns in gene expression and cellular heterogeneity, with a special focus on the roles and interactions of various immune cells within the TME. Significantly, our research has unearthed insights into the dynamics of sphingolipid metabolism in ccRCC, shedding light on its potential implications for tumor progression and strategies for immune evasion. A novel aspect of this study is the development of a risk score model designed to enhance prognostic predictions for ccRCC patients, which is currently pending external validation to ascertain its clinical utility. Despite its contributions, the study is mindful of its limitations, including a reliance on observational data from public sources and a primary focus on RNA sequencing data, which may constrain the depth and generalizability of the findings. The study does not encompass critical aspects, such as protein expression, posttranslational modifications, and comprehensive metabolic profiles. Moreover, its retrospective design underscores the necessity for future prospective studies to solidify these preliminary conclusions. Our findings illuminate the intricate interplay between genetic alterations, sphingolipid metabolism, and immune responses in ccRCC. This research not only enhances our understanding of the molecular foundations of ccRCC but also paves the way for the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment modalities. The study underlines the importance of cautious interpretation of results and champions ongoing research using diverse methodologies to thoroughly comprehend and effectively combat this formidable cancer type.</p>","author":"Dongdong Xie, \nZhitao Han, \nYu Wang, \nHaoyu Shi, \nXiang Wu, \nJiaqing Wu, \nYingbo Dai","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"a3c47979143737aa1e651f21dee04b589d3e867b73b03abc80d58652395fa506","category":"Environment"}
