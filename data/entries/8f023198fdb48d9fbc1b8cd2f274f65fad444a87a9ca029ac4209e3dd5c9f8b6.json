{"title":"Numerical Simulation Analysis of Turbulent Pulsation Drag Reduction at Different Intervals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1706/v1","date":1721666355000,"content":"The shear stress generated by wall turbulence is the main cause of wall friction resistance in turbulent flow through pipes. This paper investigates the impact of inserting rest periods (regions of constant Reynolds number) within the pulsating operating cycle of velocity on the fully turbulent flow at large time-averaged Reynolds numbers, using the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method. The study aims to explore the effect of increasing rest periods within pulsations on drag resistance. The dimensionless shear stress and drag reduction rates during different time periods of rest were analyzed. Numerical simulation results indicate that the pulsating velocity operation mode does not necessarily lead to drag reduction; it may even result in increased resistance. Inserting rest periods within the pulsation cycle can achieve drag reduction effects, with the maximum drag reduction rate reaching 21.8\\%. Comparisons with experimental data and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) from the literature validate the feasibility of using the LES method for pipe pulsating operation modes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f023198fdb48d9fbc1b8cd2f274f65fad444a87a9ca029ac4209e3dd5c9f8b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
