{"title":"1-Methylcyclopropene and Bacillus Treatment Affects Blueberry Storage Quality and Antioxidant Levels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1792/v1","date":1721780861000,"content":"Blueberries are rich in a variety of functional substances and have high nutritional and health values, but they are not resistant to decline during fresh storage. Here, the effects of six Bacillus species on storage quality of, and antioxidant levels in, the southern highbush blueberry ‘O'Neal’ fruit were investigated. Bacillus treatments reduced the fruit decay rate, slowed fruit quality decline, inhibited malondialdehyde accumulation, and increased superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activity levels. Bacillus altitudinis Y-14 had the best effect overall. Further, the effects of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), B. altitudinis Y-14, and 1-MCP+B. altitudinis Y-14 treatments on the storage quality and antioxidant of rabbiteye blueberry ‘Brightwell’ fruit were investigated, and each treatment effectively reduced the decay rate and weight loss of fruit. When stored for 25 days, the decay rate of the 1-MCP+B. altitudinis Y-14 group was only 8.33%, significantly lower than that of the control. The three treatments delayed the fruit quality decline, inhibited malondialdehyde accumulation, and increased superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activity levels. The 1-MCP+B. altitudinis Y-14 treatment had the best effect. Thus, the combined 1-MCP and B. altitudinis Y-14 treatment may be an effective way to improve the storage quality and extend the storage period of blueberries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1bc8cdbf67bc730650dab09b49dcf932e64e10ba7d0a3feffee39e5e7ae3078b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
