{"title":"Optimization of “vehicle-UAV” joint distribution routing for cold chain logistics considering risk of epidemic spreading and green cost","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306127","date":1719410400000,"content":"<p>by Gang Liu, Qian Liu, Hao Guo, Ming Xiang, Jinyan Sang</p>\r\n\r\nTo address the epidemic, such as COVID-19, the government may implement the home quarantine policy for the infected residents. The logistics company is required to control the risk of epidemic spreading while delivering goods to residents. In this case, the logistics company often uses vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for delivery. This paper studies the distribution issue of cold chain logistics by integrating UAV logistics with epidemic risk management innovatively. At first, a \"vehicle-UAV\" joint distribution mode including vehicles, small UAVs and large UAVs, is proposed. The green cost for vehicles and UAVs is calculated, respectively. The formula for infection risk due to large numbers of residents gathering at distribution centers to pick up goods is then derived. Furthermore, based on the control of infection risk, an optimization model is developed to minimize the total logistics cost. A modified ant colony algorithm is designed to solve the model. The numerical results show that the maximum acceptable risk and the crowd management level of distribution centers both have significant effects on the distribution network, logistics cost and number of new infections. Our study provides a new management method and technical idea for ensuring the needs of residents during the epidemic.","author":"Gang Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3d233a858a0c4ae03401a94d8c56df1030fdeb66cbfed46882b6ce6fe27fa9cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
