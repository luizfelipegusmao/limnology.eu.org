{"title":"Rotating Droplet Hydrodynamic Electrochemistry for Water Toxicity Bioassay Based on an Electron-Transfer Mediator","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1337/v1","date":1718851405000,"content":"An electrochemical bioassay based on the rotating droplet electrochemistry by using electron transfer mediator was developed for the evaluation of a wide variety of pollutants such as antibiotics, heavy metals and pesticides in the water environment. Ferricyanide was used as electron transfer mediator for obtaining the catalytic response of Escherichia coli. The electrochemical response of E.coli was measured via hydrodynamic chronoamperometry in a microdroplet on a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE). The constructed electrode system successfully evaluate the catalytic response of E.coli solution in presence of ferricyanide. The assay for antibiotic toxicity on E.coli was carried out. The EC50 for ampicillin, sulfamonomethoxine, chlorotetracycline, tetracycline and oxytetracycline valuated by the pre-incubation method were 0.26, 0.77, 5.25, 18.5, 19.0 ÂµM, respectively. The toxicity order was ampicillin &amp;gt; sulfamonomethoxine &amp;gt; chlorotetracycline &amp;gt; tetracycline&amp;gt;oxytetracycline. The proposed method can be used to evaluate the antibiotic toxicities in different real sample, such as pond water, powder and raw milk. Recoveries were found in the range 90 and 99%. The developed methods do not require additional incubation time to evaluate toxicity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d20759d2e7de010f4b9cecab3035534ee282384267274a83f42797c4ca22da8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
