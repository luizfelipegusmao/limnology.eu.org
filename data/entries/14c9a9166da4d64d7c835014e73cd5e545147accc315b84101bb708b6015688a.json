{"title":"Synthesis of Patchouli Biomass Based (&alpha;-Fe2O3, &gamma;-Fe2O3, Fe3O4)/Activated Biochar Composite for Water Environment Remediation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1020/v1","date":1723603768000,"content":"Biochar is a porous material produced by pyrolisis of biomass and can be modified using metal oxide to improve its adsorption performance, especially toward organics substances. The activated biochar was synthesized from patchouli biomass to study effect of calcination temperature on both structural properties and paracetamol drug adsorption of the composite was studied. Some process routes were conducted, including the patchouli biomass pyrolysis using CoCl2 activator, the activated biochar impregnation using 0.1 M FeCl3 solutions, biochar-FeCl3 calcination at various temperatures (400, 600, 800 oC) in the almost closed porcelain crucible, product characterizations using X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectrometry, and paracetamol adsorption test at various concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 ppm). The paracetamol concentrations were analyzed using UV-Vis spectrophotometry at 243 nm. The adsorption data was treated using Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) models. The product diffractograms indicated α-Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3, FeFe2O4 beside the carbon turbostratic structure. The metal oxide peak heights increased by increasing of the temperature. FTIR spectra significantly started to change at 600 oC. Adsorption test of paracetamol gave the highest adsorption capacity of 56.37 mg/g at 800 oC (Langmuir model) with correlation coefficient of 0.964. The highest adsorption energy was achieved at 800 oC, i.e 530.33 J/mol (physical adsorption) with a dimensionless factor, the RL value of 0.86 (favorable adsorption), and the n constant of 1.58 (favorable adsorption).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"14c9a9166da4d64d7c835014e73cd5e545147accc315b84101bb708b6015688a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
