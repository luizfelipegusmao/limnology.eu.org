{"title":"Text Analytics on YouTube Comments for Food Products","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1691/v1","date":1714112137000,"content":"YouTube is a very popular social media platform in todayâ€™s digital landscape. The primary \nfocus of this study is to explore the underlying sentiment in user comments on food-related videos \non YouTube, specifically within two pivotal food product categories: Plant-Based and Hedonic. \nOur research involved labelling comments using sentiment lexicons such as TextBlob and VADER. \nFurthermore, the sentiments of the comments were classified using advanced Machine Learning \n(ML) algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, \nLogistic Regression, and XGBoost. The evaluation of these models encompassed key macro average \nmetrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. Results from VADER showcased a high \naccuracy level, with SVM achieving 93% accuracy in the plant-based dataset and 96% in the hedonic \ndataset. In addition to sentiment analysis, we delved into user interactions within the two datasets, \nmeasuring crucial metrics such as views, likes, comments, and engagement rate. The findings \nilluminate significantly higher levels of views, likes, and comments in the hedonic food dataset, but \nthe plant-based dataset maintains a superior overall engagement rate.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"533cd5158713259ceb5cf4e56341679510d69425ef6569b08f4b6f5ed330054d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
