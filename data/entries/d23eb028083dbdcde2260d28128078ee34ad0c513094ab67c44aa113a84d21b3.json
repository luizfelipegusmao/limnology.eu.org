{"title":"Experimental Verification of a Two-Motor-Two-Pump Motor-Controlled Hydraulic Cylinder with Throttle-Free Passive Load-Holding Capability in Four-Quadrant Operations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1273/v1","date":1718873260000,"content":"In a motor-controlled hydraulic cylinder (MCC), the two chambers of the cylinder are directly connected to single or multiple fixed-displacement hydraulic pumps driven by electric servo motors. In contrast to a valve-controlled cylinder, an MCC does not have valve throttling, resulting in an improved system energy efficiency. Among various MCC topologies, the two-motor-two-pump (2M2P) MCC distinguishes itself through several notable advantages, including precise cylinder pressure control and eliminating mode switch oscillations. Nevertheless, there are remaining challenges in fully realizing its operations across four quadrants and establishing an effective load-holding function within these operations. This study bridges this gap by implementing a 2M2P MCC prototype on a laboratory knuckle boom crane, enabling operation across all four quadrants. Experimental results indicate that position tracking errors remain within Â±2.5 mm across three cases. Furthermore, smooth intersection of cylinder bore side and rod side pressures is observed during transitions between quadrants. In conclusion, the proposed 2M2P MCC demonstrates seamless operation throughout all quadrants, with the load-holding function smoothly activating and deactivating in all four quadrants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d23eb028083dbdcde2260d28128078ee34ad0c513094ab67c44aa113a84d21b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
