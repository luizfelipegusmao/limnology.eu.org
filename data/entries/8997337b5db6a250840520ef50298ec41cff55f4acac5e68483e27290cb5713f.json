{"title":"Performance Analysis of Glass Fa&ccedil;ade Cleaning Robot","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0779/v1","date":1725953755000,"content":"Glass cleaning is one of the major cleaning tasks in malls, offices, and modern households where the human workforce is still used for cleaning. Manual cleaning on façade glasses is a less safe, tedious, ineffective, and complex process. With the advancement of robot technology, it is possible to use robots for glass cleaning to facilitate mankind and improve cleaning efficiency. This work presents the development of a vacuum-type glass cleaning robot for façade cleaning and its performance analysis. The developed square-shaped robot is controlled by an Arduino Mega microcontroller, equipped with vacuuming and cleaning technology. An adhesion mechanism on the wheels makes the robot move forward and backward on the glass. The robot runs on a 24-volt DC with a power rating of 75 watts. There are ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and help the robot navigate. The robot uses a random-walk mechanism and works continuously for 90 minutes effectively. The performance of the robot has been analyzed in terms of coverage area, repeatability, and dust collection efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8997337b5db6a250840520ef50298ec41cff55f4acac5e68483e27290cb5713f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
