{"title":"HPV-Related Cancer Vaccine Strategies: A Focus on China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1013/v1","date":1728985538000,"content":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) persistent infection is a major pathogenic factor for HPV-related cancers, such as cervical cancer (CC), vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, anal cancer, penile cancer, and head and neck cancer (HNC). Vaccination against HPV is an effective measure to block the transmission of the virus and to prevent HPV infections and the occurrence of related cancers. Since the introduction of the worldâ€™s first prophylactic HPV vaccine, there has been a decline in the incidence of HPV infections and associated cancers. Furthermore, there are currently ongoing developments of preventive vaccines that cover more HPV types, as well as the clinical application of therapeutic HPV vaccines. This article reviews the latest literature on the research progress, efficacy, and safety of HPV vaccines for these cancers, providing a reference for HPV vaccination strategy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a181e7cc25e73534661c6064b1e604832d0a1d8ab5b6979c1c3cc101e0dc1bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
