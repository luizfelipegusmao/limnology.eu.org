Yang, Tuanjun Hu, Tahar Ait-Ali</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Lawsonia intracellularis</i> is the etiological agent of proliferative enteropathy (PE) in pigs, horses and wide range of mammals. Little is known about the role of innate immune response during <i>L</i>. <i>intracellularis</i> infection. In this study, we investigated the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-regulated immune response against infection of a clinical strain Dkp23 and a live-attenuated Enterisol vaccine strain in PK-15 cells. We found that expression of NF-κB target genes <i>TNF-α</i>, <i>IFN-γ</i>, <i>IL-6</i> and <i>IL-8</i> were modulated during the course of infection. At 5 dpi, there was a significant increase in p65 NF-κB activation, including protein nuclear translocation and phosphorylation, synchronous with the induction of <i>IL-6</i>, <i>IFN-γ</i> and <i>IL-8</i> expression in <i>L</i>. <i>intracellularis</i> infected cells, especially for Enterisol vaccine strain-infected cells. This result suggests that NF-κB signalling level is induced when <i>L</i>. <i>intracellularis</i> bacterial load peaks at 5 dpi. The induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines expression is consistent with the decreased viability of <i>L</i>. <i>intracellularis</i>-infected cells especially that of the vaccine strain. There were no significant changes in NF-κB signalling between vaccine and Dkp23 infection in PK-15 cells, except for moderate levels of differences in NF-κB target genes expression which might be a reflection of differences in intracellular bacterial load. Overall, the data presented here indicate a correlation between the induction of NF-κB signalling and the <i>L</i>. <i>intracellularis</i> bacterial load in PK-15 cells.","author":"Huan W.
