Bilgewater is a regulated shipboard produced waste stream. Fundamental knowledge of emulsion surface changes is needed for improved wastewater treatment; however, limited information is currently available. Microbes play an important role in the ocean. It is hypothesized that microbes release organics that can act as surfactants that affect bilgewater formation or weakening. Such information will be critical for development mitigation strategies to treat polluted seawater containing bilgewater emulsions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6fe79828f75af4934ac79cf5929749e2615c8973600d2310978465d65853757d","category":"Environment"}
