{"title":"A Comprehensive Review of Organ-on-a-Chip Technology and Its Applications in Disease Diagnostics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0965/v1","date":1710838597000,"content":"Organ-on-a-chip (OOC) is an emerging technology that simulates an artificial organ within a microfluidic cell culture chip. Current cell biology research focuses on in vitro cell culture due to various limitations of in vivo testing. Unfortunately, in vitro cell culture fails to provide an accurate microenvironment, and in vivo cell culture is expensive and has historically been a source of ethical controversy. OOC aims to overcome these shortcomings and provide the best of both in vivo and in vitro cell culture research.  The key component of the OOC design is utilizing microfluidics to ensure a stable concentration gradient, dynamic mechanical stress modeling, and accurate reconstruction of a cellular microenvironment. OOC also has the advantage of complete observation and control of the system, which is impossible to recreate in in vivo research. Multiple throughputs, channels, membranes, and chambers are constructed in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) array to simulate various organs on a chip. Various experiments can be performed utilizing OOC technology, including drug delivery research and toxicology. Current technological expansions involve multiple organ microenvironments on a single chip, allowing for studying inter-tissue interactions. Other developments in the OOC technology include finding a more suitable material as a replacement for PDMS and minimizing artefactual error and non-translatable differences.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0f0356df5d64c2985dd6382d1cc7e7862a21c0e1618c8bfc8116c6cc5564c255","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
