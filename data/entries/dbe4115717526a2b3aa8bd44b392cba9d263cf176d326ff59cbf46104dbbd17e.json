{"title":"Exploring Diverse Biological Fertilizers (Micronutrients) for Sustainable Soil Fertility: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1140/v1","date":1728987178000,"content":"Attaining sustained soil fertility is essential for guaranteeing global food security and environmental well-being. Traditional farming methods that depend extensively on synthetic fertilizers have resulted in soil deterioration and environmental contamination. Biological fertilizers fortified with micronutrients have emerged as viable alternatives. This analysis examines many types of biological fertilizers and their contribution to improving soil fertility via micronutrient enhancement. Multiple sources of micronutrient-enriched biological fertilizers, such as microbial inoculants, compost, and organic amendments, are evaluated for their effectiveness in enhancing plant growth, increasing nutrient availability, and boosting soil health. Moreover, the effects of these fertilizers on agricultural productivity, soil microbial populations, and ecological sustainability are examined. Green manuring is a reasonable and ecofriendly scientific approach to enhancing robust and sustainable food production in agricultural systems. The integration of green manure improves soil quality by augmenting its chemical, physical, and biological properties, including the availability of organic matter, potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus, while also enhancing soil structure by reducing erosion and improving water retention capacity. Green manure serves as a natural fertilizer, releasing nutrients into the soil during decomposition, so enhancing nutrient content and fostering plant growth and development. The results highlight the potential of biological fertilizers as sustainable solutions for improving soil fertility and decreasing reliance on synthetic inputs, hence promoting long-term agricultural output and ecosystem resilience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbe4115717526a2b3aa8bd44b392cba9d263cf176d326ff59cbf46104dbbd17e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
