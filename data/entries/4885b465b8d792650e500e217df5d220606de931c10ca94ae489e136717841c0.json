{"title":"Vocal Communication between Cobots and Humans to Enhance Productivity and Safety: Review and Discussion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2071/v1","date":1717079018000,"content":"This paper explores strategies for fostering efficient vocal communication and collaboration between human workers and collaborative robots (cobots) in assembly processes. Vocal communication enables division of attention of the worker, as it frees the visual attention, and the workerâ€™s hands, dedicated to the task at hand. Speech generation and speech recognition are pre-requisites for effective vocal communication. The study focuses on cobot assistive tasks, where the human is in charge of the work and performs the main tasks while the cobot assists the worker in various peripheral jobs, such as bringing tools, parts, or materials, and returning them, or disposing them; or screwing or packaging the products. A nuanced understanding is necessary for understanding how human-robot interactions can be optimized to enhance overall productivity and safety. Through a comprehensive review of relevant literature and empirical studies, this manuscript identifies key factors influencing successful vocal communication, and proposes practical strategies for implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4885b465b8d792650e500e217df5d220606de931c10ca94ae489e136717841c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
