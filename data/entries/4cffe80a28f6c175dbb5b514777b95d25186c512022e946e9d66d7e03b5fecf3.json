{"title":"The Effect of Music Therapy on Substance Use Disorder Patients in the Rehabilitation Stage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1997/v1","date":1721891949000,"content":"Substance use disorder (SUD) is a global health crisis that is becoming increasingly prevalent among younger generations and impacting the overall health of millions of people worldwide. Traditional treatment methods, including cognitive-behavioral therapies and medicinal-assisted treatments, often face limitations such as inconsistent efficacies and varying degrees of accessibility. Thus, there is a clear need for a new and innovative treatment strategy. Music therapy has recently gained attention through research as a promising non-pharmacological supplement to strengthen conventional SUD treatment methods. This review explores the potential benefits of music therapy in reducing substance cravings, alleviating depressive symptoms, and improving emotional expression among patients in the rehabilitation phase of SUD recovery. We review evidence from various studies and clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of music therapy in improving standard treatment outcomes, with the results indicating that music therapy could be an effective complement to traditional treatment methods while noting that its efficacy could vary depending on the individual and type of intervention provided. The benefits of music therapy include accessibility of treatment for diverse patient groups and the potential for highly individualized care, although more research is needed to compare the efficacies of specific music treatment types for certain conditions and patient populations. Further research is also needed to validate the neurobiological mechanisms of music therapy, as well as increased communication between music therapists worldwide to enforce consistency in treatment methods and share learnings in this growing field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4cffe80a28f6c175dbb5b514777b95d25186c512022e946e9d66d7e03b5fecf3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
