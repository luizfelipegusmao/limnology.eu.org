Despite the growing use of CGs in recent decades, there is no unanimous consensus on their overall influence on joint proprioception. In this current meta-analysis, we aim to fill this knowledge gap by assessing the impact of CGs on joint proprioception. We conducted a literature search across seven databases and one registry. Ultimately, we included 27 studies with 671 participants. The meta-analysis revealed that wearing CGs resulted in a significant reduction in absolute error during joint position sensing (Hedges’ <i>g</i>: −0.64, <i>p</i> = 0.006) as compared to no CGs. However, further analyses of variables such as constant error (<i>p</i> = 0.308), variable error (<i>p</i> = 0.541) during joint position sense tests, threshold to detect passive motion (<i>p</i> = 0.757), and active movement extent discrimination (<i>p</i> = 0.842) did not show a significant impact of CGs. The review also identified gaps in the reporting of certain outcomes, such as parameters of CGs, reporting of performance, individual-reported outcomes, and lack of placebo comparators. Consequently, this review provides guidelines for future studies that may facilitate evidence-based synthesis and ultimately contribute to a better understanding of the overall influence of CGs on joint proprioception.</p>","author":"Shashank Ghai, \nFinn Nilson, \nJohanna Gustavsson, \nIshan Ghai","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences: Table of Contents","siteHash":"98c7119f6adff358c1cf3a15f5efdc68ead59681d375d3da00900b474221c3c5","entryHash":"de484aabc105ab7be2f782ac4bb3930a445c7b5021b08d3e770d8189c7f9cdd7","category":"Environment"}
