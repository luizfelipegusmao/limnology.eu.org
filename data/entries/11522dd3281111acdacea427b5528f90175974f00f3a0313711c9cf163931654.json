{"title":"Adaptive traits of Planctomycetota bacteria to thrive in macroalgal habitats and establish mutually beneficial relationship with macroalgae","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10424?af=R","date":1720604304000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Bacteria and macroalgae share an inseparable relationship, jointly influencing coastal ecosystems. Within macroalgae habitats, <i>Planctomycetota</i>, a group of bacteria notoriously challenging to cultivate, often dominate. However, the mechanisms facilitating their persistence in this environment remain unclear. Here, we successfully isolated a novel <i>Planctomycetota</i> bacterium, <i>Stieleria</i> sp. HD01, from the surface of kelp. We demonstrated that HD01 possesses a robust ability to metabolize fucoidan, which constitutes half of the kelp-derived organic carbon and exhibits resistance to attack by most microorganisms. Moreover, HD01 can utilize a broad spectrum of other organics, indicating its metabolic versatility and competitive prowess within algal environments. Additionally, HD01 can secrete antagonistic substances against other bacteria, form biofilms, and employ superoxide dismutase and catalase to resist oxidative stress, further consolidating its ecological fitness. Comparative metagenomics analysis suggested that <i>Planctomycetota</i> may have a mutually beneficial relationship with kelp.</p>","author":"Xueyan Gao, \nYihua Xiao, \nZiwei Wang, \nHanshuang Zhao, \nYufei Yue, \nShailesh Nair, \nZenghu Zhang, \nYongyu Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Letters: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e3d6bd1d0a248694da65f62e7591c05124a8fbc5456d1cafb66209dfd7ae6238","entryHash":"11522dd3281111acdacea427b5528f90175974f00f3a0313711c9cf163931654","category":"Environment"}
