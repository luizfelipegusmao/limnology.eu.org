Using the electron beam in the aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (AC-STEM) we demonstrate modification, thinning and drilling of features in multilayer hBN (âˆ¼ 5-to-20-nm-thick). These processes are monitored with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), revealing the atomic composition, and allowing for drift correction. We report effects of electron-beam energy and exposure times on defect size and structure.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ebd95bbb8a864f5ee68dfa1c830ac74f2de0edc9ad5dc628aa4347f06d253871","category":"Environment"}
