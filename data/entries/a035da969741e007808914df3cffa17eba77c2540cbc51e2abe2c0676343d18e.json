{"title":"Exploring Carcinoid Syndrome in Neuroendocrine Tumors: Insights from a Multidisciplinary Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0299/v1","date":1728027854000,"content":"Carcinoid syndrome (CS) is a rare condition associated with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), particularly those originating in the gastrointestinal tract, which secrete bioactive substances like serotonin. The management of CS requires a multidisciplinary approach due to its complex clinical manifestations, including flushing, diarrhea, bronchospasm, and carcinoid heart disease. Optimal care involves collaboration between several professional figures like oncologists, endocrinolo-gists, gastroenterologists, surgeons, and dietitians. Currently, a wide range of treatments are available focused on both symptom control and tumor burden reduction. Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) are the first-line therapy for symptom relief. Still, in patients with progressive disease or refractory CS, other options include targeted therapies, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), liver-directed therapies, and surgical resection when feasible. Furthermore, management of complications related to prolonged serotonin release and malnutrition as a result of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, post-surgical conditions, vitamin deficit, and chronic diarrhea often re-quires early detection to mitigate symptoms and improve the quality of life in these patients. The complexity of CS necessitates individualized care and continuous coordination among specialists to optimize outcomes and enhance patient well-being.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a035da969741e007808914df3cffa17eba77c2540cbc51e2abe2c0676343d18e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
