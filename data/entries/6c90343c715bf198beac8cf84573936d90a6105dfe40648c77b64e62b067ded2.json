{"title":"Dynamics of Biomarkers in COVID-19 Patients Treated with Anakinra","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0840/v1","date":1726051059000,"content":"A prospective clinical-epidemiological study was conducted to evaluate the dynamics of biomarkers in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (according to the National Institute of Health severity scale) treated with Anakinra, compared to those receiving standard treatment. The study included 65 patients with a mean age of 75.51Â±9.54 years, ranging from 44 to 99 years. Among the study participants, 38 (58.5%) were male and 27 (41.5%) were female. The patients were divided into two groups: control group (standard treatment): 24 patients (36.9%) and target group (Anakinra treatment): 41 patients (63.1%). The results showed a significant relationship between the dynamics of leukocytes, ASAT, LDH, D-dimer, ferritin, and IL-6 and the administration of Anakinra. In the control group, no significant dynamics were observed in leukocyte count, D-dimer, ferritin, or IL-6. A statistically significant decrease in ASAT and LDH values in the control group was noted only on Day 7. In the Anakinra group, significantly (or with borderline statistical significance, p&amp;lt;0.1) lower mean values were observed for leukocytes, NLR, D-dimer, ferritin, and IL-6 on Days 3 and 7 compared to the control group. Additionally, significantly lower CRP values were detected in the Anakinra group on Day 7 compared to the control group.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c90343c715bf198beac8cf84573936d90a6105dfe40648c77b64e62b067ded2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
