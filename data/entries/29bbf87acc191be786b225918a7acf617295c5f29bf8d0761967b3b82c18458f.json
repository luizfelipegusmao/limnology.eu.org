{"title":"Rationality of Irrational Choice: The Logic of the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1273/v1","date":1711018546000,"content":"The goal of the paper is to clarify the observed irrationality of decision making in conflict situations considered as one-step games of two players. To solve such situations, we consider the asymmetry in the relation of the players to their own rewards and the rewards of the opponents. Formalization of the decision-making process is based on recently developed non-commutative operators of multivalued logic algebra. The suggested method is applied to solve the well-known Prisonersâ€™ dilemma game and the other situations of conflict, where it results in the expected strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"29bbf87acc191be786b225918a7acf617295c5f29bf8d0761967b3b82c18458f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
