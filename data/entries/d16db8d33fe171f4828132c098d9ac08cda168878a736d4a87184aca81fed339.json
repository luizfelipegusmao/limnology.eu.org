{"title":"161 Effects of Sericea Lespedeza Supplementation on Steers Grazing Wild-Type Endophyte-Infected Tall Fescue","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/50/7617947?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Fescue toxicosis poses a significant challenge to the United States beef industry, resulting in considerable economic losses. This syndrome arises from the consumption of tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceous) infected with the wild-type endophyte (WE; Epichloe coenophiala), which produces toxic alkaloids. The most effective solution for mitigating fescue toxicosis is renovating WE tall fescue pastures to novel endophyte-infected (NE) tall fescue. However, pasture renovation is costly and may not be feasible under certain conditions, with the economic profitability taking up to 3 yr. While the potential of condensed tannins (CTs) in specific leguminous forages to reduce the absorption of toxic alkaloids is recognized, their use as supplements remains underexplored. This study aims were to investigate the potential of CT-containing feed supplements, specifically sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) pellets, in reducing the post-ingestive effects of fescue toxicosis in steers. Over two summers,12 steers were assigned to either Schedonorus arundinaceous (LES) or LES mixed with polyethylene glycol (LES + PEG) as a positive control for 12 wk. Body weight, hair retention score, rectal and extremities temperatures, cortisol concentrations, and lumen area of caudal arteries were collected at 4-wk intervals. Data were analyzed using a mixed-effect ANOVA test in SAS Studio 3.5. Steers on the LES diet exhibited significantly less (P &lt; 0.05) hair retention scores compared with those on the LES + PEG diet. In 2021, steers on the LES diet showed greater (P = 0.0101) ADG, while in 2022, there was no difference (P = 0.9916) in ADG between the treatments. Steers on the LES diet displayed greater (P = 0.0332) tail skin temperatures and decreased (P &lt; 0.0001) rectal temperatures compared with those on the LES + PEG diet. Hair cortisol concentrations were greater (P &lt; 0.05) in steers on the LES + PEG diet than in those on the LES diet. Additionally, steers supplemented with the LES + PEG diet showed a 21.2% smaller caudal artery lumen area compared with those on the LES diet (P &lt; 0.01). These findings underscore the potential of CTs in reducing the post-ingestive effects of fescue toxicosis. However, further research is needed to explore the complex mechanisms underlying these effects, establish the long-term efficacy of such interventions, and extend the investigation to include a broader range of physiological parameters affecting livestock health and performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"d16db8d33fe171f4828132c098d9ac08cda168878a736d4a87184aca81fed339","category":"Environment"}
