{"title":"Hematological parameters and plasma biochemistry of tambaqui Colossoma macropomum from fish farms in the Amazon region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0395/v1","date":1712299741000,"content":"The tambaqui Colossoma macropomum is the main species of edible fish originating from fish farming in the Amazon region. This study aimed to determine and compare the hematological and biochemical parameters of tambaqui from fish farms in municipalities in the Metropolitan Region of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Two fish farms were sampled in a semi-excavated pond-type breeding system in each of the five towns investigated (Presidente Figueiredo, Manaus, Iranduba, Manacapuru and Novo Airão), totaling ten breeders. On each farm, ten specimens were captured, totaling 100 animals. Blood was collected by caudal puncture, and hematological and biochemical parameters were determined using the methodology described for teleosts fish. For the erythrogram in the variables of hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration and erythrocytes, significant differences were observed in Iranduba and Novo Airão, demonstrating indications of anemic processes and dehydration. For plasma biochemistry, low levels were observed in fish from Iranduba and Novo Airão. High values in lipid compounds were found in tambaqui from Manacapuru. High intraspecific variation was found in the leukogram and thrombogram, which determined similarities between tambaqui from different farms and municipalities. On the other hand, fish from Manacapuru have an inappropriate diet, indicated by the high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides found in the blood.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9fda3752d20def84a620ee26b32992a23563736b1c15d874d4b24826232f63d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
