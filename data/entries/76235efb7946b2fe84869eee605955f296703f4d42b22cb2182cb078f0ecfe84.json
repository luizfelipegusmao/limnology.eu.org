{"title":"Dissolved Hydrogen Concentration in the Psychrophilic Anaerobic Digestion of Food Leftovers and Its Correlation to VFA/ TIC Ratio","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1445/v1","date":1726665008000,"content":"This paper evaluates the usefulness of measuring the concentration of dissolved hydrogen in an anaerobic fermenter for maintaining the process stability. A laboratory test of two-stage psychrophilic anaerobic digestion of food leftovers from a university canteen was carried out in a vertical reactor with a total working volume of 0.255 m3 without stirring. In the course of the experiment lasting 1050 days, with an average organic loading of 15.45 kgVS m-3 d-1 for the 1st stage and 0.657 kgVS m-3 d-1 for the 2nd stage, a specific biogas production of 0.123 Nm3 per kilogram of substrate and 0.448 Nm3 per kilogram of total solids and 0.480 Nm3 per kilogram of volatile solids, respectively, was achieved. The average methane content in biogas was 55.9 % vol. Slightly higher gas productions were measured in the batch BMP test. The concentration of hydrogen in the mixed biogas from both reactor stages occasionally exceeded 1000 ppm and averaged 134 ppm, the concentration of dissolved hydrogen measured by AMT MS 08 sensor in the overloaded second stage was often 0.10-0.23 mg dm-3 and correlated with the total concentration of lower fatty acids and with the VFA/ TIC parameter. The dissolved hydrogen concentration from AMT instrument was not found to be a reliable timely indicator of overload or process stability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76235efb7946b2fe84869eee605955f296703f4d42b22cb2182cb078f0ecfe84","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
