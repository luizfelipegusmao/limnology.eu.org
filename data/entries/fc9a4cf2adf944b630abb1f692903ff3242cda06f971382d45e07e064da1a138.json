{"title":"Assessing the risk perception, attitude, and management strategies used by the participants in Nigeriaâ€™s rice value chain.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1269/v1","date":1716190317000,"content":"The study assessed the risk perception, attitude, and management tools of 260 randomly selected farmers and processors in the rice value chain using data elicited via a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, Equally Likely Certainty Equivalent (ELCE) technique, Binary logistic regression, and a 5-point Likert scale were employed in the data analyses. Descriptive statistics show that the respondents are young, active, and in their productive age with an intermediate education level. Majority of the farmers and processors were risk averse. Risk aversion was common among farmers and processors. Farmers' risk attitudes and perceptions of risk are significantly influenced by a number of factors, including age, access to extension services, farm size, marital status, household size, education, income, training, and experience. Majority of rice farmers consider price risk as the most important risk while majority of processors perceive production risk as the most important risk. Pests and diseases, price fluctuation, drought, and lack of input were the most important source of risk to farmers, while processors perceived price fluctuation, technology adoption, and poor storage facilities as the most important source of risk. Off-farm investment, spraying for pests and diseases, cash contribution, market information, and cooperative were the important risk mitigating management strategies employed by the farmers/processors. The study suggests improvements in the identified risk sources, which could influence the attitude and perception of the farmers and processors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc9a4cf2adf944b630abb1f692903ff3242cda06f971382d45e07e064da1a138","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
