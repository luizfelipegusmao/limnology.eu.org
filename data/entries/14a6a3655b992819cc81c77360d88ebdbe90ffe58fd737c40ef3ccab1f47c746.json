{"title":"A dominant negative mutation of GhMYB25-like alters cotton fiber initiation, reducing lint and fuzz","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/8/2759/7623567?rss=1","date":1709683200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cotton (<span>Gossypium hirsutum</span>) fibers, vital natural textile materials, are single-cell trichomes that differentiate from the ovule epidermis. These fibers are categorized as lint (longer fibers useful for spinning) or fuzz (shorter, less useful fibers). Currently, developing cotton varieties with high lint yield but without fuzz remains challenging due to our limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying fiber initiation. This study presents the identification and characterization of a naturally occurring dominant negative mutation <span>GhMYB25-like_AthapT</span>, which results in a reduced lint and fuzzless phenotype. The GhMYB25-like_At<sup>hapT</sup> protein exerts its dominant negative effect by suppressing the activity of GhMYB25-like during lint and fuzz initiation. Intriguingly, the negative effect of GhMYB25-like_At<sup>hapT</sup> could be alleviated by high expression levels of <span>GhMYB25-like</span>. We also uncovered the role of GhMYB25-like in regulating the expression of key genes such as <span>GhPDF2</span> (<span>PROTODERMAL FACTOR 2</span>), <span>CYCD3; 1</span> (<span>CYCLIN D3; 1</span>), and <span>PLD</span> (<span>Phospholipase D</span>), establishing its significance as a pivotal transcription factor in fiber initiation. We identified other genes within this regulatory network, expanding our understanding of the determinants of fiber cell fate. These findings offer valuable insights for cotton breeding and contribute to our fundamental understanding of fiber development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"14a6a3655b992819cc81c77360d88ebdbe90ffe58fd737c40ef3ccab1f47c746","category":"Environment"}
