Nevertheless, an imbalance amid the hospitalized people demands and the respiratory structure could cause to inconsistencies in the patientâ€™s inhalation. To tackle this problem, this study presents an Iterative Learning PID Controller (ILC-PID), a unique current cycle feedback type controller that helps in gaining the correct pressure and volume. The paper also offers a clear and complete examination of the primarily efficient neural approach for generating optimal inhalation strategies. Moreover, machine learning-based classifiers are used to evaluate the precision and performance of the ILC-PID controller. These classifiers able to forecast and choose the perfect type for various inhalation modes, eliminating the likelihood that patients will require mechanical ventilation. In pressure control, the suggested accurate neural categorization exhibited an average accuracy rate of 88.2% in continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode and 91.7% in proportional assist ventilation (PAV) mode while comparing with the other classifiers like ensemble classifier has reduced accuracy rate of 69.5% in CPAP mode and also 71.7% in PAV mode. An average accuracy of 78.9% rate in other classifiers compared to neutral network in CPAP. The neural model had an typical range of 81.6% in CPAP mode and 84.59% in PAV mode for 20 cm <i>H</i><sub>2</sub><i>O</i> of volume created by the neural network classifier in the volume investigation. Compared to the other classifiers, an average of 72.17% was in CPAP mode, and 77.83% was in PAV mode in volume control. Different approaches, such as decision trees, optimizable Bayes trees, naive Bayes trees, nearest neighbour trees, and an ensemble of trees, were also evaluated regarding the accuracy by confusion matrix concept, training duration, specificity, sensitivity, and F1 score.","author":"Anitha T.","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"36c78e144564824cc5ee34e807c229d3b2721a2b576449f8a1e0e8cc219f1163","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
