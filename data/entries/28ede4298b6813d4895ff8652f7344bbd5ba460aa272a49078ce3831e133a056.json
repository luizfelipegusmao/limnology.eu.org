{"title":"Histone deacetylase OsHDA716 represses rice chilling tolerance by deacetylating OsbZIP46 to reduce its transactivation function and protein stability","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1913/7577598?rss=1","date":1705536000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Low temperature is a major environmental factor limiting plant growth and crop production. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is important for plant adaptation to environmental changes, whereas the epigenetic mechanism of cold signaling in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) remains largely elusive. Here, we report that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) OsHDA716 represses rice cold tolerance by interacting with and deacetylating the transcription factor OsbZIP46. The loss-of-function mutants of <span>OsHDA716</span> exhibit enhanced chilling tolerance, compared with the wild-type plants, while <span>OsHDA716</span> overexpression plants show chilling hypersensitivity. On the contrary, OsbZIP46 confers chilling tolerance in rice through transcriptionally activating <span>OsDREB1A</span> and <span>COLD1</span> to regulate cold-induced calcium influx and cytoplasmic calcium elevation. Mechanistic investigation showed that OsHDA716-mediated OsbZIP46 deacetylation in the DNA-binding domain reduces the DNA-binding ability and transcriptional activity as well as decreasing OsbZIP46 protein stability. Genetic evidence indicated that OsbZIP46 deacetylation mediated by OsHDA716 reduces rice chilling tolerance. Collectively, these findings reveal that the functional interplay between the chromatin regulator and transcription factor fine-tunes the cold response in plant and uncover a mechanism by which HDACs repress gene transcription through deacetylating nonhistone proteins and regulating their biochemical functions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"28ede4298b6813d4895ff8652f7344bbd5ba460aa272a49078ce3831e133a056","category":"Environment"}
