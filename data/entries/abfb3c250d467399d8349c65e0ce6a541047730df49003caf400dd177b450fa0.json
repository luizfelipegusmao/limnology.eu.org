{"title":"Machine Learning Data Processing for COVID‐19 Diagnostics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0727/v1","date":1720591211000,"content":"A new data processing method based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms has been developed and tested in clinical environments during COVID-19 trials at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Breath samples have been collected in 2020–2021 from 100 participants using gas chromatography combined with ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS, G.A.S. mbH). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests combined with clinical diagnostics were used as a reference method. Once the ML training-testing cycle is completed, the diagnostics of a single data set may be completed in as little as a few seconds. A convincing difference in the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOS) breath biomarker signature with COVID-19 positive and negative participants has been found. This approach is a generic method that can be applied to data sets collected with other types of hardware, e.g., different settings of GC, GC-MS, GC-GC, or other methods providing high information density in 2-dimensional data sets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"abfb3c250d467399d8349c65e0ce6a541047730df49003caf400dd177b450fa0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
