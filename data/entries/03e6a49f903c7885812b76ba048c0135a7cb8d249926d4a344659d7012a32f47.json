{"title":"Characterization of Vitronectin Effect in 3D Ewing Sarcoma Models: A Digital Microscopic Analysis of Two Cell Lines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0532/v1","date":1723082775000,"content":"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is an aggressive bone and soft-tissue pediatric cancer. High vitronectin (VN) expression has been associated with poor prognosis in other cancers, and we aimed to determine the utility of this extracellular matrix glycoprotein as a biomarker of aggressiveness in ES. Silk-fibroin plus gelatin-tyramine hydrogels (HGs) were fabricated with and without cross-linked VN and cultivated with A673 and PDX73 ES cell lines for two and three weeks. VN secretion to culture media was assessed using ELISA. Morphometric analysis was applied for phenotypic characterization. VN release to culture media was higher in 3D-models than in monolayer cultures, and intracellular, intercellular and pericluster presence was also observed. A673-HGs showed lower density of clusters but a proportion of larger clusters than PDX73-HGs, which presented low cluster circularity. The cluster density of A673-HGs without added VN was higher than with added VN, and slightly lower in the case of PDX73-HGs. Furthermore, a culture time of three weeks provided no benefits in cluster growth compared to two weeks, especially in A673 -HGs. These advances in 3D modeling and digital quantification pave the way for future studies in ES and other cancers to deepen understanding about intra- and intercellular heterogeneity and anti-adhesion VN therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"03e6a49f903c7885812b76ba048c0135a7cb8d249926d4a344659d7012a32f47","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
