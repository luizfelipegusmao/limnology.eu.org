{"title":"Quill Mites of the Subfamily Syringophilinae (Acariformes: Syringophilidae) Parasitising Starlings (Passeriformes: Sturnidae)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1273/v1","date":1721116046000,"content":"Quill mites of the family Syringophilidae are widely distributed parasites of birds inhabiting the interior of feather quills. In this paper, we provide detailed information on the host spectrum and distribution for six previously described species of syringophilines associated with starlings with new host and locality records. Additionally, we describe three new species, Aulonastus indonesianus Marcisova, Skoracki and Patan sp. n. from the Common Hill Myna Gracula religiosa Linnaeus in Indonesia (Java) and the White-necked Myna Streptocitta albicollis (Vieillot) in Indonesia (Celebes), Aulonastus anais Skoracki and Patan sp. n. from the Golden Myna Mino anais (Lesson) in Papua New Guinea, and Syringophiloidus poeopterus Skoracki and Patan sp. n. from the Abbott's Starling Poeoptera femoralis (Richmond) in Tanzania. Finally, we explore the host-parasite interactions within the system comprising starlings and syringophiline mites.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"28321a16e44e4627da34cecab655a30fc62aa8cdb706f2daced310b3815b1d58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
