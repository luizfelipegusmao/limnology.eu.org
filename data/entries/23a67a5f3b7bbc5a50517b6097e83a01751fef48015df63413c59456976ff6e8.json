{"title":"Evolution of the Tourism Industry in Chile: An Approximation to GDP for the Period 2013&ndash;2019","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2069/v1","date":1727337292000,"content":"This study examines the evolution of the tourism industry in Chile during the period 2013-2019, focusing on its contribution to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Using data from the National Tourism Service (SERNATUR) and the Undersecretariat of Tourism, it analyzes the approximation of tourism GDP and its share in the Chilean economy. The results indicate a sustained growth of the tourism sector, with a contribution to GDP that reached 3.3% in 2019. The main Tourism Characteristic Activities (TCAs) contributing to this growth are identified, highlighting administrative and support activities, food services and accommodation. The study reveals growth patterns, fluctuations in the contribution of different TCAs, and the impact of external factors on the sector's performance. This research provides valuable insights for the formulation of tourism development policies and strategies in Chile.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"23a67a5f3b7bbc5a50517b6097e83a01751fef48015df63413c59456976ff6e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
