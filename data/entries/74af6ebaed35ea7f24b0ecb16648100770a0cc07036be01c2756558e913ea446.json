{"title":"Exploring the impact of polystyrene microplastics on human health: unravelling the health implications of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs): a comprehensive study on cytotoxicity, reproductive health, human exposure, and exposure assessment","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae063/7655606?rss=1","date":1713657600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This investigation explores the various impacts that polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) have on human health. As most of the plastic materials affect human health when they release leachable toxic substances that affect human health, this causes a negative effect that determines poor health conditions and leads to health hazards associated with plastic toxins routed in the human body, such as: Polychlorinated Biphenyls, Polybrominated Biphenyls etc. The study includes micro-plastic exposure assessment on testicular structure analysis, and cytotoxicity evaluations of different human cell types. The findings clarified the possible dangers of PS-MPs exposure from food, medications, and common products, emphasising the necessity of standard specimen handling procedures for precise biomonitoring.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"74af6ebaed35ea7f24b0ecb16648100770a0cc07036be01c2756558e913ea446","category":"Environment"}
