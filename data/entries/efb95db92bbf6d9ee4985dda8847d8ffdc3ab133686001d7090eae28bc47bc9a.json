{"title":"SCMtalk: IoT-Based Scientific Chinese Medicine Pharmacy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1336/v1","date":1724069835000,"content":"Traditional Chinese medicine requires decoction and consumption, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Scientific Chinese medicine (SCM), on the other hand, uses concentrated granules that can be taken with hot water, making it widely welcomed. With the widespread adoption of SCM, the packaging technology has started to receive attention. Whether it is manpower allocation, operation time, or the uniformity and residue of the medicine powder, these factors can become bottlenecks in the process. A traditional SCM pharmacy machine is purely mechanically hardwired. This paper proposes SCMtalk, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based SCM mechanism designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of SCM medicine packets generation. We show how SCMtalk develops IoT hardware and software modules for medicine selection, mixing, dispensing, packaging, and cleaning. We also explain how the mechanical IoT hardware is integrated with the corresponding software module to become an individual IoT device. These IoT devices can be transparently replaced, allowing us to easily upgrade the individual components of the SCM packet generation through the IoT concept. Finally, we address quality control issues by leveraging IoT. One contribution of this paper is to introduce an interesting SCM application to IoT experts and to demonstrate how we collaborated with pharmacists and mechanical experts to use a powerful IoT platform to create a smart pharmacy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"efb95db92bbf6d9ee4985dda8847d8ffdc3ab133686001d7090eae28bc47bc9a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
