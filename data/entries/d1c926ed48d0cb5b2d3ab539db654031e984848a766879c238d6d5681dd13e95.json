{"title":"Determinants Determining the Farmer Participation and the Development of Shallot Farming in Search of Effective Farm Management Practices: Evidence Grounded in Structural Equation Modeling Results","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1038/v1","date":1715785569000,"content":"The objective of the research was to examine the determinants that determine farmer participation and shallot farming development in search of effective farm management practices. The study used Structural Equation Modeling data analysis. The primary data was collected from direct-structural interviews with 150 randomly chosen shallot farmers in Bantaeng Regency, Indonesia. It was found that the physical attributes of the land, the economic framework of the community, and the political system of the agricultural community were fundamental factors that exerted a positive and significant influence on farmer participation. Therefore, improvements in the physical aspects of land, the economic framework, and the political structure of agricultural communities could promote farmer participation. Furthermore, the farmersâ€™ participation and the political structure of agricultural communities have a positive and significant impact on the development of shallot farming. Thus, by increasing the influence of government officials and community leaders, shallot farming can be promoted. The farmers can then enhance their participation in the shallot farming plan's formulation and implementation, providing the continued development of shallot farming. The findings of this study contribute significantly to the body of knowledge by validating previous research and proposing different ways to improve effective farm management practices in shallot farming.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1c926ed48d0cb5b2d3ab539db654031e984848a766879c238d6d5681dd13e95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
