{"title":"Feeding ecology and behavior of mimetic juveniles of the Maracaibo leatherjack Oligoplites palometa (Perciformes: Carangidae) observed in an Amazonian tidal channel","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05483-9","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>We describe and analyze the mimetic behavior in juvenile Maracaibo leatherjack, <em>Oligoplites palometa</em>, establishing correlations with feeding diet composition during daytime. The relationships between behavioral patterns and the feeding diet of <em>O. palometa</em> were analyzed during daylight hours, considering seasonal and lunar cycle variations within a tidal channel in the estuary of the Caeté River, Northeastern Pará, Brazil. The two relatively well-defined seasons associated with the study area—rainy and dry seasons—have influenced the behavioral patterns and feeding diet of the fish. During the dry season, higher foraging frequencies were observed, consistently related to mimetic swimming behavior, and correlated with the abundance of food items found in the stomach contents. In contrast, during the rainy season, both behavioral and food item frequencies were lower, although the food items presented greater diversity. The fish have exhibited zooplanktivorous feeding habits, preferring copepods over other prey types. The lunar cycle may be associated with the temporal distribution of prey, whereas Brachyura, Clupeid larvae, and unidentified Crustacea are more related to the full, waning, and new moon phases, respectively. Our results clarify the dynamics between the environment and prey types, behavioral tactics, and feeding diets adopted by mimetic juvenile <em>O. palometa.</em></p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"2641214a5dc4d9ae0a99bb75c09bbb45982e9fab15a8743d3fa20385e1aaba59","category":"Environment"}
