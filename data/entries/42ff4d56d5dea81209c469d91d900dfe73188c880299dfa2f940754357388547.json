Such fibers can be engineered for therapeutic purposes by modifying the peptide sequence, which can tune cell adhesion and regeneration [<a href=\"#ozae044.355-B2\">2</a>]. However, the relationship between peptide fibers and structural properties is not fully understood as there is lack of structural investigation of such fibrils. Contrarily, there is a large understanding of the assembly mechanism and final structure of amyloid forming peptides such as Amyloid-Î² 42.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"42ff4d56d5dea81209c469d91d900dfe73188c880299dfa2f940754357388547","category":"Environment"}
