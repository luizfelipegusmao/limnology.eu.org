{"title":"Investigation into the Crystal Structure, Hirshfeld Surface Analysis, and Electrical Transport Conduction of theAg0.2Na0.8FeP2O7compound","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1404/v1","date":1716331483000,"content":"In this study, a new diphosphate compound, Ag0.2Na0.6FeP2O7, was synthesized using a solid-state reaction method and extensively studied using various techniques. The compound's structure was confirmed through X-ray diffraction analysis, revealing a single-phase monoclinic structure with the P21/C space group. The electrical behavior of the compound was investigated, and its conductivity followed Jonscher's universal law. The correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model explained the temperature-dependent ac conductivity and parameter \"s\" well. The study also explored the contribution of single-polaron and bipolaron hopping to the a.c. conductivity and discussed the ionic conductivity in relation to the structural characteristics of the sample. Overall, this investigation significantly enhances our comprehension of the distinctive electrical properties of Ag0.2Na0.6FeP2O7 and its potential practical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad1679214530d86446742c2c1bceb8c1ff9b68dea936ec5ec1b2d6c54c3287b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
