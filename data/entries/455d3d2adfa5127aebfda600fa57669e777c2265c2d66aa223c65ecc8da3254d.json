This study aims to assess the efficacy of APC as a first line treatment for gastric dysplasia, and identify risk factors for residual dysplasia.</p> Methods <p>A total of 179 cases of gastric dysplasia were treated with APC and have been followed-up with upper endoscopy within 1 year. The overall incidence and the characteristics of lesions with residual dysplasia in follow-up endoscopy were analyzed by logistic regression.</p> Results <p>Among 179 lesions treated with APC, 171 (95.5%) lesions have achieved complete ablation in the follow-up endoscopy. Additional APC was applied for residual dysplasia, achieving complete ablation in 97.77% (175/179). The upper third location of the gastric dysplasia was significantly associated with residual dysplasia, while tumor size, horizontal location, macroscopic morphology and grade of dysplasia showed no significant associations with residual dysplasia following the initial APC.</p> Conclusions <p>APC with meticulous follow-up can be recommended as a first line treatment in patients with gastric dysplasia.</p>","author":"Mi Jin Oh","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"455d3d2adfa5127aebfda600fa57669e777c2265c2d66aa223c65ecc8da3254d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
