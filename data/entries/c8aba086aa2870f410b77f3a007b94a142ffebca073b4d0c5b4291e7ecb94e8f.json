Where uphill speed matters, the direct connection from crank to axle, without some energy-inefficient suspension spoiling the fun, is the quickest way to get up to speed.</p>\n<p>Riding rough-and-ready trails on a hardtail might beat you up a little more, but there’s something almost zen-like about being able to pick the smoothest line between the chunder, while pumping through rollers to generate free speed.</p>\n<p>Hardtails are often also lighter, easier to maintain and cheaper than full-suspension mountain bikes, because there are fewer moving parts to add weight, service or build in the first place.</p>\n<p>Here, we’ve put together our pick of the best hardtail mountain bikes as ridden, rated and reviewed by the BikeRadar team.</p>\n<h2>Hardtail vs full-suspension mountain bike</h2>\n<p>Stuck between whether a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/hardtail-versus-full-suspension-mountain-bike/\">hardtail or full-suspension mountain bike</a> best suits your requirements?</p>\n<p>It all depends on the type of mountain biking you would like to take part in. Hardtails are more capable than you might initially think, but full-suspension mountain bikes come into their own on more technical terrain, especially when the gradients point downwards.</p>\n<p>Budget is the biggest factor and (with few exceptions), the entry point to a full-suspension bike is much higher than that for a hardtail. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-mountain-bikes-under-1500-2/\">best mountain bikes under £1,500</a> see full-suspension start to become available and as you start to spend more, you’ll find updates in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-frame-materials/\">frame materials</a>, as well as better components and suspension specced.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s your budget?</h2>\n<p>Buying a hardtail is one of the most affordable ways into mountain biking.</p>\n<p>As a result, it’s no surprise that hardtails dominate our buyer’s guides to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-500/\">best mountain bikes under £500</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-750/\">best mountain bikes under £750</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bikes-under-1000-2/\">best mountain bikes under £1,000</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to buy a hardtail mountain bike, we’ve collated our reviews of the best bikes here, organised by price, as well as our reviews of hardtail frames.</p>\n<p>Use the links below to skip to the relevant section:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"#over2000\">Best hardtails over £2,000/$2,300</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#under2000\">Best hardtails under £2,000/$2,300</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#under1500\">Best hardtails under £1,500/$1,700</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#under1000\">Best hardtails under £1,000/$1,200</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#hardtailframes\">Best hardtail frames</a></li>\n</ul><p>If you’re in the market for a full-suspension bike, make sure you check out our guides to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">best trail bikes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downcountry-mountain-bikes/\">best downcountry bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">best enduro mountain bikes.</a></p>\n<p>We’ve also got a list of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">best cross-country bikes</a>, covering both hardtail and full-suspension designs for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cross-country-racing-guide/\">XC racing</a>.

It would be nice to have a slightly longer dropper to create enough space to move your weight around in the sketchiest of situations.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Signal has a great chassis that wouldn’t look out of place on a much pricier bike, and there is a good level of kit for the money without too much compromise.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/sonder-signal-st-nx-review/\">Read our full Sonder Signal ST NX review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Best hardtail mountain bikes under £1,500/$1,700</h3>\n<h4>Kona Kahuna</h4>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Kona Kahuna hardtail mountain bike\" title=\"Kona Kahuna - 03\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Kona Kahuna has a curvy silhouette.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Superb ride quality</li>\n<li>Well-specced Shimano groupset and brakes</li>\n<li>£1,199 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>Kona’s endearing Kahuna offers a commendable ride quality in its latest guise.

This helps make it comfortable on climbs, and when paired with its 650b wheels it has a solid, stable feel and great descending composure.</p>\n<p>We weren’t without quibbles when testing this bike, though. The air-sprung front fork doesn’t offer great small-bump sensitivity, and a fork upgrade isn’t viable at this price. It would be nice to see Boost spacing too.</p>\n<p>Despite these points, you do get a lot of performance for the money and the Fury trumps its competitors in multiple ways. A better fork would just elevate this steal of a bike even further.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/2021-carrera-fury-review/\">Read our full Carrera Fury review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h4>Vitus Sentier 29</h4>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus Sentier 29 hardtail mountain bike for Bike of the Year 2023\" title=\"BOTY MTB_Vitus Sentier 29 hardtail mountain bike for Bike of the Year 2023\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Vitus Sentier 29 proves to be good value for money.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Up-to-date geometry</li>\n<li>Decent spec</li>\n<li>£950/$1,200/€1,300/AU$1,800 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Vitus Sentier 29 combines quality parts with impressive value, with the bike featuring a 130mm RockShox Recon Silver RL fork, Clarks M2 hydraulic brakes and a Shimano Deore M5100 derailleur.</p>\n<p>The Sentier frame, which remains the same throughout the range, provides a good foundation to the spec, with a refined geometry that feels just as fast downhill as it does on the climbs.</p>\n<p>One negative is the exposed inner gear cable that runs down the top tube, which after a couple of muddy rides lead to stiff gear shifting.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/vitus-sentier-29-review-2/\">Read our full Vitus Sentier 29 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h4>Voodoo Bizango Pro</h4>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Voodoo Bizango Pro\" title=\"Voodoo Bizango Pro\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Voodoo Bizango Pro is our 2023 Budget Mountain Bike of the Year.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>High-quality spec for the price</li>\n<li>Upgrade potential</li>\n<li>£950/$1,258 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Voodoo Bizango Pro offers top performance at a bargain price.
