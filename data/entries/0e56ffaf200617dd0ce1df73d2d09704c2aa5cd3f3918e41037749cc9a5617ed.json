{"title":"Enhancing Daylight Comfort with Climate-Responsive Kinetic Shading: A Simulation and Experimental Study of a Horizontal Fin System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1515/v1","date":1721350305000,"content":"This study uses simulation and experimental methodologies to explore the efficacy of bi-sectional horizontal kinetic shading systems (KSS) featuring horizontal fins in enhancing daylight comfort across various climates. Given the increasing energy demands and shifting climatic patterns, optimizing daylight levels while minimizing solar heat gain is vital. The paper introduces a bespoke horizontal bi-sectional KSS, simulated in three distinct climates—Wroclaw, Tehran, and Bangkok—using Climate Based Daylight Modelling methods with Ladybug and Honeybee tools in Rhino software. The study employs standard daylight metrics such as Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) and Daylight Glare Probability (DGP), along with custom metrics designed to capture the specific dynamics of the bi-sectional KSS. Initial simulations indicated that the KSS significantly improved daylight distribution and uniformity, reducing glare and over-illumination risks by av. 42.34%. Including KSS switching schedules, which are seldom detailed in similar research, enhances the reproducibility and understanding of findings. Subsequently, a physical reduced-scale mock-up of the bi-sectional KSS was tested under real-weather conditions in Wroclaw (lat. 51° N) during June-July 2024. The mock-up utilized two chambers: one equipped with the prototype of bi-sectional KSS and the second without any protection. The operation of fins was guided by two stepper motors controlled by a Python script running on a Raspberry Pi 3 minicomputer. The control chamber served to benchmark the bi-sectional KSS's efficiency by providing results that would be expected if no shading system were installed. The experimental outcomes supported the simulations, demonstrating the KSS's robustness in reducing high illuminance levels to the target comfort level, thus enhancing indoor visual comfort. The values below 3,000 lux were maintained for 68% of the time. However, it must be explicitly stated that during the June-July 2024 heat waves, the illuminance levels inside the test room momentarily exceeded the comfort threshold of 3,000 lux, reaching up to 4,674 lux. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, the paper advocates for the broader application and further development of KSS as a climate-responsive shading system in diverse architectural contexts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0e56ffaf200617dd0ce1df73d2d09704c2aa5cd3f3918e41037749cc9a5617ed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
