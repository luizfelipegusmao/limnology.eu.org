However, intensive aquaculture industry faces challenges such as growth abnormalities, high mortality rates, water quality and intestinal health deterioration. Administering probiotics can serve as a nutritional strategy to enhance the immune system and growth performance of fish influxes of gut microbiota. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of two dietary probiotic strains <i>L</i>. <i>mesenteroides</i> and <i>L</i>. <i>lactis</i> on the growth performance, immunity, and gut microbiota of Nile tilapia (<i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>). Fish were fed with basal and experimental diet supplemented by both <i>L</i>. <i>mesenteroides</i> and <i>L</i>. <i>lactis</i> bacteria at 10<sup>6</sup> cell/g for 8 weeks. Feeding a combination of <i>L</i>. <i>mesenteroides</i> and <i>L</i>. <i>lactis</i> resulted in significant improvements in feed utilization parameters (PER and FER) (P &lt; 0.001), alternative complement pathway activity, intestinal lactic acid bacteria count (P &lt; 0.012), mucus secretion (P &lt; 0.002) and peroxidase activity (P &lt; 0.001) compared to the control groups. Serum lysozyme activity also exhibited a significant increase in the <i>L</i>. <i>mesenteroides</i> and <i>L</i>. <i>lactis</i> dietary group (P &lt; 0.011) compared to the control and single probiotic supplemented diet groups. Furthermore, Nile tilapia fed the <i>L</i>. <i>mesenteroides</i> and <i>L</i>. <i>lactis</i> supplemented diet showed enhanced growth performance metrics (weight gain, final weight and specific growth rate) compared to those fed control and single probiotic supplemented diets (P &lt; 0.022). Additionally, superoxide dismutase activity was significantly elevated in the <i>L</i>.<i>mesenteroides</i> and <i>L</i>. <i>lactis</i> supplemented diet groups compared to the control and single <i>L</i>.<i>mesenteroides</i> supplemented diet groups (P &lt; 0.017). These findings strongly indicate that a dietary combination of <i>L</i>. <i>mesenteroides</i> and <i>L</i>. <i>lactis</i> probiotics could function as a beneficial immunostimulant feed supplement in Nile tilapia aquaculture.","author":"Assel Paritova","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"90d1b6555b7bcd360ea4e3b7134d8cd0fa66b778b9cb634b06cdc1cdb9694c53","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
