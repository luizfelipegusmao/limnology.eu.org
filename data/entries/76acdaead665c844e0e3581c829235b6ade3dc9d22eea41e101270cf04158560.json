{"title":"A Case Report of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL)/Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (LBL) Following the Second Dose of Comirnaty&reg;: An Analysis of the Potential Pathogenic Mechanism Based on of the Existing Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1661/v1","date":1711524874000,"content":"In this report we describe the case of a healthy, young, athletic woman who developed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech modified mRNA (modRNA) COVID-19 genetic vaccine (marketed as ComirnatyÂ®). The first dose of the genetic vaccine did not appear to illicit any noticeable side effects, but within 24 hours of the second dose the patient suffered widespread and intensifying bone pain, fever, vomiting, and general malaise. Due to the persistence of the symptoms, the patient underwent a series of tests and examinations including a full laboratory workup, a consult with a clinical immunologist and rheumatologist, a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, as well as an osteomedullary biopsy. These together led to a definitive diagnosis of ALL. A time interval of 16 weeks from the second vaccination to the diagnosis of cancer was noted. Several similar cases with identical pathology which developed after the modRNA COVID-19 vaccination, are described in case reports in the scientific literature. The massive and indiscriminate use of genetic vaccines to fight COVID-19 is raising serious concerns about their safety and about the technology platform as a whole for this purpose. Growing evidence is accumulating regarding the biodistribution and persistence of the modRNA which can reach, thanks to the lipid nanoparticles, a multitude of tissues and organs of the body, including the bone marrow and other blood-forming organs and tissues. Moreover, there is evidence that the modRNA vaccines display a particular tropism for the bone marrow, influencing the immune system at multiple levels and being able to trigger not only autoimmune-based pathologies, but also neoplastic mechanisms. The aim of this article is to assess, on the basis of the available scientific literature, the risk of developing haematopoietic cancers after modRNA vaccination, and to investigate the potential genetic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76acdaead665c844e0e3581c829235b6ade3dc9d22eea41e101270cf04158560","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
