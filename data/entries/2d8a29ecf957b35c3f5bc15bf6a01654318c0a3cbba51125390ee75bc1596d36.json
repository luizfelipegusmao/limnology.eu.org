{"title":"Approaches to Numerical Modelling of Rain Drop Erosion of Wind Turbine Blades: Surface Degradation Issues","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1113/v1","date":1723717034000,"content":"This paper investigates the effects that rain drop erosion has on the integrity of wind turbine materials. This research involves analysis of impact models and theoretical equations to simulate the impact phenomena when a raindrop collides with a wind turbine blade at high speed. Impact phenomena that occur when a raindrop impacts with a wind turbine blade were evaluated. Additionally, the use of various types of software was considered to simulate this impact event. The model results of the raindrop impact with respect to a comparison of the governing equations and impact behaviour are addressed. Future work is outlined including adding variables to the erosion modelling algorithms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d8a29ecf957b35c3f5bc15bf6a01654318c0a3cbba51125390ee75bc1596d36","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
