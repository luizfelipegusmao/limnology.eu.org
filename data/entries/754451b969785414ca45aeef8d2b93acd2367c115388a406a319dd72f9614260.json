Methods: Consecutive patients with pathologically diagnosed stage III/IV NSCLC who underwent first-line chemoimmunotherapy were retrospectively enrolled. The clinical outcomes used for biomarker evaluation were Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Overall Survival (OS). Results: Non-responders had significantly higher values of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR, median: 5.36; IQR: 2.78–10.82 vs. 3.31; IQR: 2.15–4.12, p = 0.019), neutrophil to monocyte ratio (NMR, median: 14.00; IQR: 8.82–21.20 vs. 9.20; IQR: 7.45–11.20, p = 0.013), and systemic inflammation index (SII, median: 1,395; IQR: 929–3,334 vs. 945; IQR: 552–1,373, p = 0.025), but only NLR and NMR remained independently related with clinical response in multivariate logistic regression. In univariate analysis white blood cells (OR:1.2202; 95% CI: 1.0339 - 1.4400, p=0.019), neutrophils (OR:1.2916; 95% CI: 1.0692 - 1.5604, p=0.008), NLR (OR:1.3601: 95% CI: 1.0949 - 1.6896, p=0.005) and NMR (OR:1.2159; 95% CI: 1.00396 - 1.4221, p=0.015) were significantly associated with survival; Cox regression models confirmed that neutrophils, NLR and MLR were independently associated with survival; NLR at a cut-off value of 4.0 showed the better AUC (0.749) in predicting survival. Conclusions: Baseline complete blood cell count biomarkers, especially the NLR, can predict clinical outcomes in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with first-line chemoimmunotherapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"754451b969785414ca45aeef8d2b93acd2367c115388a406a319dd72f9614260","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
