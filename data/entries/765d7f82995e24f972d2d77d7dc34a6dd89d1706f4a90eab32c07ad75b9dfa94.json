{"title":"88 Impacts of trace mineral source and ancillary drench on steer performance during a 60-day backgrounding phase","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/20/7617954?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This experiment evaluated the impacts of supplementing organic complexed Cu, Co, Mn, and Zn on productive and health responses of high-risk beef cattle during a 60-d backgrounding phase. Crossbred steers (n = 120) were purchased at auction and transported to the experimental facility. Steer BW was recorded at arrival (d -1; initial shrunk BW = 227.7 ± 1.3 kg). On d 0, steers were ranked by BW and allocated to 1 of 8 groups (8 steers/group) and housed in drylot pens (6 m x 12 m) equipped with GrowSafe automated feeding systems (Model 8000; 2 bunks/pen; d 0 to 60). Groups were randomly assigned to receive a total mixed ration (TMR; 47% corn) containing: 1) sulfate sources of Cu, Co, Mn, and Zn (INR; n = 40); 2) organic complexed sources of Cu, Mn, Co, and Zn (AAC; Zinpro Availa 4; Zinpro Corp., Eden Prairie, MN; n = 40); or 3) AAC and an organic complexed trace mineral drench (APF; 30 mL/hd; Zinpro ProFusion, Zinpro Corp.) on d 0 and ancillary to morbidity treatment (n = 40). Diets provided the same daily amount of energy, protein, macro minerals and trace minerals based on 7 g/steer daily of Zinpro Availa 4. Steers were assessed for bovine respiratory disease (BRD) signs daily. Liver biopsies were performed on day 0, 28 and 60. Final BW was recorded on d 60 and 61. Blood samples were collected on d 0, 2, 6, 10, 13, 21, 28 and 45. No treatment differences were detected (P ≥ 0.23) for TMR intake, final BW, ADG, feed efficiency, or BRD incidence. Mean liver Co concentrations were greater (P = 0.02) in AAC and APF compared with INR steers. Mean liver Cu was greater (P = 0.02) in APF compared with AAC steers. Liver Zn tended to be greater (P = 0.10) on d 28 but less (P = 0.05) on d 60 for INR compared with AAC and APF steers. Plasma cortisol was least (P = 0.05) for steers supplemented with AAC on d 6, whereas AAC steers tended to have greater (P = 0.09) plasma cortisol on d 13 compared with APF. Plasma haptoglobin tended to be greater (P ≤ 0.10) for INR steers on d 28 and 45 compared with AAC and APF. While supplementing cattle with AAC or INR results in similar animal performance and clinical disease, AAC and APF reduces stress and acute phase protein responses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"765d7f82995e24f972d2d77d7dc34a6dd89d1706f4a90eab32c07ad75b9dfa94","category":"Environment"}
