{"title":"Antiparasitary Potential Of Natural And Semi-Synthetic Labdane Diterpenes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1954/v1","date":1721835924000,"content":"In this paper is described the obtention of fourteen derivatives from four natural labdane diterpenes isolated from Copaifera oleoresin, named ent-copalic acid (1), Â¬ent-3beta-acetoxy copalic acid (2), ent-3beta-hydroxy copalic acid (3) and ent-agathic acid (4). All eighteen compounds were assayed against promastigote form of Leishmania amazonensis and trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, revealing two promising compounds related to leishmanicidal activity (IC50 = 5.94 micromolar and 5.31 micromolar) and three promising compounds with trypanocidal activity, two of them (IC50 = 13.31micromolar and IC50 = 15.05micromolar) displaying similar activity as the reference drug (IC50 = 13.12micromolar) and one of them even more potent with IC50 = 0.425micromolar.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"677886ed5e55e27c3d17b44f2d0732608453aa4aac95a51ebc8a64ce3deeb325","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
