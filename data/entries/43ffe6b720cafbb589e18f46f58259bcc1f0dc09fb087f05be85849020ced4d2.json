{"title":"Standing Watch:  Baselining Predictable Events That Influence Maritime Operations in the Context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1522/v1","date":1711431999000,"content":"The authors present a framework for assessing seasonal events which may influence maritime operations. Most maritime-related research tends to focus on single events, such as a storm, but maritime systems operate within complex systems that have some predictable patterns. These predictable patterns due to natural events, such as weather and water levels, can influence operations, while other factors, such as cargo peaks or cultural activities, could also shape maritime systems. By integrating data from emergency management databases and weather information sources with other inputs, the authors created a matrix of regionally specific predictable events that may occur within a region by time of year. The matrix was vetted with various stakeholder groups to verify the information in the matrix. The main findings were that a seasonal event matrix is helpful as a reference for examining operational patterns in a river for various uses, such as training, operational planning, and emergency response coordination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43ffe6b720cafbb589e18f46f58259bcc1f0dc09fb087f05be85849020ced4d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
