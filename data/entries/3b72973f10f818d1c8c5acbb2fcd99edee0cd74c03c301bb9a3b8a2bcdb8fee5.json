Sohn, on behalf of the Global fRAmework of Data collection Used for Adolescent HIV Transition Evaluation (GRADUATE) Advisory Group </p>\r\n\r\nFew national programs and research cohorts within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) document transition-related processes and outcomes for adolescents and young adults living with HIV (AYLH) transitioning to adulthood. Between 2017–2020, The Global fRAmework of Data collection Used for Adolescent HIV Transition Evaluation (GRADUATE) project convened a collaborative advisory group to identify key variables and definitions capturing the process, predictors, and outcomes across the transition period. In total, 114 variables identified as essential to measuring AYLH transition-related data were identified and formatted into a GRADUATE Data Exchange Standard (DES), which was added to and harmonized with the existing International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) DES. In 2019, the GRADUATE DES was pilot tested at four IeDEA facilities in Malawi, South Africa, and Thailand through a cross-sectional study. Upon comparing the variables to routine medical records, available data were too limited to adequately capture transition-related processes and outcomes. However, additional data collection using GRADUATE tools was feasible and improved completeness. Of the 100 (52% female) AYLH included in the pilot study, 71% had transitioned/transferred to adult care, with 42% transitioning from an adolescent-specific model of care within an integrated family clinic to having their clinic visits scheduled on a different day of the week while 58% transferred from a pediatric facility to one offering adult HIV care. While almost all (94%) had a transition-related discussion with their healthcare providers prior to the transition, we found that 69% (95% CI 49–85%) were somewhat or very satisfied/comfortable with the post-transfer clinic and the staff. Utilization of the GRADUATE DES better characterized AYLH transitioning to adulthood across LMICs, and optimally measured transition preparation activities and outcomes. Utilization of the GRADUATE DES in other settings could facilitate comparisons and identify gaps in the care of transitioning adolescents that need to be addressed.","author":"Priscilla R.
