{"title":"Eco-Friendly Dyeing Processes of Nylon 6.6 woven Fabrics with Used Coffee Grounds (UCG)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0114/v1","date":1725289128000,"content":"(1) Background: The increasing demand for sustainable practices in the textile industry has led to the exploration of natural dyes and eco-friendly dyeing processes. This study focuses on the potential of used coffee grounds (UCG) as an eco-friendly natural dye for Nylon 6.6 woven fabrics. (2) Methods: Five dyeing processes were evaluated, varying in the use of mordants and acids, to assess their impact on color saturation, colorfastness to laundering, and crocking resistance of Nylon 6.6. fabric. The processes included a control with no mordant or acid and others that incorporated tannic acid, acetic acid, and ferrous sulfate heptahydrate. (3) Results: The results demonstrated that Process 4, which combined tannic acid pre-mordanting with acetic acid in the dye bath, provided the best balance between color saturation and colorfastness. Process 2, utilizing only tannic acid, offered some durability in laundering and crocking tests. Process 5, being the least eco-friendly process demonstrated high color saturation, but it performed poorly in colorfastness to crocking, which means that it releases the UCG-based dye after rubbing of the dyed Nylon 6.6. fabric. (4) Conclusions: The findings confirm that UCG can be an effective and sustainable natural dye for Nylon 6.6, with pre-mordanting and acid treatment significantly enhancing dye uptake and retention. However, further research is needed to optimize color intensity and expand the application of UCG in textile dyeing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6472e91b5a8c69903b5d40add94e6f9ea6be5fdfdbfec51faa50596bf05009e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
