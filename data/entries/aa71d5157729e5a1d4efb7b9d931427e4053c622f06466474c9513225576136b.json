{"title":"Wound Healing Efficacy of Cellulose Hydrogel on ICR Mice: A Morphoanatomical, Histological and Genomic Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1941/v1","date":1727189851000,"content":"Chronic wounds remain a major challenge in healthcare, with conventional dressings often leading to infections and lacking advanced healing capabilities. This study evaluated the wound healing potential of NIMO-CH, a cellulose hydrogel derived from nipa fronds and enriched with indigenous microorganisms, particularly Lacticaseibacillus paracasei BCRC-16100. Using ICR mice with excisional wounds, three treatments were compared: no treatment, NIMO-CH, and DuoDERM. Results showed that NIMO-CH and DuoDERM both achieved 100% wound closure, with NIMO-CH-treated wounds showing complete healing with hair growth by day 18-20, while untreated wounds healed by day 20. Minimal scarring was observed in both NIMO-CH and DuoDERM groups. Histological analysis confirmed similar healing processes, including granulation tissue formation and moderate inflammatory responses, with no significant differences in collagen fiber orientation. Furthermore, genome sequencing revealed that Lacticaseibacillus paracasei BCRC-16100 contained genes sodA and gsiC, responsible for coding enzymes necessary for the wound healing process. These results suggest that NIMO-CH could be an effective alternative for wound care applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa71d5157729e5a1d4efb7b9d931427e4053c622f06466474c9513225576136b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
