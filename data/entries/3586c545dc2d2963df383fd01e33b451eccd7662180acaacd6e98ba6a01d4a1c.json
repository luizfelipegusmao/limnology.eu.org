{"title":"Modulation of the Adverse Health Effects of Environmental Cadmium Exposure by Zinc and Its Transporters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0302/v1","date":1715042906000,"content":"Zinc (Zn) is the second most abundant metal in the human body, and is essential for the function of 10% of all proteins. As metals cannot be synthesized or degraded, they must be assimilated from diet by specialized transport proteins, which unfortunately also provide an entry route for the toxic metal pollutant cadmium (Cd). The intestinal absorption of Zn depends on the composition of food that is consumed, firstly the amount of Zn itself, and then the quantity of other food constituents such as phytate, protein and calcium (Ca). In cells, Zn is involved in regulation of intermediary metabolism, gene expression, cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and antioxidant defense mechanisms. Cellular influx, efflux, subcellular compartmentalization, and trafficking of Zn are coordinated by transporter proteins, the Solute-Linked Carrier 30A and 39A (SLC30A and SLC39A), known as the ZnT and the Zrt-/Irt-like protein (ZIP). Because of its chemical similarity with Zn and Ca, Cd disrupts the physiological functions of both. The concurrent induction of a Zn efflux transporter ZnT1 (SLC30A1) and metallothionein by Cd disrupts the homeostasis and reduces the bioavailability of Zn. The present review highlights the increased mortality and the severity of various diseases, including those induced by COVID-19 infections, among Cd-exposed persons and the roles of Zn and other transport proteins in the manifestation of Cd cytotoxicity. Special emphasis is given to the potential protective effects of Zn against bone, lung and heart diseases associated with Cd exposure. The difficult challenge of determining a permissible intake level of Cd is discussed in relation to the recommended dietary Zn intake levels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3586c545dc2d2963df383fd01e33b451eccd7662180acaacd6e98ba6a01d4a1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
