{"title":"Study on the Wear Resistance Performance of Hot Rolled BTW1/Q345 Composite Plate Under Different Annealing Temperature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0958/v1","date":1720708540000,"content":"Wear-resistant steel/carbon steel composite plate not only has the double performance advantage of high strength and wear-resistance, but also can reduce energy consumption and production cost. Based on 50% reduction rate, the wear resistance of BTW1/Q345 composite was studied at different annealing temperatures, and the dry friction and wear tests of BTW1/Q345 composite at different annealing temperatures were carried out by using RETC MFT-5000. The macro-micro morphology and wear mechanism of wear marks at different annealing temperatures were analyzed by using white light interference three-dimensional surface profiler, Scanning electron microscope scanning electron microscope (SEM) and backscatter electron diffraction (EBSD) . The results show that with the increase of annealing temperature, the grain size near the scratch of BTW1 in the wear-resistant layer of the composite plate is refined, and the wear-resistant property is higher than that of the original sample.When the annealing temperature is 860â„ƒ,the wear resistance is the best.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c9f735e522dc65f25112b60f0b395c6ecf303b49ee05def7f47a5ff65fe2c0c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
