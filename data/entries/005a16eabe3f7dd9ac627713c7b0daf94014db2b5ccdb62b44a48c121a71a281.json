{"title":"Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Investigation on the Permeation of Sodium and Chloride Ions through Nanopores in Graphene and Hexagonal Boron Nitride Membranes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0578/v1","date":1710177153000,"content":"Nanoporous membranes promise energy-efficient water desalination. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), like graphene, exhibits outstanding physical and chemical properties, making it a promising candidate for water treatment. We employed Carâ€“Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations to establish accurate modeling of Na+ and Cl- permeation through hydrogen passivated nanopores in graphene and h-BN membranes. In these complex systems the classical potentials cannot properly account for the physics at play. We demonstrate that ion separation works well for the h-BN by imposing a barrier of 0.13 eV and 0.24 eV for Na+ and Cl- permeation respectively, compared to the graphene where the Cl- ion faces a negative barrier of 0.68 eV and is prone toward blockade and Na+ permeation is associated with a slightly negative barrier of 0.03 eV. From the change in the solvation shell, we get the following trend: Na/h-BN &gt; Na/G &gt; Cl/G &gt; Cl/h-BN. We argue that the trend in the permeation barrier changes to Cl-h-BN &gt; Na-h-BN &gt; Na-G &gt; Cl-G due to a combination of several interactions, including the distortion of the water network induced by the ions, the ion-water interaction, and the ion-nanopore interaction. Overall, the desalination performance of h-BN surpasses that of their graphene counterparts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"005a16eabe3f7dd9ac627713c7b0daf94014db2b5ccdb62b44a48c121a71a281","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
