{"title":"Combining capillary electrophoresis and chemometric tools for the straightforward determination of imidazolinone herbicides in plant‐based milks","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13948?af=R","date":1728305637000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Highly polar herbicides, such as imidazolinones, are used for weed control to increase agricultural productivity and crop quality. However, their misapplication can lead to residues in ready-to-eat food with a potential health risk for consumers. Hence, the fast determination of these herbicides is necessary for timely action. In this work, an eco-friendly method based on capillary zone electrophoresis combined with chemometrics was used for the determination of imazapyr and imazamox in vegetable-based beverages such as soy and quinoa milk.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The analytical strategy consisted of only three steps: (i) protein precipitation prior to sample injection (ii) data pre-processing to reduce the background and make corrections on electrophoretic times shift, and (iii) resolution of fully overlapped capillary electrophoresis (CE) peaks by the well-known partial least square (PLS) algorithm, which extracts quantitative information attributed to the analytes. The method was successfully applied in the concentration range between 1.00 and 100 μg L<sup>−1</sup> with coefficient of determination of the calibration (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup>\n<sub>cal</sub>) and prediction (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup>\n<sub>pred</sub>) &gt; 0.90, residual prediction deviation of calibration (RPD<sub>cal</sub>) and of prediction (RPD<sub>pred</sub>) &gt; 3, and relative error of prediction (REP) &gt; 11 in the analyzed sample matrices, in the three built methods (quinoa samples, soy samples, and joint quinoa and soy samples).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The proposed methodology offers a simple and quick alternative for determining imidazolinones at trace concentrations in vegetable beverages, such as quinoa and soy milk, without complex sample preparation. The results were consistent with those obtained using more complex techniques, confirming the applicability of this method. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ángela Y.
