{"title":"From Single Shot to Structure: End-to-End Network based Deflectometry for Specular Free-Form Surface Reconstruction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1913/v1","date":1727256736000,"content":"Deflectometry is a key component in the precise measurement of specular (mirrored) surfaces, however traditional methods often lack an end-to-end approach that performs 3D reconstruction in a single shot with high accuracy and generalizes across different free-form surfaces. This paper introduces a novel deep neural network (DNN)-based approach for end-to-end 3D reconstruction of free-form specular surfaces using single-shot deflectometry. Our proposed network, VUDNet, innovatively combines discriminative and generative components to accurately interpret orthogonal fringe patterns and generate high-fidelity 3D surface reconstructions. By leveraging a hybrid architecture integrating a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a modified U-Net, VUDNet excels in both depth estimation and detail refinement, achieving superior performance in challenging environments. Extensive data simulation using Blender, leading to a dataset which we are making available, ensures robust training and enables the network to generalize across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of VUDNet, setting a new standard for 3D surface reconstruction. The implementation of VUDNet is available on GitHub at https://github.com/hadious/VUDNet.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59357dfb56a9a053748d52418d1c3f506e62d5c239492be844870506535640f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
