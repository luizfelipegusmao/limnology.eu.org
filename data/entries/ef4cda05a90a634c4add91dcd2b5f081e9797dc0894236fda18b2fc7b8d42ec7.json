{"title":"Applications of Machine Learning and Remote Sensing in Soil and Water Conservation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0048/v1","date":1727775426000,"content":"The application of machine learning (ML) and remote sensing (RS) in soil and water conserva-tion has become a powerful tool. As analytical tools continue to advance, the variety of ML al-gorithms and RS sources has expanded, providing opportunities for more sophisticated analyses. At the same time, researchers are required to select appropriate technologies based on research objectives, topic, and scope of the study area. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on the application of ML algorithms and RS that has been implemented to advance research in soil and water conservation. The key contribution of this review paper is that it provides an overview of current research areas within soil and water conservation and their effectiveness in improving prediction accuracy and resource management in categorized subfields, including biomass-vegetation, soil properties, hydrology and water resources, and wildfire management. We also highlight challenges and future directions based on limitations of ML and RS applica-tions in soil and water conservation. This review aims to serve as a reference for researchers and decision-makers by offering insights into the effectiveness of ML and RS applications in the field of soil and water conservation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef4cda05a90a634c4add91dcd2b5f081e9797dc0894236fda18b2fc7b8d42ec7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
