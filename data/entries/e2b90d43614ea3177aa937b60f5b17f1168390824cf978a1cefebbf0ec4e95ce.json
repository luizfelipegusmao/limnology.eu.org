{"title":"240 Feed preference of weanling pigs fed diets containing extruded corn ground to different particle sizes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/234/7757408?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective was to test the null hypothesis that there were no effects of reducing particle size of extruded corn on feed preference by weanling pigs. Three corn-based diets containing extruded corn ground to 700, 500, or 300 μm were prepared. An 8-d feed preference test was conducted with all possible combinations of the three diets. Each pair of diets constituted a treatment group (i.e., 700 vs. 500 μm; 700 vs. 300 μm; 500 vs. 300 μm). A total of 48 growing pigs [initial body weight (BW) = 12.1 ± 1.34 kg] were allotted to the three preference test combinations using a randomized complete block design with initial BW group as the blocking factor, resulting in eight replicate pens per treatment group. Two pigs were housed in each pen. Pigs had ad libitum access to feed and water. For each preference test, each pen contained two feeders with two of the three diets. Feeder positions within each pen were switched daily to minimize positional preference. Feed allotments and feed disappearances were recorded daily. Feed preference (%) was calculated by dividing the amount of feed disappeared for each diet by the total amount of two diets consumed by pigs. Three statistical models for each preference test included particle size of corn as fixed effect and block as random effect. Results indicated that pigs had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) daily feed disappearance and preference for corn with 700 µm on d 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8 when pigs had a choice between 700 µm vs. 500 µm (Table 1). For the other two preference tests, which were 700 µm vs. 300 µm and 500 µm vs. 300 µm, pigs had a greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) preference for the larger particle size corn (700 and 500 µm, respectively) for d 3 to 8. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that pigs have a preference for larger particle sizes of extruded corn when given the choice. This may be a result of better texture of feed, a satisfying chewing experience, and the perception of greater bulkiness provided by greater particle sizes. However, further research with longer-term feeding trials is needed because pigs may have already adapted to consuming diets with 700 µm particle size prior to the experiment, which is similar to commercial diets.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"e2b90d43614ea3177aa937b60f5b17f1168390824cf978a1cefebbf0ec4e95ce","category":"Environment"}
