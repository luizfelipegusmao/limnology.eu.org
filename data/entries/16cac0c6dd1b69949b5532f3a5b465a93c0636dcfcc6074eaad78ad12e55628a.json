{"title":"On the Salient Regularities of Strings of Assembly Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1581/v3","date":1728869583000,"content":"Using assembly theory of strings of any natural radix b we find some of their salient regularities. In particular, we show that the upper bound of the assembly index depends on the radix b both quantitatively and qualitatively, and the longest length N of a string that has the assembly index of N-k is given by N(N-k)=b2+b+3k-2 for k={1,2,3,4}. We also provide particular forms of such strings. For k=1 such odd length strings are nearly balanced and there are four such different strings if b=2 and seventy-two if b=3. The assembly depth of a string has a value between the minimum assembly index for the length of this string and the assembly index of this string. Since these results are valid also for b=1, assembly theory subsumes information theory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16cac0c6dd1b69949b5532f3a5b465a93c0636dcfcc6074eaad78ad12e55628a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
