The exotic plant and animal hobbies are highly organized with internal cultures that are often poorly understood by non-members; however, understanding them is of central importance for biocommerce with both direct and indirect consequences for the conservation of wild populations.\n\nGrowing international demands for exotic species leaves simple questions related to the economics of biocommerce unexplored. The long-term success of biocommerce businesses requires constant income, meaning they obtain and retain significant market proportions. Some biocommerce products can be reproduced by hobbyists and undercut business efforts based on sustainably produced exports.\n\nWe analyse a test case in Neotropical poison frogs where sustainable biocommerce is burgeoning, yet (export-based) businesses face direct market competition from the offspring produced within the countries, which receive their exports, and therefore are forced to rely on fervent customer support.\n\n<i>Solution</i>: We survey customers' behaviours where we find different classes of consumers, which differ in where they place higher values within the hobby. By taking into account these different classes, we gain insights and potential solutions to promote the stability of this unique type of biocommerce.\n</p>","author":"Justin Yeager, \nJuan Manuel ScarpettaÂ Gonzalez, \nAlexander Shepack","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecological Solutions and Evidence: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2d59a3492421ff8dc6c930252c6b4149e9691eaa8596381f5a50d8e1d8243fb4","entryHash":"bda23dd66d97ff2bcb44f4fddb3afcf1ed2917284db45feee7fcc9d94af4af86","category":"Environment"}
