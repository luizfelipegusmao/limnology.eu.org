Existing studies suffer from short filming durations, limited data volume, and a narrow range of sediment transport intensity variations. This paper employs the high-speed photography technology and conducts experimental studies on bedload particle motion under 8 different sediment transport intensities. Using the latest image processing technology, over 6 million sediment particle coordinate points and nearly 400,000 particle motion trajectory curves were automatically obtained and used to compare the motion characteristics of bedload particles under different sediment transport intensities. The results show that under low sediment transport intensity, both the number of moving particles and particle motion velocity contribute to the bedload sediment transport rate, while under high-intensity conditions, the transport rate mainly depends on the number of moving particles. The probability density distribution of sediment transport rate is concentrated and varies within a small range under low-intensity conditions, exhibiting a tailing phenomenon. In contrast, under high-intensity conditions, the range of sediment transport rate values increases, and the probability density curve tends to be symmetric, more closely approximating a normal distribution. Additionally, the paper compares the longitudinal and transverse motion velocities of particles and the coefficient of variation of the bedload sediment transport rate.</p>","author":"Chunjing Liu, \nLingfeng Zhang, \nYu Zhang, \nXiaopeng Jiang, \nFei Liu, \nLeilei Gu, \nJing Lu","siteTitle":"Wiley: River: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0b74d58d2572beb2996093d38ec1aeffad4d7646e8152f056f56cbe7cdd98b36","entryHash":"cd8a3f5b1aac27694be3bad83644ad771dc58dbc210a904c776848475d472826","category":"Environment"}
