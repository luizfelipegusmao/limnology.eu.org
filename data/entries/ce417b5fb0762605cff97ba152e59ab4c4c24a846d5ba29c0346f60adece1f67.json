Right sided colon cancer  is less common than left sided, occurring more frequently in females, and associated with an older age and poor prognosis.

After further evaluation, he was diagnosed with right sided colon adenocarcinoma complicated by peri-colonic abscess formation. He was treated with hemicolectomy without immunotherapy. Considering the scarcity of data concerning colonic abscess formation and colorectal adenocarcinoma, more research is needed on this dual presentation.
