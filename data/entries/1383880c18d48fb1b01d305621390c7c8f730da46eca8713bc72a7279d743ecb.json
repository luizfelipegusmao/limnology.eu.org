{"title":"Thermophysical Characterization of Materials for Energy-Efficient Double Diaphragm Preforming","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0387/v1","date":1717738217000,"content":"The Double Diaphragm Forming (DDF) process uses vacuum pressure and heat to pre-shape composite reinforcements between flexible diaphragms. Accurate modelling of heat transfer within DDF requires knowledge of the thermophysical properties of the constituent materials. This study investigates the specific heat and thermal conductivity of silicone diaphragms, carbon fibers (chopped and powdered), thermoplastic veils, and their combinations. Experiments measured the specific heat of each material using differential scanning calorimetry and the thermal conductivity of silicone and carbon fabric preforms using the transient plane source method and modified transient plane source method respectively. The influence of reheating cycles on specific heat of carbon fiber-veil samples and the effect of compaction on thermal conductivity of silicone and carbon fabrics were explored. While silicone exhibited linear specific heat behavior, the thermoplastic veil showed non-linearity due to phase change. The combined carbon fiber-veil samples demonstrated slight non-linear specific heat variations depending on reheating cycles. Thermal conductivity of the fabric preforms decreased with the addition of thermoplastic veil and under vacuum-compaction conditions. The established temperature-dependent property relationships provide valuable data for optimizing DDF preforming parameters and enhancing energy efficiency in composite manufacturing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1383880c18d48fb1b01d305621390c7c8f730da46eca8713bc72a7279d743ecb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
