{"title":"Industrial Decarbonization through Blended Combustion of Natural Gas and Hydrogen","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0708/v1","date":1720501215000,"content":"The transition to cleaner energy sources, particularly in hard-to-abate industrial sectors, often requires gradual integration of new technologies. Hydrogen, crucial for decarbonization, is explored as a fuel in blended combustions. Blending or replacing fuels impacts combustion stability and heat transfer rates due to differing densities. An extensive literature review examines blended combustion, focusing on hydrogen-methane mixtures. While industrial burners claim to accommodate up to 20% hydrogen, theoretical support is lacking. A novel thermodynamic analysis methodology is introduced, evaluating methane-hydrogen combustion using the Wobbe index. Findings highlight practical limitations beyond 25% hydrogen volume, necessitating a shift to \"totally hydrogen\" combustion. Blended combustion can be proposed as a medium-term strategy, acknowledging hydrogen's limited penetration. Higher percentages require burner and infrastructure redesign.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee3d5e9400c0aeaa5be455d693216e1d9787f5e9a39fbab129c4e35367d66000","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
