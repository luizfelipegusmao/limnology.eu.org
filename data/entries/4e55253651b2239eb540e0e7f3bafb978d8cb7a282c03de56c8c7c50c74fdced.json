{"title":"Association between ADIPOQ Gene Polymorphisms and Diabetic Retinopathy Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2071/v1","date":1719613228000,"content":"Background and Objectives: Recent studies have focused on the association between the risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and rs1501299 and rs2241766 polymorphisms of the ADIPOQ gene, whereas their results remain inconclusive. Thus, a systematic review and meta-analysis was car-ried out to clarify the role of these polymorphisms in the development of DR.\nMaterials and Methods: A systematic research of electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) was conducted until June 16, 2023, and a reference list of relevant articles was collected, which explored the association between rs1501299 and rs2241766 polymorphisms of the ADIPOQ gene and the risk of DR. The pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated via random-effects model and the meta-analysis was implemented by using Review Manager 5.4. \nResults: In total, 6 out of 178 studies, with 1,888 cases (DR) and 2,285 controls (without DR), were included in the meta-analysis. A statistically significant association between rs1501299 poly-morphism and DR risk was recorded in G vs. T in the overall analysis (OR=0.84, 95% CI=0.72-0.99, p=","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e55253651b2239eb540e0e7f3bafb978d8cb7a282c03de56c8c7c50c74fdced","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
