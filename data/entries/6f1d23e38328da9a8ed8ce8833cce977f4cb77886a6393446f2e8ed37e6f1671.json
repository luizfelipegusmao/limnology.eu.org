{"title":"Impact of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-related complications on in-hospital mortality","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300713","date":1711375200000,"content":"<p>by Eunae Byun, Pil Je Kang, Sung Ho Jung, Seo Young Park, Sang Ah Lee, Tae-Won Kwon, Yong-Pil Cho</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a well-established treatment for supporting severe cardiopulmonary failure, the morbidity and mortality of patients requiring ECMO support remain high. Evaluating and correcting potential risk factors associated with any ECMO-related complications may improve care and decrease mortality. This study aimed to assess the predictors of ECMO-related vascular and cerebrovascular complications among adult patients and to test the hypothesis that ECMO-related complications are associated with higher in-hospital mortality rates.</p> Methods <p>This single-center, retrospective study included 856 ECMO runs administered via cannulation of the femoral vessels of 769 patients: venoarterial (VA) ECMO (<i>n</i> = 709, 82.8%) and venovenous (VV) ECMO (<i>n</i> = 147, 17.2%). The study outcomes included the occurrence of ECMO-related vascular and cerebrovascular complications and in-hospital death. The association of ECMO-related complications with the risk of in-hospital death was analyzed.</p> Results <p>The incidences of ECMO-related vascular and cerebrovascular complications were 20.2% and 13.6%, respectively. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 48.7%: 52.8% among VA ECMO runs and 29.3% among VV ECMO runs. Multivariable analysis indicated that age (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01), cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01), continuous renal replacement therapy (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01), and initial platelet count [&lt;50×10<sup>3</sup>/μL (<i>P</i> = 0.02) and 50–100(×10<sup>3</sup>)/μL (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01)] were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. ECMO-related vascular and cerebrovascular complications were not independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality rates for VA or VV ECMO runs.</p> Conclusion <p>ECMO-related vascular and cerebrovascular complications were not associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among adult patients.</p>","author":"Eunae Byun","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6f1d23e38328da9a8ed8ce8833cce977f4cb77886a6393446f2e8ed37e6f1671","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
