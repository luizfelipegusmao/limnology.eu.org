{"title":"Encapsulated Bacteria with a Light-Repressed Deadman Switch for Liver Gene Delivery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1631/v5","date":1727165722000,"content":"Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) have been used for liver gene therapy. Hemgenix and Roctavian are AAV-based treatments for hemophilia B and A, respectively. They cost $3 million and $2.8 million per dose, respectively. While AAV vectors may eventually be cheaper to mass produce, a bacteria-based DNA delivery system might be much cheaper for patients. Also, “bactofection” would allow for the delivery of much larger DNA packages. Such a bacterial system may now be possible, and a prototype for the liver could possibly be developed immediately.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f033f50e6fa981bce6bee07a42d3b56f243e8f148c9da7be56f48041db121b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
