{"title":"Dynamic Modulus of Elasticity as a Guideline for Deformation Evaluation by Using the Finite Element Method for Igneous Rocks in the Morelia Region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1831/v1","date":1719461970000,"content":"Understanding and measuring rock characteristics is crucial for scientific and practical applications. This study investigates stone quarries in Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico, evaluating ten quarries (both volcanic and crushed) using diverse analytical methods. Physical properties such as density were measured alongside mechanical tests like uniaxial compressive strength and ultrasonic pulse velocity. Results demonstrate that crushed materials exhibit superior physical and mechanical properties compared to volcanic stones. Advanced techniques including high-magnification scanning electron microscopy and X-ray fluorescence provided insights into surface morphology and elemental composition. Additionally, a novel finite element model was constructed, leveraging dynamic modulus of elasticity (Ed) derived from ultrasonic pulse velocity and maximum load data from uniaxial compressive strength tests. This model facilitated the classification of quarries based on their engineering characteristics. The findings underscore the model’s potential applicability to quarry assessments globally, offering valuable insights into optimizing stone resource utilization and enhancing structural integrity in construction projects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c7c0f70f5d076803df17e8cace686bd530511fba66f8d2e9c31166403072cd2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
