{"title":"Pathways linking health literacy to self-care in diabetic patients with physical disabilities: A moderated mediation model","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299971","date":1710424800000,"content":"<p>by Hye Jin Nam, Ju Young Yoon</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Health literacy is widely considered to be a determinant of self-care behavior in people with diabetes. However, the mechanisms underlying how health literacy is linked to self-care behaviors have not been clearly elucidated. The aim of the present study was to explore the mediating roles of access to healthcare, provider-patient interaction, motivation, self-efficacy in the effect of health literacy on diabetes self-care behaviors among diabetic patients with physical disabilities and investigate the moderating effect of age in a moderated mediation model.</p> Methods <p>The online survey was participated by a total of 214 diabetic patients with physical disabilities from November to December 2021. The moderated mediation analysis was examined using the Hayes’ PROCESS macro modeling tool based on the bias-corrected bootstrapping method.</p> Results <p>After controlling for education, the results yielded a significant indirect effect of health literacy on diabetes self-care through motivation and self-efficacy. A partially mediating relationship also was confirmed, as there is a positive direct effect of health literacy on diabetes self-care. Furthermore, age groups (i.e., age &lt;40 and ≥ 40) functioned as a moderator of the mediating effects of motivation and self-efficacy between health literacy and diabetes self-care.</p> Conclusion <p>This study emphasized the important role of motivation and self-efficacy which play in linking health literacy and self-care behavior, especially for younger diabetic patients with physical disabilities. In the light of these findings, a health-literacy tailored motivation and self-efficacy enhancing program may be key targets for interventions promoting diabetes self-care behaviors in people with physical disabilities.</p>","author":"Hye Jin Nam","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"54ae5be1130e0e7e64e9a4a656a6560b53d9eebfc33f731e4751f97883600bcc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
