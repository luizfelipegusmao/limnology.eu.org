{"title":"Bullfights, advances or setbacks? a global and local perspective, from animal law","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1669/v1","date":1721634001000,"content":"The purpose of this disquisition is to analyze bullfighting, its advances and setbacks at a global and local level in terms of animal law. It was developed as a descriptive documentary research with a non-experimental design, using the observation and interpretation of documents related to the subject, from the global level, to the local, the national, specific to the regions and communities, being interpreted through the hermeneutic method. In the analysis, results were reached such as: every day more countries are willing to assume that bulls, because they are living beings that feel, are being attended to from the legal and the ethical, propitiating changes in the way of thinking of people in terms of wanting to consider bullfighting, a sport, art and hobby considered cultural heritage of many countries. For this reason, different actions have been generated from surveys, to define the acceptance or not of these events. It is concluded that there are important advances in this regard, as bullfighting is being prohibited in different parts of the world, taking into account the protection that protects animals, but the laws do not establish specific prohibition in this regard worldwide.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0666f28719937952935fd1d4b3870412478748974445d15529b49139785b4250","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
