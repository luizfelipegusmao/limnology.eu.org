{"title":"Hematological changes in Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus) supplemented with β‐glucan and Pediococcus acidilactici synbiotic","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15645?af=R","date":1712853919000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Florida pompano (<i>Trachinotus carolinus</i>) are a species of growing interest for commercial aquaculture. Effective health monitoring is crucial to the successful growout of the species, and prophylactic and therapeutic use of chemicals and antibiotics has been the traditional strategy for promoting stock health. However, concerns about antimicrobial resistance, chemical residues in seafood products and the environment, and resultant immunosuppression have prompted the industry to identify alternative management strategies, including supplementation with prebiotics, probiotics, and combinations of both (synbiotics). The objectives of this study are to determine and compare hematological, plasma biochemical, and plasma protein electrophoresis data of synbiotic-supplemented (β-glucan and <i>Pediococcus acidilactici</i>) and non-supplemented Florida pompano. Reference intervals for blood analytes are provided for both groups and for subgroups (females, males, large, and small fish) where statistically significant results exist. There are no differences between the hematological and plasma biochemistry analytes between the supplemented and control groups, except for blood urea nitrogen and carbon dioxide, indicating a possible effect of synbiotic supplementation on gill function and osmoregulation. Sex-related and size-related differences are observed within each of the control and supplemented groups; however, biometric measurements do not strongly correlate with blood analytes. These data represent baseline hematological and plasma biochemical data in the Florida pompano and indicate the safety of synbiotic supplementation in this commercially important species. This study serves to further the commercialization of Florida pompano by providing blood analyte reference intervals for health monitoring in the aquaculture setting.</p>","author":"Ashley N.
