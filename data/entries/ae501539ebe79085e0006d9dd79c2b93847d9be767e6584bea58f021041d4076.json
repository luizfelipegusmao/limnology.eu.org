{"title":"Analysis of inhibition mechanisms of Streptococcus agalactiae by Siganus oramin L‐amino acid oxidase","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16093?af=R","date":1667394512000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In a previous experiment, an L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) from the serum of <i>Siganus oramin</i> (SR) had a strong inhibitory effect on <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i>. But we did not know inhibition mechanisms of SR-LAAO against <i>S. agalactiae</i>. In this study, after <i>S. agalactiae</i> was treated with SR-LAAO and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) at the minimal bactericidal concentration, scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that there are differences in cell size, degree of surface wrinkle and internal dissolution. These observations suggested that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can cause more serious damage to <i>S. agalactiae</i> than SR-LAAO. The metabolites of <i>S. agalactiae</i> that has been treated with SR-LAAO or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were analysed and compared. A total of 438 positive ion metabolites were detected and 129 were significantly different between SR-LAAO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We detected 351 negative ion metabolites, of which 104 were significantly different. It should be noted that in the differential amino acid analysis, L-ergothioneine was the most significantly up-regulated amino acid in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment group, which suggested that it may be related to the function of SR-LAAO. Direct mixing of L-ergothioneine and SR-LAAO did not extend the inhibition zone, which suggested that ergothioneine could not react directly with SR-LAAO, to enhance the antibacterial ability. However, the results of challenge experiments and the qRT-PCR experiment proved that ergothioneine can up-regulate the expression of SR-LAAO and reduce the mortality of <i>S. agalactiae-</i>challenged zebrafish. This study further revealed the antibacterial mechanism of fish LAAO and provided a foundation for future research.</p>","author":"Yuxi Huang, \nXiao Han, \nHuan Peng, \nXiaohang Wang, \nRuijun Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"ae501539ebe79085e0006d9dd79c2b93847d9be767e6584bea58f021041d4076","category":"Environment"}
