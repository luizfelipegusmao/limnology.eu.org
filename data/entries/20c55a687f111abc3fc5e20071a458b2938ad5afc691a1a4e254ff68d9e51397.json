{"title":"Analyzing Traditional Building Materials: A Case Study on Repair Practices in Konuralp, Düzce-Türkiye","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0075/v1","date":1722563234000,"content":"Some wrong decisions and faulty practices applied during the repair and restoration of traditional buildings cause more damage to the structures due to the materials used in the repair. In this study, brick, mortar, plaster, and wood samples were taken from one registered building in the Konuralp neighborhood of Düzce Province, which has survived to the present day by preserving its original structural features and reflecting the characteristics of traditional housing. Texture, chemical and petrographic analyses were carried out on the samples. In line with these analyses, a scientific basis was created for selecting material properties in the repair and reuse processes of traditional buildings, and suggestions are made for the analysis of materials specific to traditional buildings in Konuralp.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"20c55a687f111abc3fc5e20071a458b2938ad5afc691a1a4e254ff68d9e51397","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
