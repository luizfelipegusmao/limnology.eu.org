{"title":"An In-silico Designing of Vaccine against All Serotypes of Dengue Virus Based on Virtual Screening of B-Cell and T-Cell Epitopes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0023/v1","date":1719817935000,"content":"Dengue virus is a global health problem most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. However, after the approval of two vaccines, Dengvaxia, TV003/TV005 of Takeda, for its prevention, problems were reported, like enhanced risks of infection or less efficiency of protection. Since then, more struggles have been in demand for the development of better vaccines. Here, we conducted a new design through an in-silico strategy. Initially, epitopes were chosen based on their antigenicity, immunogenicity, and binding affinity with MHC molecule, while excluded with allergenicity, toxicity and potential risk of antibody dependent enhancement. Subsequently, a core antigen was constructed with selected epitopes and linked with distinct adjuvant proteins to achieve three candidate vaccines, PSDV-1~3. PSDV-2 was chosen for further validation based on their advantage in physicochemical and structural properties. With a panel of simulations, this artificial protein showed tight binding with pattern recognition receptors, good stability, robust immune induction, and ultimately was confirmed as a high quality vaccine candidate. The plasmid for its recombinant expression was then designed accordingly. With our new design, one more choice was obtained for the effective protection from Dengue virus. Further experimental validations are still require to confirm it protection capacity and safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"af068ee89d847124e51a4254b278ada4c43c61c8f2d348a235a498422b68f578","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
