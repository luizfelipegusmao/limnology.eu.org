{"title":"Ruthenium-Based Sensors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2086/v1","date":1721975497000,"content":"In the periodic table of the elements, ruthenium is ideally placed, right in the middle, just above iron. And like iron, it possesses several oxidation states, with +2 and +3 being the most common. Accordingly, ruthenium chemistry is extremely rich and well developed, ruthenium complexes show excellent catalytic aptitude, tremendous redox capacity, and intriguing biological activity. However, in the design of sensors, the use of ruthenium complexes remains scarce, despite valuable electro- and photochemical properties. Therefore, there is an opportunity here, and ruthenium-based complexes might become one day, key players in sensing technology. Starting ourselves a new research project with ruthenium-based sensors, writing this review was essential to see the current state of research in the field, to identify opportunities, and to have an overview of state-of-the-art examples.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d3630ee00f364425822392d0b93fa1dad0d0581a6aa7a4d232fb8c926211107","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
