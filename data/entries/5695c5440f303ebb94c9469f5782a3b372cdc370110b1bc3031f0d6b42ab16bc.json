{"title":"Solving the Problem of Infinities in Electrodynamics (and Mechanics) and a New Formula for the Electrostatic Potential","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0631/v1","date":1718088320000,"content":"The presented work shows that a force (electromagnetic or gravitational) field surrounding any material body is not limitless, but has the external and internal boundaries (radii). Understanding the fact of the existence of the field boundaries allows us to solve the problem of infinities that exists in electrodynamics. It is shown that there are two different electrostatic potentials: with the dimension of speed and with the dimension of the square of speed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5695c5440f303ebb94c9469f5782a3b372cdc370110b1bc3031f0d6b42ab16bc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
