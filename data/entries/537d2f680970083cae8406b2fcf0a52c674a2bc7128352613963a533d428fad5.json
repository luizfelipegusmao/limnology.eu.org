The presence of species that act as colonizers, pathogens, or even consumers creates evolutionary pressure that drives plants to develop intricate molecular defensive responses. However, growth and defense responses must be perfectly balanced and regulated, as defense responses usually have a negative impact on vegetative growth (<a href=\"#koae188-B3\">Depaepe et al. 2021</a>). Jasmonates (JA) are key players in plant defense responses. JA signaling has been extensively studied, particularly its conjugation with amino acids, especially isoleucine (Ile), and its subsequent sensing by CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1). This process is crucial for targeting and degrading the repressor proteins JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAINS (JAZs), thereby activating the transcription of JA-responsive genes (<a href=\"#koae188-B2\">Chini et al. 2023</a>). Despite these advances, the specific players involved in the downstream effects of JA and its spatiotemporal regulation have not been fully elucidated.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"537d2f680970083cae8406b2fcf0a52c674a2bc7128352613963a533d428fad5","category":"Environment"}
