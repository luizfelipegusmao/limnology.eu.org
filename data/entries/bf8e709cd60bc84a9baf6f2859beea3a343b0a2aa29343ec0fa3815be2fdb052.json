{"title":"Production of Nano and Micro Powders and Composites from Radioactive Waste for the Space Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1466/v1","date":1726724489000,"content":"Taking into account modern technologies in the mining industry and in the processing of industrial waste, we propose to reprocess cemented low- and intermediate level radioactive waste by extracting all chemical compounds from them. Because of the low cost of space flights in the near future, we propose to use chemical compounds, extracted from radioactive waste, in the production of space electronics and structural materials for automatic space probes and rovers. At the same time, since nano- and micro powders, as well as composites with these fillers, are widely used today in electronics and technology, including in the space industry, the production of radioactive powders and composites will provide new scientific results in the field of materials science and solid-state physics, since nothing is known today about the properties of radioactive powders and composites containing radioactive sources inside.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf8e709cd60bc84a9baf6f2859beea3a343b0a2aa29343ec0fa3815be2fdb052","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
