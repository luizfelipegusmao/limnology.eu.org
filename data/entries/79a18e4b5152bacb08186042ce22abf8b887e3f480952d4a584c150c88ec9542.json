{"title":"Insect Protein as a Component of Meat Analogue Burger","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0413/v1","date":1715090112000,"content":"Researchers are exploring solutions to meet the growing demand for protein due to the expected increase in global population by 2050. Interest in alternative protein sources like insects has risen, driven by concerns about environmental impact and the need for sustainable food production. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the physicochemical properties of soy protein-based burger enriched with insect protein from Alphitobius diaperinus. Three formulations were developed: a control (B0), and burgers with 5% (B5) and 10% (B10) insect protein - Whole Buffalo Powder (WBP). Results showed that adding insect protein decreased the burger analogue's pH. There was observed a clear trend of increasing total lipids and SFA, and decreasing MUFA and PUFA, as the WBP concentration increases from 0% to 10%. No significant differences with increasing WBP concentration in the protein content of the burger analogue, as well as the cooking yield, were noted. The WBP addition had a notable effect on the color change, especially decrease in brightness (L*). It was shown that as the WBP concentration increased, there were no significant differences in the texture profile of the burger analogues. The formulation with 5% WBP concentration was the most acceptable in sensory analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"79a18e4b5152bacb08186042ce22abf8b887e3f480952d4a584c150c88ec9542","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
