{"title":"Anthocyanin biosynthesis in goji berry is inactivated by deletion in a bHLH transcription factor LrLAN1b promoter","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1461/7618154?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Black goji berry (<span>Lycium ruthenicum</span> Murray) contains a rich source of health-promoting anthocyanins which are used in herbal medicine and nutraceutical foods in China. A natural variant producing white berries allowed us to identify two key genes involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in goji berries: one encoding a MYB transcription factor (<span>LrAN2-like</span>) and one encoding a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor (<span>LrAN1b</span>). We previously found that <span>LrAN1b</span> expression was lost in the white berry variant, but the molecular basis for this phenotype was unknown. Here, we identified the molecular mechanism for loss of anthocyanins in white goji berries. In white goji, the <span>LrAN1b</span> promoter region has a 229 bp deletion that removes three MYB-binding elements and one bHLH-binding element, which are key to its expression. Complementation of the white goji berry <span>LrAN1b</span> allele with the <span>LrAN1b</span> promoter restored pigmentation. Virus-induced gene silencing of <span>LrAN1b</span> in black goji berry reduced fruit anthocyanin biosynthesis. Molecular analyses showed that LrAN2-like and another bHLH transcription factor LrJAF13 can activate <span>LrAN1b</span> by binding directly to the MYB-recognizing element and bHLH-recognizing element of its promoter-deletion region. <span>LrAN1b</span> expression is enhanced by the interaction of LrAN2-like with LrJAF13 and the WD40 protein LrAN11. LrAN2-like and LrAN11 interact with either LrJAF13 or LrAN1b to form two MYB–bHLH–WD40 complexes, which hierarchically regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in black goji berry. This study on a natural variant builds a comprehensive anthocyanin regulatory network that may be manipulated to tailor goji berry traits.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"1ae06781ebcf0c06193006f00f1cefbdfb1f0a7e433eb99eec9d2e33e1d799e9","category":"Environment"}
