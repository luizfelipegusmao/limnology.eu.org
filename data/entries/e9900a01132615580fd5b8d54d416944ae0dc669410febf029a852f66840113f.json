{"title":"Managing Patients with Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases on Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drug Therapy in a COVID-19 Endemic World: A Narrative Review and Expert Insights","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1071/v1","date":1713281376000,"content":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, individuals with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, face a heightened risk of infection and severe outcomes due to immunological alterations resulting from their underlying conditions and immunosuppressive treatments. Even as the pandemic has transitioned to an endemic state, it remains crucial to recognize that these patients continue to be at risk. In this narrative review, we analyzed existing literature to explore the impact of IMIDs, clinical risk factors, and the influence of immunosuppressive therapies on COVID-19-related risks and outcomes. Notably, certain disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), like rituximab, are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes, and rituximab-treated patients show impaired immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, we outline the diverse effects of glucocorticoids on COVID-19 outcomes and management. To highlight real-life challenges faced by clinicians caring for patients with IMIDs, we present an illustrative scenario that underscores the importance of effective vaccination, timely boosting, and additional mitigation strategies against COVID-19. Given the clinical heterogeneity and diverse disease states within IMIDs, it is crucial to understand the ongoing implications and risks associated with COVID-19 in these patients, to guide the implementation of appropriate measures and optimize care and outcomes in the current endemic era.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9900a01132615580fd5b8d54d416944ae0dc669410febf029a852f66840113f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
