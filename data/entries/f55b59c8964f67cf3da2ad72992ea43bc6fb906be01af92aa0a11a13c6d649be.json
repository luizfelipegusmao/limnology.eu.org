{"title":"New Chymotrypsin Purified and Biochemically Characterized from Digestive Organs of Bigfin Reef Squid (Sepioteuthis les-soniana)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0907/v1","date":1710497206000,"content":"Chymotrypsin from the digestive organs of bigfin reef squid, a major commercial squid species in Thailand, was purified to 41.27-fold with 5.74% yield by a sequential purification process including ammonium sulfate precipitation, size exclusion and ion exchange chromatography. According to SDS-PAGE, the molecular weight of purified chymotrypsin was 43 kDa. Native-PAGE analysis revealed a single band for this purified enzyme. Optimum pH and temperature for chymotrypsin activity of the purified enzyme were pH of 7.0 with a temperatures of 55°C. The purified chymotrypsin remained stable throughout a wide range of pH levels (6–11) and at relatively high temperature (50°C). It was significantly inhibited by PMSF and TPCK. The values of the kinetic constants Km and Kcat were found to be 1.33 mM and 31.46 s‒1, respectively. The purified chymotrypsin has the N-terminal amino acid IVGGQEATPGEWPWQAALQV. This study provided new information about the biochemical properties of pure chymotrypsin from bigfin reef squid, which is useful in the future investigation, aquaculture and application of bigfin reef squid.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f55b59c8964f67cf3da2ad72992ea43bc6fb906be01af92aa0a11a13c6d649be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
