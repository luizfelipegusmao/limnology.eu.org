{"title":"FLOWERING LOCUS T1 and TERMINAL FLOWER1 regulatory networks mediate flowering initiation in apple","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/580/7609599?rss=1","date":1708041600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Flower bud formation is a critical process that directly determines yield and fruit quality in fruit crops. Floral induction is modulated by the balance between 2 flowering-related proteins, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1); however, the mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of this dynamic balance remain largely elusive. Here, we showed that in apple (<span>Malus × domestica</span> Borkh.), <span>MdFT1</span> is predominantly expressed in spur buds and exhibits an increase in expression coinciding with flower induction; in contrast, <span>MdTFL1</span> exhibited downregulation in apices during flower induction, suggesting that MdTFL1 has a role in floral repression. Interestingly, both the <span>MdFT1</span> and <span>MdTFL1</span> transcripts are directly regulated by transcription factor basic HELIX–LOOP–HELIX48 (MdbHLH48), and overexpression of <span>MdbHLH48</span> in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) and tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>) results in accelerated flowering. Binding and activation analyses revealed that MdbHLH48 functions as a positive regulator of <span>MdFT1</span> and a negative regulator of <span>MdTFL1</span>. Further studies established that both MdFT1 and MdTFL1 interact competitively with MdWRKY6 protein to facilitate and inhibit, respectively, MdWRKY6-mediated transcriptional activation of target gene <span>APPLE FLORICAULA</span>/<span>LFY</span> (<span>AFL1</span>, an apple <span>LEAFY</span>-like gene), ultimately regulating apple flower bud formation. These findings illustrate the fine-tuned regulation of flowering by the MdbHLH48-MdFT1/MdTFL1-MdWRKY6 module and provide insights into flower bud formation in apples.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"56c267fb7f50eb1116d6703a49566694793296b202083aa891d35ff2fa51680b","category":"Environment"}
