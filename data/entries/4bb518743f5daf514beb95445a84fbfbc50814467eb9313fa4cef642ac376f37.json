{"title":"The Molecular Bases of Anti-oxidative and Anti-inflammatory Properties of Paraoxonase 1","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0996/v1","date":1728900752000,"content":"Anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) are thought to be mediated by paraoxonase 1 (PON1), a calcium-dependent hydrolytic enzyme carried on a subfraction of HDL that also carries other anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory proteins. In humans and mice, low PON1 activity is associated with elevated oxidized lipids, homocysteine (Hcy)-thiolactone, and proteins modified by these metabolites, which can cause oxidative  stress and inflammation. PON1-dependent metabolic changes can lead to atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and cancer. The molecular bases underlying these associations are not fully understood. Biochemical, proteomic, and metabolic studies have significantly expanded our understanding of mechanisms by which low PON1 leads to disease and high PON1 is protective. Studies discussed in this review highlight the changes in gene expression affecting proteostasis as a cause of the pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory phenotypes associated with attenuated PON1 activity. Accumulating evidence supports the conclusion that PON1 regulates the expression of anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory proteins, and that disruption of these processes leads to disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4bb518743f5daf514beb95445a84fbfbc50814467eb9313fa4cef642ac376f37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
