{"title":"Meta’s Oculus Quest App Lab","link":"https://developer.oculus.com/blog/introducing-app-lab-a-new-way-to-distribute-oculus-quest-apps/","date":1708115414000,"content":"\n<p>So I <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/16/meta-neural-interface\">found an answer</a> to my intrigue regarding Mark Zuckerberg’s off-handed quip about “neural interfaces”, but I’m still at a loss to understand <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/14/zuckerberg-vision-pro\">his positioning of Quest</a> as the “open” alternative to Apple’s “closed” Vision. One friend sent me a pointer to Meta’s “App Lab”, which they announced in February 2021:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whether the goal is to build a business, create a community, test \nand experiment with new apps, or get feedback on new ideas, you \ncontrol how your app is distributed. App Lab supports both free \nand paid apps, which are shareable via a URL or Oculus Keys. While \nApp Lab is distinct from the Oculus Store and App Lab apps won’t \nappear in the Oculus Store, customers who install apps from App \nLab will find them in their Quest library. App Lab apps can also \nbe searched by exact name and found in the “App Lab” section of \nresults. App Lab apps can access the majority of standard platform \nfeatures, including automatic update distribution, platform \nintegration and SDKs, app analytics, release channels, and more. </p>\n\n<p>We’ve taken steps to reduce the technical requirements and Virtual \nReality Checks (VRCs) to make submission as simple as possible. In \norder to promote a safe, secure and positive experience, App Lab \napps are required to comply with our <a href=\"https://developer.oculus.com/policy/app-lab-policies/\">App Lab Policies</a>, \nincluding our <a href=\"https://developer.oculus.com/policy/content-guidelines/\">Oculus Content Guidelines</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.oculus.com/policy/data-use/\">Data Use \nPolicy</a>, and <a href=\"https://developer.oculus.com/policy/app-policies/\">App Policies</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Follow that link to “<a href=\"https://developer.oculus.com/policy/app-policies/\">App Policies</a>” and you’ll see that this doesn’t sound very different from Apple’s iOS-derived platforms:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apps hosted on the platform may not contain, use, or make \navailable commerce solutions — including for app payment \nprocessing, in-app purchases, or in-app advertising — except as \nprovided in the platform SDK, or otherwise expressly agreed by you \nand Meta Platforms Technologies in writing. For example, if your \napp has in-app purchases, and your app is distributed through any \nMeta Platforms Technologies distribution channel, including the \nMeta Quest Store, you must use the Platform In-App Purchases to \nhandle such payment processing. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s also <a href=\"https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto\">a third-party thing called SideQuest</a> that ostensibly lets you “sideload” apps on a Quest, but it requires both desktop software on a Mac or PC and a Meta developer account. I can definitely see how Quest is at least slightly more open than Vision, but on the grand scale of open-vs.-closed platforms, it seems pretty closed. What am I missing?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/16/meta-oculus-app-lapb\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ea8101949ff053ca578fcd8e3dd2119c7b4a7b16e10241fa833896f27fa72673","category":"Tech"}
