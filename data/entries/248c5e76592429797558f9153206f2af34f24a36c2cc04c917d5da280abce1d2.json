{"title":"Comparative Analysis Of The Responses Of Various Bromodomain Inhibitors In Cancer Cell Lines Utilizing Various Machine Learning Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2011/v1","date":1719633584000,"content":"The focus was on developing machine learning models to predict the IC50 values of the compound OTX015 using gene expression levels of cancer cell lines. Through regression-based machine learning models, particularly the SVM model, trained on pre-laboratory data, consistent and generalizable performance with low error scores was achieved. These models underwent enhancement via hyperparameter optimization and were tested on validation data. The results indicate the utility of machine learning in drug discovery processes and personalized medicine, offering rapid and cost-effective predictions of IC50 values. However, for enhanced reliability, further model development, data gathering, and evaluation with diverse compounds are recommended. In conclusion, this research demonstrates the potential of machine learning approaches to optimize experimental processes, reduce costs, and contribute to personalized treatments in healthcare by accurately predicting compound responses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"248c5e76592429797558f9153206f2af34f24a36c2cc04c917d5da280abce1d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
