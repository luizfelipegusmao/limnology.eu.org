{"title":"Control of Membrane Luminescence Using Colloidal Nanocrystals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0509/v1","date":1718087734000,"content":"The optical properties of the Nafion polymer membrane containing colloidal CdSe/CdS/ZnS nanocrystals embedded by diffusion have been studied. The CdSe/CdS/ZnS nanocrystals have a core/shell/shell appearance. A toluene solution was used to provide mobility of the active sul-fone groups of the Nafion membrane and to embed the nanocrystals inside the membrane. The kinetics of the process of nanocrystal embedding into the membrane matrix was studied using luminescence analysis, absorption spectroscopy and laser emission spectroscopy techniques. The diffusion of colloidal CdSe/CdS/ZnS nanocrystals into the Nafion proton exchange membrane resulted in a new molecular complex «Nafion-colloidal CdSe/CdS/ZnS nanocrystals». The pres-ence of new luminescence centers based on CdSe/CdS/ZnS nanocrystals in the membrane was registered using laser emission spectroscopy. Colloidal nanocrystals located in the Nafion ma-trix represent an analogue of a luminescent transducer. The lines contained in the luminescence spectrum of the membrane, which has been in solution with colloidal nanocrystals for a long time, registered upon its drying, show the kinetics of the formation of the molecular complex «Nafion membrane - nanocrystals». The luminescence spectrum of the membrane with nano-crystals contains additional intensity maxima that do not coincide with the spectral lines of the solvent and Nafion membrane. The intensity of the luminescence spectrum of the membrane with embedded nanocrystals is higher than the intensity of the secondary emission peak of the initial nanocrystals, which is important for the practical use of the complex «Nafion-colloidal nanocrystals» in optical systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"901c29586d503b88741de9b3c7dbd65ff0874ebd89e90d1daa0de36b0d613297","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
