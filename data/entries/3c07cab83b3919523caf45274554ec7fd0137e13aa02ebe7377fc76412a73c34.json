{"title":"Hard Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Caused by SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Survival in a Retrospective Cohort Study of 3 Years of Pandemic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0310/v1","date":1728030924000,"content":"Introduction. Mexico confirmed its first COVID-19 case in February 2020. Since then, it has been important to describe the presentation and data of critically ill patients with ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nObjectives. To determine the survival of critically ill patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2. Secondary objectives are to identify factors associated with mortality in these patients and to evaluate 90-day survival based on these risk factors.\nMaterials and Methods. This observational, retrospective study was conducted in an ICU at a tertiary hospital in Mexico City (March 2020 - March 2023). It included patients over 18 years old with COVID-19 confirmed by PCR, excluding those with negative PCR, those who died within the first 24 hours, or those without invasive mechanical ventilation. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected. Descriptive statistical analyses, logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed. The study was approved by ethical committees and did not require informed consent.\nResults. A total of 157 patients with COVID-19 were studied, with a mean age of 62.8 years and a male predominance (74.5%). ARDS was severe in 68.2%, and acute kidney injury (AKI) developed in 70.1%. The mortality rate was 58.6%, with a 90-day survival of 33.1%. Factors such as AKI (OR = 3.4), hemodynamic failure (OR = 6.5), and elevated lactate (OR = 0.201) were independently associated with mortality, with their impact on survival confirmed by the log-rank test.\nConclusion. In critically ill patients with ARDS due to COVID-19, the 90-day survival rate was 33.1%. AKI, hemodynamic failure, and elevated lactate were associated with reduced survival, especially when AKI was combined with hemodynamic failure (26.7%).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c07cab83b3919523caf45274554ec7fd0137e13aa02ebe7377fc76412a73c34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
