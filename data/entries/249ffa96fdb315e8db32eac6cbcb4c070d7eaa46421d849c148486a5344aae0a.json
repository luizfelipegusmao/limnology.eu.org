They can be either beneficial or detrimental depending on their nature (tensile or compressive) and the application [<a href=\"#ozae044.290-B1\">1</a>]. Additive Manufacturing (AM) of metal alloys, a standout among manufacturing techniques like casting and molding, builds complex three-dimensional objects layer by layer from digital models, with Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) and its subset Selective Laser Melting (SLM) being particularly noted for producing intricate metal parts. SLM employs a high-energy laser to fuse metal powder into solid structures, offering a precise method for creating components [<a href=\"#ozae044.290-B2\">2</a>]. To measure the residual stresses, diffraction techniques like X-ray and neutron diffraction are commonly employed [<a href=\"#ozae044.290-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.290-B4\">4</a>], which rely on a constant Young’s modulus (YM) to evaluate the residual stresses present in metal alloys. In this work, a better and accurate method for mapping residual stresses is utilized, based on correlative and multimodal scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). This method determines the residual stress using the local value of YM, where YM is determined at the same pixel at which the residual strain is measured. The residual stress maps are generated by multiplying the strain maps and YM maps through Hooke’s law as follows: σij=YMεij where σij is the normal and shear components of the residual stress tensor, Ym is the Young’s modulus, and εij is the normal and shear components of the strain tensor. Equation (1) indicates a pixel-by-pixel multiplication of YM and strain maps images to produce residual strain map images. To make sure this method is an accurate way of determining the residual stress, the pixel accuracy must be checked. Pixel accuracy is typically discussed in the realm of image classification or segmentation tasks [<a href=\"#ozae044.290-B5\">5</a>]. However, if we are referring to a scenario where two images are multiplied pixel-by-pixel, pixel accuracy means assessing the accuracy of the multiplication operation. In this work, the pixel accuracy of the generated residual stress map of annealed AlSi10Mg alloy prepared by SLM is assessed. The residual stresses are calculated from the residual strains determined by using the four-dimensional transmission electron microscopy (4DSTEM) technique and YM determined with the scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with the electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) method at the same region and spatial resolution where the strains have been determined. Both methods have been applied in a correlative manner and enabled the determination of these quantities at the nanoscale.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"249ffa96fdb315e8db32eac6cbcb4c070d7eaa46421d849c148486a5344aae0a","category":"Environment"}
