{"title":"Matching of Water Breakthrough in Low Resistivity Oil Reservoir Using Permeability Anisotropy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0010/v1","date":1714530315000,"content":"Uncertainties in initial water saturation and early water breakthroughs of un-known sources and paths, which occurred in the low resistivity Lower Haushi sand-stone (LHS) reservoir at the beginning of oil production, imply that the bypassed oil can yet remain in the reservoir. In addition, the upper part of LHS is a tight oil reser-voir, which can still contain a significant amount of unrecovered oil. This opens the opportunity to produce the remaining oil instead of abandoning this reservoir. \nLow resistivity can exaggerate water saturation, leading to misinterpretation and premature water flooding due to inadequate oil-water contrast. Our analysis revealed a correlation between low resistivity and robust porous network connectivity, along-side elevated formation water salinity in highly porous layers. In regions of high po-rosity, sufficient oil-water contrast facilitates precise water saturation determination, affirming oil presence in all wells. However, within tight oil zones, near-complete wa-ter saturation contradicts actual oil presence. Factors contributing to saturation un-certainty and water breakthroughs were reassessed. Utilizing a 1:1 verti-cal-to-horizontal permeability ratio derived from core data enhanced simulation alignment with water production rates. Investigation into the impact of relative per-meabilities on water production was conducted. Water saturation maps were gener-ated to pinpoint remaining oil reserves. Depletion around wells is evident in lower po-rous regions, while oil persists across the entire tight reservoir, notably in two unex-plored sections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a3e48c049880e68ad68a2752020def1e6ea7e0e8f8897537bbd31be2ede5177","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
