{"title":"Fishery Products Safety, Processing and Utilization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0579/v1","date":1710148122000,"content":"Abstract\nGlobal marine fish harvest has reached a plateau over the last decade. Efforts to increase aquaculture tend to face limitations in water resources and contamination problems. Of the current fish harvest at least 50% is discarded as waste. The chemical and microbiological contaminations limit the utilization of harvested fish. There is a need to improve fish preservation to minimize spoilage and process them into more appealing products. Instead of resorting to individual food processing methods, the efficiency of processing could best be increased by a combination of conventional and modern processing methods, or combinations of modern processing methods. Fish waste is a rich source of oils containing essential fatty acids, polypeptides, and amino polysaccharides that could be utilized through upscaling of the current scientifically proven methods, to new processing technologies. Separation of collagens, gelatins, bioactive peptides, edible fish oils, and chitosan form the primary stages in the utilization of fish waste. The products need purification to meet food quality and safety standards, and desirable industrial characteristics. The diversity of information and products generated through new methods requires advanced data handling and prediction systems, such as artificial intelligence, to address food safety and get the best out of fish processing and utilization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b7d3f256757eb23ea7f0aa55816ab02e4d4c2bdb4edcf54e6e3f64cf7141ecb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
