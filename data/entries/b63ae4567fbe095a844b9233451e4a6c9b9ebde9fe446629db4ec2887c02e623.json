Fortunately, some carbon fixation microorganisms have been found in PHC-contaminated sites. However, most of the studies are related to volatile short-chain PHC, and few studies focus on long-chain PHC-contaminated sites. To reveal the carbon fixation microorganisms in these sites, in the study, a long-chain PHC polluted site in North China was selected. Through hydrochemical and metagenomics analysis, the structure and capacity of carbon fixing microorganisms in the site were revealed. Results showed that there were many kinds of carbon fixed microorganisms that were identified such as <i>Flavobacterium</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i>. HP/4HB, rTCA, and DC/4HB cycles were dominated carbon fixation pathways. The long-chain PHC were weakly correlated with carbon fixation microorganisms, but it may stimulate the growth of some carbon fixation microorganisms, such as microorganisms involved in rTCA cycle.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nThe microorganisms with carbon fixation gene exist in the aquifer contaminated by long-chain petroleum hydrocarbon.\nMicroorganisms that have the ability to degrade petroleum also have the ability to carbon fixation.\nLong-chain petroleum hydrocarbon may promote the growth of carbon fixation microorganisms.\n</p>","author":"Shuang Gan, \nZhuo Ning, \nShuaiwei Wang, \nWeichao Sun, \nZhe Xu, \nHe Di, \nJinjin Ti, \nCaijuan Guo, \nYahong Zhou, \nZe He, \nSiyu Kong, \nMin Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"b63ae4567fbe095a844b9233451e4a6c9b9ebde9fe446629db4ec2887c02e623","category":"Environment"}
