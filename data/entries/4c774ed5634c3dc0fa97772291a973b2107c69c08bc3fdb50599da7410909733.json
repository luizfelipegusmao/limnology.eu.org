Determining the incidence rate and predictors among children on antiretroviral treatment (ART) is essential to improve treatment outcomes and minimize harm. And also, evidence regarding the time to major adverse drug reactions and its predictors among children on antiretroviral treatment is limited in Ethiopia.</p> Objective <p>This study aimed to assess the time to major adverse drug reaction and its predictors among children on antiretroviral treatment at selected public hospitals in Northwest Amhara, Ethiopia, 2023.</p> Method <p>A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 380 children on antiretroviral treatment who enrolled from June 27, 2017, to May 31, 2022. Data was collected using a structured data extraction checklist. Data were entered into Epidata 4.6 and analyzed using STATA 14. The incidence rate of major adverse drug reactions was determined per person/months. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to identify predictors of major adverse drug responses. A p-value less than 0.05 with a 95% CI was used to declare statistical significance.</p> Result <p>The minimum and maximum follow-up time was 6 and 59 months, respectively. The study participants were followed for a total of 9916 person-months. The incidence rate of major adverse drug reactions was 3.5 /1000 person–months. Advanced clinical stages of HIV/AIDS (III and IV) [adjusted hazard ratio = 7.3, 95% CI: 2.74–19.60)], poor treatment adherence [adjusted hazard ratio = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.21–0.42], taking antiretroviral treatment twice and more [adjusted hazard ratio = 3.43, 955 CI: (1.26–9.33)] and not taking opportunistic infection prophylaxis [adjusted hazard ratio = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.23–0.52)] were predictors of major adverse drug reactions.</p> Conclusion <p>The incidence rate of major adverse drug reactions among children on antiretroviral treatment was congruent with studies in Ethiopia. Advanced clinical stages of HIV/AIDS, poor treatment adherence, taking antiretroviral treatment medications twice or more, and not taking opportunistic infection prophylaxis were predictors of major adverse drug reactions.</p>","author":"Bantegizie Senay Tsega","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4c774ed5634c3dc0fa97772291a973b2107c69c08bc3fdb50599da7410909733","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
