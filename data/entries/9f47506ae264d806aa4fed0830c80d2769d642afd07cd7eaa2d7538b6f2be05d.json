It accounts for a substantial portion of household energy use and varies based on environmental factors and climate conditions. Environmental factors highly influence energy-saving strategies of buildings in different climate areas. Addressing this challenge necessitates innovative approaches to building design and materials. This study aims to explore the energy performance of different walling materials in varying climates, including desert, subtropical, and tropical regions. Using transient systems simulation program multi-zone software, simulations were conducted on five room models with ten different walling materials. Notably, autoclaved aerated concrete and cellular lightweight concrete consistently demonstrated better performance in both Kuwait and Australia, resulting in reduced cooling and heating demands. The study emphasizes the significance of selecting building materials based on local climate conditions. It highlights the potential for future exploration of advanced materials like phase change materials and cool roofs. By considering local climate conditions, energy-efficient buildings can be constructed. Future research should focus on advanced materials to further enhance energy efficiency.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"9f47506ae264d806aa4fed0830c80d2769d642afd07cd7eaa2d7538b6f2be05d","category":"Environment"}
