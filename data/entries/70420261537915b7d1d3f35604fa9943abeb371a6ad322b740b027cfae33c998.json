{"title":"A Sustainable Approach to Define Important Digital Skills of Digital Currency Users","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0076/v1","date":1712018102000,"content":"Nowadays, the transactions carried out with digital currencies are increasing. Citizens are asked to respond to growing challenges related to the sustainable management of digital currencies in their daily lives. However, due to the lack of digital skills of users, the sustainable management of digital currencies hides risks. The methodology of this study was based on the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens (DigComp) and is applied through a questionnaire completed by 443 respondents. The main objective was to evaluate their digital skills from the perspective of digital currency use. The analysis of the responses was carried out by using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The most important result from this research reveals that users of digital currencies are significantly capable of developing sustainable communication to solve everyday problems. At the same time, users of digital currencies mostly detect digital threats and effectively manage fake news without being affected by them. However, users of digital currencies consider that security issues are important, but only for transactions and not for their supporting functions. The study concludes with suggestions for improving the experience of digital currency users through individual actions, thus having a positive impact on the state and banking institutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70420261537915b7d1d3f35604fa9943abeb371a6ad322b740b027cfae33c998","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
