{"title":"Conservative Management of Bowel Endometriosis: Cross-Sectional Analysis for Assessing Clinical Outcomes and Quality-of-Life","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0014/v1","date":1717462361000,"content":"Background/Objectives Bowel endometriosis (BE) is defined as the presence of endometrial-like tissue in the muscular layer of the bowel wall. When BE does not cause severe obstruction to fecal transit, not leading to (sub)occlusive symptoms, the decision to operate becomes challenging as intestinal surgery is associated with higher complication rates and long-term bowel dysfunction. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) in patients with BE undergoing medical therapy or expectant management, investigating the impact of characteristics of BE nodules on QoL and intestinal function. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 580 patients with BE who did not undergo surgery but were treated conservatively by medical therapy or expectant management between January 2017 and August 2022. The diagnosis of BE was done by transvaginal ultrasound and confirmed at double contrast barium enema. After at least one year of follow-up, QoL and intestinal function of patients were evaluated by the Endometriosis Health Profile-5 (EHP-5) questionnaire and Bowel Endometriosis Symptom score (BENS), whereas pain symptoms were assessed by the Visual Analogic Scale (VAS 0-10). Statistical analysis was performed to investigate possible associations between QoL and characteristics of bowel nodules (dimension, location, and evidence of stenosis) as well as type and length of eventual medical therapy. Results Patients with BE had a satisfying overall QoL with a mean EHP-5 score of 105.42 ± 99.98 points and VAS lower than 3 for all pain domains; additionally, they did not show a significant impartment of bowel function with mean BENS score of 4.89 ± 5.28 points. Notably, patients under medical therapy had a better QoL than patients without therapy (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40e9d5e4294e4c1075c6c49167ea0fcb53d1193d28e4f9d354d6be0858d6eb4d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
