{"title":"The detrimental consequences of mining and inspiration for the Gandhamardan movement in western Odisha, India","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12350?af=R","date":1722998683000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Most of Odisha's mineral resources are situated in tribally controlled regions that are impacted by resource extraction operations. Being a mineral-rich state, Odisha is becoming a popular investment location. The majority of the population is made up of indigenous people who have historically subsisted on the highlands' natural resources. Local people (most of them are tribal) of the Gandhamardan hills region have protested extraction, insisting that their rights to holy religious sites near the mine, traditional methods of subsistence and the environment be protected. The purpose of this article is to look into the impact of mining during the extraction phase in the 1980s, which was a driving element in the emergence of the resistance movement, as well as discuss the future expectations of mining and its effect. The paper is based on primary data that includes direct interview to 366 households. The purposive sampling method has been deployed to collect data from the participants of Gandhamardan movement (1980s). According to the findings, mining has impacted Â three vital areas, including religious beliefs, the environment and livelihood, prompting the local community to resist mining activities. These three areas were crucial for the emergence of Gandhamardan or BALCO (Bharat Aluminium Company) movement. The environmental component has received widespread support both domestically and worldwide. The State Government should have a clear strategy in place that acknowledges the economic relevance of managing forest resources in a way which improves local people's economic conditions with local economic development.</p>","author":"Baijayanti Rout","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"65aec407e1a26eaddc071e3f6a5fc649cf008cb3c8d57d08ca785d81b8448754","category":"Environment"}
