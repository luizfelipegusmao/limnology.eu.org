{"title":"Ecological-Health Hazards and Multivariate Assessment of Contamination Sources of Potentially Toxic Elements from Al-Lith Coastal Sediments, Saudi Arabia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1378/v1","date":1726650718000,"content":"To assess contamination levels, sources, and ecological health risks of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the sediments of Al Lith on the Saudi Red Sea coast, 25 samples were collected and analyzed for Zn, V, Cr, Cu, Ni, As, Pb, and Fe using ICP-AES. The average concentrations of PTEs (μg/g) were found in the following order: Fe (14259) &gt; V (28.30) &gt; Zn (22.74) &gt; Cr (16.81) &gt; Cu (12.41) &gt; Ni (10.63) &gt; As (2.66) &gt; Pb (2.46). Contamination indices indicated that Al Lith sediments exhibited either no or minimal enrichment of PTEs, with concentrations below the low effects range. This suggests that the primary source of these PTEs is the basement rocks of the Arabian Shield and that they are unlikely to pose a substantial risk to benthic communities. The hazard index (HI) values for PTEs in both adults and children were below 1.0, indicating no significant non-carcinogenic risk. Lifetime cancer risk (LCR) values for Pb, As, and Cr in both adults and children were within acceptable or tolerable levels, posing no significant health threats. However, a few samples showed LCR values exceeding 1 × 10-4, indicating potential risks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d56eb0724f6f6c18843e7103eeede68c097381fbca637877808666d76ba9f922","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
