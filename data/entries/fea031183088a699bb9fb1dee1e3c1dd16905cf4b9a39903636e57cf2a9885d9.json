{"title":"An Update on Microbial Interventions in Autism Spectrum Disorder with Gastrointestinal Symptoms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1887/v1","date":1729758477000,"content":"In the United States, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 33 children and is characterized by atypical social interactions, communication difficulties, and intense, restricted interests. Microbial dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is frequently observed in individuals with ASD, potentially contributing to behavioral manifestations and correlating with worsening severity. Moreover, dysbiosis may contribute to the increased prevalence of GI comorbidities in the ASD population and exacerbate immune dysregulation, further worsening dysbiosis. Over the past 25 years, research on the impact of microbial manipulation on ASD outcomes has gained substantial interest. Various approaches to microbial manipulation have been preclinically and clinically tested, including antibiotic treatment, dietary modifications, prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation. Each method has shown varying degrees of success in reducing the severity of ASD behaviors and/or GI symptoms and varying long-term efficacy. In this review, we discuss these microbiome manipulation methods and their outcomes. We also discuss potential microbiome manipulation early in life, as this is a critical period for neurodevelopment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fea031183088a699bb9fb1dee1e3c1dd16905cf4b9a39903636e57cf2a9885d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
