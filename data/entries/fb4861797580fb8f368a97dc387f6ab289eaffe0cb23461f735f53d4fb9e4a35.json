Only imaging methods such as the electron microscopy (operating in different modes) and AFM can address individual nanoparticles with a high accuracy regarding their size and shape. Nevertheless, also with these methods, the devil is in the details. In this paper a systematic study on a well-probed laboratory model nanoparticulate material, TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles of bipyramidal shape [<a href=\"#ozae044.308-B1\">1-3</a>], has been caried out with the purpose to quantify the measurement uncertainties induced by using improper analysis conditions. The study has been carried out at an SEM being able to measure the same field-of-view on the sample simultaneously with a detector of SE InLens type and in the transmission mode, i.e. STEM-in-SEM, by using a dedicated transmission sample holder [<a href=\"#ozae044.308-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fb4861797580fb8f368a97dc387f6ab289eaffe0cb23461f735f53d4fb9e4a35","category":"Environment"}
