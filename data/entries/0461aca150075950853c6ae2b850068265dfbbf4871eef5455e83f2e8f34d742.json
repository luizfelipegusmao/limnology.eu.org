{"title":"Association of Swimming and Photobiomodulation to Alleviate Nociceptive and Motor Behavior in Rats with Neuropathic Pain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1899/v1","date":1724768717000,"content":"Several studies have shown that non-pharmacologic treatments such as photobiomodulation (PBMT) and swimming (SW) have been increasingly used as adjuncts to clinical practice. The aim of this work is to evaluate whether SW associated or not with PBMT has its effects potentialized on different kind of pain and motor aspects in a model of chronic constriction injury and if the treatments have any improvement on morphometry of the skeletal striated muscle. Our results have demonstrated a beneficial effect on pain and motor response for animals treated with the therapies isolated, and an even better response when we associate them. Regarding muscle tissue, we observed an improvement in inflammatory cells quantification and on the collagen expression on the muscle after each isolated treatment or in combination. These findings contribute to enhancing for individuals suffering from neuropathic pain conditions, offering a promising avenue for integrated care approaches that prioritize both symptom alleviation and functional recovery. Such insights are crucial for advancing treatment strategies in pain management since the currently available treatments are not completely effective to treat all the pain and also promotes several side effects on the patientsâ€™ health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0461aca150075950853c6ae2b850068265dfbbf4871eef5455e83f2e8f34d742","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
