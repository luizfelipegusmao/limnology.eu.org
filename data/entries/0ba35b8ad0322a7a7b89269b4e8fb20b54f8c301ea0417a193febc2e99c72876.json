{"title":"How AI and Robotics Will Advance Interventional Radiology: A Narrative Review and Future Perspectives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0377/v1","date":1715074885000,"content":"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics has led to significant progress in various medical fields, including interventional radiology (IR). This review focuses on the research progress and applications of AI and robotics in IR, including deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) across specialties such as oncology, neurology, and cardiology. To ensure the breadth and depth of this review, we implemented a systematic literature search strategy, selecting research published within the last five years. We conducted searches in databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar to find relevant literature. Special emphasis was placed on selecting large-scale studies to ensure comprehensiveness and reliability of the results. We discuss the role of AI techniques used before, during, and after intervention treatments and the advantages of robotics in achieving precise operations and reducing intra-operative risks. Challenges faced in the implementation of these techniques are also addressed. Finally, we explore the future trends and potential applications of AI and robotics in interventional therapy, highlighting their potential to improve patient treatment outcomes and quality of life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0ba35b8ad0322a7a7b89269b4e8fb20b54f8c301ea0417a193febc2e99c72876","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
