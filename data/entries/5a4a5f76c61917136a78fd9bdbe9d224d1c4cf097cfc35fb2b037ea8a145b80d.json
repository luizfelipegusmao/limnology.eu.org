{"title":"Addressing the Interoperability of Electronic Health Records:  Proposing the TASSIPS Framework","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0381/v1","date":1722940556000,"content":"Interoperability has become crucial in the world of electronic health records (EHR), allowing for seamless data exchange and integration across diverse settings. It facilitates the integration of disparate systems, ensures that patient records are accessible, and enhances the care delivery process. The current interoperability landscape for electronic health records is saddled with challenges hindering efficient interoperability. Existing interoperability frameworks for EHR have failed to properly address many of these challenges relating to data exchange, security and privacy. To address these challenges, the TASSIPS framework is proposed as a comprehensive approach to achieving efficient interoperability. TASSIPS integrates robust security and privacy measures, providing real-time access to electronic health records that enable precise diagnoses, timely treatment plans and improved patient outcomes. TASSIPS offers a holistic and effective solution to healthcare interoperability challenges. An evaluation of TASSIPS via comparison with exicting frameworks concluded that it is an advancement in framework design for interoperabil-ity of EHR.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a4a5f76c61917136a78fd9bdbe9d224d1c4cf097cfc35fb2b037ea8a145b80d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
