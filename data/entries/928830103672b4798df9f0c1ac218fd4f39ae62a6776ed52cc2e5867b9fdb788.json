Employing an optimized machine-learning model with an explainable algorithm, the research reveals that the diversity of microbial community is highly dependent on environmental contexts. Additionally, the study highlights that the interplay between nitrogen (N) addition, pH, and mean annual temperature leads to non-linear trends in soil bacterial diversity. Furthermore, the research identifies thresholds for these main and interactive factors, emphasizing the importance of adopting appropriate fertilization strategies based on the specific local environment.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Global patterns in soil microbiomes are driven by non-linear environmental thresholds. Fertilization is known to shape the soil microbiome of terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. Yet, whether fertilization influences global thresholds in soil microbiomes remains virtually unknown. Here, utilizing optimized machine learning models with Shapley additive explanations on a dataset of 10,907 soil samples from 24 countries, we discovered that the microbial community response to fertilization is highly dependent on environmental contexts. Furthermore, the interactions among nitrogen (N) addition, pH, and mean annual temperature contribute to non-linear patterns in soil bacterial diversity. Specifically, we observed positive responses within a soil pH range of 5.2–6.6, with the influence of higher temperature (&gt;15°C) on bacterial diversity being positive within this pH range but reversed in more acidic or alkaline soils. Additionally, we revealed the threshold effect of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen, demonstrating how temperature and N addition amount interacted with microbial communities within specific edaphic concentration ranges. Our findings underscore how complex environmental interactions control soil bacterial diversity under fertilization.</p>","author":"Cai Chen, \nShu‐Le Li, \nQing‐Lin Chen, \nManuel Delgado‐Baquerizo, \nZhao‐Feng Guo, \nFenghua Wang, \nYao‐Yang Xu, \nYong‐Guan Zhu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"928830103672b4798df9f0c1ac218fd4f39ae62a6776ed52cc2e5867b9fdb788","category":"Environment"}
