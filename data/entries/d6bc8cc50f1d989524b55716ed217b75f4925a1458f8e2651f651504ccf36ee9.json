{"title":"Genetic Gain and Inbreeding Rate in Different Simulated Genomic Selection Schemes for Grain Yield and Oil Content in Safflower","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1902/v1","date":1714379286000,"content":"Abstract\nSafflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) is a multipurpose minor crop consumed by developed and developing nations around the world with a limited research fund and genetic resources. Genomic selection (GS) is an effective modern breeding tool which could help to fast track the genetic diversity preserved in genebank collections to facilitate rapid and efficient germplasm improvement and variety development. In the present study, we simulated four GS strategies to compare genetic gains and inbreeding rates during breeding cycles in a safflower recurrent selection breeding program targeting grain yield (GY) and seed oil content (OL). We observed positive genetic gains over cycles in all four GS strategies, where the first cycle delivered the largest genetic gain. Single traits GS strategies had the greatest gain for the target trait but with very limited genetic improvement for the other trait. Simultaneous selection for GY and OL via index indicated higher gains for both traits than crossing between the two single trait independent culling strategies. The the multi-trati GS strategy with inbreeding control (GS_GY+OL+Rel) showed lower inbreeding rate but similar gain compared to GS_GY+OL (without inbreeding control) after few cycles. Our finding lay the foundation for the future safflower GS breeding.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6bc8cc50f1d989524b55716ed217b75f4925a1458f8e2651f651504ccf36ee9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
