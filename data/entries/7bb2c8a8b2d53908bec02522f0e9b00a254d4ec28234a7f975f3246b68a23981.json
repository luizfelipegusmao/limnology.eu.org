{"title":"Spotlight on Syndecan 1 Role in Systemic Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases: Main Actor or Guest Appearance?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1925/v1","date":1714389421000,"content":"Background: Systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs), including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), are characterized by chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. Identifying reliable biomarkers is crucial for enhancing diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and evaluating therapeutic responses. This study explores the potential of serum Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) as a biomarker for these conditions and concurrently examines its relationship with free light chain (FLC) expression levels in the same patients.\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was performed on serum samples from 120 patients (60 RA, 60 SLE), alongside 50 healthy donors (HD). Serum levels of κ and λ FLCs were determined by turbidimetric assay, while SDC-1 levels were measured using ELISA. Statistical analyses, including the Kruskal-Wallis test, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test, multivariable linear regression and Spearman’s correlation, were employed to compare biomarker levels across groups and to explore correlations among them.\nResults: Significantly increased levels of SDC-1, κ-FLC, and λ-FLC were observed in patients diagnosed with RA and SLE compared to HD (p &lt; 0.001), while no significant differences in the κ/λ ratio were noted among the groups (p = 0.4). A statistically significant difference in subject age was also identified. However, multivariate regression analysis indicated that RA and SLE statuses are significantly associated with the levels of these markers, with minimal confounding by age. A significant correlation was observed separately in all groups between the FLC markers. Conversely, no correlation was detected between SDC-1 and FLCs, nor between these markers and age.\nConclusion: Elevated serum levels of FLCs and SDC-1 in RA and SLE patients compared to healthy controls underscore their potential as biomarkers for SARDs. The findings also suggest sustained plasma cells activation, supporting the SDC-1 role in the pathogenesis of these conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7bb2c8a8b2d53908bec02522f0e9b00a254d4ec28234a7f975f3246b68a23981","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
