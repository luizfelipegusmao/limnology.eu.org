{"title":"Theory of Unification of the Interactions of Fundamental Forces: SU(3) x SU(2) --&gt; U(1)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0660/v1","date":1728464236000,"content":"Here, using the theory of electrical modelling of the neutron and proton as a three-phase alternating current electrical generator, we will begin the path to demonstrate that the interactions of electromagnetic forces, weak force and strong force that are part of the standard model, can be described by a single electromagnetic force interaction, in other words: SU(3) x SU(2) --&gt; U(1). We will also hypothesize two particles that would give rise to gravitons. It is the interactions of the quarks (U, Û, D, ^D) that dominate the dynamics; They are responsible for the origin of bosons (photons, gluons, W⁺, W⁻, Z⁰, gravitons and Higgs boson).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e90b6712fd9e50946c9099315788ff2458cd46a0bbee21107c626413ec6c9b05","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
