{"title":"Partial replacement of saturated fats in liver pâté by an olive oil‐in‐water emulsion containing β‐glucan shows no compromise in sensory and storage oxidation of lipids and protein","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13368?af=R","date":1708710575000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The consumption of olive oil has been shown to have a positive effect on preventing obesity and hypertension. At the same time, it is recommended to avoid processed meat products as they contain saturated fats. The inclusion of highly unsaturated lipids in food products can lead to rapid oxidation and deterioration of sensory characteristics. The objective of the current work was to encapsulate olive oil and incorporate it into traditional Polish liver pâté. The oil-in-water emulsions were formulated with varying levels of oat <i>β</i>-glucan and were evaluated for droplet size, pH, encapsulation efficiency and rheology. The liver pâtés made using the emulsions with and without <i>β</i>-glucan were then evaluated for pH, texture, colour, lipid and protein oxidation, thermal stability and sensory properties.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that the oil-in-water emulsions had a 100% encapsulation rate of olive oil after 30 days of storage at 4 °C, regardless of the presence of <i>β</i>-glucan. Although the texture of the emulsion-enriched liver pâté was different from that of the control, this difference was reduced when <i>β</i>-glucan was added to the emulsion and then to the pâté matrix.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Replacing 50% of animal fat with an olive oil emulsion enriched with <i>β</i>-glucan did not result in any compromise of sensory properties, increase lipid or protein oxidation. These results suggest that it is possible to replace saturated lipids with omega-3-rich olive oil. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Marzena Zając, \nMirosław M Kasprzak, \nJoanna Tkaczewska, \nWiktor Berski, \nAnna Stępień, \nCharles Odilichukwu R Okpala, \nJacek Domagała","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"96fe43e83f87981d6c44ab598d3e5836c98d7a14bfd7a27e359de749662ecfd7","category":"Environment"}
