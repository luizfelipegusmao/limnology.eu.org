(Arecales: Arecaceae) is the most economically important crop in Oman with an annual production of &gt;360,000 tons of fruit. The Dubas bug (<span>Ommatissus lybicus</span> de Bergevin) (Hemiptera: Tropiduchidae) is one of the major pests of date palms, causing up to a 50% reduction in fruit production. Across the course of 2 seasons, a variety of arthropod predators living in the date palm canopy were investigated for possible biological control of Dubas bugs, given the growing interest in nonchemical insect pest control in integrated pest management. We collected ~6,900 arthropod predators directly from date palm fronds from 60 Omani date palm plantations and tested them for Dubas bug predation using PCR-based molecular gut content analysis. We determined that â‰¥56 species of arthropod predators feed on the Dubas bug. We found that predatory mites, ants, and the entire predator community combined showed a positive correlation between predation detection frequency and increasing Dubas bug density. Additionally, there was a significant impact of season on gut content positives, with the spring season having a significantly higher percentage of predators testing positive for Dubas bug, suggesting this season could be the most successful time to target conservation biological control programs utilizing a diverse suite of predators.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"b77df73f11b1592bc4dec3fcd3041bfe4eef6d3e9264039e905dc58cc61d05a7","category":"Environment"}
