Stakeholder engagement emerged as a critical factor, with leaders who prioritize open communication and collaboration successfully building trust, leveraging expertise, and co-creating innovative solutions to sustainability challenges. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of fostering a culture of innovation, where leaders support experimentation, risk-taking, and the adoption of new technologies and processes that enhance sustainability. Ethical leadership, emphasizing integrity, transparency, and accountability, is identified as essential for gaining stakeholder support and reinforcing the legitimacy of SSCI. Furthermore, the integration of sustainability into organizational culture, driven by leadership, is crucial for aligning individual and organizational behaviors with sustainability goals. The ability of leaders to navigate challenges, adapt to global supply chain complexities, and utilize robust sustainability metrics is also emphasized as key to sustaining SSCI.
