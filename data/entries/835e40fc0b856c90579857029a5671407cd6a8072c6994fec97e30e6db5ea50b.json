{"title":"A Device for Controlling the Chlorination in Small Umbrian Water Distribution Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2174/v1","date":1724945485000,"content":"Umbria is an Italian region with a highly fragmented water supply, with many small water distribution systems fed by local sources. The chlorination in these small water systems faces many difficulties related to the high demand variation, low economic relevance, and access to infrastructures. As a result, there are many noncompliances with the quality of the supplied water, which causes a decrease in the performance indicators and tariff. This research investigates the possibility of using a low-cost chlorination system to consider different environmental conditions (e.g., temperature variations of water and environment, pH, ...) and discontinuous consumption. A device for this specific use is developed and tested by laboratory tests and is ready for use in the field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"835e40fc0b856c90579857029a5671407cd6a8072c6994fec97e30e6db5ea50b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
