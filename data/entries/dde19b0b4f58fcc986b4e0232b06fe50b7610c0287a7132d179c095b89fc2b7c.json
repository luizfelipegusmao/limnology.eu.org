Quinn, Gandalf Nicolas</p>\r\n\r\nMany people who are stigmatized along concealable features (e.g., sexual minorities or people with mental illness) anticipate social rejection due to their features and associated labels, and these beliefs are a prominent predictor of psychological distress. While ecological approaches to stigma research have highlighted the social basis of these two related outcomes, it typically has focused on the impact of non-stigmatized counterparts. Also embedded in the social environment are similarly-stigmatized others who, in concealing, may be less accessible to the individual. Given the centrality of psychological distress and rejection concerns as a relational self-conception in attachment theories, we tested if identity-based rejection sensitivity and distress may emerge from diminished access to similarly-stigmatized others as identity group members. Leveraging the University as a partially-controlled, naturalistic setting, we collected measures of concealment, identity-based rejection sensitivity, and psychological distress from undergraduate students in introductory psychology courses who reported a concealable stigmatized identity (<i>N</i> = 355; <i>k</i> = 15 identity groups). With concealment aggregated to the level of the identity group, multi-level modeling showed that concealment by similarly-stigmatized students was positively associated with both individualsâ€™ identity-based rejection sensitivity and their psychological distress. Moreover, rejection sensitivity mediated the association of group-level concealment and distress. Findings suggest that rejection concerns and distress may emerge from identity group inaccessibility in the social environment, with the association of concerns and distress possibly contextualized by underlying group attachment dynamics. Results reveal the identity group as a novel source of social influence in the lives of individuals with concealable stigmatized identities.","author":"Andrew C.
