{"title":"Identifying the Mobility Patterns of the Historic Centre of Syrian Cities Using Cluster and Spatial Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1721/v1","date":1719285151000,"content":"One of the most significant challenges that is facing urban-planning ,is the develop-ment of a transportation network, particularly in historical Syrian cities, which are characterized by their compact urban form. Historical Syrian cities, including historical city of Aleppo, present difficulties due to the essential balance required between saving cultural heritage and meeting the needs of a present-day population. This study basically addresses the city's key elements and planning issues, including traffic density, pedestrian safety, and the massive spreading of motor-ized vehicles. The objective of this study is to analyze the street structure, understanding its components and problems in order to develop a methodology that can be used to enhance urban mobility and to improve the structure of the historical city. for this purpose, two main methods were employed, method of analyzing geographical data based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and K-Means cluster analysis method. These two methods were employed to gain detailed and clear vision into mobility patterns of historical Aleppo. Which involved careful processing of data, such as street names, locations, components, quantities, and widths, based on the authorâ€™s observations and notes and a variety of local and international sources. This analysis process will not only reveal the current hierarchy of streets but also demonstrates the dynamical and complicated formation of transportation structures of the historical city. The findings of the study describe the challenges faced by historic city centers and highlight the interrelationship between the following: urban structure, objects of cultural heritage, tourism plans, and mobility patterns. The application of spatial analysis method serves as a technique that reveals the formulation of possible scenarios that helps to develop the transportation structure in the historical city of Aleppo. These generated scenarios will be used as typical solutions that can be generalized to all similar historic Syrian cities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab5969f7d4189c616584a3e9a81ca513b10e12025f1c1bc31d8c52c67bed162e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
