{"title":"Serum and Plasma miRNA Expression Levels in Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0220/v1","date":1722819896000,"content":"Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is a rapidly developing acquired idiopathic disorder. Differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in the acute serum of SSNHL patients. miRNAs are transmitted in both serum and plasma but it is unknown which better reflects changes associated with inner ear disease. Therefore, we sought to compare the serum and plasma miRNA expression levels in adult SSNHL patients. We extracted and reverse transcribed total RNA from serum and plasma, and analyzed the product with quantitative re-al-time PCR. hsa-miR-191-5p was used for normalization, and miRNA expression levels were calculated using the delta Ct method. Paired t-tests comparing serum and plasma samples from 17 SSNHL patients (mean age 51.9 years, Std. deviation 13.9 years) showed no significant differences in miR-128-3p, miR-132-3p, miR-375-3p, miR-590-5p, miR-30a-3p, miR-140-3p, miR-186-5p, and miR-195-5p expression levels. We conclude that, plasma and serum are equally suitable for investigating potential miRNA SSNHL disease markers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25003650ef36f055fdab9651fd211fc5d6a545d0a6f87ead2d9c5eed8cbc5860","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
