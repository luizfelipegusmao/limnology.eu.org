{"title":"A Study on New Straight Shape Design to Reduce Cogging Torque of Small Wind Power Generator","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1254/v1","date":1716214394000,"content":"In this paper, a small wind power generator is proposed with a new straight shape stator and rotor. The advantages of the proposed structure are introduced through a comparison between the basic and the proposed models. By comparing the pole slot combination of the proposed generator, the combination with optimal cogging torque characteristics was selected. The electromagnetic characteristics of proposed shape are analyzed for design variables using a finite element analysis (FEA) of ANSYS Maxwell. The final model of the proposed structure is designed by considering cogging torque and the generator electromagnetic characteristics. The electromagnetic and structural simulations of the final model are performed to satisfy the required performance of generator and mechanical safety. To verify the FEA results of the final model, a prototype is manufactured, experimented, and compared with the FEA results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8940ddba653ac7f7a619b50cad5d68ed951d435433ee526ed6dd564ca20c91c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
