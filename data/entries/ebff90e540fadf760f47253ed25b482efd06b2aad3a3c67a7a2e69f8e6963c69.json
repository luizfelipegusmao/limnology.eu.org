Current approaches include focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), tilt-series and atom probe tomography (APT), and through-focus depth sectioning by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Recently, multislice electron ptychography (MEP) has demonstrated unprecedented deep sub-angstrom lateral resolution along with depth-sectioning capabilities by incorporating a multislice formalism into the phase retrieval algorithm, enabling new possibilities for high-resolution volumetric characterization [<a href=\"#ozae044.942-B1\">1-2</a>]. Unlike other techniques, multislice ptychography does not require a time-consuming or destructive data collection phase and can computationally reconstruct the 3D object potential slice-by-slice from a single 4-dimensional STEM (4D-STEM) dataset that is usually acquired within a few seconds (Fig. 1a). However, the depth resolution of MEP is limited to a few nanometers, or 100 times worse than the achievable lateral resolution. Here, we propose a data-driven approach to enhance the depth resolution of multislice ptychography by introducing prior knowledge of the specimen into the reconstruction workflow.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ebff90e540fadf760f47253ed25b482efd06b2aad3a3c67a7a2e69f8e6963c69","category":"Environment"}
