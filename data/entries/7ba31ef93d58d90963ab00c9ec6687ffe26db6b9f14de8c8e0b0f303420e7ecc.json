{"title":"Synthesis of Quaternary Ammonium Lignin Based Ionic Liquids and Comparison of Extraction Behavior of Co(II) and Ni(II) with 2-Ethylhexyl Phosphoric Acid Mono-2-ethylhexyl Ester","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1051/v1","date":1710775248000,"content":"Two interesting compounds such as quaternary ammonium lignin(QAL) and 2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (P507) were synthesized as ionic liquids(QP-ILs) for the extraction of metal ions. The extraction behavior of Co(II) and Ni(II) from chloride solution was compared between QP-ILs and P507. The results showed that the extraction rates of Co(II) and Ni(II) in the two solutions varied with the extraction conditions, but QP-ILs has stronger extractability for cobalt than P507, while Ni is on the contrary. Under the same conditions, the Co/Ni separation performance(βCo/Ni) in QP-ILs is superior to that in p507. At pH4.0, 55℃, concentration of 20%, extraction time of 10 minutes, the βCo/Ni of QP-ILs reached to 2703, while that of P507 was only 164. In conclusion, QP-ILs was more efficient than P507 for separating Co from mixed solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ba31ef93d58d90963ab00c9ec6687ffe26db6b9f14de8c8e0b0f303420e7ecc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
