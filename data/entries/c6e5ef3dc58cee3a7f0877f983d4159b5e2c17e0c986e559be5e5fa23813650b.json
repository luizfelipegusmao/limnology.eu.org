{"title":"Potential insect threats to pennycress, Thlaspi arvense (Brassicales: Brassicaceae), an emerging oilseed cover crop","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae086/7742310?rss=1","date":1724716800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pennycress (<span>Thlaspi arvense</span> L.) is an annual plant in temperate regions that often grows as a weed. Pennycress is being domesticated as a new winter cover crop and oilseed crop for incorporation in the Midwest United States corn-soybean rotation, where it could offer economic and environmental benefits. While pennycress is gaining attention as a promising new crop, there remains a significant gap in understanding its interaction with insect communities and agroecosystems. This review compiles available information on insect herbivores (potential pests) and beneficial insects associated with pennycress growing in the wild (natural areas) or as a weed in agricultural areas. The limited knowledge on the response of pennycress to stressors (defoliation, stem injury and stand loss) similar to injury that could be caused by insects is also compiled here. By shedding light on the insects associated with pennycress and how pennycress might respond to injury from insectÂ pests, this review sets the stage for further research and development of integrated pest management programs for insect pests of this new crop.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"c6e5ef3dc58cee3a7f0877f983d4159b5e2c17e0c986e559be5e5fa23813650b","category":"Environment"}
