{"title":"The Effect of Battery Configuration on Dendritic Growth: a Magnetic Resonance Microscopy Study on Symmetric Lithium Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1729/v1","date":1714117675000,"content":"The potential of metallic lithium to become the anode material for next-generation batteries is hampered by significant challenges, chief among which is dendrite growth during battery charging. These dendritic structures not only impair battery performance but also pose safety risks. Among the non-destructive analytical techniques in battery research, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) stands out as a promising tool. However, the direct imaging of lithium by 7Li MRI is hindered by its low sensitivity and spatial resolution, making its use for of dendritic growth imaging very difficult. Instead, a recently introduced indirect imaging approach based on 1H MRI of the electrolyte was used in this study. This method was used for sequential 3D imaging to monitor the charging process of lithium metal symmetric cells in three different electrical circuits: single cell, four cells in parallel, four cells in series. The measured sequential images allowed measurement of dendrite growth in each cell using volumetric analysis. The growth results confirmed the theoretical expectation that growth across cells is uneven in a parallel circuit and even in a series circuit. The methods presented in this study can be applied also to many other dendrite-related issues in batteries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"71bef0bfc273f5d5a9dcc5a0895f1fd73703427d0c988447562e18a9e811df29","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
