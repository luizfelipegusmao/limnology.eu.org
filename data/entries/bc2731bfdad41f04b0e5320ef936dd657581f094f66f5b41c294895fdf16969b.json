{"title":"EEG for Neurological Prognostication in Post-anoxic Coma Following Cardiac Arrest and Its Relationship to Outcome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2475/v1","date":1722351469000,"content":"Cardiac arrest may cause significant hypoxic-ischemic injury leading to coma, seizures, myoclonic jerks, or status epilepticus. Mortality is high but accurate prognostication is challenging. A multimodal approach is employed, in which electroencephalograph (EEG) forms a key part with several recognised patterns of prognostic significance. In this retrospective study, clinical and qualitative features of the EEG of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Kingston General Hospital following cardiac arrest from 2017-2020 were reviewed. The study included 81 adult patients (&gt;18 years). Outcome was assessed using the Cerebral Performance Category as 1-2 (favourable) or 3-5 (unfavourable). EEG patterns were divided into groups within the highly malignant, malignant, and benign patterns described in the literature. There were a wide range of causes and 22% had a favourable outcome. Highly malignant, malignant, and benign patterns were associated with survival in 0%, 78% and 100% respectively and favourable outcomes in 0%, 44% and 100%. All patients with seizures died and 94% with myoclonus had unfavourable outcomes. In contrast, EEG reactivity and improvement on follow-up EEG was associated with a favourable outcome. In conclusion, highly malignant EEG, seizures and myoclonus were associated with unfavourable outcome, while patient with malignant EEG had better outcome.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc2731bfdad41f04b0e5320ef936dd657581f094f66f5b41c294895fdf16969b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
