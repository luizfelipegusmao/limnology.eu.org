Segregation of La dopant atoms around threading dislocation cores in BaSnO<sub>3</sub>, a widely studied stannate oxide for its high room temperature electron mobilities, can induce local insulator to metallic like behavior [<a href=\"#ozae044.567-B2\">2-5</a>]. To access these exciting properties in the actual bulk-scale, defect engineering to control their formation is crucial. In this work, we use SrTiO<sub>3</sub> substrates, with nanometer scale modifications created on their surface to control the density of dislocations in La-doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> thin films grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1ecab7426f4283f904dc0a200ed2b0cb9ae44d370c4f427392a996ea09ff4099","category":"Environment"}
