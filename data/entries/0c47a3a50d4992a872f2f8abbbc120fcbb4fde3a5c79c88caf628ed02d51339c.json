Much work has been done regarding drug delivery potential and electrochemical biosensing efficacy of microneedles. However, the mechanics of microneedle insertion in skin is a less studied area, particularly at high imaging resolutions. In this work, we have developed a simple approach for studying microneedle insertion mechanics with an SEM-compatible artificial mechanical skin model.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0c47a3a50d4992a872f2f8abbbc120fcbb4fde3a5c79c88caf628ed02d51339c","category":"Environment"}
