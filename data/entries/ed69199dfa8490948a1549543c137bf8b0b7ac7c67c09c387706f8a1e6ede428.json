{"title":"Experiments Conducted to Date to Verify the Relativistic Gravitational Time Dilation Have Limited Scientific Significance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1673/v1","date":1711596760000,"content":"Abstract: Experiments conducted to date to verify the relativistic gravitational time dilation have limited scientific significance because the basic postulate of Einsteinâ€™s relativistic GR that the same time (t0) is measured in all non-inertial frames of reference, because all non-inertial frames of reference must be equal, has not yet been verified by time measurements. According to Einstein's relativistic GR, a correlation between time and different gravitational potentials must be the result of a relative relation between non-inertial frames of reference and must not the result of any other physical influence. An experiment that can differentiate between a causal correlation (relative relation) and an apparent correlation (relativistic relation) between time and gravitational potentials is still outstanding. The expressions \"relative\" and \"relativistic\" are often used as synonyms. However, Einstein's GR is a relativistic theory. In the case of general relativity, relativistic means that time depends only on the relative relation between non-inertial frames of reference and not on other physical factors. The author proposes an easy-to-realize experiment that is able to distinguish between a causal correlation (relative relation) and an apparent correlation (relativistic relation) between time and gravitational potentials, which can confirm or falsify Einstein's relativistic GR.\n.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed69199dfa8490948a1549543c137bf8b0b7ac7c67c09c387706f8a1e6ede428","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
