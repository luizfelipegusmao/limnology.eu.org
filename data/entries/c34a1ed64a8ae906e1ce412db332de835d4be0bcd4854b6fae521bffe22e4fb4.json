{"title":"Molecular Characterization, Phylogeny, and Expression Profiles of SoxE Subfamily in Scophthalmus maximus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/7014567?af=R","date":1704182400000,"content":"<p>SOXE transcription factors, including SOX8, SOX9, and SOX10, regulate several developmental events, such as sex determination, chondrogenesis, and neurogenesis. This study systematically identified six <i>SoxE</i> subfamily genes from the turbot (<i>Scophthalmus maximus</i>) genome and transcriptome, including <i>SmSox8a</i>, <i>SmSox8b</i>, <i>SmSox9a</i>, <i>SmSox9b</i>, <i>SmSox10a</i>, and <i>SmSox10b</i>. The duplicates of three SOXE members revealed that <i>SoxE</i> subfamily genes in the turbot underwent significant expansion. Relatively conserved exon-intron structures and intron insertions were detected using genomic structural analysis. Besides, phylogenetic analysis supported the previous classification of the <i>SoxE</i> subfamily. Results of the expression profile revealed that turbot <i>SoxE</i> subfamily genes may be involved in different activities, such as neurogenesis and gonad development. These findings would assist in the understanding of fish <i>SoxE</i> gene subfamily activities and evolution.</p>","author":"Qing Ji, \nHonglu Guo, \nAnxin Shi, \nXingqiang Wang, \nJiachen Yu, \nZiyi Zhang, \nJiayang Chen, \nXiaowei Shi, \nPronob Das","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"c34a1ed64a8ae906e1ce412db332de835d4be0bcd4854b6fae521bffe22e4fb4","category":"Environment"}
