{"title":"Main Microclimatic Indicators in a Milking Parlor for Dairy Cows","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2201/v1","date":1727430478000,"content":"The study was conducted in the milking parlor of a cattle farm with a capacity of 400 cows of the Holstein-Friesian breed. The milking installation was a double 8 \"Herringbone\" type without windows, and the roof was constructed of glass. The reporting of temperature, air humidity and temperature-humidity index (THI) was performed three times during each milking (at the start, in the middle and at the end of milking) with measurements repeated during the morning, noon and evening milking. The highest mean and maximum daytime air temperature values were recorded in summer and spring. Although the average values for the spring season were lower than those for summer (by about 4 ⁰ C), the maximum values reached were equally high – 31.4 ⁰ C. In terms of relative air humidity, the highest mean values were reported for the winter sea-son – 82.39%. For the other seasons, the relative humidity values were on average high and close in value - from 62.51 to 67.46%. In THI, the highest average daily and maximum values were re-ported in the summer months - 73.41 and 80, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d7107098f3fa0354c52defe6f37013d1d19fe6b1b64c609386e0ec36abb5e17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
