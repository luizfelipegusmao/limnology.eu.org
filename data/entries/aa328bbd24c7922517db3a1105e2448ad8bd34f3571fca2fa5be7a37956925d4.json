{"title":"Prediction of Changes in Laver (Gim) Aquaculture Based on IPCC Projected Scenarios on Climate Change: A Case in the Republic of Korea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1495/v1","date":1716454784000,"content":"In Korea, laver (Gim) is the leading traded marine product and an important food source, accounting for 82.0% of the world’s exports. Laver exports reached $100 million in 2010 and steadily increased to $600 million in 2020. An increase in laver exports improves the income of laver farmers and promotes the growth of fisheries. However, marine algae are vulnerable to climate change. In this study, we aimed to predict changes in laver production due to climate change using environmental variables, including water temperature, rainfall, and sunlight duration. The results showed that water temperature considerably affected laver production; when water temperature increased by 1 °C, production decreased by 13.78% (t) in the same month. By contrast, when sunlight duration and rainfall increased by 1 h and 1 mm, respectively, 1 month before harvesting laver, production increased by 0.32% (t-1) and 0.13% (t-1), respectively. Using four scenarios based on climate change published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in a modeling exercise, we found that laver production in 2100 in Wando in Korea may decline by 73.3% owing to water temperature changes (based on 2020 production), threatening food security. Accordingly, short-, mid-, and long-term countermeasures are needed for sustainable laver aquaculture. Appropriate water temperature (21–22 °C) during seeding is necessary to control environmental variables, based on scientific data and activation of land-based seeding methods. Moreover, mid- and long-term countermeasures should include development of high-temperature resistant laver seeds, identification of suitable new laver aquaculture grounds, and research on seeds that can adapt to climate change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa328bbd24c7922517db3a1105e2448ad8bd34f3571fca2fa5be7a37956925d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
