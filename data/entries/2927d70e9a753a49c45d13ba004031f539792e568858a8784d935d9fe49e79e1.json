{"title":"Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities of Digital Marketing Adoption in the Multinational FMCG Sector","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0948/v1","date":1720690519000,"content":"Digital marketing adoption in the multinational Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector presents both challenges and opportunities that significantly impact organizational strategies and market competitiveness. This qualitative study explores the complexities surrounding digital marketing adoption through interviews with 45 participants from multinational FMCG companies. The research investigates key barriers such as organizational resistance, technological constraints, and concerns over data privacy and security, while also examining the benefits of enhanced consumer engagement, global market reach, and data-driven decision making. Findings reveal that organizational resistance remains a formidable barrier, driven by senior management's cautious approach to digital transformation and concerns over return on investment (ROI) amidst rapidly evolving digital landscapes. Technological challenges, including outdated systems and limited budgets for technology upgrades, further hinder comprehensive digital integration. Moreover, navigating regulatory frameworks and addressing consumer trust in data privacy emerge as critical considerations for FMCG companies seeking to leverage digital strategies effectively. Conversely, digital marketing adoption offers substantial opportunities. Enhanced consumer engagement through personalized and interactive campaigns allows companies to strengthen brand-consumer relationships and foster loyalty. The global reach facilitated by digital platforms enables multinational FMCG firms to expand market presence, penetrate new markets, and adapt marketing strategies to diverse consumer preferences worldwide. Data-driven decision making emerges as pivotal, leveraging analytics to optimize marketing strategies, measure campaign effectiveness, and anticipate consumer behaviors in real-time. Strategies for overcoming barriers emphasize building internal digital capabilities through training, recruitment, and cross-functional collaboration. Aligning digital strategies with overarching business objectives and integrating digital efforts with traditional marketing channels are crucial for creating cohesive and effective campaigns. Embracing innovation, flexibility, and agility in adapting to technological advancements are essential for maintaining competitiveness and relevance in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Looking forward, emerging trends such as AI and machine learning integration for predictive analytics, sustainability-focused marketing initiatives, and the evolution towards omnichannel strategies are poised to reshape digital marketing practices in the FMCG sector. By aligning strategies with these trends, FMCG companies can harness digital technologies to drive sustainable growth, enhance market competitiveness, and meet evolving consumer expectations in a digitally-driven global marketplace.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2927d70e9a753a49c45d13ba004031f539792e568858a8784d935d9fe49e79e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
