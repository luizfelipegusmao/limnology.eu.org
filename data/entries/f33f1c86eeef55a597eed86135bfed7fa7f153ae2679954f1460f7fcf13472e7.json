Modeling integrated predictions from two distinct models for inferences. First, modeling of the relationship between temperature and precipitation and European eel catch values using multiple time-series regression analyses showed that climate variables contributed to eel distribution in Türkiye. Eel catch became restricted to western and southern coasts of Türkiye and total catch decreased between 1967 and 2020. From 1967 to 2020, favorable climatic conditions for European eels in Türkiye were characterized by moderate temperatures. Furthermore, projections for 2050 and 2070 suggested that suitable habitat would be lost in Türkiye. Our findings underscore the urgent need for immediate and widespread implementation of effective conservation policies to mitigate threats to European eel in Türkiye and globally.</p>","author":"Burcu Mestav, \nŞükran Yalçın Özdilek, \nZahide Acar, \nKemal Gökkaya, \nNurbanu Partal","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"f33f1c86eeef55a597eed86135bfed7fa7f153ae2679954f1460f7fcf13472e7","category":"Environment"}
