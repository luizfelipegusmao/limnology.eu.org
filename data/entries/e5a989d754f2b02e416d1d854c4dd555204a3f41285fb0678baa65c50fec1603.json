{"title":"Comparison of Genetic Diversity between Hatchery‚ÄêReared and Wild Rock Bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) Based on Microsatellite Markers and Mitochondrial COI Sequences","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/5570764?af=R","date":1722404101000,"content":"<p>Hatchery release of rock bream (<i>Oplegnathus fasciatus</i>) is common in the Zhoushan Sea region of the East China Sea as an efficient method for stock enhancement. Clarifying the genetic effects of farm-raised populations on wild ones is important for understanding the health of fish stocks. Thus, this study collected six rock bream stocks (two wild, three hatchery-reared, and one parental) for genetic diversity analysis using microsatellite markers and mitochondrial sequences. Although the results of mitochondrial sequence analysis showed that 61.26% of the genetic diversity resided among groups, indicating a high degree of genetic differentiation among wild, hatchery-reared, and parental groups, the results of microsatellite analysis showed that 30% of the genetic diversity resided within the populations, indicating no obvious genetic differentiation among different groups. Our study suggests that though releasing hatchery-reared rock bream for stock enhancement may not noticeably decrease the genetic diversity of wild populations in the Zhoushan Sea in the short term, long-term genetic evaluations shall be taken to monitor genetic diversity in wild rock bream and ensure that the populations remain healthy.</p>","author":"Simiao Liu, \nQin Yu, \nRuiyi Chen, \nWeihua Hu, \nXiaojun Yan, \nQingxi Han, \nDongdong Xu, \nQihui Zhu, \nSofia Priyadarsani Das","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"e5a989d754f2b02e416d1d854c4dd555204a3f41285fb0678baa65c50fec1603","category":"Environment"}
