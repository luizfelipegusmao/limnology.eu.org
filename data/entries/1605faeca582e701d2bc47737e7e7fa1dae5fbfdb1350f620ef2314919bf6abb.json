{"title":"Interstitial N-Doped TiO2 for Photocatalytic Methylene Blue Degradation under Visible Light Irradiation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1629/v1","date":1724309830000,"content":"Photocatalysis is a promising method for methylene blue (MB) degradation due to its effectiveness and environmental compatibility. Among photocatalysts, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely used for MB degradation due to its exceptional photocatalytic activity. However, the wide bandgap limits the degradation efficiency of TiO2 under visible light. Herein, an interstitial nitrogen-doped TiO2 (5%NT/TiO2) used thiourea as the N source is fabricated for the visible light-derived MB degradation. 5%NT/TiO2 exhibits an extended visible light absorption range. Besides, photoelectrochemical measurement shows an improvement in photocurrent response and charge transfer behavior on N/TiO2. Thus, 5%NT/TiO2 has enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to pristine TiO2 and substitutive N-doped TiO2 (5%NAB/TiO2). The accelerated photocatalytic MB degradation process on N/TiO2 should be mainly attributed to the interstitial N doping, which causes the appearance of new energy states and extended optical properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1605faeca582e701d2bc47737e7e7fa1dae5fbfdb1350f620ef2314919bf6abb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
