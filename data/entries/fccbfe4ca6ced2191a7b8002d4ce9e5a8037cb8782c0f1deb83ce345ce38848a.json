Thirteen putative m<sup>6</sup>A readers, mostly annotated as EVOLUTIONARILY CONSERVED C-TERMINAL REGION (ECT) proteins, have been identified in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), but few have been characterized. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis m<sup>6</sup>A reader ECT1 modulates salicylic acid (SA)–mediated plant stress responses. ECT1 undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation in vitro, and its N-terminal prion-like domain is critical for forming in vivo cytosolic biomolecular condensates in response to SA or bacterial pathogens. Fluorescence-activated particle sorting coupled with quantitative PCR analyses unveiled that ECT1 sequesters SA-induced m<sup>6</sup>A modification-prone mRNAs through its conserved aromatic cage to facilitate their decay in cytosolic condensates, thereby dampening SA-mediated stress responses. Consistent with this finding, <span>ECT1</span> overexpression promotes bacterial multiplication in plants. Collectively, our findings unequivocally link ECT1-associated cytosolic condensates to SA-dependent plant stress responses, advancing the current understanding of m<sup>6</sup>A readers and the SA signaling network.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"fccbfe4ca6ced2191a7b8002d4ce9e5a8037cb8782c0f1deb83ce345ce38848a","category":"Environment"}
