{"title":"Coercivity of (Fe0.7Co0.3)2B Nanowire and Its Bonded Magnet","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1877/v1","date":1719404705000,"content":"Potential permanent magnet (Fe0.7Co0.3)2B has large saturation magnetization and high Curie temperature but a moderate magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) and displays relatively low coercivity. One way to improve coercivity is to combine the contribution from magnetocrystalline- and magnetic shape anisotropy by preparing (Fe0.7Co0.3)2B nanowires. We study the effect of size, morphology, and surface defect on the hard magnetic properties of nanowires using micromagnetic simulation. The hard magnetic properties of (Fe0.7Co0.3)2B nanowire bonded magnet have been estimated, including the role of inter-wire magnetostatic interaction. By considering the existence of local reduction of MCA energy up to 30% on the surface layer of nanowires, the anisotropic bonded magnet with 65% vol. of (Fe0.7Co0.3)2B nanowires displays typical magnetic properties of remanence Br=8.4 kG, coercivity Hci=9.9 kOe, and maximum energy product (BH)m=17.8 MGOe. Developing effective technology for synthesizing nanowires and fabricating corresponding bonded magnets is promising for manufacturing practical magnets based on magnetic phase with relatively low or moderate MCA, such as (Fe0.7Co0.3)2B.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ab772631f0be2309fe6c3d07de7c304ae3356207470565f32d0f1c2923db024","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
