However, the precise relationship between NRs and their surrounding communities remains poorly understood, whether it is coordinated or unbalanced? This study employed a matrix analysis approach alongside a coordination degree model to assess the relationship and the degree of coordination between the Xiaoheishan NRs (Xhs NRs) and local communities. In addition, a structural equation model was used to analyze the factors that influence the degree of coordination between the Xhs NRs and adjacent communities. Taking into account the willingness of these communities, a prospective development model was proposed. The results of the study revealed that: (1) the relationship between the Xhs NRs and their surrounding communities was predominantly characterized by a protection-oriented approach, particularly in the subprotected regions of Xhs, Dxs, and Jzs. (2) The path analysis revealed that the level of dependence, knowledge, and cost perception among the Xhs NRs communities had a direct negative influence on the degree of coordination. Conversely, the attitudes and perceived benefits to the Xhs NRs had a direct positive effect. (3) The pathway to future development involves a triple model approach: a public participation model, an economic model that focuses on mutual benefits and a protection and poverty alleviation model. The relationship between NRs and surrounding communities should be accurately defined; and the contradiction between protection and development should be fully coordinated. To achieve coordinated development of NRs and communities that reside close by, the Xhs NRs, along with other smaller and scattered NRs, should actively involve the public, particularly local communities, in conservation management.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>自然保护区与周边社区的协调关系，对当地社区<span>发展</span>和保护管理实践有着重大影响。然而，目前二者之间的确切关系是协同还是失衡，仍知之甚少。本研究采用矩阵分析方法和协调度模型，评估了小黑山自然保护区与周边社区的关系模式和二者之间的协调程度；采用结构方程模型，分析了影响小黑山自然保护区与邻近社区协调程度的因素\n<span>；</span>结合社区发展意愿，提出了未来潜在的发展模式。研究结果表明:（1）小黑山自然保护区与周边社区的关系主要以保护为导向，这一特性在小黑山、大雪山和江中山子保护区尤为明显。（2）路径分析显示，小黑山自然保护区周边社区对保护区的依赖程度、社区的知识水平和社区对保护区建立带来的成本感知对协调程度有直接的负面影响；社区对该保护区的态度和对保护区建立带来的收益感知则对协调程度有直接的积极影响。（3）未来的\n<span>潜在</span>发展途径包括三种模式:公众参与模式、以互利共赢为核心的经济模式、保护和扶贫相结合模式。在未来的保护管理中，应准确界定自然保护区与周边社区的关系，充分协调保护与发展的矛盾。为实现自然保护区与周边社区的协调发展，小黑山自然保护区及其他规模较小、分布零散的自然保护区，应积极吸纳公众尤其是当地社区参与到保护管理中。【审阅:郭雪艳】</p>","author":"Xueyan Guo, \nZhongde Huang, \nYang Bai, \nYiwei Lian, \nWei Yang, \nXinyao Lu, \nWei Shi, \nNaiju Wu, \nMaroof Ali Turi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Integrative Conservation: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b2434e359c647f096191c4befea99097fa9394fd28e02b126976eb35d9219c03","entryHash":"3fe298d9f5a1c644e4fc0930e8fd31ba9c7e9ef2f5eab0f080f91fa7ee7d268f","category":"Environment"}
