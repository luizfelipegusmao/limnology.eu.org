{"title":"Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Infection of Human Brain Organoids and Pancreatic Stem Cell-Islets Drives Transcripts Associated with Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and Autoimmune Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1267/v1","date":1721111239000,"content":"Viral infections leading to inflammation have been implicated in several common diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). Of note, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) has been reported to be associated with AD. We sought to identify the transcriptomic changes due to HSV-1 infection and anti-viral drug (acyclovir, ACV) treatment of HSV-1 infection in dissoci-ated cells from human cerebral organoids (dcOrgs) versus stem cell-derived pancreatic islets (sc-islets) to gain potential biological insights into the relevance of HSV-1-induced inflammation in AD and T1D. We observed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HSV-1-infected sc-islets were enriched for genes associated with several autoimmune diseases, most significantly T1D but also rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn’s disease, and multiple sclerosis, whereas DEGs in HSV-1-infected dcOrgs were exclusively enriched for genes associated with AD. ACV treatment of sc-islets did not rescue transcript expression of autoimmune disease-associated genes. Finally, we identified gene ontology categories that were enriched for DEGs that were in common across, or unique to, viral treatment of dcOrgs and sc-islets, such as categories involved in the transferase complex, mitochondrial and autophagy function. Collectively, this studies pro-vide insight to the molecular effects of inflammation in AD and T1D.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"856d5768c1b41b32c6117144e51b604850401b6c0fa69936b46a081f866da9ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
