{"title":"Whole Genome Sequencing of the Entomopathogenic Fungus Lecanicillium lecanii, KMZW-1 and Its Efficacy against Bactrocera dorsalis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1518/v1","date":1721349015000,"content":"Lecanicillium lecanii KMZW-1, is recognized for its potential as a bio-control agent against agricultural and forestry pests, particularly due to its compatibility with integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. This study aimed to investigate the complete genome of L. lecanii KMZW-1 and assess its pathogenicity against Bactrocera dorsalis. Whole genome sequencing revealed a genome size of 47,239,278 bp, comprising 27 contigs, with a GC content of 51.16%. The genome completeness was assessed as 97.93% using BUSCO analysis, AntiSMASH analysis identified 29 gene clusters associated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis providing insights into the genetic basis of its pathogenic mechanisms and biocontrol potential. The pathogenicity of L. lecanii KMZW-1 was assessed using concentrations ranging from 1×10^4 to 1×10^11 spores/mL. Higher-concentrations (1×10^10 to 1×10^11 spores/mL), resulted in significantly increased cumulative mortality rates of B. dorsalis adults compared to the control group. Notably, the pathogenicity was higher in male adults than in females. Probit regression analysis yielded LogLC50 values as 5.662 for female and 4.486 for male B. dorsalis adults. In summary, L. lecanii KMZW-1 exhibits strong insecticidal activity against B. dorsalis and shows potential as a biocontrol agent with IPM strategies. These findings provide robust genomic evidence supporting the use of L. lecanii KMZW-1in managing against B. dorsalis populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"587cec925722d50b2776aadbab325dfe9bc5eb013b5a7c448d55dba89609ee21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
