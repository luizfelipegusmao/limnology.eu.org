{"title":"Comparative Research on Laminar Flame Propagation for Four C8 Fuels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2458/v1","date":1727746507000,"content":"Experimental studies and numerical analyses were conducted to estimate the laminar flame speeds of butyl ether, n-octane, iso-octane, and 1-octene at temperatures of 373 and 443 K and pressures ranging from 0.03 to 0.3 MPa in a constant-volume combustion chamber. Iso-octane had the slowest laminar flame speed whereas butyl ether had the highest. The LLNL model for large hydrocarbons and the Cai model for butyl ether were combined to describe the chemical kinetic mechanism for the test fuels. The simulation data calculated with the constructed model agree with the experimental data. The discrepancies in the laminar flame speeds of the four fuels were clarified from the perspectives of thermodynamics, diffusion, and chemical kinetics. The results reveal that the thermodynamics and chemical kinetics were dominant. Butyl ether had the highest laminar flame speed. This was attributed to it having the highest adiabatic flame temperature and a higher concentration of H and OH radicals, which have a high reactivity in a flame. Iso-octane produces the highest concentration of CH3, which inhibits flame propagation, so that it had the slowest laminar flame speed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45c6702bdf201a3326d6727153b8df448159aceadd7f754aac4d9e68a9bb3f9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
