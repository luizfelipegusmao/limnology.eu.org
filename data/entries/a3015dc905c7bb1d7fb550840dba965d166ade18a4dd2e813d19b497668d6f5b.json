However, the impact of moderate doses of radiation on abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains unknown.</p> Methods <p>Angiotensin II-infused <i>Apoe</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice were irradiated (acute, 1 Gray) either 3 days before (Day-3) or 1 day after (Day+1) pomp implantation. Isolated primary aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were irradiated (acute 1 Gray) for mechanistic studies and functional testing in vitro.</p> Results <p>Day-3 and Day+1 irradiation resulted in a significant reduction in aorta dilation (Control: 1.39+/-0.12; Day-3: 1.12+/-0.11; Day+1: 1.15+/-0.08 mm, P&lt;0.001) and AAA incidence (Control: 81.0%; Day-3: 33.3%, Day+1: 53.3%) compared to the non-irradiated group. Day-3 and Day+1 irradiation led to an increase in collagen content in the adventitia (Thickness control: 23.64+/-2.9; Day-3: 54.39+/-15.5; Day+1 37.55+/-10.8 mm, P = 0.006). However, the underlying protective mechanisms were different between Day-3 and Day+1 groups. Irradiation before Angiotensin II (AngII) infusion mainly modulated vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype with a decrease in contractile profile and enhanced proliferative and migratory activity. Irradiation after AngII infusion led to an increase in macrophage content with a local anti-inflammatory phenotype characterized by the upregulation of M2-like gene and IL-10 expression.</p> Conclusion <p>Moderate doses of ionizing radiation mitigate AAA either through VSCM phenotype or inflammation modulation, depending on the time of irradiation.</p>","author":"Goran Riazi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a3015dc905c7bb1d7fb550840dba965d166ade18a4dd2e813d19b497668d6f5b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
