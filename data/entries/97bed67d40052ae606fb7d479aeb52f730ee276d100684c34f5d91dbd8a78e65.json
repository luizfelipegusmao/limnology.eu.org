{"title":"Landscape and meteorological determinants of malaria vectors’ presence and abundance in the rural health district of Korhogo, Côte d’Ivoire, 2016–2018, and comparison with the less anthropized area of Diébougou, Burkina Faso","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312132","date":1729519200000,"content":"<p>by Paul Taconet, Barnabas Zogo, Ludovic P. Ahoua Alou, Alphonsine Amanan Koffi, Roch Kounbobr Dabiré, Cedric Pennetier, Nicolas Moiroux</p>\r\nBackground <p>Understanding how weather and landscape shape the fine-scale distribution and diversity of malaria vectors is crucial for efficient and locally tailored vector control. This study examines the meteorological and landscape determinants of (i) the spatiotemporal distribution (presence and abundance) of the major malaria vectors in the rural region of Korhogo (northern Côte d’Ivoire) and (ii) the differences in vector probability of presence, abundance, and diversity observed between that area and another rural West African region located 300 km away in Diébougou, Burkina Faso.</p> Methods <p>We monitored <i>Anopheles</i> human-biting activity in 28 villages of the Korhogo health district for 18 months (2016 to 2018), and extracted fine-scale environmental variables (meteorological and landscape) from high-resolution satellite imagery. We used a state-of-the-art statistical modeling framework to associate these data and identify environmental determinants of the presence and abundance of malaria vectors in the area. We then compared the results of this analysis with those of a similar, previously published study conducted in the Diébougou area.</p> Results <p>The spatiotemporal distribution of malaria vectors in the Korhogo area was highly heterogeneous and appeared to be strongly determined and constrained by meteorological conditions. Rice paddies, temporary sites filled by rainfall, rivers and riparian forests appeared to be the larval habitats of <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes. As in Diébougou, meteorological conditions (temperatures, rainfall) appeared to significantly affect all developmental stages of the mosquitoes. Additionally, ligneous savannas were associated with lower abundance of malaria vectors. <i>Anopheles</i> species diversity was lower in Korhogo compared to Diébougou, while biting rates were much higher. Our results suggest that these differences may be due to the more anthropized nature of the Korhogo region in comparison to Diébougou (less forested areas, more agricultural land), supporting the hypothesis of higher malaria vector densities and lower mosquito diversity in more anthropized landscapes in rural West Africa.</p> Conclusion <p>This study offers valuable insights into the landscape and meteorological determinants of the spatiotemporal distribution of malaria vectors in the Korhogo region and, more broadly, in rural west-Africa. The results emphasize the adverse effects of the ongoing landscape anthropization process in the sub-region, including deforestation and agricultural development, on malaria vector control.</p>","author":"Paul Taconet","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"97bed67d40052ae606fb7d479aeb52f730ee276d100684c34f5d91dbd8a78e65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
