{"title":"Temporal and spatial diversity and abundance of cryptophytes in San Diego coastal waters","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13451?af=R","date":1718080861000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Cryptophytes (class Cryptophyceae) are bi-flagellated eukaryotic protists with mixed nutritional modes and cosmopolitan distribution in aquatic environments. Despite their ubiquitous presence, their molecular diversity is understudied in coastal waters. Weekly 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier (La Jolla, California) in 2016 revealed 16 unique cryptophyte amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), with two dominant “clade 4” ASVs. The diversity of cryptophytes was lower than what is often seen in other phytoplankton taxa. One ASV represented a known <i>Synechococcus</i> grazer, while the other one appeared not to have cultured representatives and an unknown potential for mixotrophy. These two dominant ASVs were negatively correlated, suggesting possible niche differentiation. The cryptophyte population in nearby San Diego Bay was surveyed in 2019 and showed the increasing dominance of a different clade 4 ASV toward the back of the bay where conditions are warmer, saltier, and shallower relative to other areas in the bay. An ASV representing a potentially chromatically acclimating cryptophyte species also suggested that San Diego Bay exerts differing ecological selection pressures than nearby coastal waters. Cryptophyte and <i>Synechococcus</i> cell abundance at the SIO Pier from 2011 to 2017 showed that cryptophytes were consistently present and had a significant correlation with <i>Synechococcus</i> abundance, but no detectable seasonality. The demonstrated mixotrophy of some cryptophytes suggests that grazing on these and perhaps other bacteria is important for their ecological success. Using several assumptions, we calculated that cryptophytes could consume up to 44% (average 6%) of the <i>Synechococcus</i> population per day. This implies that cryptophytes could significantly influence <i>Synechococcus</i> abundance.</p>","author":"Tristin Rammel, \nMaitreyi Nagarkar, \nBrian Palenik","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"f252941824235dffa7142039d7f127797652cb96e4741fc108f836453b29a730","category":"Environment"}
