{"title":"Instantaneous Relativistic Precession of Mercury","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1049/v1","date":1710771359000,"content":"The extra precession of Mercury - 42.9 seconds of arc per century - explained by General Relativity (GR), is the result of a secular addition of 5.02 × 10−7 rad. at the end of every orbit around the Sun. We will analyze, the instantaneous precession and its addition along one orbit, determine the magnitude and oscillations around the mean value, comparing key theoretical proposals. This angular precession, should be the result reaction of Mercury to the gravitoelectric action produced by the geometric curve space-time at each single point of the elliptic orbit. The better we should know about this instantaneous precession, the better we will determine the external action and its quantum core nature, if that is the case. The Doppler tracking of the MESSENGER spacecraft, produces only 1 m error, enough precision to deduce the complete geodesic orbit of Mercury as an open free-fall path, isolated from other planets gravitational interference. The aim of this article is also to encourage JPL, IMCCE. and other scientific teams to do so because, as far as I know, it has not been entirely measured yet, by accurately tracking that motion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57b5cab9e67287ad9095a259c191cc9286ee09718da5f25709f6a0b97c360d37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
