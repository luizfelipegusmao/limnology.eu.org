{"title":"Navigating Uncertainty: A Tripartite Creative Knowledge Exchange Among Artists, Researchers, Carers and People with Lived Experience of Dementia, A co‐Created Space for Living Uncertainty","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0347/v1","date":1725434739000,"content":"In a world filled with uncertainties, Ebb&amp;Flow emerged as a story of convergence, intertwining dementia research, caregiving, and artistic exploration into a tripartite creative knowledge exchange. This study delves into the complexities of uncertainty in dementia care and research through a collaborative project involving artists, researchers, carers, and individuals with lived experience of dementia. Initiated by the Trellis:Arbor program, Ebb&amp;Flow sought to co-created a human space addressing the multifaceted nature of uncertainty.   The sea, with its unpredictable nature, served as a guiding metaphor for the project, reflecting the unpredictability of dementia and life. Over three months, through paintings, writings, and digital mediums, participants documented the changing emotions, challenges, and discoveries they encountered daily. The project fostered an environment where uncertainties were openly discussed, building supportive and resilient communities through participatory co-creation and methodological exchange.   Key activities included a digital logbook, allowing participants to document and share their experiences of uncertainty, and the creation of the Ebb&amp;Flow card deck—a compilation of personal stories and insights that serve as a legacy of shared experiences. Each card facilitated dialogue, understanding, and connection, bridging gaps between those affected by dementia and the broader community. The project culminated in a final exhibition and sharing event, where participants, researchers, and the public celebrated the journey's outcomes through stories and artworks.   Throughout this journey, we observed that embracing uncertainty and fostering empathy through creative collaboration profoundly impacted participants, enhancing empathy and resilience. This project underscores the transformative potential of integrating artistic practices with scientific research to address the emotional and psychological burdens of dementia and research environments. Ebb&amp;Flow demonstrates that even in the face of the unknown, a united community can find strength, solace, and understanding, highlighting the power and beauty of unity in exploring and expressing the multifaceted experiences of dementia and life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f0cecde98a49e7e069ba4822dcc3e282223e7af8d8270724dcaea9ccd70d5d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
