{"title":"Postindustrial Jute Waste as a Support for Nano-carbon Nitride Photocatalyst: Influence of the Chemical Pretreatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1125/v1","date":1718607776000,"content":"Non-woven jute (NWJ) produced from the carpet industry waste was oxidized by H2O2 or alkali treated by NaOH and compared with water-washed samples. Changes in the structure of the NWJ, tracked by XRD, showing that both chemical treatments disrupt hydrogen bond networks between cellulose Iβ chains of the NWЈ fibers. Thereafter, nano carbon nitride (nCN) was impregnated, using layer-by-layer technique, onto water washed jute sample (nCN-Jw), NaOH treated sample (nCN-Ja) and H2O2 treated sample (nCN-Jo). Analysis of the FTIR spectra of the impregnated samples, revealed that nCN anchors to the water washed NWЈ surface through hemicellulose and secondary hydroxyl groups of the cellulose. In the case of chemically treated samples nCN is preferentially bonded to the hydroxymethyl groups of cellulose. The stability and reusability of nCN-J samples were assessed by tracking the photocatalytic degradation of Acid Orange 7 (AO7) dye under simulated solar light irradiation. Results from up to ten consecutive photocatalytic cycles demonstrated varying degrees of effectiveness across different samples. nCN-Jo and nCN-Ja samples exhibited declining effectiveness over cycles, attributed to bond instability between CN and jute. In contrast, the nCN-Jw sample consistently maintained high degradation rates over ten cycles, with a dye removal percentage constantly above 90%.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e603aab81b38410f120b1758b75ece2835563e056ceaf244e8ebb9d4ee61b5f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
