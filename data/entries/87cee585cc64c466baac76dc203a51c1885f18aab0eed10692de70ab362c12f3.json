{"title":"What, where, and how: Regulation of translation and the translational landscape in plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1540/7223411?rss=1","date":1689120000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Translation is a crucial step in gene expression and plays a vital role in regulating various aspects of plant development and environmental responses. It is a dynamic and complex program that involves interactions between mRNAs, transfer RNAs, and the ribosome machinery through both cis- and trans-regulation while integrating internal and external signals. Translational control can act in a global (transcriptome-wide) or mRNA-specific manner. Recent advances in genome-wide techniques, particularly ribosome profiling and proteomics, have led to numerous exciting discoveries in both global and mRNA-specific translation. In this review, we aim to provide a “primer” that introduces readers to this fascinating yet complex cellular process and provide a big picture of how essential components connect within the network. We begin with an overview of mRNA translation, followed by a discussion of the experimental approaches and recent findings in the field, focusing on unannotated translation events and translational control through cis-regulatory elements on mRNAs and trans-acting factors, as well as signaling networks through 3 conserved translational regulators TOR, SnRK1, and GCN2. Finally, we briefly touch on the spatial regulation of mRNAs in translational control. Here, we focus on cytosolic mRNAs; translation in organelles and viruses is not covered in this review.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"87cee585cc64c466baac76dc203a51c1885f18aab0eed10692de70ab362c12f3","category":"Environment"}
