The influence of two regularly used different commercial feeds and varied environments such as pond and biofloc systems on haemato-biochemical and growth parameters of <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> was studied by the results of 4-month experiment. Fish ponds and biofloc systems where all the fish were supplied either feed A and B were surveyed weekly. The crude protein content of feed A was 30%, while that of feed B was 28%. Physico-chemical characteristics of water in all culturing systems were suitable for Nile Tilapia production throughout the study period. Results revealed a significant difference (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in most haemato-biochemical parameters. Growth performance was better in fish fed on feed A than feed B in both culture systems. In between, the habitat wide range of haemato-biochemical indices and fish growth parameters were significantly higher in biofloc technology than pond culture system. However, no significant difference (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05) was recorded in fish enzymatic activities in both systems. Furthermore, it was found that both the length and weight gain were positively associated with the crude protein of the feeds. However, in the case of biofloc, crude protein of both feeds works far better than the pond, as indicated by the <i>p</i>-value and regression R square. Current study delivers the basic knowledge to observe fish blood and growth parameters, which could be essential to understanding the fish culture management and environment.</p>","author":"Syed Sikandar Habib, \nAima Iram Batool, \nMuhammad Fayyaz Ur Rehman, \nSaira Naz","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"44f74dd460e47eb7896810bb97d352ee74f684730a9d40aa310a94fd499382cc","category":"Environment"}
