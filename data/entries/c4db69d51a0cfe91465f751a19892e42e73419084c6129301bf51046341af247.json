{"title":"Assessing the Stress Induced by Novel Packaging in GaN Hemt Devices via Raman Spectroscopy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1301/v1","date":1713780677000,"content":"Micro-Raman spectroscopy was carried out to evaluate the localized residual stresses in commercial Gallium Nitride-based devices, specifically AlGaN/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) in a novel packaging design provided by STMicroelectronics S.r.l. The packaging plays a key role in protecting the device core against the external environment, thus minimizing damages caused by mechanical shocks, exposure to light, and contact with chemicals, conjointly achieving an efficient heat dissipation rate. Even though the packaging is a required step for the proper functioning of ready-to-use electronic devices, its application typically may introduce mechanical stress to AlGaN/GaN HEMTs, which can result in various reliability issues. In this paper, we investigate the impact of packaging on residual stress by analyzing the frequency shift of the E2 Raman peak along GaN layers and at the GaN/Si interface. An extensive evaluation was conducted using both a packaged device and a wafer-level device. The correlation between Raman frequency shifts of the E2 mode was accurately quantified, revealing a stress mitigation of approximately 0.1 GPa. This reduction is ascribed to the compressive stress introduced by the packaging, which partially offsets the intrinsic tensile stress of the wafer-level device. The proposed methodology could, in principle, be implemented to improve the development of a packaging.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4db69d51a0cfe91465f751a19892e42e73419084c6129301bf51046341af247","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
