{"title":"Broadband target strength of arabesque greenling, Pacific sand lance, and pointhead flounder","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/1/195/7469915?rss=1","date":1702339200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Measurement of target strength (TS) is important for estimating the abundance of species using fisheries acoustics. However, most researchers have only used a limited number of representative frequencies for acoustic measurements of fish without a swim bladder (bladderless fish). Here, we measured the broadband TS of three bladderless fish species, arabesque greenling (<span>Pleurogrammus azonus</span>), Pacific sand lance (<span>Ammodytes personatus</span>), and pointhead flounder (<span>Cleisthenes pinetorum</span>), using two broadband echosounders. TS measurements were conducted in a seawater tank over frequency ranges of 45–90 and 80–120 kHz using a tether method. Higher TS and directivity were observed at higher frequencies than at lower frequencies for pointhead flounder and arabesque greenling. However, the TS for Pacific sand lance was relatively flat over the measured frequency spectra. Additionally, the TS of pointhead flounder and Pacific sand lance could be expressed as a function of body length and the TS of arabesque greenling could be expressed as a function of body length and frequency, which could be used in fish species discriminations and size estimations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"cd707bcd22191d1ac68ac81b1567af6ac6f1261712f621d784255ff3b592bf5d","category":"Environment"}
