{"title":"NaOH alkali‐sunset yellow FCF dye photosensitizer‐ascorbic acid reductant‐Cetrimonium bromide surfactant based photogalvanic cells: Solar power, storage and spectral study","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14286?af=R","date":1709812904000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The photogalvanic cell, which works on the photogalvanic effect, has the potential for both solar energy conversation and storage. The dye sensitizer is the main material required for fabrication of these cells as it is a light absorbing agent and also an electroactive-species at both the electrodes. The dye aggregation and dye toxicity are some of the main hurdles in the fabrication of the good and safe photogalvanic cells. The dye materials so far exploited in the photogalvanics have disadvantages like low-water solubility and/or toxicity. The Sunset Yellow FCF dye is a food dye having very high solubility in the water (19 g/100 mL). This dye material has not attracted the attention of the photogalvanicists. So, in the present study, the use of very safe and highly water-soluble Sunset Yellow FCF dye has been planned to fabricate safe and efficient photo galvanic cells. In present study, the observed optimum cell performance is as potential 806 mV, current 5400 μA, power 552.0 μW, and conversion efficiency 11.19%. The spectral study shows that the Sunset Yellow FCF dye material is responsible for absorption of the light by the electrolyte. This dye material shows very high photo-stability as substantiated from the fact that the height of absorption band at wavelength maxima of electrolyte under pre-illuminated and post-illuminated conditions is comparable. Further, the power storage capacity is sufficiently robust as the cell is capable of supplying power at its ~80% capacity after very long time of 24 h.</p>","author":"Pooran Koli, \n Dheerata, \nAnita Meena, \nRajendra Kumar, \nMeenakshi Jonwal, \nAnamika Charan, \nJyoti Saren","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"53fdc00b54c632fa1c235112a5c846cece0c21d3f5fbcd3fe8c8136a189463b5","category":"Environment"}
