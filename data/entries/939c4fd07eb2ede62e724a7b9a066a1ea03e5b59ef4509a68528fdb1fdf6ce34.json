{"title":"Research on Effect of Psychological Emotions and Academic Performance on Music Learning System Based on Nonlinear Model System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1883/v1","date":1714360190000,"content":"This research aims to explore factors that influence sustainable music learning system from psychological perspective, and innovatively constructs a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. For first time, combines nonlinear system and identifies relevant factors affecting music learning by establishing data system for questionnaire answering and a quantitative model for actual academic performance. Existing research mainly looks at several factors that affect fragmented music learning system from perspective of teachers' teaching rules, emphasizing phased teaching state and learning goals of teachers as main body, thus ignoring music learning students, who are a large group of music learning objects. The research fills gap in this type of research object, focusing on sustainable music learning system from emotional perspective and students who occupy a dominant position in music learning, so as to more accurately explore impact of their emotional influencing factors on music learning system. The most prominent innovation of this study lies in construction of stochastic nonlinear system for psychological influencing factors of student music learning and a quantitative model for actual learning effect. Through analysis of nonlinear system, weight values of several negative emotions on music learning system are obtained. The comprehensive impact of emotional factors and practical learning on music learning system can be obtained by weighting them together.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"939c4fd07eb2ede62e724a7b9a066a1ea03e5b59ef4509a68528fdb1fdf6ce34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
