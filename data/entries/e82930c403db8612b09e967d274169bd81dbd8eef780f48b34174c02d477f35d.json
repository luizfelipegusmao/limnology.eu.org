{"title":"Acyl carrier protein OsMTACP2 confers rice cold tolerance at the booting stage","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1277/7618153?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Low temperatures occurring at the booting stage in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span> L.) often result in yield loss by impeding male reproductive development. However, the underlying mechanisms by which rice responds to cold at this stage remain largely unknown. Here, we identified <span>MITOCHONDRIAL ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN 2</span> (<span>OsMTACP2</span>), the encoded protein of which mediates lipid metabolism involved in the cold response at the booting stage. Loss of OsMTACP2 function compromised cold tolerance, hindering anther cuticle and pollen wall development, resulting in abnormal anther morphology, lower pollen fertility, and seed setting. <span>OsMTACP2</span> was highly expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during anther development, with the encoded protein localizing to both mitochondria and the cytoplasm. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed differential expression of genes related to lipid metabolism between the wild type and the <span>Osmtacp2-1</span> mutant in response to cold. Through a lipidomic analysis, we demonstrated that wax esters, which are the primary lipid components of the anther cuticle and pollen walls, function as cold-responsive lipids. Their levels increased dramatically in the wild type but not in <span>Osmtacp2-1</span> when exposed to cold. Additionally, mutants of two cold-induced genes of wax ester biosynthesis, <span>ECERIFERUM1</span> and <span>WAX CRYSTAL-SPARSE LEAF2</span>, showed decreased cold tolerance. These results suggest that OsMTACP2-mediated wax ester biosynthesis is essential for cold tolerance in rice at the booting stage.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"e82930c403db8612b09e967d274169bd81dbd8eef780f48b34174c02d477f35d","category":"Environment"}
