{"title":"An improved digital soil mapping approach to predict total N by combining machine learning algorithms and open environmental data","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40808-024-02127-8","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) is fundamental for soil monitoring, as it is limited and strategic for human activities. The availability of high temporal and spatial resolution data and robust algorithms is essential to map and predict soil properties and characteristics with adequate accuracy, especially at a time when the scientific community, legislators and land managers are increasingly interested in the protection and rational management of soil.</p>\n                    <p>Proximity and remote sensing, efficient data sampling and open public environmental data allow the use of innovative tools to create spatial databases and digital soil maps with high spatial and temporal accuracy. Applying machine learning (ML) to soil data prediction can improve the accuracy of maps, especially at scales where geostatistics may be inefficient. The aim of this research was to map the nitrogen (N) levels in the soils of the Nurra sub-region (north-western Sardinia, Italy), testing the performance of the Ranger, Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models, using only open source and open access data. According to the literature, the models include soil chemical-physical characteristics, environmental and topographic parameters as independent variables. Our results showed that predictive models are reliable tools for mapping N in soils, with an accuracy in line with the literature. The average accuracy of the models is high (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.76) and the highest accuracy in predicting N content in surface horizons was obtained with RFR (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.79; RMSE = 0.32; MAE = 0.18). Among the predictors, SOM has the highest importance. Our results show that predictive models are reliable tools in mapping N in soils, with an accuracy in line with the literature. The results obtained could encourage the integration of this type of approach in the policy and decision-making process carried out at regional scale for land management.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"1e44f408c865559d2791cea2624d424724ae267eb0a8441cc85d87c16b24881d","category":"Environment"}
