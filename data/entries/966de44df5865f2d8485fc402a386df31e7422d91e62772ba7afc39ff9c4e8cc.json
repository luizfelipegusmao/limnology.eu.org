{"title":"Epidemiological and Molecular Characterization of HBV Virus Infection in General Population of North Waziristan, Pakistan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0601/v1","date":1720422274000,"content":"Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a lethal form of viral hapatitis, is an extra burden on the socioeconomic status of a country.\nObjectives: The population-based studies to quantify the incidence of hepatitis B.\nData sources: in the North Waziristan, formally known as EX-FATA (Federal Administrated Tribal Area), Pakistan, are still rare. Study eligibility criteria: 943 individuals were selected on the basis of signs and symptoms to determine the epidemiology of HBV in the study population.\nTests: Hepatitis B virus (HBV).\nMethods of data synthesis: Among these, 626 were male and 317 were female. All the HBV suspected individual were screened through ICT (Indirect Coombs Test) , ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and RT-PCR (Re-verse transcription polymerase chain reaction).\nResults: The results obtained from the screening tests for HBV revealed that RT-PCR based results are more reliable and it indicated that HBV infection is more common in male 41 (6.54%) than female 15 (4.73%). The age range selected for the study was 1-75 years. Age wise analysis indicated that HBV is more prevalent among individuals of age group between 16 to 45 years. This age range also showed higher number of patients having either mild, moderate or elevated viral loads. The HBV genotype D was the most common, present in 62.5% patients. However, 16.07 % patients were having genotype U, 12.5 % genotype C, 8.92 % genotype A, and 7.14% had genotype B.\nDiscussion: The questionnaire based investigation revealed that HBV was most prevalent among married individuals (64.6%), whereas least prevalent among individuals having HBV positive family member (1.4 %). The other risk factors contributed were history of dental procedures (57.8%), ear, nose, piercing, or tattooing and uses of un-disposable syringes (56.5%), transfusion of blood or plasma (42.9%), surgery (41.8%), frequent visits to barber shops (39.45%), and addiction of injectable drugs (38.1%). The current study is providing a clear picture of the alarming situation HBV transmission and emphasis on the need for more effective planing, strategies and policies for the control and prevention of HBV.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"966de44df5865f2d8485fc402a386df31e7422d91e62772ba7afc39ff9c4e8cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
