Stevens, Stephen R. Frost</p>\r\n\r\nMeasurement of human faces is fundamental to many applications from recognition to genetic phenotyping. While anthropometric landmarks provide a conventional set of homologous measurement points, digital scans are increasingly used for facial measurement, despite the difficulties in establishing their homology. We introduce an alternative basis for facial measurement, which 1) provides a richer information density than discrete point measurements, 2) derives its homology from shared facial topography (ridges, folds, <i>etc</i>.), and 3) quantifies local morphological variation following the conventions and practices of anatomical description. A parametric model that permits matching a broad range of facial variation by the adjustment of 71 parameters is demonstrated by modeling a sample of 80 adult human faces. The surface of the parametric model can be adjusted to match each photogrammetric surface mesh generally to within 1 mm, demonstrating a novel and efficient means for facial shape encoding. We examine how well this scheme quantifies facial shape and variation with respect to geographic ancestry and sex. We compare this analysis with a more conventional, landmark-based geometric morphometric (GMM) study with 43 landmarks placed on the same set of scans. Our multivariate statistical analysis using the 71 attribute values separates geographic ancestry groups and sexes with a high degree of reliability, and these results are broadly similar to those from GMM, but with some key differences that we discuss. This approach is compared with conventional, non-parametric methods for the quantification of facial shape, including generality, information density, and the separation of size and shape. Potential uses for phenotypic and dysmorphology studies are also discussed.","author":"Sawitree Wisetchat","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a2ebbc2f1bec6ffbe4651886b329c93998175fb72b86288bb7c170a39ed0cd46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
