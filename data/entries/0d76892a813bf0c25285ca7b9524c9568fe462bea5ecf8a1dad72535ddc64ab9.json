{"title":"Complementary and Alternative Therapies (CAT) in Nursing Education in Spanish Universities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1244/v1","date":1721183491000,"content":"Background: The use of complementary therapies in the population is increasing, so it is necessary to understand the training that health professionals receive in this type of therapy in their training plans, as they are often the primary source of information for patients. Our objective was to investigate Spanish universities that offer subjects on complementary therapies in their Nursing degree programs. Methods: Observational descriptive cross-sectional study. For this purpose, we used the document published on the website of the Ministry of Universities as a working document. Additionally, a literature search was conducted up to September 2023 in the PubMed database, along with reverse searches. Results: Out of a total of 62 universities, only 16 (29%) offer a subject related to this type of therapy, with most of them being elective courses. Conclusions: The training content on complementary care in Nursing degree programs in Spanish universities is scarce, highlighting the potential benefit of expanding and promoting it, in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d76892a813bf0c25285ca7b9524c9568fe462bea5ecf8a1dad72535ddc64ab9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
