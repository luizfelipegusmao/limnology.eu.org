{"title":"Enhancing Dendritic Cell Cancer Vaccination: The Synergy of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Combined Therapies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0880/v1","date":1718272302000,"content":"Dendritic cell (DC) cancer vaccines are a promising therapeutic approach, leveraging the immune system to fight tumors. These vaccines utilize DCs' ability to present tumor-associated antigens to T cells, triggering a robust immune response. DC vaccine development has progressed through three generations. The first generation involved priming DCs with tumor-associated antigens or messenger RNA outside the body, showing limited clinical success. The second generation improved efficacy by using cytokine mixtures and specialized DC subsets to enhance immunogenicity. The third generation uses blood-derived DCs to elicit a stronger immune response. Clinical trials indicate that cancer vaccines have lower toxicity than traditional cytotoxic treatments. However, achieving significant clinical responses with DC immunotherapy remains challenging. Combining DC vaccines with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Antigen 4 and anti-programmed Death-1 antibodies has shown promise by enhancing T cell responses and improving clinical outcomes. These combinations can transform non-inflamed tumors into inflamed ones, boosting ICIs' efficacy. Current research is exploring new checkpoint targets like LAG-3, TIM-3, and TIGIT, considering their potential with DC vaccines. Additionally, engineering T cells with chimeric antigen receptors or T cell receptors could further augment the anti-tumor response. This comprehensive strategy aims to enhance cancer immunotherapy, focusing on increased efficacy and improved patient survival rates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d35b62961e27d6303d1612ac89a6dcead6fca68d2489f750d5ad3b9b4066b70f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
