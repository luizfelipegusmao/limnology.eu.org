{"title":"How to Survive without Water? A Short Lesson from Desiccation Tolerance of the Budding Yeast","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1603/v1","date":1719209760000,"content":"Water is essential for all life on earth. It is a major component that makes up living organisms and plays a vital role in multiple biological processes. It provides a medium for chemical and enzymatic reactions in the cell and is a major player for osmoregulation and maintenance of cell turgidity. Despite this, many organisms, called anhydrobiotes, are capable of surviving under extremely dehydrated conditions. Less is known about how anhydrobiotes adapt and survive under the desiccation stress. Studies have shown that morphological and physiological changes occur in anhydrobiotes in response to desiccation stress. Certain disaccharides and proteins, including heat shock proteins, intrinsically disordered proteins, and hydrophilins, play important roles in the desiccation tolerance of the anhydrobiotes. In this review, we summarize the recent findings of the desiccation tolerance in the budding yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also propose that the yeast under desiccation could be used as a model to study neurodegenerative disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c9f8d1def03184038088456b3fe709b389d0817f61d297f312be987877e873e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
