{"title":"Predicting fat cover in beef cattle to make on-farm management decisions: a review of assessing fat and of modeling fat deposition","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae058/7643887?rss=1","date":1712793600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Demands of domestic and foreign market specifications of carcass weight and fat cover, of beef cattle, have led to the development of cattle growth models that predict fat cover to assist on-farm managers make management decisions. The objectives of this paper are 4-fold: 1) conduct a brief review of the biological basis of adipose tissue accretion, 2) briefly review live and carcass assessments of beef cattle, and carcass grading systems used to develop quantitative compositional and quality indices, 3) review fat deposition models: Davis growth model (<strong>DGM</strong>), French National Institute for Agricultural Research growth model (<strong>IGM</strong>), Cornell Value Discovery System (<strong>CVDS</strong>), and BeefSpecs drafting tool (<strong>BeefSpecsDT</strong>), and 4) appraise the process of translating science and practical skills into research/decision support tools that assist the Beef industry improve profitability. The <span>r</span><sup><span>2</span></sup> for live and carcass animal assessments, using several techniques across a range of species and traits, ranged from 0.61 to 0.99 and from 0.52 to 0.99, respectively. Model evaluations of DGM and IGM were conducted using Salers heifers (n = 24) and Angus-Hereford steers (n = 15) from an existing publication and model evaluations of CVDS and BeefSpecsDT were conducted using Angus steers (n = 33) from a research trial where steers were grain finished for 101 d in a commercial feedlot. Evaluating the observed and predicted fat mass (<strong>FM</strong>) is the focus of this review. The FM mean bias for Salers heifers were 7.5 and 1.3 kg and the root mean square error of prediction (<strong>RMSEP</strong>) were 31.2 and 27.8 kg and for Angus-Hereford steers the mean bias were −4.0 and −10.5 kg and the RMSEP were 9.14 and 21.5 kg for DGM and IGM, respectively. The FM mean bias for Angus steers were −5.61 and −2.93 kg and the RMSEP were 12.3 and 13.4 kg for CVDS and BeefSpecsDT, respectively. The decomposition for bias, slope, and deviance were 21%, 12%, and 68% and 5%, 4%, and 91% for CVDS and BeefSpecsDT, respectively. The modeling efficiencies were 0.38 and 0.27 and the models were within a 20 kg level of tolerance 91% and 88% for CVDS and BeefSpecsDT, respectively. Fat deposition models reported in this review have the potential to assist the beef industry make on-farm management decisions on live cattle before slaughter and improve profitability. Modelers need to continually assess and improve their models but with a caveat of 1) striving to minimize inputs, and 2) choosing on-farm inputs that are readily available.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"6b36f24d91987091cb01bf82fa7499d587eb0961317bf626010f26235be1e882","category":"Environment"}
