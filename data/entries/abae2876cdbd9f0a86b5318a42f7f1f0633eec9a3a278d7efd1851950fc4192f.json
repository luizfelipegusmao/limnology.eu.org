{"title":"The Photon Energy Density Parameter &Omega;&gamma; of the Universe Exactly Derived","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1663/v1","date":1711545477000,"content":"We will demonstrate that the photon energy density parameter Ωγ of the universe can be derived exactly in Rh = ct cosmology. We find that it must be Ωγ = 1/5760π ≈ 5.52621330180192× 10^(−5). This indicates that there is no uncertainty in the radiation density within at least somesub-classes of Rh = ct cosmology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"abae2876cdbd9f0a86b5318a42f7f1f0633eec9a3a278d7efd1851950fc4192f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
