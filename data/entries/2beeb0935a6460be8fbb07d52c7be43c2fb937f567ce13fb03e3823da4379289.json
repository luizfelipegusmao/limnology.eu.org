{"title":"249 Effects of sorghum silage kernel processing on growth performance and blood metabolites of beef heifers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/360/7757102?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Our previous studies suggested that using a shredlage (SHRD) processor or a conventional (CONV) sorghum kernel processor leads to similar apparent total tract nutrient digestibility of whole plant sorghum silage (WPSS). This study evaluated the effects of feeding WPSS harvested using different kernel processors (CONV vs. SHRD), on growth performance of beef heifers. Grain sorghum (ADV2450IG; Advanta Seeds, Argentina) was harvested at the hard-dough stage with a Class Jaguar 950 (Harsewinkel, Germany), switching the kernel processor to generate the forage material for the two treatments: CONV and SHRD. The material was bagged in two 2.7 m diameter bags and allowed to ferment for 3 mo. Black Angus heifers [n = 96; body weight (BW) = 15 ± 1 mo, 249.6 ± 28.6 kg] were blocked by initial BW, and randomly assigned to pens (8 heifers/pen, 6 pens/treatment). Diets consisted, all in DM basis, of WPSS of each respective type (SHRD or CONV) at 90.5%, expeller soybean meal at 7.0%, and a vitamin-mineral-NNP concentrate at 2.5%. The experiment consisted of a 14-d adaptation period, followed by a 56-d growing period; and feed was offered once daily. Data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design, using pen as the experimental unit, with the fixed effect of treatment and the random effect of block. No differences were observed (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) for final BW, dry matter intake, and residual feed intake. However, CONV fed heifers tended to gain more BW per day (ADG, 0.83 vs. 0.77 kg/d; <span>P</span> = 0.07) and had greater gain to feed ratio (GF, 0.083 vs. 0.075 kg/kg; <span>P</span> = 0.05) and greater Kleiber ratio (KR, 12.1 vs 11.2 g/kg; <span>P</span> = 0.05) as compared with SHRD fed heifers. Furthermore, performance calculated dietary Net Energy of gain (NEg) in CONV fed heifers tended to be greater than that for SHRD (0.70 vs. 0.65 Mcal/kg of diet DM, respectively; <span>P</span> = 0.06). Moreover, blood serum from CONV fed heifers had 16% greater total bilirubin (<span>P</span> = 0.04), 12% greater cholesterol (<span>P</span> = 0.02), and slightly greater non esterified fatty acids (<span>P</span> = 0.03) concentrations. Noteworthy, serum concentrations of total bilirubin were correlated (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.03) with ADG, GF, KR and NEg. In conclusion, the type of kernel processor utilized for the harvest of sorghum silage may have an impact on feed efficiency of beef cattle. These differences could be related to changes on the site of utilization of nutrients, particularly starch; what could also explain the differences on blood metabolites. However, further research is needed to help explain these findings.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"2beeb0935a6460be8fbb07d52c7be43c2fb937f567ce13fb03e3823da4379289","category":"Environment"}
