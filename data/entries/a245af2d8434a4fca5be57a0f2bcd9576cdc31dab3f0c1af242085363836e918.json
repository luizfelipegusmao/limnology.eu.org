{"title":"Uremic Toxins and Inflammation: Metabolic Pathways Affected in Patients Undergoing Renal Replacement Therapies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2068/v1","date":1721907717000,"content":"3.9 million individuals rely on kidney replacement therapy worldwide. They experience height-ened susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases and mortality, alongside an increased risk of in-fections and malignancies, with inflammation being key to explaining this intensified risk. This study utilized semi-targeted metabolomics to explore novel metabolic pathways related to in-flammation in this populations. We collected pre and post-session blood samples of patients who had already undergone one year of chronic hemodialysis. And used liquid chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometry to perform a metabolomic analysis. Afterwards, we employed both univariate (Mann-Whitney test) and multivariate (logistic regression with LASSO regulari-zation) to identify metabolites associated with inflammation. In the univariate analysis, in-dole-3-acetaldehyde, 2-ketobutyric acid, and urocanic acid showed statistically significant de-creases in median concentrations in the presence of inflammation. In the multivariate analysis, metabolites positively associated with inflammation include allantoin, taurodeoxycholic acid, norepinephrine, pyroglutamic acid, and L-hydroorotic acid. Conversely, metabolites showing negative associations with inflammation include benzoic acid, indole-3-acetaldehyde, methio-nine, citrulline, alphaketoglutarate, n-acetyl-ornithine and 3-4-dihydroxibenzeneacetic acid. Non inflamed patients exhibit preserved autophagy and reduced mitochondrial dysfunction. Under-standing inflammation in this group hinges on the metabolism of arginine and the urea cycle. Additionally, the microbiota, particularly uricase-producing bacteria and those metabolizing tryptophan, play critical roles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a245af2d8434a4fca5be57a0f2bcd9576cdc31dab3f0c1af242085363836e918","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
