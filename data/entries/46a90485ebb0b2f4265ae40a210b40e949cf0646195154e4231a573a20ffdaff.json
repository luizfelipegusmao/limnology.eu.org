{"title":"Optimized Right-Turn Pedestrian Collision Avoidance System Using Intersection LiDAR","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0047/v1","date":1725260538000,"content":"The incidence of right-turning pedestrian accidents is increasing in South Korea. Most of the accidents occurred when the larger vehicle was turning right, and the main cause of the accidents was found to be the driver's limited field of vision. After these accidents, the government has implemented a series of institutional measures with the objective of preventing such accidents. However, despite the institutional arrangements in place, pedestrian accidents continue to occur. We focused on the many limitations that autonomous vehicles, like humans, can face in such situations. To address this issue, we propose a right-turn pedestrian collision avoidance system by installing a LiDAR sensor in the center of the intersection to facilitate pedestrian detection. Furthermore, the urban road environment is considered, as this provides the optimal conditions for the model to perform at its best. During this research, we collected data on right-turn accidents using the CARLA simulator and ROS interface and demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in preventing such incidents. Our results suggest that the implementation of this method can effectively reduce the incidence of right-turn accidents in autonomous vehicles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46a90485ebb0b2f4265ae40a210b40e949cf0646195154e4231a573a20ffdaff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
