{"title":"Association between Enteral Nutrition and the Incidence of Pneumonia in Critical Care Adults: A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0354/v1","date":1725441836000,"content":"Background: To investigate the association between enteral feeding and the risk of pneumonia in critical care adult patients. Methods: An updated literature review of studies discussing between 2016 and 2023. CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of science databases were used to explore studies regarding our subject, the association between enteral feeding and the risk of pneumonia in critical care adults. Results: Enteral nutrition (EN) has been linked to a significant reduction in pneumonia, as well as shorter ICU or hospital stays, and decreased mechanical-ventilation duration in numerous studies. Conversely, pneumonia risk and other infections, as well as the fatality rate, has been found to increase with EN. Early initiation of EN within 48 hours, along with a low-calorie diet containing (&lt; 600 Kcal/day) demonstrated a notable decrease in the occurrence of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) when contrasted with delayed EN and a high-calorie diet. EN was associated with a marked decrease in adverse events including aspiration pneumonia, emesis, and the escalation of respiratory support. Conclusion: EN is safe and effective in critically ill patients. It is advisable for future research to investigate the monitoring of larger sample sizes to ascertain the most effective feeding methods in the intensive care unit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2e35d0ec36b47d7958d73d4136fa57307d8f01ecd5e388aa1de51f856d4dadb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
