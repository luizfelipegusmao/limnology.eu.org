{"title":"The risk for subsequent primary lung cancer after cervical carcinoma: A quantitative analysis based on 864,627 cases","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305670","date":1719237600000,"content":"<p>by Sheng Gong, Gang Li, Dan Li, Yu Liu, Banggui Wu</p>\r\nPurpose <p>To compare the risk of developing subsequent primary lung cancer among cervical cancer patients and the general population.</p> Methods <p>Several databases were searched from inception to April 25, 2023. The standard incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were combined to identify the risk for second primary lung cancer after cervical carcinoma. Subgroup analyses based on the follow-up period, age, degree of malignancy and source of SIR were conducted. All the statistical analyses were performed with STATA 15.0 software.</p> Results <p>A total of 22 retrospective studies involving 864,627 participants were included. The pooled results demonstrated that cervical cancer patients had a significantly greater risk for lung cancer than did the general population (SIR = 2.63, 95% CI: 2.37–2.91, P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, subgroup analyses stratified by follow-up period (&lt;5 years and ≥5 years), age (≤50 years and &lt;50 years), and degree of malignancy (invasive and in situ) also revealed an increased risk of developing lung cancer among cervical carcinoma patients.</p> Conclusion <p>Cervical cancer patients are more likely to develop subsequent primary lung cancer than the general population, regardless of age, follow-up time or degree of malignancy. However, more high-quality prospective studies are still needed to verify our findings.</p>","author":"Sheng Gong","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4dfb0e17441f8e7e6321ad2c98231e9f955d18d8959ad8476df5a73f20a4e766","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
