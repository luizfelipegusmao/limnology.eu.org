{"title":"Empirical analysis of spatial heterogeneity in the development of China’s National Fitness Plan","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305397","date":1718287200000,"content":"<p>by Yuanbo Hu</p>\r\nPurpose <p>The National Fitness Plan (NFP) is a vital initiative aimed at realizing Healthy China 2030. This study assessed spatial heterogeneity in the NFP development and the socioeconomic factors contributing to this inequality.</p> Methods <p>Data from 31 administrative regions in 2021 were analyzed using four NFP development metrics. Spatial autocorrelation was evaluated using global Moran’s <i>I</i>, followed by global and local regression models for non-random spatial patterns.</p> Results <p>National physical fitness exhibited significant clustering (z = 5.403), notably a high-high cluster in East China. The global regression model identified three socioeconomic factors in the geographically weighted regression model: per capita disposable income and the number of public buses positively affected national physical fitness, while general public budget expenditure had a negative impact.</p> Conclusions <p>Persistent unequal NFP development is projected due to income disparities in economically backward regions. To promote the NFP effectively, a cost-efficient strategy includes creating 15-minute fitness circles, especially by establishing public sports facilities in Western China communities. These findings inform policy priorities for advancing the NFP towards Healthy China 2030.</p>","author":"Yuanbo Hu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3ab700394d016db625870ac996982cc547485d6f248ac924bc52d5bf3605e0f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
