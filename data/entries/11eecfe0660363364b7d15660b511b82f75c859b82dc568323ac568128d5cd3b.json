This study aimed to specify and validate with an international sample of healthcare professionals, a proactive deprescribing process of steps and constituent activities. We developed a proactive deprescribing process framework of steps which we populated with literature-derived activities required to be undertaken by healthcare professionals. We distributed a survey to healthcare professionals in-ternationally requesting for each activity; the frequency of its occurrence in practice and whether it was important. Extended response questions invited barriers and enablers to deprescribing. The 263 survey respondents were from 25 countries. A proactive deprescribing process was developed comprising four steps: (1) Identify a patient for potential stop of a medicine, (2) Evaluate a patient for potential stop of a medicine, (3) Stop a medicine(s), (4) After a medicine has been stopped, and 17 activities. All activities were considered important by â‰¥70% respondents. Nine activities re-quired healthcare professionals to undertake in direct partnership with the patient and/or care-giver, of which seven were only sometimes undertaken. Deprescribing interventions should focus on addressing the barriers and enablers of healthcare professionals undertaking the activities that require direct partnership with the patient and/or caregiver.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"11eecfe0660363364b7d15660b511b82f75c859b82dc568323ac568128d5cd3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
