{"title":"Triaxiality and Plastic Strain Dependent Proposed PEAK Parameter for Predicting Crack Formation in Polypropylene Polymer Reservoir Subjected to Pressure Load","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1406/v2","date":1721797165000,"content":"This article raise a topic of critical examination of polypropylene, a key polymeric material, and its extensive application within the automotive industry, particularly focusing on the manufacturing of brake fluid reservoirs. The study aims to enhance the understanding of polypropylene's behavior under mechanical stresses through a series of laboratory destruction tests and numerical simulations, emphasizing the Finite Element Method (FEM). A novel aspect of this research is the introduction of the PEAK parameter, a groundbreaking approach designed to assess the material's resilience against varying states of strain, known as triaxiality. This parameter facilitates the identification of critical areas prone to crack initiation, thereby enabling the optimization of component design with a minimized safety margin, which is crucial for cost-effective production. The methodology involves conducting burst tests to locate crack initiation sites, followed by FEM simulations to determine the PEAK threshold value for the Sabic 83MF10 polypropylene material. The study successfully validates the predictive capability of the PEAK parameter, demonstrating a high correlation between simulated results and actual laboratory tests. This validation underscores the potential of the PEAK parameter as a predictive tool for enhancing the reliability and safety of polypropylene automotive components. The research presented in this article contributes significantly to the field of material science and engineering by providing a deeper insight into the mechanical behavior of polypropylene and introducing an effective tool for predicting crack initiation in automotive components. The findings hold promise for advancing the design and manufacturing processes in the automotive industry, with potential applications extending to other sectors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"29b26c75ba79971f6dbbd796d239d2ab19cb1e906c0b24e95c904f9342d56d3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
