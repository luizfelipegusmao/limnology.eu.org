{"title":"The Effects of Lutein/ Zeaxanthin (Lute-Gen&reg;) on Eye Health, Eye Strain, Sleep Quality, and Attention in High Electronic Screen Users: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1893/v1","date":1721819588000,"content":"Background: Lutein and zeaxanthin are fat-soluble antioxidant nutrients that have evidence of beneficial effects on vision and eye health. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of supplementation with lutein and zeaxanthin isomers (Lute-genÂ®) on eye health, eye strain, sleep quality, and attention in high electronic users. Study design: Two-arm, 6-month, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Methods: Seventy volunteers aged 18 to 65 who used electronic screens for more than 6 hours daily were supplemented with 10 mg of lutein and 2mg of zeaxanthin-isomers or a placebo. Outcome measures included several ophthalmic examinations comprising the Schirmer tear test, photo-stress recovery time, contrast sensitivity, tear film break-up time, and self-report measures of visual fatigue, computer vision, sleep quality and attention. Results: Compared to the placebo, lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation was associated with greater improvements in the Schirmer tear test, photo-stress recovery time, and tear film break-up time. However, there were no group differences in the change in self-report measures or contrast sensitivity. Lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation was well-tolerated, with no reports of serious adverse reactions or clinically significant changes in safety blood measures, including liver function, renal function, blood lipids, and full blood examination. Conclusions: The results from this study provide support for the beneficial effects of 6 months of lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation on visual health and dry eyes in regular users of electronic screens. However, these findings were not corroborated by group differences in the administered self-report questionnaires.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2deceab252fe35d19954bdd55fa27db425d685d5026ce9347a9e98c07f680a9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
