{"title":"Innovations in Additive Manufacturing: Pressure Capacity Assessment of L-PBF Produced Microchannel Heat Exchangers for Industrial Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1410/v1","date":1721206656000,"content":"Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF)-based manufacturing is a growing area of research, with a particular focus on evaluating constraints in printed products. This research emphasises the importance of considering various factors—including mechanical properties and support structures—that influence the final product during the design phase. Specifically, the design of microchannel heat exchangers is highlighted, where all constraints are critical. This article will present a method for analysing channel pressure limitations and report findings about mechanical properties loss from examining tube porosity. This includes a summary of results and the establishment of an experimental device system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e253c3bff66106183e1c85ca5858677600b5c63bfd26154dedaef9982dd00528","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
