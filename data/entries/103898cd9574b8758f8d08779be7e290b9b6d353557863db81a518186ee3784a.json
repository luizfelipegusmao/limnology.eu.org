{"title":"In-Situ Hydrothermal Fabrication of ZnO-Loaded GAC Nanocomposite for Efficient Rhodamine B Dye Removal via Synergistic Photocatalytic and Adsorptive Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1355/v1","date":1718799258000,"content":"In this work, zinc oxide (ZnO)/ granular activated carbon (GAC) composites at different ZnO concentration (0.25M-ZnO@GAC, 0.5M-ZnO@GAC, and 0.75M-ZnO@GAC) were prepared by an in-situ hydrothermal method and demonstrated synergistic photocatalytic degradation and ad-sorption of Rhodamine B (RhB). The thermal stability, morphological structure, elemental com-position, crystallographic structure, and textural properties of developed catalysts were charac-terized by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA/DTG), scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive-x-ray (SEM-EDS), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. Successful loading of ZnO onto GAC was confirmed by SEM-EDS and XRD analysis. The BET surface areas of GAC, 0.25M-ZnO@GAC, 0.5M-ZnO@GAC, and 0.75M-ZnO@GAC were 474 m2/g, 450 m2/g, 453 m2/g, and 421 m2/g, respectively. The decrease in GAC could be attributed to the successful loading of ZnO on the GAC surface.  Notably, 0.5M-ZnO@GAC  exhibited the best photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 82% and 97% under UV-A and UV-C light over 120 min, attributed to improved crystallinity and visible light absorption. The photocatalytic degradation parameters revealed that lowering the RhB concentration, raising the catalyst dosage and pH be-yond the point of zero charge (PZC) would favor the RhB degradation. Photocatalytic reusability was demonstrated over 5 cycles. Scavenger tests revealed that the hydroxyl radicals (•OH), su-peroxide radicals (O2−•), and photoinduced hole (h+) radicals play a major role during the RhB degradation process. Based on the TOC results, the RhB mineralization efficiency of 79.1% was achieved by 0.5M-ZnO@GAC. Additionally, GAC exhibited a strong adsorptive performance towards RhB with adsorption capacity and RhB removal of 487.1 mg/g and 99.5% achieved within 90 min equilibrium time. The adsorption characteristics were best described by pseu-do-second-order kinetics, suggesting chemical adsorption. This research offers a new strategy for the development of effective photocatalyst materials with potential for wider wastewater treat-ment applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"103898cd9574b8758f8d08779be7e290b9b6d353557863db81a518186ee3784a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
