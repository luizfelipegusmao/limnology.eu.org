{"title":"Identification of Cancer Stem Cell (CSC) Associated Genes, Prognostic Value and Candidate Drugs as Modulator of CSC Associated Signaling in Carcinomas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0105/v1","date":1722550554000,"content":"Background: Cancer stem cells (CSC) are small subpopulation of cancer cells that has the potential to self-renew and has the strong proliferative capacity that sustain tumorigenesis capability. This ability of the CSCs to escape immune responses make the CSCs a primary source of functionally altered, immune-resistant, chemo-resistant aggressive tumor cells.  Mentioned characteristic determines the potential advantage of targeting CSCs for the treatment of solid tumor. Method: We downloaded different gene expression datasets of CSCs from the NCBI-GEO database and identified common gens by using suitable Venn tool. Then explored the prognostic significance of the particular genes in particular cancer along with analysis of expression of these genes at protein level in human carcinomas by using different webserver. Finally, using toxicogenomic database we selected several important drugs or chemicals. Result: In this study, we identified common targets between three types of solid tumor and the prognostic significance of the identified genes. The identified drugs capable of targeting the expression or signaling network of designated genes of CSC that may contribute in CSC targeted cancer therapy. Conclusion: We identified several CSC associated genes in human breast, lung and ovarian carcinomas and several drugs that can target the function of these genes. Our study also suggests that there is need for more experimental investigations to find out the actual functional activity and the mechanism of action of the genes of CSC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"65d98885ea99cad61f4dfc5db5501f7e45ed74c9e0ce42e74434dfcf7983aec8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
