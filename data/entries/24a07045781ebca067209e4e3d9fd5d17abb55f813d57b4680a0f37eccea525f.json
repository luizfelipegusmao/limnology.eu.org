{"title":"Methane Emissions, Nowhere to Hide from Detection and Compliance Monitoring with Newly Launched Satellite","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gas.22407?af=R","date":1715083715000,"content":"<p>Climate change is often synonymous with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions. But there is another greenhouse gas (GHG) that is also a contributor: methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), a short-lived but extremely potent GHG. Methane emissions behave differently than CO<sub>2</sub> emissions when emitted into the atmosphere. The warming effects of CH<sub>4</sub> wear off quickly compared to CO<sub>2</sub>, which remains in the atmosphere for centuries. But what it lacks in retention time, it makes up for in potency: CH<sub>4</sub> has approximately 80 times the warming impact of CO<sub>2</sub> over a 20-year period. That means it has a greater impact on near-term (20-year) temperature change. When CH<sub>4</sub> escapes (or is released) into the atmosphere, it acts as a heavy blanket in the atmosphere, trapping the sun's heat and warming the world.</p>","author":"David W.
