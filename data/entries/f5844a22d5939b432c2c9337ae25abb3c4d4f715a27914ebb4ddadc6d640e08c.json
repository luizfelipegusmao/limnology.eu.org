{"title":"Physical Activity and Urinary Sodium Excretion Circadian Rhythm: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0505/v1","date":1720175379000,"content":"Background: Blood pressure (BP) is characterized by a circadian rhythm (Circr), with lower nighttime values, called dipping. Non-dipping is associated with higher CVD risk. The Circr of urinary sodium excretion (NaCle), peaking during the day, is linked to BP patterns. Physical ac-tivity (PA) is known to improve BP control and enhance the dipping phenomenon, but its possi-ble effect on NaCle remains unclarified. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the correla-tion between PA and the Circr of NaCle and to determine if the relationship is independent of age, sex, BP values, dipping pattern, and salt intake. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the Ticino Epidemiological Stiffness Study, involving 953 participants in Switzerland. Data collection included standardized questionnaires, blood samples, 24-hour urine collections, and ambulatory BP monitoring. Participants were categorized into sedentary, partially active, and active. The effect of PA, NaCl intake, and dipping on the day/night NaCle ratio, was assessed with multivariable linear regressions. Results: Participants median age 49 years, with 78% having normal BP values and 47% exhibiting a dipping pattern. 51% were classi-fied as sedentary and 22% as partially active. The median NaCl intake was 7.9 g/day. The youngest subjects had a higher hourly NaCle ratio compared to older subjects. Higher NaCl in-take correlated with increased BP, phenomenon more pronounced in men and younger subjects. The hourly day/night NaCle ratio positively correlates with dipping; however, PA did not show a significant correlation with the NaCle ratio. Conclusion: This study indicates that while the day/night NaCle ratio correlates with the dipping pattern, PA is unrelated to the circadian rhythm of renal sodium handling. The beneficial effects of PA on BP and cardiovascular health thus appear to be mediated through mechanisms other than NaCle. These are explorative find-ings only, but relativize the need for further investigations on the topic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5844a22d5939b432c2c9337ae25abb3c4d4f715a27914ebb4ddadc6d640e08c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
