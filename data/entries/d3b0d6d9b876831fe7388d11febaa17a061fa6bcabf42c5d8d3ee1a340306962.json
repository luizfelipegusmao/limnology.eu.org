{"title":"Design of Mixed-Mode Analog PID Controller with CFOAs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1870/v1","date":1711720366000,"content":"The design of a mixed-mode proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller circuit using current-feedback operational amplifiers (CFOAs) as active components is proposed. With the same circuit topology, the proposed configuration of three CFOAs, four resistors, and two capacitors is capable of performing the PID controller in all four operation modes: namely voltage mode, trans-admittance mode, current mode, and trans-impedance mode. Numerous mathematical analyses are conducted to determine the controller performance under ideal and non-ideal conditions. Additionally, the mixed-mode second-order lowpass filter is suggested, and also used to examine the workability of the proposed mixed-mode PID controller in a feedback control structure. The proposed PID controller is implemented with the commercially available IC-type CFOA AD844, and the simulation results are presented to illustrate the functionality of the controller and its closed-loop control system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d3b0d6d9b876831fe7388d11febaa17a061fa6bcabf42c5d8d3ee1a340306962","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
