What is currently limiting the wide-spread adoption of this technology is the degradation mechanisms that can affect the cycle life and ionic conductivity performance [<a href=\"#ozae044.881-B3\">3-5</a>]. These degradation mechanisms can include dendritic growth from the anode into the solid electrolyte (SE), interfacial chemical reactions between the electrodes and the SE, loss of interfacial contact and micro structural deterioration in the SE and electrodes during cell cycling [<a href=\"#ozae044.881-B6\">6-10</a>]. A practical understanding of these degradation mechanisms for the development of high-performance SSBs requires high resolution-based characterization techniques for the the microstructural features of the SE, electrodes and interface [<a href=\"#ozae044.881-B11\">11</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.881-B12\">12</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"baa8ae5338baffe6bf7697734edb07a3d34d9105f07644c988aea9f8bbc1708d","category":"Environment"}
