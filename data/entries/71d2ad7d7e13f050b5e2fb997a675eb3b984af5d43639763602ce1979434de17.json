We demonstrated that transcutaneous application of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) could improve local blood flow and reduce skeletal muscle atrophy in a fracture model. However, the effects of transcutaneous application of CO<sub>2</sub> in cancer-bearing conditions are not yet known. In this study, we calculated fat-free body mass (FFM), defined as the skeletal muscle mass, and evaluated the expression of muscle atrophy markers and uncoupling protein markers as well as the cross-sectional area (CSA) to investigate whether transcutaneous application of CO<sub>2</sub> to skeletal muscle could suppress skeletal muscle atrophy in cancer-bearing mice. Human oral squamous cell carcinoma was transplanted subcutaneously into the upper dorsal region of nude mice, and 1 week later, CO<sub>2</sub> gas was applied to the legs twice a week for 4 weeks and FFM was calculated by bioimpedance spectroscopy. After the experiment concluded, the quadriceps were extracted, and muscle atrophy markers (muscle atrophy F-box protein (MAFbx), muscle RING-finger protein 1 (MuRF-1)) and uncoupling protein markers (uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3)) were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining, and CSA by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The CO<sub>2</sub>-treated group exhibited significant mRNA and protein expression inhibition of the four markers. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining showed decreased MAFbx, MuRF-1, UCP2, and UCP3 in the CO<sub>2</sub>-treated group. In fact, the CSA in hematoxylin and eosin staining and the FFM revealed significant suppression of skeletal muscle atrophy in the CO<sub>2</sub>-treated group. We suggest that transcutaneous application of CO<sub>2</sub> to skeletal muscle suppresses skeletal muscle atrophy in a mouse model of oral squamous cell carcinoma.","author":"Aki Sasaki","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"71d2ad7d7e13f050b5e2fb997a675eb3b984af5d43639763602ce1979434de17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
