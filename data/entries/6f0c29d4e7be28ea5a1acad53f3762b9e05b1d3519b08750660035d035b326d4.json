{"title":"EEG-Visual Multiclass Classification Based on a Channel Selection, MNE Algorithm and Deep Network Architectures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1809/v1","date":1714285396000,"content":"This work addresses the challenge of EEG visual multiclass classification into 40 classes for Brain-Computer interface applications, by using deep learning architectures. The visual multiclass classification approach offers BCI applications a significant advantage, since it allows the supervision of more than one BCI interaction, considering that each class label supervises a BCI task. However, because of the nonlinearity and nonstationarity of EEG signals, performing multiclassifiers based on EEG features remains a significant challenge for BCI systems. In the present work, mutual information-based discriminant channel selection and Minimum-Norm Estimate algorithms are implemented to select discriminant channels and enhance EEG data. Hence, deep EEGNet and Convolutional-recurrent neural networks are implemented separately to classify EEG data of image visualization into 40 labels. By using the k-fold cross-validation approach, average classification accuracies of 94.8% and 89.8% were obtained by implementing the aforementioned network architectures, respectively. Satisfactory results obtained with this method offer a new implementation opportunity for multi-task BCI applications by utilizing a reduced number of channels (&amp;lt;50%), compared to those presented in the related literature where the whole set of channels is used.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f0c29d4e7be28ea5a1acad53f3762b9e05b1d3519b08750660035d035b326d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
