{"title":"Comprehensive Overview of Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies against SARS-COV-2 Variants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0708/v1","date":1712739264000,"content":"Currently, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved into various variants, including the numerous highly mutated Omicron sub-lineages, significantly increasing immune evasion ability. The development raises concerns about possibly diminished effectiveness of available vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics. Here, we describe those representative categories of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that retain prominent effectiveness against emerging variants including Omicron sub-lineages. The molecular characteristics, epitope conservation, and resistance mechanisms of these antibodies are further detailed, aiming to offer suggestion or direction for the development of therapeutic antibodies, and facilitate the vaccine design with broad-spectrum potential.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c042eb61e1335c9eeee1548c53798a993536e79c6d912ce71ce3bdc15f016164","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
