{"title":"Macromolecular tool box to elucidate CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-RELATEDâ€“RLK binding, signaling, and downstream effects","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/17/5438/7667234?rss=1","date":1715126400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant peptides communicate by binding to a large family of receptor-like kinases (RLKs), and they share a conserved binding mechanism, which may account for their promiscuous interaction with several RLKs. In order to understand the <span>in vivo</span> binding specificity of the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED peptide family in Arabidopsis, we have developed a novel set of CLAVATA3 (CLV3)-based peptide tools. After carefully evaluating the CLE peptide binding characteristics, using solid phase synthesis process, we modified the CLV3 peptide and attached a fluorophore and a photoactivable side group. We observed that the labeled CLV3 shows binding specificity within the CLAVATA1 clade of RLKs while avoiding the distantly related PEP RECEPTOR clade, thus resolving the contradictory results obtained previously by many <span>in vitro</span> methods. Furthermore, we observed that the RLK-bound CLV3 undergoes clathrin-mediated endocytosis and is trafficked to the vacuole via ARA7 (a Rab GTPase)-labeled endosomes. Additionally, modifying CLV3 for light-controlled activation enabled spatial and temporal control over CLE signaling. Hence, our CLV3 macromolecular toolbox can be used to study rapid cell specific down-stream effects. Given the conserved binding properties, in the future our toolbox can also be used as a template to modify other CLE peptides.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"a77945dee97540293f14448ee9340ce716364ae1ede09bdde78cd1a3d1f90c68","category":"Environment"}
