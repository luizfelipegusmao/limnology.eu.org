{"title":"‘AirPods Extreme’ Was Considered as a Name for AirPods Pro","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/airpods-pro-were-almost-named-airpods-extreme/","date":1708798807000,"content":"\n<p>Joe Rossignol, with a fun little post at MacRumors: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the months leading up to Apple announcing the AirPods Pro in \nOctober 2019, the company considered changing the name of the \nwireless headphones to AirPods Extreme, according to internal \ninformation obtained by MacRumors. </p>\n\n<p>The name AirPods Extreme was floated by at least one member of \nApple’s leadership team, but the company ultimately decided to \nmove forward with AirPods Pro branding after many employees \nobjected to the change, we have learned. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple’s matrix of product-name suffix adjectives — Pro, Max, Ultra, Extreme — usually makes sense, but occasionally doesn’t. “AirPods Pro” is clearly the right name for this product, though. Calling these small earbuds “Extreme” would make no sense side-by-side with AirPods Max. To me, at least, “AirPods Extreme” would be the name for over-the-ear headphones even better than AirPods Max.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/24/airpods-extreme\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2bc40b115a6817b4a635fa940c02a8d3af51f61a93e96ebc441c40540828532e","category":"Tech"}
