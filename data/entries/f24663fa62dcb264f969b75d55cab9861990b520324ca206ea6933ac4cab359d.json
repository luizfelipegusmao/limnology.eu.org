{"title":"Identification of tipping years and shifts in mesozooplankton community structure using multivariate analyses: a long-term study in southern North Sea","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/3/553/7146850?rss=1","date":1682640000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Many previous studies on the changes in zooplankton communities considered only subsets of the total community. In this study, we investigated the temporal dynamics of the mesozooplankton community structure, considering all taxa (holo- and meroplankton) sampled over the last five decades at Helgoland Roads. We identified two tipping years. The first one occurred in 1983, which is consistent with previous studies conducted on copepods. The second shift, even more pronounced, took place in the mid-2000s. During the first shift, most taxa significantly increased in abundance and kept high densities until the end of the 1990s. Then, we observed in the mid-2000s a sharp decrease in community diversity and abundances of almost all taxa. One of the aims of the study was to test the robustness depending on the choice of taxa. To test this, we selected different subsets of the total zooplankton community, both randomly as well as based on functionality. We observed very similar trends over time for all groups, showing the complete community experienced the same changes. However, the timing of the tipping years depended on the organisms considered. These results highlight that the observed changes in the planktonic community are surprisingly robust and visible in most planktonic organisms.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"f24663fa62dcb264f969b75d55cab9861990b520324ca206ea6933ac4cab359d","category":"Environment"}
