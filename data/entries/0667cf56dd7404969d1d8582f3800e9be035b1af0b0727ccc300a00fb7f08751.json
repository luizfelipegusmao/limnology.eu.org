{"title":"Association of Polyamine and Other Dietary Component Intake and Feces Content of N-acetyl Putrescine, and Cadaverine with Patients&rsquo; Colorectal Lesions.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0989/v1","date":1720737243000,"content":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Early detection and the modification of risk factors, such as diet, can reduce its incidence. Among food components the polyamines are important for maintaining gastrointestinal health and are metabolites of gut microbiota. Their disruption is linked to CRC, making polyamines a potential marker of the disease. This study analyzed the relationship between dietary components, including polyamines, and the presence of polyamines in feces to determine whether their presence could contribute to predicting the occurrence of colorectal lesions in patients. Fifty-nine participants of both sexes (aged 50 to 70 years) who had undergone colonoscopy screening for CRC (18 without and 41 with colorectal lesions) participate in the study. A nutritional survey and determination of fecal polyamine content were performed. Specific dietary components and putrescine levels were higher in patients with colorectal lesions. The diet ratio of putrescine/spermidine and the fecal content of N-acetyl putrescine and cadaverine were elevated in patients with precancerous lesions and adenocarcinomas, showing a potential predictive value for the presence of colorectal lesions. These findings suggest that N-acetyl putrescine and cadaverine could be complementary markers for the diagnosis of suspected colorectal lesions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0667cf56dd7404969d1d8582f3800e9be035b1af0b0727ccc300a00fb7f08751","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
