{"title":"Validity evidence for using the Situational Motivation Scale to assess pre-clerkship medical student motivation.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1525/v1","date":1716450645000,"content":"Motivation is essential in education, with highly motivated learners engaging more deeply with content and more ably transferring knowledge to new contexts. However, the validity of scales to measure motivation has been underexplored in pre-clerkship medical education. This study evaluates the validity of the Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS) for measuring motivation among pre-clerkship medical students in post-situational and short-term contexts. Using a sample of n = 156 students from the Frank H. Netter MD School of Medicine at Quinnipiac University, SIMS was tested for construct validity with attention paid to content, response process, internal structure, relationships to other variables, and consequences of use evidence. Small modifications from present to past tense in English were made for clarity following focus group feedback, and content validity was ensured via expert consultation. SIMS demonstrated strong internal consistency with a satisfactory Cronbachâ€™s alpha for all subscales and anticipated patterns of correlations. Factor analysis confirmed appropriate factor loadings, with a stronger model fit for the short-term context, and no observed adverse effects on student engagement. These findings support the robustness of SIMS in capturing intrinsic, extrinsic, and amotivation in pre-clerkship medical students, highlighting its applicability for short-term and situational motivational assessment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8e573143ec9e3279ee78e2ae90f2e40836512c97b2477b5373a8d49fae7a5ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
