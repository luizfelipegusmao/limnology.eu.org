{"title":"The Potential of Community-Led Development Initiatives for Addressing Urban Inequality: Strategies and Challenges of Successful Models in Practice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0885/v1","date":1710489042000,"content":"This paper provides an overview of current literature on community-led development initiatives in urban contexts, their role in addressing urban inequality, and the challenges they face. This study examines effective strategies of community-led initiatives, such as empowering communities, building partnerships, mobilizing resources, focusing on local needs, and participatory design methods. Case studies from around the world demonstrate how successful community-led development initiatives have been able to overcome obstacles to create more inclusive and equitable urban environments. Institutional support, including technical assistance, capacity building, and regulatory frameworks, are crucial for promoting the success and sustainability of these initiatives. Challenges to community-led initiatives include limited resources, capacity building needs, inadequate infrastructure, lack of institutional support, and lack of trust among community members. Therefore, the paper suggests that it is essential to address these challenges to enable the success of community-led development initiatives. Furthermore, this study recommends that future research should explore how emerging technologies and innovative approaches can effectively support community-led development initiatives and advance more just and sustainable urban development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24078ffb38afe24672d6ce8e118ec7ace336aaad5b47499483df48641accd673","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
