{"title":"Validation of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale in Military Personnel of the Spanish Army (RSE-JGA)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0676/v1","date":1725931835000,"content":"Background: Self-esteem is a psychological term that, since its emergence in 1890 with William James, has been widely studied. Furthermore, this construct has been examined in different areas of psychology, including the clinical field, where its relationship with mental health and low levels of depression has been demonstrated. In the realm of positive psychology, its connection to resilience and life satisfaction has also been established. Objective: To evaluate validity based on internal structure from the perspective of Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Item Response Theory (IRT), to obtain evidence of validity based on the relationship with other variables and to estimate the reliability of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). Method: To this end, 584 military personnel from the three ranks of the Spanish Army (officers, non-commissioned officers, and professional soldiers and sailors) were evaluated, of which 511 were men (87.70%) and 72 were women (12.30%), with an age range of 18 to 66 years (M = 33.17, SD = 7.38). Results: The results indicate that the unidimensional structure of the RSES shows adequate fit indices (CFI = .94, TLI = .91, SRMR = .05), while the difficulty and discrimination parameters exhibited favorable values. Additionally, an acceptable reliability value was found (ɷ = .81; α = .80). Conclusions: Therefore, it is concluded that the RSE-JGA presents adequate psychometric properties of validity and reliability, making it a useful and relevant instrument for measuring self-esteem in military personnel of the Spanish Army.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3eb392463174e62059952b31699405abecffe9621ebb05bec85a92561a10adb5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
