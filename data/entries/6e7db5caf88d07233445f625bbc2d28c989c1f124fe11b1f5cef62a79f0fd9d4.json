{"title":"Anesthetics drug wastage and preventive strategies: Systematic review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306933","date":1721224800000,"content":"<p>by Meseret Firde Habte, Biresaw Ayen Tegegne, Tikuneh Yetneberk Alemayehu</p>\r\nBackground <p>Surgical Patients and hospitals are now facing financial strain due to direct anesthetic demand as a result of the development of new anesthetic drugs, equipment, and techniques. Up to 15% of a hospitalâ€™s pharmacy budget is currently allocated to anesthetic drug expenses. Drug wastage during anesthesia practice is a widespread hidden source of healthcare waste that leads to anesthetic drug shortages as well as poor operating room efficiency. On the other hand, despite the fact that it is preventable in the vast majority of cases, it is well described that drug wastage is routinely observed, including in developing countries where the consequences significantly affect both hospitals and patients.</p> Methods <p>This review aims to review the prevalence of anesthetic drug waste across the world and systematically formulate and describe preventive strategies. Relevant publications were identified using systematic searches on databases including Google Scholar, Medline (PubMed), the Cochrane Library, and Embase. In addition, papers were detected and then selected through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria guidelines and the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Using the predetermined terms and dates from the searching databases, a total of 504 articles were identified. Based on the screening criteria, 16 papers were considered eligible and included in the final review. In addition, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Manual for Evidence Synthesis was used for evaluating the quality of selected articles. This study is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42024497044.</p> Results <p>Of the sixteen publications from eleven different nations that were considered suitable for inclusion, only two of them addressed the waste of inhalational anesthetics. In more than half of eligible articles, propofol was the frequently wasted drug that contributed to increased financial loss through drug waste. The first most significant factor contributing to the waste of intravenous and inhalational anesthetics was the disposal of multidrug vials following their use for a single patient and high fresh gas flow, respectively.</p> Conclusion <p>Anesthetic medication waste is a common occurrence worldwide, despite the fact that it is expensive and has a significant negative impact on operating room efficiency. Because the majority of drug waste is avoidable, preventive measures may lower drug waste and improve patient and hospital efficiency.</p>","author":"Meseret Firde Habte","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6e7db5caf88d07233445f625bbc2d28c989c1f124fe11b1f5cef62a79f0fd9d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
