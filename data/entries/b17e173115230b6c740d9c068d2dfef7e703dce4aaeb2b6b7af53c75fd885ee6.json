{"title":"Fouling of Reverse Osmosis (RO) and Nanofiltration (NF) Membranes by Low Molecular Weight Organic Compounds (LMWOCs), Part 1: Fundamentals and Mechanism","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1618/v1","date":1726824685000,"content":"Reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) are ubiquitous technologies in modern water treatment, finding applications across various sectors. However, the availability of high-quality water suitable for RO/NF feed is diminishing due to droughts caused by global warming, increasing demand, and water pollution. As concerns grow over the depletion of precious freshwater resources, a global movement is gaining momentum to utilize previously overlooked or challenging water sources, collectively known as “marginal water.” Fouling is a serious concern when treating marginal water. In RO/NF, biofouling, organic and colloidal fouling, and scaling are particularly problematic. Of these, organic fouling, along with biofouling, has been considered difficult to manage. The major organic foulants studied are natural organic matter (NOM) for surface water and groundwater and effluent organic matter (EfOM) for municipal wastewater reuse. Polymeric substances such as sodium alginate, humic acid, and proteins have been used as model substances of EfOM. Fouling by low molecular weight organic compounds (LMWOCs) such as surfactants, phenolics, and plasticizers is known, but there have been few comprehensive reports. This review aims to shed light on fouling behavior by LMWOCs and its mechanism. LMWOC foulants reported so far are summarized, and the role of LMWOCs is also outlined for other polymeric membranes, e.g., UF, gas separation membranes, etc. Regarding the mechanism of fouling, it is explained that the fouling is caused by the strong interaction between LMWOC and the membrane, which causes the water permeation to be hindered by LMWOCs adsorbed on the membrane surface (surface fouling) and sorbed inside the membrane pores (internal fouling). Adsorption amounts and flow loss caused by the LMWOC fouling were well correlated with the octanol-water partition coefficient (log P). In part 2, countermeasures to solve this problem and applications using the LMWOCs will be outlined.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b17e173115230b6c740d9c068d2dfef7e703dce4aaeb2b6b7af53c75fd885ee6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
