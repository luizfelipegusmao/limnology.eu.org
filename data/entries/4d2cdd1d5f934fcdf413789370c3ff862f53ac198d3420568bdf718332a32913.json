{"title":"<i>Syzygium aromaticum</i> essential oil and its major constituents: Assessment of activity against <i>Candida</i> spp. and toxicity","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305405","date":1718719200000,"content":"<p>by Priscilla Guimarães Silva Vasconcelos, Gabriel Flores Abuna, Joanda Paolla Raimundo e Silva, Josean Fechine Tavares, Edja Maria Melo de Brito Costa, Ramiro Mendonça Murata</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Syzigium aromaticum</i> essential oil (EO), eugenol, and β-caryophyllene were evaluated regarding antifungal, antibiofilm, and <i>in vitro</i> toxicity. Additionally, <i>in vivo</i> toxicity of EO was observed. Anti-<i>Candida</i> activity was assessed through broth microdilution assay for all compounds. Time-kill assay (0, 1, 10, 30 min, 1, 2, and 4 h) was used to determine the influence of EO and eugenol on <i>Candida</i> Growth kinetics. Thereafter, both compounds were evaluated regarding their capacity to act on a biofilm formation and on mature biofilm, based on CFU/ml/g of dry weight. Cell Titer Blue Viability Assay was used for <i>in vitro</i> cytotoxicity, using oral epithelial cells (TR146) and human monocytes (THP-1). Lastly, <i>Galleria mellonella</i> model defined the EO <i>in vivo</i> acute toxicity. All compounds, except β-cariofilene (MIC &gt; 8000 μg/ml), presented antifungal activity against <i>Candida</i> strains (MIC 500–1000 μg/ml). The growth kinetics of <i>Candida</i> was affected by the EO (5xMIC 30 min onward; 10xMIC 10 min onward) and eugenol (5xMIC 10 min onward; 10xMIC 1 min onward). Fungal viability was also affected by 5xMIC and 10xMIC of both compounds during biofilm formation and upon mature biofilms. LD<sub>50</sub> was defined for TR146 and THP1 cells at, respectively, 59.37 and 79.54 μg/ml for the EO and 55.35 and 84.16 μg/ml for eugenol. No sign of toxicity was seen <i>in vivo</i> up to 10mg/ml (20 x MIC) for the EO. <i>S</i>. <i>aromaticum</i> and eugenol presented antifungal and antibiofilm activity, with action on cell growth kinetics. <i>In vivo</i> acute toxicity showed a safe parameter for the EO up to 10 mg/ml.","author":"Priscilla Guimarães Silva Vasconcelos","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4d2cdd1d5f934fcdf413789370c3ff862f53ac198d3420568bdf718332a32913","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
