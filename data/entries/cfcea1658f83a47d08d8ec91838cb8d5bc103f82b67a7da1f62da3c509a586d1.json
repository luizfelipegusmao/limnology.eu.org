{"title":"A Novel Tsetlin Machine with Enhanced Generalization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1767/v1","date":1727093918000,"content":"Tsetlin machine (TM) is a novel machine learning approach that implements propositional logic to perform different tasks like classification and regression. The TM can not only achieves competitive accuracy in these tasks but it is also able to provide results that are explainable and easy to implement using simple hardware. The TM learns using clauses based off the features of the data. Final classification is done using a combination of the clauses. In this paper, we propose the novel idea of adding regularizers to TM, called as Regularized TM (RegTM), to improve generalization. Regularizers have been widely used in machine learning to improve accuracy. We explore different regularization strategies and how they would influence performance. We show the feasibility of our methodology by different experiments on benchmark datasets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cfcea1658f83a47d08d8ec91838cb8d5bc103f82b67a7da1f62da3c509a586d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
