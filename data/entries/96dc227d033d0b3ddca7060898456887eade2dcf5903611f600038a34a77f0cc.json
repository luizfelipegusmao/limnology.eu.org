{"title":"Network‚ÄêIndependent Grid Synchronous Stability Boundary and Spontaneous Synchronization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.1791/v4","date":1710397898000,"content":"Spontaneous synchronization on complex networks is widespread in the real world. These synchronization behaviors are believed to be closely related to the network topology. However, it is difficult to obtain complete information in reality. Therefore, a network-independent analysis path is needed. In this study, a synchronized stability boundary equation is derived which is system- and disturbance-independent and applicable to arbitrarily coupled grids. The results also imply that spontaneous synchronization on a network may be network independent. These conclusions provide new research paths for network synchronization and analyze the synchronization stability of grids in a unified way.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"96dc227d033d0b3ddca7060898456887eade2dcf5903611f600038a34a77f0cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
