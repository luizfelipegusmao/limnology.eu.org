However, therapeutic proteins can be unstable and rapidly eliminated from the blood, compared to conventional drugs. Furthermore, on-target but off-tumor protein binding can lead to off-tumor toxicity, lowering the maximum tolerated dose. Thus, for effective treatment therapeutic proteins often require continuous or frequent administration. To improve protein stability, delivery and release, proteins can be encapsulated inside drug delivery systems. These drug delivery systems protect the protein from degradation during (targeted) transport, prevent premature release and allow for long-term, sustained release. However, thus far achieving high protein loading in drug delivery systems remains challenging. Here, the use of protein desolvation with acetonitrile as an intermediate step to concentrate monoclonal antibodies for use in drug delivery systems is reported. Specifically, trastuzumab, daratumumab and atezolizumab were desolvated with high yield (âˆ¼90%) into protein nanoparticles below 100 nm with a low polydispersity index (&lt;0.2). Their size could be controlled by the addition of low concentrations of sodium chloride between 0.5 and 2 mM. Protein particles could be redissolved in aqueous solutions and redissolved antibodies retained their binding activity as evaluated in cell binding assays and exemplified for trastuzumab in an ELISA.","author":"Levi Collin Nelemans","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"704463b9d3ed168f7b26d73f125d7fb8df703e494f2f41cfb40cd121393423fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
