{"title":"Impact of Temperature on Seebeck Coefficient of Nodal Line Semimetal in Molecular Conductor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0543/v1","date":1718004490000,"content":"We examine the impact of temperature (T) on the Seebeck coefficient S, i.e., the T dependence of S for the single-component molecular conductor Pd(dddt)_2] (dddt = 5,6-dihydro-1,4-dithiin-2,3-dithiolate) with a half-filled band, where the coefficient is obtained from a ratio of the thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity. The conductor exhibits Dirac electrons with a nodal line, which shows the energy variation around the chemical potential and the density of states (DOS) with a minimum. Using a three-dimensional tight-binding (TB) model in the presence of both impurity and electron--phonon (e--p) scatterings, we study the Seebeck coefficient S_y for the molecular stacking and the most conducting direction. The impact of T on S_y exhibits a sign change, where S_y &gt; 0 with a maximum at high temperatures and S_y &lt; 0 with a minimum at low temperatures. The T dependence of S_y suggests that the contribution from the conduction (valence) band is dominant at low (high) temperatures.The result is examined using a spectral conductivity \\sigma_y(\\epsilon,T) as a function of the energy $\\epsilon$ close to the chemical potential \\mu. Further, the Seebeck coefficients for perpendicular directions (x and z) are examined, to show both S_x and S_z being positive and no sign change in contrast to S_y.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc379233993540ba5d6341d42425749bd265f83bef3d6453f82b5d23db7a3062","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
