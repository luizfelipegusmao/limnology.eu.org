{"title":"Healing Potential of the Marine Polysaccharides Carrageenan and Ulvan on Second Degree Burns","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1421/v1","date":1711353973000,"content":"The bioactive marine sulfated polysaccharides ulvan and carrageenan, formulated in gels at 1.5, 5.0 and 10% w/w concentrations, were evaluated for their wound healing potential on second-degree burn wounds. The polysaccharide-based gels were administered on the burn-inflamed skin of hairless female SKH-hr2 mice, and the therapeutic effect of the various treatments was assessed based on histopathological analysis, the clinical condition of mice, photo-documentation, evaluation of biophysical skin parameters, and FT-IR spectroscopy.Clinical and histopathological assessment, as well as the reduction rate of the burn wound area, indicated that the 10% w/w carrageenan gel significantly enhanced wound healing, especially at the early stages of the healing process, recovering both the Î±-helix of collagen and the glycosaminoglycans configuration as evidenced by the FT-IR absorption bandsof skin in vivo and ex vivo. At later stages, the healing effect of the 5% w/w ulvan gel was also notably significant, indicating that carrageenan and ulvan wound dressing gels could potentially contribute to the efficient wound healing of burn wounds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2777c99c77a1eb29c5b7d542f83bde73466e7e98351665faa174c4e6320f57ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
