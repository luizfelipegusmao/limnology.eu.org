{"title":"Green Leaf Volatiles: A New Player in the Protection Against Abiotic Stresses?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1356/v1","date":1716275364000,"content":"To date the role of green leaf volatiles has been mainly constrained to their role in protecting plants against pests and pathogens. However, increasing evidence suggests that among the stresses that can significantly harms plants, GLV can also provide significant protection against an array of those including heat, cold, drought, light, and salinity. But while the molecular basis for this protection is still largely unknown, it seems obvious that a common theme in the way GLV work is that most if not all of these stresses are associated with physical damage to the plants, which in turn is the major event responsible for the production of GLV. Here, I summarize the current state of knowledge on GLV and abiotic stresses and provide a model that explains the multifunctionality of these compounds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b963c14f3e1bdb6b0c569309999d9bae5fec09028a3bb79f74ba524b7cc8b2b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
