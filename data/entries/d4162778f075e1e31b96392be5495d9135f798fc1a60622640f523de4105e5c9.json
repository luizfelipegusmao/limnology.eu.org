{"title":"Detection of High-Risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Their Genotypes in Lung Cancer: Insights from the Mediterranean Region of Turkey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1867/v1","date":1711959377000,"content":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide therefore studies about the etiological factors and carcinogenesis are important.The aim of the study is to detect the presence and types of Human papilloma virus (HPV) in lung cancer and non-tumoral lung and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prevalance in lung cancer with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method.Fifty patients who were histopathologically diagnosed lung cancer and 7 patients with non-neoplastic lung disease were enrolled in the study. HPV positivity was detected in 75.4% of the patients. The rate of high-risk HPV positivity was 100% in adenocarcinomas, 64.5% in squamous cell carcinomas, and 57% in non-neoplastic lung. HPV 51 was the most frequent type followed by HPV 16 (43.9%). There was no statistically significant relationship between HPV infection and age, gender and smoking history and EGFR mutation. The prevalence of HPV positivity is variable in lung cancer in different studies and this may be due to many factors including HPV detection methods, number of patients, geographic regions. New studies about the role of HPV infection need to be performed in order to obtain information about the use of prophylactic and theurepatic agents in lung cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4162778f075e1e31b96392be5495d9135f798fc1a60622640f523de4105e5c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
