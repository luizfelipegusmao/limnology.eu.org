A Prospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1868/v1","date":1724679116000,"content":"Background: Despite the tremendous effort in hamstring injury prevention, injury rates in soccer remain elevated. Hypothesis:  Hamstring and hip/pelvic isometric strength imbalances may increase the likelihood of hamstring strain injury (HSI) occurrence amongst soccer players.Study design: Case-control study.Methods: In 120 male soccer players (mean age: 20.0 +/- 6.96 years) pre-season maximum isometric strength of the hip adductors, abductors, flexors, and knee flexors were measured, and strength ratios were calculated. Previous injury and anthropometric data were registered. Injury data were collected following the FIFA/UEFA consensus. A multivariate and Machine learning-based Logistic Regression model was employed to estimate the likelihood of players sustaining a hamstring injury.Results: 21 players sustained 32 hamstring injuries. Players with higher abduction strength in the dominant leg had an 18.5% lower risk of sustaining a hamstring injury (OR = 0.818, CI 95% = [(0.695-0.964]). No other significant contributor variables were found to be significant predictors of hamstring injury in the player group (p&gt; 0.05).Conclusion: Isometric strength of the abductor muscles in the dominant limb had a significant association with hamstring injury.Clinical relevance: Our findings indicate the utilization of hip strength measurements as an integral component of the pre-season screening assessment, thereby affirming prior research on the correlation between lumbo-pelvic stability and incidence of hamstring injuries. Consequently, clinicians should contemplate incorporating hip strengthening exercises into regular training sessions, rehabilitation programs, and injury prevention protocols especially indicated when lower hip strength levels are observed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4b0e067fd0177ce03ceb1c26d06112fd4d9c4f5acdba72ca04affd12182aaa4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
