{"title":"45 Doing more with less, sustainable pork and crop production","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/264/7757186?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The many definitions of “sustainability”, as it relates to agriculture, continue to be disputed. The three pillars to maintain an ecological earthly balance are environmental, economic, and social. The global mission for most companies and industries is to establish a culture of sustainability. Sustainable agriculture is at the forefront, to be defined and to be determined; what is sustainable agriculture. Since 2016, New Fashion Pork (NFP), Jackson MN, has been a leader in pursuing innovative technologies and proven practices creating our sustainable nutrient management and crop production systems. This presentation will provide an overview of the efforts of NFP to strategically use current and advanced technologies within our nutrient management and farming practices, to maintain a profitable operation while using and protecting our natural resources and our environment. Not only the pork industry but our entire agricultural system will be facing many difficult challenges as the global entities scrutinize all agricultural practices. Hopefully, the participants will leave with the understanding that agriculture is and can be a significant part of the sustainability solution, providing food for the world by “doing more with less.”</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"2dafa7ee3f071d611b2efadaedf25773fddc59a514502d15016b06ac1f74742a","category":"Environment"}
