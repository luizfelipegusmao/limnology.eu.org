{"title":"Study on the Stock Enhancement Capacity of Main Target Species in the Waters of Zhongjieshan Islands","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0362/v1","date":1720077130000,"content":"The marine region of the Zhongjieshan Islands is an essential component and location for enhancement and release in Zhoushan Fishing Ground. The scientific assessment of the target species' ecological carrying capacity serves as the foundation for augmentation and release efforts. Based on data from the 2021-2022 survey of biological resources in the waters of Zhongjieshan islands, the Ecopath model was built to analyze the trophic structure, energy flow, and overall characteristics of the ecosystem, as well as the ecological carrying capacity of the main enhancement and releasing species, Larimichthys crocea and Sepiella maindroni. The ecosystem's functional groups had trophic levels ranging from 1 to 3.48, with an average energy transfer efficiency of 8.11% and total flow of 2125.905 t·km-2. The ratio of total primary output to total respiration is 1.713. Zhongjieshan Islands' ecosystem was currently at an embryonic stage. The ecological carrying capacity of Larimichthys crocea and Sepiella maindroni was calculated to be 0.2325 t·km-2 and 0.1617 t·km-2, separately or individually. Larimichthys crocea and Sepiella maindroni showed enormous potential for development and release. The findings offered essential data for ecological studies on the waters of Zhongjieshan Islands, as well as a reference for enhancement and release efforts in this area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da87a01e7fc16ffc4c90ef1004f2c875a50b7cf1d816948d66113c5b6fc0564d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
