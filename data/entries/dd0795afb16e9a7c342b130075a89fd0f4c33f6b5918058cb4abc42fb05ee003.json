Additionally, the impact of the condition media from LGG (LCM) was tested in macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells), microglia (BV-2 cells), and hippocampal cells (HT-22 cells).</p> Result <p>Fecal microbiome analysis demonstrated D-gal-induced dysbiosis (reduced Firmicutes and Desulfobacterota with increased Bacteroidota and Verrucomicrobiota), which LGG partially neutralized the dysbiosis. D-gal also worsens cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis severity when compared with PBS-CLP mice, as indicated by serum creatinine (Scr) and alanine transaminase (ALT), but not mortality, neurological characteristics (SHIRPA score), and serum cytokines (TNF-Î± and IL-6). Additionally, D-gal-induced aging was supported by fibrosis in the liver, kidney, and lung; however, CLP sepsis did not worsen fibrosis. Interestingly, LGG attenuated all parameters (mortality, Scr, ALT, SHIRPA, and cytokines) in non-aging sepsis (PBS-CLP) while improving all these parameters, except for mortality and serum IL-6, in aging sepsis (D-gal CLP). For the in vitro test using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, LCM attenuated inflammation in some parameters on RAW264.7 cells but not BV-2 and HT-22 cells, implying a direct anti-inflammatory effect of LGG on macrophages, but not in cells from the brain.</p> Conclusion <p>D-gal induced fecal dysbiosis and worsened sepsis severity as determined by Scr and ALT, and LGG could alleviate most of the selected parameters of sepsis, including SAE. However, the impact of LGG on SAE was not a direct delivery of beneficial molecules from the gut to the brain but partly due to the attenuation of systemic inflammation through the modulation of macrophages.</p>","author":"Chalisa Pinitchun","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dd0795afb16e9a7c342b130075a89fd0f4c33f6b5918058cb4abc42fb05ee003","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
