{"title":"Advances in Environmental Biotechnology with CRISPR/Cas9: Bibliometric Review and Cutting-Edge Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0100/v1","date":1714644868000,"content":"CRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as the predominant method for genome editing due to its cost-effectiveness and broad applicability, playing a crucial role in advancing sustainable practices across various sectors. This systematic review leverages the PRISMA methodology to explore CRISPR/Cas9's impact on environmental protection, thereby supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Analyzing data from the Web of Science, the review found significant growth in related publications, with a 30% increase since 2014, predominantly from the US, China, Germany, and the UK. The study categorizes the scientific developments into three trends: advancements in agriculture, gene editing techniques, and biofuel production. Key discussions include the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in developing fourth-generation biofuels and environmental biosensors, as well as its applications in enhancing genetic resilience and controlling invasive species. These innovations highlight CRISPR/Cas9's potential in promoting sustainable resource management and energy generation, marking a pivotal contribution to ecological conservation and sustainability efforts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"14084fe668762399f260b40dbdb7e865508d0a19cba90261b538679fdd854852","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
