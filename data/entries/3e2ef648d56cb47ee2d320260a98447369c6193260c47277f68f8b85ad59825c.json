{"title":"PSII-18 Prematurity alters nutrient signaling and protein synthesis in skeletal muscle of neonatal piglets","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/694/7757572?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Extrauterine growth restriction is common in infants born preterm, and negatively affects lean mass accretion and health. Prematurity has been shown to inhibit the feeding-induced stimulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle. We hypothesized that nutrient signaling, activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), and protein synthesis in the muscle are limited in preterm infants which negatively impacts muscle growth. The objective of this study was to examine how prematurity influences the mechanisms involved in insulin- and amino acid-induced signaling and protein synthesis in skeletal muscle of piglets delivered either 9 d preterm (104 d, n = 25) or at term (112 d, n = 26) by cesarean section. After resuscitation, they were surgically implanted with jugular vein and carotid artery catheters and placed in individual incubators. They were randomly allotted to one of three treatments within each preterm and term birth groups: euaminoacidemic-euglycemic (FAST), hyperinsulinemic-euaminoacidemic-euglycemic (INS), or euinsulinemic-hyperaminoacidemic-euglycemic (AA) clamps on 4 d after birth. After the clamp procedure, the piglets were euthanized to collect longissimus dorsi muscle for estimating in vivo fractional protein synthesis rates and the abundance and activation of components related to insulin and amino acid signaling. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. The leucine sensor, Sestrin1 bound to GATOR2 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) was reduced in response to AA whereas the abundance of the mTOR-RagA and mTOR-RagC complexes increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). The phosphorylation of Akt was increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) in response to INS and the phosphorylation of mTORC1 and protein synthesis increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) in response to both AA and INS. Prematurity did not affect the protein abundances of the AA transporters for glutamine (SLC38A2), leucine (SLC7A5), and arginine (SLC38A9). However, prematurity reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) the abundances of the leucine sensors SAR1B, the Sestrin1-GATOR complex, the AA sensor, RAB1A, and the threonine sensor, TARS2 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). The abundances of the glutamine sensor, ARF1, the arginine sensor, CASTOR, and the methionine-SAMTOR GATOR complex were similar. Prematurity reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) the abundance of the mTOR-RagA and mTOR-RagC complexes, the phosphorylation of mTORC1 and muscle protein synthesis (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, prematurity negatively affects protein synthesis in skeletal muscle of neonatal preterm piglets by blunting anabolic pathways responsible for nutrient-sensing and mTORC1 activation. The reduced anabolic response likely contributes to reduced lean growth and extrauterine growth restriction following preterm birth.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"3e2ef648d56cb47ee2d320260a98447369c6193260c47277f68f8b85ad59825c","category":"Environment"}
