{"title":"Nanocellulose-Based Materials for Water Pollutants Removal: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2473/v1","date":1722388041000,"content":"Cellulose in the nano regime, defined as nanocellulose, has been intensively used for water treatment. Nanocellulose can be produced in various forms including colloidal, water-re-dispersible powders, films, membranes, nano papers, hydrogels/aerogels, and three-dimensional (3D) objects. They were reported for the removal of water contaminants e.g., heavy metals, dyes, drugs, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, microbial cells, and other pollutants from water systems. This review summarized the recent technologies for water treatment using nanocellulose-based materials. A scientometric analysis of the topic was also included. Cellulose-based materials enable the removal of water contaminants, and salts offer advanced technologies for water desalination. They are widely used as substrates, adsorbents, and catalysts. They were applied for pollutant removal via several methods such as adsorption, filtration, disinfection, coagulation/flocculation, chemical precipitation, sedimentation, Reverse Osmosis (RO),  ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), electrofiltration (Electrodialysis), ion-exchange,  chelation,  catalysis, and photocatalysis. Processing cellulose into commercial products enables the wide use of nanocellulose-based materials as adsorbents and catalysts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f637b19ab940c3ff549b46b8f8c10226b5c70c6de4779c649bb9c24fa2c4d2d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
