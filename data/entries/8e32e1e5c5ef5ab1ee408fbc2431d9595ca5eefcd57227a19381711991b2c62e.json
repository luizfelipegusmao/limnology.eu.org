Morhason-Bello, Adesina Oladokun</p>\r\n\r\nHuman papillomavirus infection (HPV) is a significant global public health concern, known to be a leading cause of cancer related death among women in sub-Saharan Africa. This study assessed knowledge of HPV infection, transmission, prevention, and HPV vaccine uptake among tertiary institution students in Plateau State, Nigeria. A cross-sectional study was conducted among students from two tertiary institutions in Plateau State, Nigeria. Using a structured pretested questionnaire, data were collected from participants selected by two-stage sampling technique. Participants’ responses were analysed to assess their knowledge regarding HPV transmission, prevention, and vaccination. A composite score was obtained for the general HPV knowledge. A score of more than 70.0% indicated good knowledge. The distribution of the variables was examined using frequency distribution and descriptive statistics. The chi-square test was performed for bivariate analysis. Logistics regression was performed to examine the odds of having good HPV knowledge among the students. Level of significant was set at 95%. Of the 425 participants, 302 (71.1%) were female and 123 (28.9%) were male, with a mean age of 23 ± 2.8 years. There was low awareness of HPV among participants, with higher awareness among the females 66 (23.1%) than the males 26 (22.2%) (p = .853). Both female 77 (26.1%) and male participants 31 (26.72%) had low awareness of HPV vaccination. Among all participants, only 19 (5%) demonstrated good knowledge of HPV. Participants who were employed significantly had good knowledge of HPV compared to those who were unemployed. There was inadequate general knowledge of HPV and its vaccination among tertiary institution students in Plateau State, Nigeria. The students’ employment status was associated with their knowledge of HPV. Targeted educational programs focusing on diverse educational levels and institution types are recommended to enhance HPV knowledge and promote vaccine uptake.","author":"Juliana Rume","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"8e32e1e5c5ef5ab1ee408fbc2431d9595ca5eefcd57227a19381711991b2c62e","category":"Environment"}
