{"title":"Weight-Bearing CT for Diseases around the Ankle Joint","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1005/v2","date":1721011959000,"content":"Weight-bearing computed tomography (WBCT) enables acquisition of three dimensional bony structure images in a physiological weight-bearing position, which is fundamental in under-standing the pathologic lesions and deformities of the ankle joint. Over the past decade, re-searchers focused on validating and developing WBCT measurements, which has significantly enhanced our knowledge of common foot and ankle disease. Consequently, understanding the application of WBCT in clinical practice is becoming more important to produce improved out-comes in the treatment of disease around the ankle joint. This review will describe an overview of what is currently being evaluated in the foot and ankle surgery using WBCT and where the course of research will be heading in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd2aa65364ac9159b61365c8955feb7b9e4fe78a9dd668ef6b7d35a03491cc20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
