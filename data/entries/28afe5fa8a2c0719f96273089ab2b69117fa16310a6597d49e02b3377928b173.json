{"title":"A Lake at the Mt. Fuji (Lake Motosu) Recording Prolonged Negative Arctic Oscillation as Reduction of Aeolian Dust Due To Westerly Pathways During the Holocene","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023PA004805?af=R","date":1726059603000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>East Asia is a major source of dust accounting for 20% of the global dust emission. Work on reconstructing past changes in dust transport in East Asia is complicated by difficulties in distinguishing local sedimentation from aerial material and lack of suitable material for age determination. Here, we address these issues and present a new dust proxy record from Lake Motosu, located on the Pacific side of Japan. The record is anchored by a high-quality tephra and radiocarbon chronology. Because Lake Motosu is situated in a quartz-free basaltic volcanic province, all quartz deposited in the lake is likely to be aerially sourced, and variations in quartz content should reflect past changes in dust transport. Our new record detects a low dust deposition event from 3.0 to 2.0 ka. This event corresponds to elevated sea surface temperature in the Sea of Japan and climate conditions similar to a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation, indicating an association with the weakened Westerlies and with less frequent dust storms in the source region. The increase in spatial resolution of past dust transport reconstructions will further improve our understanding of the mechanism related to dust emission from East Asia.</p>","author":"Karin Nemoto, \nYusuke Yokoyama, \nStephen P.
