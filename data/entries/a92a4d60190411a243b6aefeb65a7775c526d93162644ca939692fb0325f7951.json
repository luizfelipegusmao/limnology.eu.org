{"title":"Rotating Photodisc Reactor (RPR) Used in The Photodegradation of Pyridine Using Zinc Oxide as a Catalyst Doped with Aluminum Nanoparticles Irradiated with Natural Light","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0598/v1","date":1728436561000,"content":"Pyridine was degraded in a rotating photodisc reactor (RPR) using zinc oxide (ZnO) doped with aluminum nanoparticles (ZnO-Al) as a catalyst and natural light lamps. The reactor disks, made of clay, have a surface area of 329.7209 mÂ². The reactor was operated as a semi-batch system, handling a volume of 14.8 L and a hydraulic residence time (HRT) of 72 hours at 54 rpm with a constant flow rate. The results indicated an average degradation of 50.6% after an HRT of 72 hours, with a maximum degradation of 62%. Characterization results confirmed the effectiveness of the doping process, showing an aluminum concentration of 4.11% by mass in the catalyst, as determined by X-ray techniques. Overall, the doping process proved effective for the zinc oxide catalyst, as evidenced by a reduction in the catalyst bandgap from 3.37 eV for undoped ZnO to 3.08 eV for the doped version, making it sufficiently active under natural light.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a92a4d60190411a243b6aefeb65a7775c526d93162644ca939692fb0325f7951","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
