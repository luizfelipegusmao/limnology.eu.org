{"title":"Effect of beef heifer development systems utilizing corn residue and late summer planted cover crops on growth, reproductive performance, and economics","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae111/7719266?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to evaluate growth and reproductive performance of heifers developed using 3 different winter systems in the midwestern U.S. Spring-born heifers (n = 1,156; 214 d of age; SD ± 17 d) were used in a 3-yr study to evaluate performance in winter development systems, which utilized cover crop (CC) and corn residue grazing. Heifers were assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: grazing corn residue with 0.77 kg/d dried distillers grains (CD) or 1.69 kg/d wheat midds (CW) supplementation followed by a grower ration in the drylot, or grazing late summer planted oat-brassica CC followed by corn residue grazing with 0.35 kg/d dried distillers grains supplementation (CC). Supplementation during the corn residue phase was targeted to result in a common body weight (BW) (276 kg; ~45% of mature BW) by the end of the winter development period. Grazing of corn residue (CD and CW) and CC began in early November. After 63 d, heifers assigned to CC were moved to corn residue; on day 77 heifers assigned to CD and CW began receiving a grower ration in the drylot. In mid-February (day 98), heifers were comingled and managed in a single group. Breeding season began in June and lasted for 29 d. The ADG of heifers assigned to CC when grazing CC (days 1 to 63) was greater (0.76 kg/d; <span>P </span>&lt; 0.01) than those assigned to CD or CW (0.58 kg/d and 0.49 kg/d, respectively). Gain during the last 35 d of the winter period for heifers assigned to CC (0.36 kg/d) was less (<span>P </span>&lt; 0.01) than those assigned to CW (0.49 kg/d) but not different from CD heifers (0.41 kg/d). Overall (days 1 to 98), winter ADG was greater (<span>P </span>&lt; 0.05) for heifers assigned to CC (0.62 kg/d) than CD (0.53 kg/d) or CW (0.50 kg/d), which did not differ (<span>P</span> = 0.42). Percent of mature BW in May (27 d pre-breeding) was greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) for heifers assigned to CC (52%) than for those on CD and CW (50%), which did not differ (<span>P</span> = 0.64). Pregnancy rates were affected by treatment (<span>P </span>&lt; 0.03), with heifers assigned to CC (76%) being greater than CW (64%) and CD heifers being intermediate (70%). When accounting for the differences in cost and the value of open and bred heifers, the economic return tended to differ (<span>P = </span>0.07) among treatments, with CC and CW not differing (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.20) from CD but return for CC being $73 greater than CW (<span>P</span> = 0.02). Utilizing oat-brassica CCs early in the winter followed by a slower rate of gain while grazing corn residue with distillers supplementation appears to be as effective for developing beef heifers in the midwestern U.S. as supplementing distillers grains.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"3192ce2567db83319538c610957672969fc9c7418ee8242d3b20d9de28eefe3f","category":"Environment"}
