{"title":"Reliability-based Design Optimization for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells: Tackling Dimensional Uncertainties in Manufacturing and Their Effects on Costs of Cathode Gas Diffusion Layer and Bipolar Plates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1949/v1","date":1724751033000,"content":"Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) have emerged as a pivotal technology in the automotive industry, significantly contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The high material costs of the gas diffusion layer(GDL) and bipolar plate(BP) creates a barrier for large scale commercial application. This study aims towards addressing this challenge by optimizing the material and design of the cathode, GDL and BP. While Deterministic design optimization(DDO) methods have been extensively studied, they often fall short when manufacturing uncertainties are introduced. This issue is addressed by introducing Reliability based design optimization(RBDO) to optimize four key PEMFC design variables i.e., Î´_gdl, d_ch, w_ch, and w_land. The objective is to maximize cell voltage(V_cell) considering material cost of cathode gas diffusion layer(Cost_cGDL), and cathode bipolar plate(Cost_cBP) as reliability constraints. Results of the DDO show an increment in V_cell of 31mV, with reliability of around 50% for Cost_cGDL and Cost_cBP. In contrast RBDO method provides a reliability of 95% for both Cost_cGDL and Cost_cBP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5950a9fa94ef51673bb18062cc7342f6107fb06fd3f09158e3a0246f9109db02","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
