{"title":"A Comprehensive Microstructure-Aware Electromigration Modelling Framework; Investigation of the Impact of Trench Dimensions in Damascene Copper Interconnects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0657/v1","date":1728532458000,"content":"This paper presents a comprehensive simulation framework for the investigation of electromigration (EM) in nano-interconnects, with a primary focus on unravelling the influential role of microstructure. To this end, a novel approach to generate conductor metalâ€™s microstructures is presented, whereby a predefined statistical distribution of grain sizes obtained from experimental texture analyses can be incorporated into the developed EM modelling framework. The framework considers the impact of diffusion heterogeneity through the metal texture and interfaces. As such, the intricate interplay between microstructural/interfacial properties, and the resulting atomic flux and stress distribution within nanointerconnects could be investigated. Additionally, the study advances beyond the state of the art by comprehensively simulating all stages of electromigration, including stress evolution, void nucleation, and void dynamics while considering the impact of microstructure. Specifically, the model was employed to study the impact of trench dimensions on dual damascene copper texture and its subsequent impact on electromigration aging, where the model findings were corroborated by comparing to available experimental findings. A nearly linear augmentation in normalized lifetime was detected for aspect ratios equal to or greater than 1. However, a saturation is detected for wider lines with no effective enhancement in lifetime. An aspect ratio of 1 seems to maximize EM lifetime for each cross-sectional area by fostering a bamboo-like structure, where about 2-fold of increase is estimated when going from aspect ratio 2 to 1.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f5034998ce89e0e8173879c5211edb8a5d8fa219800d862192565d87972483b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
