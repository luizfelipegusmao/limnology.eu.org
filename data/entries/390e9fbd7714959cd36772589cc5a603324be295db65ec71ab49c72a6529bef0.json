{"title":"Evaluating the Technical and Economic Impact of 4.0 Technologies in Photovoltaic Installations: A Case Study in the Residential and Industrial Sectors of Murcia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1543/v1","date":1721377392000,"content":"The integration of Industry 4.0 technologies in photovoltaic (PV) installations offers significant potential to enhance efficiency, reliability, and economic viability. This study evaluates the technical and economic impacts of implementing the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and advanced data analytics in PV systems within the residential and industrial sectors in the Region of Murcia. Real-time monitoring technologies based on IoT sensors were analyzed to collect data on the operational performance of pilot PV installations. Advanced data analysis techniques, including machine learning, were analyzed to process the collected data, enabling predictive maintenance, performance optimization, and future production estimation. The study also explored the use of drones and computer vision for automated inspection of solar panels, identifying issues such as hotspots and dirt accumulation. The results demonstrate significant improvements in energy efficiency, system availability, and reduction of failures and downtime. Economic analyses indicate cost savings in operation and maintenance and increased overall system reliability. This research identifies key barriers and opportunities for adopting 4.0 technologies in the PV sector and proposes strategies to overcome challenges and leverage benefits. The findings contribute to the advancement of knowledge and the promotion of sustainable and efficient energy systems in the solar industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"390e9fbd7714959cd36772589cc5a603324be295db65ec71ab49c72a6529bef0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
