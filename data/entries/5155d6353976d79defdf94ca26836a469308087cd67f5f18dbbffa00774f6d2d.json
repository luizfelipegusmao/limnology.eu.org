Recently, immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has taken center stage in the currently ongoing revolution that is changing standard-of-care treatment for several malignancies, including MPM. As multiple arguments and accumulating lines of evidence are in support of the existence of a therapeutic synergism between chemotherapy and immunotherapy, as well as between different classes of immunotherapeutics, we designed a multicenter, single-arm, phase I/II trial in which both programmed-death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibition and dendritic cell (DC) vaccination are integrated in the first-line conventional platinum/pemetrexed-based treatment scheme for epithelioid MPM patients (Immuno-MESODEC, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05765084). Fifteen treatment-naïve patients with unresectable epithelioid subtype MPM will be treated with four 3-weekly (±3 days) chemo-immunotherapy cycles. Standard-of-care chemotherapy consisting of cisplatinum (75mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and pemetrexed (500mg/m<sup>2</sup>) will be supplemented with the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab (1200 mg) and autologous <i>Wilms’ tumor 1</i> mRNA-electroporated dendritic cell (WT1/DC) vaccination (8–10 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/vaccination). Additional atezolizumab (1680 mg) doses and/or WT1/DC vaccinations (8–10 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/vaccination) can be administered optionally following completion of the chemo-immunotherapy scheme. Follow-up of patients will last for up to 90 days after final atezolizumab administration and/or WT1/DC vaccination or 24 months after diagnosis, whichever occurs later. The trial’s primary endpoints are safety and feasibility, secondary endpoints are clinical efficacy and immunogenicity. This phase I/II trial will evaluate whether addition of atezolizumab and WT1/DC vaccination to frontline standard-of-care chemotherapy for the treatment of epithelioid MPM is feasible and safe. If so, this novel combination strategy should be further investigated as a promising advanced treatment option for this hard-to-treat cancer.","author":"Jolien Van den Bossche","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5155d6353976d79defdf94ca26836a469308087cd67f5f18dbbffa00774f6d2d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
