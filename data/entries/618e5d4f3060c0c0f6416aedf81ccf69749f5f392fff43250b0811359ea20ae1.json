{"title":"Unlocking epitope similarity: A comparative analysis of the American manatee (<i>Trichechus manatus</i>) IgA and human IgA through an immuno-informatics approach","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308396","date":1726495200000,"content":"<p>by Mariapaula Díaz-Yayguaje, Susana Caballero-Gaitan, Augusto Valderrama-Aguirre</p>\r\n\r\nThe American manatee (Trichechus manatus), experiencing population declines due to various threats, is the focus of conservation efforts that include the capture, rehabilitation, and release of orphaned calves when their mothers are unable to care for them. These efforts are compromised by the use of commercially available milk substitutes that lack essential components found in natural manatee breast milk, particularly immunoglobulin A (IgA). IgA plays a crucial role in nurturing the immune mucosal system and fostering a healthy microbiota. However, research on IgA in non-maternally fed manatees is limited due to the lack of species-specific reagents. To address this gap, our study employs immuno-informatics analysis to compare IgA sequences from manatees with those from other species, aiming to explore epitope similarity and sharing. We compared the protein sequence of manatee IgA with available IgA sequences, assessing similarity at the sequence, 3D structures, and epitope levels. Our findings reveal that human IgA exhibits the highest similarity in terms of sequence and 3D structure. Additionally, epitope analysis shows high conservation, identity, and similarity of predicted epitopes compared to human IgA. Future studies should focus on functional analysis using human IgA polyclonal reagents to detect manatee IgA in breast milk. Our findings highlight the potential of comparative analysis in advancing the understanding of immunology in non-human animals and overcoming challenges associated with the scarcity of species-specific reagents.","author":"Mariapaula Díaz-Yayguaje","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"618e5d4f3060c0c0f6416aedf81ccf69749f5f392fff43250b0811359ea20ae1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
