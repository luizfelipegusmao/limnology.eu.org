{"title":"Ovarian Mesonephric-Like Adenocarcinoma: Its Prevalence and a Literature Review on Therapeutic Targets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0944/v1","date":1723612325000,"content":"Background: Ovarian mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma (MLA) is a newly described histological type known for its aggressive behavior. This study aims to determine the frequency of ovarian MLA, review existing literature, and elucidate its clinicopathological characteristics, including potential therapeutic targets. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the pathological diagnoses of 516 primary ovarian cancer surgical cases at our institution from 2010 to 2023. MLAs exhibiting typical morphological and immunohistochemical features were included. The frequency and clinicopathological characteristics of these cases were summarized. Additionally, we conducted a literature search using PubMed to collect and summarize previously reported cases of ovarian MLA. Results: Among the 516 primary ovarian cancer cases, we identified 3 cases (0.6%) of MLA. The patients were 52-76 years old, and the initial FIGO stages were IC1 (2 cases) and IIIB (1 case). All cases exhibited HRP, pMMR, PD-L1 negativity (CPS&amp;lt;1), and HER2-low expression. Two cases experienced metastatic recurrence. A literature review identified 97 cases of MLA. MLA frequently exhibited KRAS mutations (90%, 38/42), with a recurrence rate of 39% (26/67). Conclusion: MLA accounted for 0.6% of malignant ovarian tumors at our institution, all of which were advanced or recurrent cases. These cases showed HRP, pMMR, and PD-L1 negativity, indicating a lack of current therapeutic targets. Literature also reports a high incidence of advanced and recurrent cases, highlighting the need for accurate diagnosis and the development of new treatments. The frequent KRAS mutations suggest a potential therapeutic target for recurrent or metastatic MLA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"697a2812560ce9de3502bcf391f2143c20bbe9167b1812b1bde9a0a4496cdb54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
