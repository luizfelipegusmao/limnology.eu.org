The aim of the research is to study electric vehicles, as well as hybrid cars as alternative fuels in Kazakhstan and in the world. A wide range of methodological tools was used to conduct the research, in particular, the method of analysis and generalization of information, comparative, as well as induction and deduction. In addition, the method of analysis of scientific literature was applied, which partially reveals the problematic issues of this topic. A review of the literature concluded that alternative and transitional fuels were the most popular among transport users in the city. The information analyzed from the literature also allows concluding that in recent years some studies have presented new scientific, technical and political strategies to improve the use of alternative and transitional fuel resources. The practical value of the research is the possibility to use its results to study and analyze information on electric and hybrid vehicles. The information provided in the study could form the basis for the study of alternative fuels for cars.</p>","author":"Zhanat Arystanov, \nBaglan Togizbayeva, \nAnuar Kenesbek, \nDulat Mambetov, \nAizhan Kinzhebayeva","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"9d5c7e226a3e479ab4ad890cd0a155f2182ee77c710219bc6c0f721bdd2f396e","category":"Environment"}
