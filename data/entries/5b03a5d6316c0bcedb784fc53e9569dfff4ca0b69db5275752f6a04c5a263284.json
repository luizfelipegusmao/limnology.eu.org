{"title":"A Framework for Iterative Phase Retrieval Technique Integration into Atmospheric Adaptive Optics. Part I: Wavefront Sensing in Strong Scintillations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2193/v1","date":1721996248000,"content":"The objective of this study, which is divided into two parts, is twofold: to address long standing challenges in the sensing of atmospheric turbulence-induced wavefront aberrations in strong scintillation conditions via comparative analysis of several basic scintillation resistant wavefront sensing (SR-WFS) architectures and iterative phase retrieval (IPR) techniques (Part I, this paper), and to develop a framework for the potential integration of SR-WFS techniques into practical closed-loop non-astronomical atmospheric adaptive optics (AO) systems (Part II). In this paper we consider basic SR-WFS mathematical models and phase retrieval algorithms, tradeoffs in sensor design and phase retrieval technique implementation, and methodologies for WFS parameter optimization and performance assessment. The analysis is based on wave-optics numerical simulations imitating realistic turbulence-induced phase aberrations and intensity scintillations, and optical field propagation inside SR-WFSs. Several potential issues important for practical implementation of SR-WFS and IPR techniques such as requirements for phase retrieval computational grid resolution, tolerance with respect to optical element misalignments, and the impact of camera noise and input light non-monochromaticity are also considered. Results demonstrate that major wavefront sensing requirements desirable for AO operation in strong intensity scintillations can potentially be achieved by transitioning to novel SR-WFS architectures based on iterative phase retrieval techniques.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b03a5d6316c0bcedb784fc53e9569dfff4ca0b69db5275752f6a04c5a263284","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
