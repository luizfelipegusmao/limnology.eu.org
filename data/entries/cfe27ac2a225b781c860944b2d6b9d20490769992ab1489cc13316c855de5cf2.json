{"title":"LEDT and Idebenone treatment modulate autophagy and improve regenerative capacity in the dystrophic muscle through an AMPK-pathway","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300006","date":1710770400000,"content":"<p>by Heloina Nathalliê Mariano da Silva, Evelyn Mendes Fernandes, Valéria Andrade Pereira, Daniela Sayuri Mizobuti, Caroline Covatti, Guilherme Luiz da Rocha, Elaine Minatel</p>\r\nPurpose <p>Considering the difficulties and challenges in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) treatment, such as the adverse effects of glucocorticoids, which are the main medical prescription used by dystrophic patients, new treatment concepts for dystrophic therapy are very necessary. Thus, in this study, we explore the effects of photobiomodulation (PBM; a non-invasive therapy) and Idebenone (IDE) treatment (a potent antioxidant), applied alone or in association, in dystrophic muscle cells and the quadriceps muscle, with special focus on autophagy and regenerative pathways.</p> Methods <p>For the <i>in vitro</i> studies, the dystrophic primary muscle cells received 0.5J LEDT and 0.06μM IDE; and for the <i>in vivo</i> studies, the dystrophic quadriceps muscle received 3J LEDT and the mdx mice were treated with 200mg/kg IDE.</p> Results <p>LEDT and IDE treatment modulate autophagy by increasing autophagy markers (SQSTM1/p62, Beclin and Parkin) and signaling pathways (AMPK and TGF-β). Concomitantly, the treatments prevented muscle degeneration by reducing the number of IgG-positive fibers and the fibers with a central nucleus; decreasing the fibrotic area; up-regulating the myogenin and MCH-slow levels; and down-regulating the MyoD and MHC-fast levels.</p> Conclusion <p>These results suggest that LEDT and IDE treatments enhance autophagy and prevented muscle degeneration in the dystrophic muscle of the experimental model. These findings illustrate the potential efficacy of LEDT and IDE treatment as an alternative therapy focused on muscle recovery in the dystrophic patient.</p>","author":"Heloina Nathalliê Mariano da Silva","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cfe27ac2a225b781c860944b2d6b9d20490769992ab1489cc13316c855de5cf2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
