In the case of FIB milling, the quality of the prepared samples depends on the interaction of the ions with the target substrate. Therefore, optimizing the milling parameters becomes crucial for smooth and consistent sample preparation. Either for volume imaging by SEM/FIB tomography, lamella preparation for high-resolution TEM imaging, or for nanoscale x-ray microscopy analysis, minimizing FIB-induced artifacts while maximizing data collection and sample preparation efficiency is essential. Therefore, optimizing the milling conditions becomes crucial for reliable sample preparation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c0dc78815a4a3527f4707dfe2ce22c89e96874e564be997018ce00474e64cf48","category":"Environment"}
