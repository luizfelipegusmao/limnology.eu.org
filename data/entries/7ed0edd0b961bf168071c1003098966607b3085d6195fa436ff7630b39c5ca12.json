{"title":"Soybean Productivity Is Increased with Protein Hydrolysate Seed and Foliar Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1387/v1","date":1718872743000,"content":"Protein hydrolysates are plant biostimulants containing amino acids, oligopeptides, and peptides in their composition. When supplied to plants, protein hydrolisates (PH) have been identified to improve nitrogen metabolism, enhance the activity of antioxidant enzymes, boost plant defence response to stresses, and positively impact the quantity and quality of products. Soybean is a crucial global commodity, with nitrogen being the primary nutrient for crop development as it directly affects productivity. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a HP-based biostimulant on the N metabolism in nodulated soybean plants and their productivity. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to test two modes of application of the 0.20% HP-based biostimulant. Soybean plants, growing in pots, were treated with HP 0.20% either via seed treatment or foliar application (at growth stages V3 and V5). Activities of enzymes and compounds related to N metabolism, gene expression, and productivity components were analysed. It was observed that the mode of application did not significantly influence the results. The application of HP increased the concentration of nitrate, amino acids, and ureides in soybean leaves. It also positively altered the expression of genes such as nitrate reductase, urease, and asparagine. Additionally, it enhanced productivity, resulting in plants with a greater number and weight of pods and grains. Therefore, it is possible to consider HP as a stimulator for increasing soybean productivity, even under non-stressing conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ed0edd0b961bf168071c1003098966607b3085d6195fa436ff7630b39c5ca12","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
