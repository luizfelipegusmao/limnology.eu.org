{"title":"Cortical parenchyma wall width regulates root metabolic cost and maize performance under suboptimal water availability","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/18/5750/7658190?rss=1","date":1714003200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We describe how increased root cortical parenchyma wall width (CPW) can improve tolerance to drought stress in maize by reducing the metabolic costs of soil exploration. Significant variation (1.0–5.0 µm) for CPW was observed in maize germplasm. The functional–structural model RootSlice predicts that increasing CPW from 2 µm to 4 µm is associated with a ~15% reduction in root cortical cytoplasmic volume, respiration rate, and nitrogen content. Analysis of genotypes with contrasting CPW grown with and without water stress in the field confirms that increased CPW is correlated with an ~32–42% decrease in root respiration. Under water stress in the field, increased CPW is correlated with 125% increased stomatal conductance, 325% increased leaf CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate, 73–78% increased shoot biomass, and 92–108% increased yield. CPW was correlated with leaf mesophyll midrib parenchyma wall width, indicating pleiotropy. Genome-wide association study analysis identified candidate genes underlying CPW. OpenSimRoot modeling predicts that a reduction in root respiration due to increased CPW would also benefit maize growth under suboptimal nitrogen, which requires empirical testing. We propose CPW as a new phene that has utility under edaphic stress meriting further investigation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"93d3364d2c76b9416a8b7ec66e13cca936e850a25f05be0bf1e83c2ae60a633d","category":"Environment"}
