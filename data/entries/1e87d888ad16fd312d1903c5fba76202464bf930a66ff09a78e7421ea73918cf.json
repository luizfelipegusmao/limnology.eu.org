{"title":"Novel NH4V4O10-Redox Graphene Oxide Cathodes for Zinc-Ion Batteries: Theoretical Predictions and Experimental Validation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0122/v1","date":1714636957000,"content":"This investigation explores the potential of enhancing aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) through the introduction of a novel cathode material, NH4V4O10 (NVO), combined with redox graphene oxide (rGO). Utilizing Density Functional Theory (DFT), it was hypothesized that the incorporation of rGO would increase the interlayer spacing of NVO and diminish the charge transfer interactions, thus promoting enhanced diffusion of Zn2+ ions. These theoretical predictions were substantiated by experimental data acquired from hydrothermal synthesis, which indicated a marked increase in interlayer spacing. Significantly, the NVO-rGO composite exhibits remarkable cyclic durability, maintaining 94.54% of its initial specific capacity of 506.9 mAh g−1 after 600 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. The electrochemical performance of NVO-rGO not only surpasses that of pristine NVO but also outperforms the majority of existing vanadium oxide cathode materials reported in the literature. This study underscores the effective integration of theoretical insights and experimental validation, contributing to the advancement of high-performance energy storage technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e87d888ad16fd312d1903c5fba76202464bf930a66ff09a78e7421ea73918cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
