{"title":"Analysis of Adverse Drug Reactions with Oxaliplatin-Based Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1758/v1","date":1721726724000,"content":"Objectives: To analyze the clinical characteristics and factors associated with adverse drug reactions (ADR) in liver cancer patients receiving oxaliplatin‐based hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 137 patients with liver cancer who received oxaliplatin‐based HAIC. Changes in baseline characteristics, inflammatory factors, and other laboratory indicators in the no‐ADR and ADR groups were analyzed. Results: The incidence of serious ADR (CTCAE  ≥ 3) was 21.9% (30/137). There was no significant difference in the cumulative dose of oxaliplatin between the two groups [157.3 (80.3, 322.4) vs. 206.6 (139.1, 324.2), P=0.161]. The increase in NEUT and IL‐6 was greater in the group treated with ADR than in the group not treated with ADR. Changes in NEUT [4.1 (1.5, 6.2) vs. 2.5 (0.5, 4.9), P=0.045] and changes in NEUTIL‐6 [4.2 (‐0.2, 22.9) vs. 0.8 (‐3.9, 7.7), P=0.026]. TBIL, ALT, AST, ALP, WBC, NEUT, PCT, CRP, TNF, IL‐2R, IL‐6, and IL‐10 were significantly higher after treatment than before in the ADR group (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, ALB and AFP were decreased. Conclusions: The severe ADR (CTCAE ≥ 3) associated with oxaliplatin‐based HAIC may be closely related to increased inflammatory factors such as NEUT and IL‐6. We should be vigilant for allergic reactions to oxaliplatin and increase monitoring during treatment","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73340260686890464c5dbe881d5dde297b9565606394d08873e29a38e30645f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
