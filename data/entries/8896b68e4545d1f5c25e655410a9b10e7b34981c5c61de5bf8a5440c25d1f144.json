Eirenid hydroids living on the soft tissue of bivalves\" />\n<p>Infographic on the life history of Eirenid hydroids (<i>Eutima</i> and <i>Eugymnanthea</i> spp.) living on soft body parts of bivalves (drawings not to scale). A planula (1)—the infecting stage—reaches the bivalve's mantle cavity likely captured by the bivalve's inhalant current. After settling on soft parts of the bivalve, the planula becomes a polyp (2) which multiplies by budding inside the host (red arrow). In a determined period of the life cycle, the polyps produce a planktonic stage by budding (3), that is, a long-lived medusa in <i>Eutima</i>, and an eumedusoid with a shorter life span in <i>Eugymnanthea</i>. The planktonic stage generally detaches from the polyp and swims outside the bivalve (4). After the medusa/eumedusoid spawning, sexual reproduction occurs (5), and a new planula will develop from the fertilized egg (1). The different anatomy of the free-living stages (medusa and eumedusoid) in the two genera suggests a higher dispersal potential of the medusae of <i>Eutima</i> spp. while, medusoids of <i>Eugymnanthea</i>, with a vestigial (or absent) manubrium lacking tentacles are unable to capture prey and can only survive a few days. Parameters influencing the spread of the association were also shown (low values in pale yellow, high values in red). Hydroid prevalence and abundance increase with salinity and temperature. Parameters critical for the bivalve host such as low oxygen concentration and shellfish handling promote the infestation. Low water movement and sheltered environments limit the dispersal of the free-living stage and favour the larval settlement nearby the place of origin. These conditions and high mollusc densities favour the spread of <i>Eugymnanthea</i>.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Both wild and reared bivalves can host hydroids from the Eirenidae family which settle on the soft body parts of their host. Thousands of hydroids have been observed on a single bivalve, and often have severe detrimental effects on the host. However, this relationship has received little attention in aquaculture research, which is probably due to a lack of baseline data. An extensive review was conducted (i) to show the current level of knowledge on the association between eirenids and bivalves, providing a benchmark for future research; (ii) to detect a critical combination of biotic/abiotic factors that could switch the relationship from commensalism to infestation and (iii) to identify research priorities for future studies. Seventy scientific papers were screened to provide ecological information useful in understanding the hydroid-host-environment interactions and to show the global spatial and bathymetric distribution of the relationship. Although the main parameters influencing the hydroid abundance were identified, it was challenging to collate information from such heterogeneous data sources. A standardized method for data collection is proposed to obtain more robust and comparable data on the association. The most relevant and unstudied issue is the potential physiological and qualitative changes that could occur in infested bivalves. Monitoring the association could provide data needed to prevent or to control hyper-proliferation of the symbionts and to detect eventual synergistic effects with climate change. This could be fundamental for species living in areas particularly prone to climate regime shifts, such as semi-enclosed basins and estuarine habitats.</p>","author":"Cristina Di Camillo, \nCamilla Roveta, \nTorcuato Pulido Mantas, \nCinzia Gravili, \nCarlo Cerrano, \nBarbara Calcinai, \nMartina Coppari, \nChiara Gregorin, \nTeo Marrocco, \nAgnese Riccardi, \nStefania Puce","siteTitle":"Wiley: Reviews in Aquaculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e603512385355dc11b8c11c7000aba80fad3ae9faea7a2537d8e3609c19b97a1","entryHash":"8896b68e4545d1f5c25e655410a9b10e7b34981c5c61de5bf8a5440c25d1f144","category":"Environment"}
