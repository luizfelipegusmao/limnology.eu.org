One potential key factor is reproduction, which could constrain body size evolution because females of miniature species need to remain large enough to lay viable eggs. <a href=\"#CIT0003\">Glynne and Adams (2024)</a> tested this hypothesis in two gecko families, the Sphaerodactylidae and Phyllodactylidae. Their findings support this hypothesis, indicating that female-biased size differences in miniature species are shaped by selection for reproductive success.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"9ec326d7d6d960b490b64c603893e1f68b011bbd465176eae989115b17ee93f8","category":"Environment"}
