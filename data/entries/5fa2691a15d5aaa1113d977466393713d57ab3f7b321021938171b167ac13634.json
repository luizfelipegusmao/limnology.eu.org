{"title":"Metal cation‐induced conformational changes of soybean protein isolate/soybean soluble polysaccharide and their effects on high‐internal‐phase emulsion properties","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13219?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Metal ions commonly inevitably appear in food products and have adverse effects on high-internal-phase emulsions (HIPEs) foods, but conformational conversion of soybean protein isolate (SPI)/soybean soluble polysaccharide (SSPS) on the interface layer of HIPEs influenced by different metal ions has rarely been reported.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Here, the conformational conversion of SPI/SSPS induced by Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions and its effects on HIPEs were investigated. After adding the ions to SPI and SPI/SSPS dispersions, the particle size and zeta potential results showed different degrees of flocculation; the zeta potential and Fourier transform infrared spectra indicated that SPI and SPI/SSPS changes in structure involve electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Moreover, Raman spectra showed that the content of <i>β</i>-sheet of SPI/SSPS HIPEs increased with the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>, suggesting that SPI molecules at the interface formed a more orderly structure. The ultraviolet and fluorescence results showed that the hydrophobic environment of tryptophan and tyrosine residues inside protein molecules played a vital role in the emulsifying stability of SPI.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These findings suggested that the SPI/SSPS complexes for food applications were not susceptible to ions, thus ensuring complex stability, showing potential for commercial application in the production of emulsions. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Guilan Zhao, \nShengnan Wang, \nYangyang Li, \nXiulin Liu, \nLina Yang, \nHong Song, \nHe Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"5fa2691a15d5aaa1113d977466393713d57ab3f7b321021938171b167ac13634","category":"Environment"}
