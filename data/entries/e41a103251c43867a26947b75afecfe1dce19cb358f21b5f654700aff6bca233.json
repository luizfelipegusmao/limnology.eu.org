{"title":"USP2 Mitigates Reactive Oxygen Species&ndash;Induced Mitochondrial Damage via UCP2 Expression in Myoblasts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2531/v1","date":1722411801000,"content":"Ubiquitin-specific protease 2 (USP2) maintains mitochondrial integrity in culture myoblasts. In this study, we investigated molecular mechanisms underlying the protective role of USP2 on mitochondria. Knockout (KO) of the Usp2 gene or chemical inhibition of USP2 induced robust accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), accompanied by defects in mitochondrial membrane potential, in C2C12 myoblasts. ROS removal by N-acetyl-L-cysteine restored the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by USP2 deficiency. Comprehensive RT-qPCR screening and following protein analysis indicated that both genetic and chemical inhibition of USP2 elicited a decrease of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) at mRNA and protein levels. Accordingly, the introduction of a Ucp2-expressing construct effectively recovered mitochondrial membrane potentials, entailing an increment of the intracellular ATP level in Usp2KO C2C12 cells. In contrast, USP2 deficiency also decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  coactivator 1 (PGC1 protein in C2C12 cells, while it upregulated Ppargc1a mRNA. Overexpression studies indicate that USP2 potentially stabilizes PGC1 in an isopeptidase-dependent manner. Given that PGC1 is an inducer of UCP2 in C2C12 cells, USP2 might ameliorate mitochondrial ROS by maintaining the PGC1–UCP2 axis in myoblasts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e41a103251c43867a26947b75afecfe1dce19cb358f21b5f654700aff6bca233","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
