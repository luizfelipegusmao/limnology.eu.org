{"title":"PLASMODESMATA-LOCATED PROTEIN 6 regulates plasmodesmal function in Arabidopsis vasculature","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3543/7688863?rss=1","date":1717632000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plasmodesmata connect adjoining plant cells, allowing molecules to move between the connected cells for communication and sharing resources. It has been well established that the plant polysaccharide callose is deposited at plasmodesmata, regulating their aperture and function. Among proteins involved in maintaining callose homeostasis, PLASMODESMATA-LOCATED PROTEINSs (PDLPs) promote callose deposition at plasmodesmata. This study explored the function of PDLP5 and PDLP6 in different cell types. We discovered that PDLP5 and PDLP6 are expressed in nonoverlapping cell types in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). The overexpression of <span>PDLP5</span> and <span>PDLP6</span> results in the overaccumulation of plasmodesmal callose at different cell interfaces, indicating that PDLP5 and PDLP6 are active in different cell types. We also observed 2 distinct patterns of starch accumulation in mature leaves of <span>PDLP5</span> and <span>PDLP6</span> overexpressors. An enzyme-catalyzed proximity labeling approach was used to identify putative functional partners of the PDLPs. We identified SUCROSE SYNTHASE 6 (SUS6) as a functional partner of PDLP6 in the vasculature. We further demonstrated that PDLP6 physically and genetically interacts with SUS6. In addition, CALLOSE SYNTHASE 7 (CALS7) physically interacts with SUS6 and PDLP6. Genetic interaction studies showed that CALS7 is required for PDLP6 function. We propose that PDLP6 functions with SUS6 and CALS7 in the vasculature to regulate plasmodesmal function.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"0d87e18c0ecd7c3f49c5c1caffd2d18f07ad1af0da45ffbad28d7feba994749e","category":"Environment"}
