It is normally reported with <i>Botrytis fabae</i> Sardiña, which causes chocolate spot of faba bean. The aim of the work reported here was to estimate how fast isolated infections of <i>D. gigas</i> may spread spatially and how background infection of the host with <i>B. fabae</i> alters multiplication of <i>D. gigas</i>. Spatial spread in field conditions was measured in plants growing in square grids. After establishment, single plants at the centre of each grid were spray inoculated with <i>D. gigas.</i> In summer 2017, <i>D. gigas</i> spread to a distance of at least 1 m, the edge of each 2 m × 2 m plot. Incidence on shoots decreased very slowly with distance beyond 0.4 m. In a repeat experiment harvested in autumn 2018, <i>D. gigas</i> was detected at distances of up to 160 cm in 4 m × 4 m plots. The yield effect and reproduction rate of <i>D. gigas</i> were measured in glasshouse experiments, alone and following brush inoculation with low (10<sup>3</sup>) or high (10<sup>6</sup> conidia/mL) doses of <i>B. fabae.</i> At low doses of <i>D. gigas</i> inoculum multiplied by approximately 75-fold, with lower rates of multiplication as the inoculum dose increased. The reproduction rate of <i>D. gigas</i> was reduced in plants inoculated with <i>B. fabae</i>, especially at high doses of <i>D. gigas</i>. The reduction was approximately proportional to log (<i>B. fabae</i> dose). Seed yield from inoculated plants decreased approximately in proportion to the logarithms of the initial dose of <i>D. gigas</i> and of <i>B. fabae</i>.</p>","author":"Anthony Isadeha, \nMichael W.
