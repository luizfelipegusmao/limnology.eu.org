This study examined intersectional inequity in knowledge, attitudes, and testing related to HIV among adults aged 15 to 49 years in Ethiopia. This study used nationally representative 2016 Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey data. The sample size was 27,261 for knowledge about HIV/AIDS and 25,542 for attitude towards people living with HIV and HIV testing. Triple (dis)advantage groups were based on wealth status, education status, and residence. The triple advantages variables specifically are urban residents, the educated, and those who belong to households of high wealth status, while the triple disadvantages are rural residents, the uneducated, and those who live in poor household wealth rank. A multilevel logistic regression analysis was employed. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and confidence intervals (CI) with a P-value â‰¤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Based on descriptive analysis, 27.9% (95% CI: 26.5%, 29.3%) of adults had comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS, 39.8% (95% CI: 37.6, 41.9%) exhibited accepting attitude towards people living with HIV, and 20.4% (95% CI: 19.1%, 21.8%) undergo HIV testing. Comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS, accepting attitude towards people living with HIV, and HIV testing was 47.0%, 75.7%, and 36.1% among those with triple advantages, and 13.9%, 16.0% and 8.7% among those with triple non-advantages, respectively. The odds of having comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS, accepting attitude towards people living with HIV, and HIV testing were about three (aOR = 3.4; 95% CI: 2.76 to 4.21), seven (aOR = 7.3; 95% CI = 5.79 to 9.24) and five (aOR = 4.7; 95% CI:3.60 to 6.10) times higher for triple forms of advantage than triple disadvantages, respectively. The findings of this study imply that Ethiopia will not achieve the proposed targets for HIV/AIDS services unless it prioritises individuals who live under multiple disadvantaged conditions.","author":"Aklilu Endalamaw","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"ac5c97e212961f84d857d26d21b86d3a014abec4eeff897ad2b97010f0065e10","category":"Environment"}
