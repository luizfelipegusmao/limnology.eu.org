{"title":"Optimal Harvesting Strategies for Timber and Non-timber Forest Products with Nonlinear Harvesting Term","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0635/v1","date":1715333461000,"content":"Forest resources are renewable,rational exploitation and utilization of forest resources are not only conducive to sustainable development of population, but also can obtain higher economic benefits. Based on actual timber harvesting problems,a combined harvesting model of timber and non-timber with nonlinear harvesting term was established.Firstly, using the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations, the dynamic behavior of the model is studied, and the existence and stability of the equilibrium point of the model are proved .Secondly, the optimal control solution is obtained by using the optimal control theory.Finally, the optimal harvesting strategy of timber and non-timber products is given based on the numerical simulation results, which provides a certain theoretical basis for the sustainable development of forestry ecological economy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc047beff361b023b36817dfa4961ea68e9ab7e0733676923c4d8a673b52d7c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
