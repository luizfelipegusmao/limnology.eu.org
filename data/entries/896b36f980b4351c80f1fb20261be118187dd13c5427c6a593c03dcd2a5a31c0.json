{"title":"Using Electrical Muscle Stimulation to Enhance Electrophysiological Performance of Agonist-Antagonist Myoneural Interface","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1816/v1","date":1721750418000,"content":"The agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI), a surgical method to reinnervate physiologically-relevant proprioceptive feedback for control of limb prostheses, has demonstrated the ability to provide natural afferent sensations for limb amputees when actuating their prostheses. Following an AMI surgery, one potential challenge is atrophy of the disused muscles, which would weaken the reinnervation efficacy of AMI. It is well known that electrical muscle stimulus (EMS) can reduce the muscle atrophy. In this study, we conducted an animal investigation to explore whether the EMS can significantly improve the electrophysiological performance of AMI. The AMI surgery was performed in 14 rats, in which the distal tendons of bilateral solei donors were connected and positioned on the surface of the left biceps femoris. Subsequently, the left tibial nerve and the common peroneus nerve were sutured onto the ends of the connected donor solei. Two stimulation electrodes were affixed onto the ends of the donor solei for EMS delivery. The AMI rats were randomly divided into two groups. One group regularly received the EMS treatment (designated as EMS_on) for eight weeks and another was no EMS (designated as EMS_off). Two physiological parameters, nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and motor unit number, were derived from the electrically evoked compound action potential (CAP) signals to assess the electrophysiological performance of AMI. Our experimental results demonstrated that the reinnervated muscles of the EMS_on group generated higher CAP signals in comparison to the EMS_off group. Both NCV and motor unit number were significantly elevated in the EMS_on group. Moreover, the EMS_on group displayed statistically higher CAP signals on the indirectly activated proprioceptive afferents than the EMS_off group. These findings may suggested that the EMS treatment would be promise in enhancing the electrophysiological performance and facilitating the reinnervation process of AMI.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"896b36f980b4351c80f1fb20261be118187dd13c5427c6a593c03dcd2a5a31c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
