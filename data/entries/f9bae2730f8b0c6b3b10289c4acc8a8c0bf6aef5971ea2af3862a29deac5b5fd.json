Its high amylose content, however, suggests its suitability for specific industrial uses. Understanding the flowability, rheology and thermal properties of cardaba banana starch could lead to its novel application in food product formulation and pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the effect of modification on the bulk material characterization (powder flowability), granule size and shape (measured by light microscope), rheology and thermal properties of cardaba banana starch.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The flowability of cross-linked starch was affected significantly by the granule size (105 892.7 μm), shape (circularity 0.78) and compressibility (0.20), making it a more free-flowing powder than other starch powders. The rheological behavior of the starch paste revealed that the Herschel–Bulkley model best predicts the rheological behavior with the highest coefficient of determinant (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.9).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Cross-linked Cardaba banana starch with an excellent characteristic will find good application in food products that require free-flowing behavior. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Babatunde Olawoye, \nIsaac Olatunde Olaoye","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"f9bae2730f8b0c6b3b10289c4acc8a8c0bf6aef5971ea2af3862a29deac5b5fd","category":"Environment"}
