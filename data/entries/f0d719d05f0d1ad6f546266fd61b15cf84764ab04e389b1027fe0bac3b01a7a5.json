{"title":"An Examination of the Very First Polarimetric X-ray Observations of Radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1150/v1","date":1718628319000,"content":"Active galactic nuclei (AGNs), either radio-quiet or radio-loud, had never been observed in X-ray polarized light until the advent of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE [1]) in the end of 2021. This satellite opened a new observational window for studying supermassive black holes and their complex environment. In this regard, radio-quiet AGNs are probably better targets than radio-loud objects to probe accretion processes, due to the lack of synchrotron emission from jets that can dilute the polarized signal from the central engine. Their relatively clean environment not only allows to detect and measure the X-ray polarization originating from the hot corona responsible for X-ray emission, but also to assess the geometry of the media immediately surrounding the supermassive black hole. Such geometrical measurements work just as well for characterizing the corona morphology in pole-on AGNs as it does for determining the three-dimensional shape of the circumnuclear cold obscurer (the so-called torus) in edge-on AGNs. In this review paper, we will return to each of the observations made by IXPE so far in the field of radio-quiet AGNs and highlight the fundamental contribution of X-ray polarimetry to our understanding of how light is emitted and how matter is shaped around supermassive black holes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0d719d05f0d1ad6f546266fd61b15cf84764ab04e389b1027fe0bac3b01a7a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
