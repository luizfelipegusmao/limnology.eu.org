{"title":"Artificial Intelligence in Flight Safety: Fatigue Monitoring and Risk Mitigation Technologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2208/v1","date":1727429964000,"content":"With the improvement of computer, artificial intelligence, information technology and other technical levels, the relationship between man-machine environment systems is more complicated and diversified. The optimization, iteration and development of the new generation of intelligent equipment system and human-computer interaction interface put forward higher requirements for ensuring the safety of personnel, improving the efficiency of human-computer interaction and improving the efficiency of the system. Such as intelligent cabin adaptive cognitive decision aid system, how to adopt intelligent information display and human-computer interaction, optimize information processing, strengthen situational awareness; How to effectively present information and improve the efficiency of human-computer interaction, so that the system has good security, applicability and maximize its effectiveness; How to deal with man-machine matching and man-machine collaboration problems, so as to improve the efficiency of man-machine/unmanned collaborative work. Human factors throughout the life cycle of equipment systems must be fully considered. The human factor is considered in the system design, so that people, machines and the environment can work together and adapt to each other, so as to achieve benign interaction and feedback between people and equipment and interface and complete the full transmission and communication of human-machine intelligent interaction information. The development of new aircraft human-computer interaction systems combined with new technological methods has also gradually changed the role of pilots and staff. From the system operator gradually into the monitor and decision maker, especially with the improvement of the degree of intelligent flight, information technology, advanced complex airborne equipment is increasing, the amount of information that operators need to deal with is also increasing, and the allowed time for judgment and decision is very short, and the mental resources that pilots bear are gradually rising. As the mental load is a key factor affecting the allocation of cognitive tasks, when encountering emergency situations, the mental load overload caused by the increase of information processing tasks often occurs, which seriously affects the task performance of operators, physical and psychological comfort and flight safety, and thus affects the efficiency and safety of the entire aircraft man-machine system. This requires us to conduct real-time analysis of human-computer interaction situational awareness, especially the individual cognitive state as an uncontrollable factor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a2322649033db48021b4594b79462dd605a28273bdb032b35e25a429b6a3220","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
