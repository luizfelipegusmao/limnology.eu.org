{"title":"Unlocking the secrets of green semiotics: The revolutionary power of eco-symbols in transforming consumer perceptions and catalyzing behavioral shifts in emerging markets","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310963","date":1727359200000,"content":"<p>by Wongsatorn Worakittikul, Chatrawee Saenwerm, Phaninee Naruetharadhol</p>\r\n\r\nThis study delves into the intriguing dynamics between green semiotics and brand experiences, examining how elements like color, image, logo, and font not only shape brand experiences towards eco-friendly products but also influence green consumer behavior and thinking. Conducting a survey among 357 Thai consumers, this research uses Covariance-based Structural Equation Modeling (CB-SEM) to unearth the complex relationships between these semiotic elements and the multifaceted dimensions of brand experienceâ€”cognitive, sensory, emotional, and cultural. Surprisingly, the analysis revealed a predominantly negative impact of green semiotics on consumer perceptions, challenging the prevailing notion that eco-friendly branding consistently engenders positive reactions. Theoretically, this research sheds light on the potential pitfalls of green semiotics in branding, while practically, it offers critical insights for marketers on the cautious use of these elements to avoid consumer disillusionment and enhance sustainable consumer engagement, thereby contributing to a more nuanced understanding of how green brand experiences can be optimized to foster positive environmental behavior.","author":"Wongsatorn Worakittikul","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4f6465b84d043ad7f764d75259527ae62089fd498c1bdf6255d7af3a0d197a30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
