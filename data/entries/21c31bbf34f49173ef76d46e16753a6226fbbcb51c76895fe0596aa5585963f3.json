{"title":"Work-related Musculoskeletal Problems: A Look at How Employers View Causes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1914/v1","date":1719481219000,"content":"Causation concepts for work-related musculoskeletal disorders vary among authors and academic disciplines. Major causation concepts are single-event and repetitive motion. The aim of this short communication is to share findings from a recent survey, conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics of United States employers about work-related musculoskeletal cases, and more specifically, about whether the employers regard the cause of their employeeâ€™s musculoskeletal problem as being from a single exposure or from multiple exposures. Recommendations are offered for using terminology consistent with employer understandings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"21c31bbf34f49173ef76d46e16753a6226fbbcb51c76895fe0596aa5585963f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
