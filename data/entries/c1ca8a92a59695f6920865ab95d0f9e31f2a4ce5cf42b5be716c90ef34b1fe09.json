{"title":"Are two stresses better than one? In-depth analysis of 5 Arabidopsis accessions under water and nitrogen stress","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3324/7698904?rss=1","date":1719273600000,"content":"<span>Plant species are simultaneously affected by a broad range of environmental stresses, such as low soil nutrients and decreased water availability. Although much is known about the effects of individual stresses, we have less understanding of the plant response to simultaneous stresses (<a href=\"#koae174-B1\">Araus et al. 2020</a>), and the effects of such multifactorial stresses cannot be predicted from the individual stresses involved (<a href=\"#koae174-B4\">Zandalinas et al. 2021</a>). Multifactorial stress events can seriously affect plant growth and survival, as well as increase plant susceptibility to pathogens, even when the extent of the individual stresses alone might have little to no effect (<a href=\"#koae174-B4\">Zandalinas et al. 2021</a>). However, new work by <strong>Zeyun Xue and colleagues (<a href=\"#koae174-B3\">Xue et al. 2024</a>)</strong> presents an intriguing alternative to this model, where combined stresses might alleviate the effects of a single stress. The group presents an in-depth transcriptome and metabolome analysis of individual and combined stresses of nitrogen and water deficiency conditions in natural variants of <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>. Their study provides insights into the fine-tuned responses at the transcriptional and metabolic levels and sheds light on the impact of combined stresses on plant molecular programming.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"c1ca8a92a59695f6920865ab95d0f9e31f2a4ce5cf42b5be716c90ef34b1fe09","category":"Environment"}
