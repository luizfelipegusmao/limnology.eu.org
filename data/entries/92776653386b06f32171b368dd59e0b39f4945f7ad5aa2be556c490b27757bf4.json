Twenty-six healthy men underwent plantar flexors passive stretching. Before and after stretching, the electrochemical and mechanical components of the EMD and the relaxation EMD (R-EMD) were calculated in gastrocnemius medialis (GM), lateralis (GL) and soleus (SOL) during a supramaximal motor point stimulation. Additionally, joint passive stiffness was assessed. At baseline, the mechanical components of EMD and R-EMD were longer in GM and GL than SOL (Cohen’s <i>d</i> from 1.78 to 3.67). Stretching decreased joint passive stiffness [-22(8)%, <i>d</i> = -1.96] while overall lengthened the electrochemical and mechanical EMD. The mechanical R-EMD components were affected more in GM [21(2)%] and GL [22(2)%] than SOL [12(1)%], with <i>d</i> ranging from 0.63 to 1.81. Negative correlations between joint passive stiffness with EMD and R-EMD mechanical components were found before and after stretching in all muscles (<i>r</i> from -0.477 to -0.926; <i>P</i> from 0.007 to &lt;0.001). These results suggest that stretching plantar flexors affected GM and GL more than SOL. Future research should calculate EMD and R-EMD to further investigate the mechanical adaptations induced by passive stretching in synergistic muscles.","author":"Nicholas Toninelli","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"92776653386b06f32171b368dd59e0b39f4945f7ad5aa2be556c490b27757bf4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
