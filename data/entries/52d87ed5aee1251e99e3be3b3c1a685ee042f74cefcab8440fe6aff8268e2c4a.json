Using the PREDIMED-Plus-Cognition cohort, several glycemic-related and impulsivity assessments were obtained over 3 years. Z-scores of impulsivity domains were obtained to provide a comprehensive impulsivity evaluation. Based on previous evidence, the current results suggest a positive feedback loop between impulsivity and glycemic dysregulations.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Impulsivity has been proposed to have an impact on glycemic dysregulation. However, it remains uncertain whether an unfavorable glycemic status could also contribute to an increase in impulsivity levels. This study aims to analyze associations of baseline and time-varying glycemic status with 3-year time-varying impulsivity in older adults at high risk of cardiovascular disease. A 3-year prospective cohort design was conducted within the PREDIMED-Plus-Cognition substudy. The total population includes 487 participants (mean age = 65.2 years; female = 50.5%) with overweight or obesity and metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and type 2 diabetes control were evaluated. Impulsivity was measured using the Impulsive Behavior Scale questionnaire and various cognitive measurements. Impulsivity z-scores were generated to obtain Global, Trait, and Behavioral Impulsivity domains. Linear mixed models were used to study the longitudinal associations across baseline, 1-year, and 3-year follow-up visits. HOMA-IR was not significantly related to impulsivity. Participants with higher HbA1c levels, type 2 diabetes, and poor control of diabetes showed positive associations with the Global Impulsivity domain over time, and those with higher HbA1c levels were further related to increases in the Trait and Behavioral Impulsivity domains over the follow-up visits. These results suggest a potential positive feedback loop between impulsivity and glycemic-related dysregulation.</p>","author":"Carlos Gómez‐Martínez, \nNancy Babio, \nLucía Camacho‐Barcia, \nJordi Júlvez, \nStephanie K.
