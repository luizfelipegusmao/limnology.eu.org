{"title":"Update on the use of Sodium Glucose Cotransporter Type 2 inhibitors in kidney transplant patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1755/v1","date":1716813090000,"content":"Abstract\nSodium glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors are a new class of drugs acting on cardiovascular system, renal and metabolism in a multiple way. Indeed, even their principal action is on the transporter of sodium and glucose in the convoluted distal tubule, they have multiple actions as antifibrotic and endothelial protective action. Their principal mechanism consist in the loss of sodium and glucose. Therefore, they have effect on blood pressure and glucose metabolism. In a first period their use has been in the diabetic general population, later on some studies documented their activity in non-diabetic general population, in heart failure in chronic kidney disease. Only in recent years several small studies documented their efficacy in diabetic and non-diabetic kidney transplant patients, larger studies are few and very recent and open new ways for these drugs","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"722e2e7c4499d37f837013dc7ce1cb91d4ceab41d290415ee419db7a9d192fd2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
