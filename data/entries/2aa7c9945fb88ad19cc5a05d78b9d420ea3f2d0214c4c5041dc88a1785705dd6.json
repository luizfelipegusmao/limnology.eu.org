{"title":"Effect of stocking on brown trout angling catch rates in the Czech Republic during 1996–2018","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12726?af=R","date":1720162193000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>When investigating potential causes of apparent declines in European brown trout angling catch rates over recent decades, fisheries management procedures are rarely considered. Using a 20-year dataset of brown trout stocking and angling catch rates, we found a significant decline in brown trout angling catch rates in streams of East Bohemia, Czechia, were well predicted by a reduction in the number of brown trout stocked at catchable size (i.e. age-3+). Increased stocking of smaller sized brown trout, and recent sporadic efforts to stock large brown trout, had no effect on catch rates. Our findings suggest that brown trout catch rates were related to ‘put-and-take’ stocking, in which non-native rainbow trout gradually replaced brown trout in both stocking and catches. Our study stresses the importance of considering historical fisheries management, a sometimes-neglected factor, when studying angling catches of economically important species.</p>","author":"Luděk Šlapanský, \nMichal Janáč, \nPavel Jurajda","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"2aa7c9945fb88ad19cc5a05d78b9d420ea3f2d0214c4c5041dc88a1785705dd6","category":"Environment"}
