{"title":"Neuromodulation and Habituation: A Literature Review and Conceptional Analysis of Sustaining Therapeutic Efficacy and Mitigating Habituation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0468/v1","date":1712477398000,"content":"Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a therapeutic modality for the treatment of various chronic pain conditions that has rapidly evolved over the past 50 years. Unfortunately, over time, patients implanted with SCS undergo a habituation phenomenon leading to decreased pain relief. Consequently, discovery of new stimulation waveforms and SCS applications have shown to prolong efficacy and reduce explantation rates. This article explores various SCS waveforms, their applications and proposes a graded approach to habituation mitigation. We suspect the neural habituation phenomenon parallels that seen in pharmacology. Consequently we urge further exploration of early introduction of these stimulation strategies to abate spinal cord stimulation habituation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51cda9cb6ce176de823e8350188b80d970d0d1142be4d1c23424b3329f138cf0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
