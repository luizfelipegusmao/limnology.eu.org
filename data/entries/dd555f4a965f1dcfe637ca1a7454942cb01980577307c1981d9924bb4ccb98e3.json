{"title":"Rates and risk factors for antepartum and intrapartum stillbirths in 20 secondary hospitals in Imo state, Nigeria: A hospital-based case control study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003771","date":1729778400000,"content":"<p>by Uchenna Gwacham-Anisiobi, Charles Opondo, Tuck Seng Cheng, Jennifer J.

We assessed stillbirth incidences and associated risk factors in 20 secondary hospitals in Imo state, to generate essential local evidence to inform policymaking to reduce mortality. The total numbers of births and their outcomes were determined through hospital maternity registers. An unmatched case-control study was conducted. We collected retrospective data about 157 antepartum and 193 intrapartum stillbirths, and from 381 livebirths (controls). Potential risk factors were categorised into sociodemographic, obstetric and maternity care and biological determinants using a theoretical framework. Independent multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the association of risk factors with each stillbirth type. The overall stillbirth rate was 38 per 1,000 total births. The rate of antepartum and intrapartum stillbirths were 16 and 19 per 1,000 respectively. The risk factors independently associated with antepartum stillbirths were nulliparity (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.87, 95%CI 1.04–3.36); preterm birth (aOR 14.29, 95%CI 6.31–32.38); being referred from another facility (aOR 3.75, 95%CI 1.96–7.17); unbooked pregnancy (aOR 2.58, 95%CI 1.37–4.85); and obstetric complications (aOR 4.04, 95%CI 2.35–6.94). For intrapartum stillbirths, associated factors were preterm birth (aOR 11.28, 95%CI 4.66–27.24); referral (aOR 2.50, 95%CI 1.19–5.24); not using a partogram (aOR 2.92, 95%CI 1.23–6.95) and obstetric complications (aOR 10.71, 95%CI 5.92–19.37). The findings highlight specific risk factors associated with antepartum and intrapartum stillbirths, shedding light on potential areas for targeted interventions.","author":"Uchenna Gwacham-Anisiobi","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"dd555f4a965f1dcfe637ca1a7454942cb01980577307c1981d9924bb4ccb98e3","category":"Environment"}
