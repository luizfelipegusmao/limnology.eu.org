{"title":"Spiking activity in the visual thalamus is coupled to pupil dynamics across temporal scales","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002614","date":1715695200000,"content":"<p>by Davide Crombie, Martin A. Spacek, Christian Leibold, Laura Busse</p>\r\n\r\nThe processing of sensory information, even at early stages, is influenced by the internal state of the animal. Internal states, such as arousal, are often characterized by relating neural activity to a single “level” of arousal, defined by a behavioral indicator such as pupil size. In this study, we expand the understanding of arousal-related modulations in sensory systems by uncovering multiple timescales of pupil dynamics and their relationship to neural activity. Specifically, we observed a robust coupling between spiking activity in the mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus and pupil dynamics across timescales spanning a few seconds to several minutes. Throughout all these timescales, 2 distinct spiking modes—individual tonic spikes and tightly clustered bursts of spikes—preferred opposite phases of pupil dynamics. This multi-scale coupling reveals modulations distinct from those captured by pupil size per se, locomotion, and eye movements. Furthermore, coupling persisted even during viewing of a naturalistic movie, where it contributed to differences in the encoding of visual information. We conclude that dLGN spiking activity is under the simultaneous influence of multiple arousal-related processes associated with pupil dynamics occurring over a broad range of timescales.","author":"Davide Crombie","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"facb271cb7baa59d744e974c3f5c6fe4801f0dc1a83117b65da60a8f53f1fd0c","category":"Environment"}
