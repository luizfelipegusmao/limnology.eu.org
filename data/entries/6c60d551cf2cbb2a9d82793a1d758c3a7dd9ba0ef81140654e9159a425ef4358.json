The G-Shaped Net architecture appears in this context as an innovative and promising design that combines components from many models to attain improved accuracy and efficiency. In order to improve efficiency, the G-Shaped Net architecture synergistically incorporates four fundamental components: the Self-Attention, Squeeze Excitation, Fusion, and Spatial Pyramid Pooling block structures. These factors work together to improve the precision and effectiveness of brain tumor segmentation. Self-Attention, a crucial component of G-Shaped architecture, gives the model the ability to concentrate on the image’s most informative areas, enabling accurate localization of tumor boundaries. By adjusting channel-wise feature maps, Squeeze Excitation completes this by improving the model’s capacity to capture fine-grained information in the medical pictures. Since the G-Shaped model’s Spatial Pyramid Pooling component provides multi-scale contextual information, the model is capable of handling tumors of various sizes and complexity levels. Additionally, the Fusion block architectures combine characteristics from many sources, enabling a thorough comprehension of the image and improving the segmentation outcomes. The G-Shaped Net architecture is an asset for medical imaging and diagnostics and represents a substantial development in semantic segmentation, which is needed more and more for accurate brain tumor segmentation.","author":"Chandra Sekaran D.
