{"title":"First Record of the Red Cornetfish Fistularia petimba Lacep&egrave;de, 1803 from Amorgos Island (Central Aegean Sea; Greece) and a Review of Its Current Distribution in the Mediterranean Sea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1928/v1","date":1714397631000,"content":"The rapid spread of non-indigenous species (NIS) poses a significant threat to biodiversity globally, with the Mediterranean region being particularly susceptible due to increased human activities and its status as a marine biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we focus on the introduction and distribution of Fistularia petimba, a member of the Fistulariidae family, in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, specifically on the coasts of Amorgos Island, Greece. Through a baseline fisheries study conducted over 12 months, utilizing experimental sampling with gillnets, trammel nets, and longlines, one individual of F.petimba was captured off the coast of Katapola Bay. Morphological examination confirmed its identity, with measurements on meristic characteristics obtained and stomach content analyzed. This finding represents a significant addition to the documented distribution of F. petimba in the Mediterranean Sea, particularly in the Aegean Sea, underscoring the importance of ongoing research in uncovering new occurrences and expanding our understanding of marine biodiversity and ecosystem changes. Further investigation into the ecological preferences and population dynamics of F.petimba in the Aegean Sea is crucial for informed conservation and management efforts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07a28288a819ebc5029ed7f57390f1515a0d9314cf3e3a9781362850bc7a27d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
