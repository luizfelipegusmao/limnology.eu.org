{"title":"Climate change vulnerability and conservation strategies for tertiary relict tree species: Insights from landscape genomics ofÂ Taxus cuspidata","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.13686?af=R","date":1725433200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The unprecedented habitat fragmentation or loss has threatened the existence of many species. Therefore, it is essential to understand whether and how these species can pace with the environmental changes. Recent advantages in landscape genomics enabled us to identify molecular signatures of adaptation and predict how populations will respond to changing environments, providing new insights into the conservation of species. Here, we investigated the pattern of neutral and putative adaptive genetic variation and its response to changing environments in a tertiary relict tree species, <i>Taxus cuspidata</i> Sieb. et Zucc, which is distributed in northeast China and adjacent regions. We investigated the pattern of genetic diversity and differentiation using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) and seven nuclear microsatellites (nSSRs) datasets. We further explored the endangered mechanism, predicted its vulnerability in the future, and provided guidelines for the conservation and management of this species. RAD-seq identified 16,087 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in natural populations. Both the SNPs and nSSRs datasets showed high levels of genetic diversity and low genetic differentiation in <i>T. cuspidata</i>. Outlier detection by <i>F</i>\n<sub>ST</sub> outlier analysis and genotype-environment associations (GEAs) revealed 598 outlier SNPs as putative adaptive SNPs. Linear redundancy analysis (RDA) and nonlinear gradient forest (GF) showed that the contribution of climate to genetic variation was greater than that of geography, and precipitation played an important role in putative adaptive genetic variation. Furthermore, the genetic offset and risk of non-adaptedness (RONA) suggested that the species at the northeast edge may be more vulnerable in the future. These results suggest that although the species has maintained high current genetic diversity in the face of recent habitat loss and fragmentation, future climate change is likely to threaten the survival of the species. Temperature (Bio03) and precipitation (Prec05) variables can be potentially used as predictors of response of <i>T. cuspidata</i> under future climate. Together, this study provides a theoretical framework for conservation and management strategies for wildlife species in the context of future climate change.</p>","author":"Yanjun Luo, \nWei Qin, \nYu Yan, \nKangquan Yin, \nRunguo Zang, \nFang K.
