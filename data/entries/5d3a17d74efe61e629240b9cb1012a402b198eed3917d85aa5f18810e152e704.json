{"title":"Relationship between phthalates exposures and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease in United States adults","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301097","date":1713535200000,"content":"<p>by Junhao Sun, Siqi Yang, Yue Zhang, Wenzhi Xiang, Xiubo Jiang</p>\r\n\r\nAs a new definition for the evidence of hepatic steatosis and metabolic dysfunctions, the relationship between phthalates (PAEs) and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) remains virtually unexplored. This study included 3,137 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey spanning 2007â€“2018. The diagnosis of MAFLD depended on the US Fatty Liver Index (US FLI) and evidence of metabolic dysregulation. Eleven metabolites of PAEs were included in the study. Poisson regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS), and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression were used to assess the associations between phthalate metabolites and MAFLD. After adjusting for potential confounders, Poisson regression analysis showed that mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), mono-n-butyl phthalate, mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate, mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate were generally significant positively associated with MAFLD (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the WQS index constructed for the eleven phthalates was significantly related to MAFLD (OR:1.43; 95%CI: 1.20, 1.70), MEHHP (33.30%), MEP (20.84%), MECPP (15.43%), and mono-isobutyl phthalate (11.78%) contributing the most. This study suggests that exposure to phthalates, individually or in combination, may be associated with an increased risk of MAFLD.","author":"Junhao Sun","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5d3a17d74efe61e629240b9cb1012a402b198eed3917d85aa5f18810e152e704","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
