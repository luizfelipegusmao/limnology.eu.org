{"title":"Lipid concomitant γ‐oryzanol decreased oil absorbency of French fries by changing the microstructure of French fries and physical properties of frying oil","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13211?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The aim of this research was to evaluate the possibility of lipid concomitant γ-oryzanol reducing oil absorbency of fried foods and the underlying mechanism. Therefore, the influence of γ-oryzanol on moisture and oil content, and distribution and micromorphology of French fries and the viscosity, fatty acid composition and total polar compounds content of rice bran oil (RBO) after frying were studied.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Our results showed that the incorporation of low concentration of γ-oryzanol [low addition group (LAG)] (5.754 g/kg) decreased the oil absorbency and porous structure of French fries during frying. Additionally, LAG incorporation inhibited the degradation of linoleic acid, decreased the growth rate of saturated fatty acids, total polar compounds and viscosity of frying oil.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>Consequently, it was recommended to incorporate a small amount of γ-oryzanol in frying oil because it could inhibit oil absorption behavior of French fries. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Hai‐long Zhang, \nZhi‐xian Wang, \nKun‐li Wang, \nJing Du, \nJun‐bo He, \nWei‐nong Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"fbbc7a3c2cfeef65f830e46809633fc11bdc78bed4d60864f0b5ce5c91943a3f","category":"Environment"}
