Amidst increasingly complex global dynamics, effective strategies are crucial for organizations to mitigate risks, maintain operational continuity, and preserve consumer trust. The study employs semi-structured interviews with stakeholders across diverse industries, focusing on strategies employed, outcomes observed, and challenges faced in managing disruptions. Key findings underscore the significance of proactive measures such as risk assessment, contingency planning, diversification, technology integration, and collaboration in enhancing organizational resilience. These strategies not only enable businesses to navigate disruptions effectively but also contribute to sustaining competitive advantage and stakeholder confidence. Consumer perception during disruptions emerges as pivotal, shaped by brands' transparency, responsiveness, and ethical considerations in managing supply chain challenges. Transparent communication and reliable service delivery during disruptions enhance brand reputation and foster consumer loyalty. However, challenges including information gaps, resource constraints, coordination issues, and regulatory compliance complexities highlight the need for adaptive strategies and robust partnerships across the supply chain. Overall, the study provides insights into the interconnectedness of disruption management, brand resilience, and consumer perception, offering practical implications for organizations seeking to strengthen their resilience strategies and consumer relationships in dynamic market environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c40fcd5d620441a5e680881c337ab34a2d688e5619c05ff8665fef9d2eb5c70","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
