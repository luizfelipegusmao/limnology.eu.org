{"title":"Protein and Amino Acid Metabolism of Thermoanaerobacter mathranii","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0551/v1","date":1718003469000,"content":"The members within the genus Thermoanerobacter have been much less investigated for protein and amino acid metabolism as compared with carbohydrates. The present study investigates the biotechnological potential of Thermoanaerobacter mathranii (DSM 11426) concerning its ability to produce high energy alcohols from amino and fatty acids. End-product formation was analyzed from glucose in the presence and absence of butyric acid as well as from selected proteins, and all amino acids. T. mathranii did not degrade any of the proteins tested to a large extent but de-grade several amino acids, namely serine and the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleu-cine, valine) when cultivated in the presence of thiosulfate. The main end products from the branched-chain amino acids were a mixture of their corresponding branched-chain fatty acids and alcohols. 13C2-labeled leucine revealed that the strains degraded the amino acid in the pres-ence of thiosulfate, producing 3-methyl-1-butyrate, which was then used as an electron acceptor which led to the accumulation of 3-methyl-1-butanol. The strain is highly ethanologenic, pro-ducing more than 1.2 mol ethanol per mol of glucose degraded. The strain was able to reduce volatile fatty acids during glucose fermentation to their corresponding alcohol, further suggest-ing this strain may be of greater biotechnological value beyond bioethanol production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58d08738724781f3e8b19f181da5b96fa39138c2be214fa4d01d2bb6b7598867","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
