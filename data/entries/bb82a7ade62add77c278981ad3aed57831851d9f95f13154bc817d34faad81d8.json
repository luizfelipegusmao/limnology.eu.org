{"title":"Invisible Melanin: Is It Lacking Consideration?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2039/v1","date":1719904705000,"content":"Expanding earlier observations, we show that many melanin materials, in vitro synthesized from a wide range of precursors, can be fractionated into a dark-colored precipitate and a near-colorless, dispersible fraction. The dispersible fractions exhibited absorbance in the UVA and UVB range of the electromagnetic spectrum, but none in the visible range. In addition, fluorescent properties were associated with all dispersible fractions obtained. FT-IR spectroscopic analyses were performed to compare both types of fractions. Overall, it appears that some of the properties associated with melanin (UV absorbance, fluorescence) may not necessarily reside in the dark-colored portion of melanin, but in a colorless fraction of the material. It remains to be seen whether any of these in vitro observations have any relevance in vivo. However, we raise the possibility that the presence of a colorless fraction within melanin materials, and their associated properties, may have received inadequate attention. Given the important association between melanin, UV protection, and skin cancer, it is worthwhile to consider this additional aspect of melanin chemistry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb82a7ade62add77c278981ad3aed57831851d9f95f13154bc817d34faad81d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
