{"title":"Influence of administration timing of San‐Huang‐Xie‐Xin‐Tang treatment on attenuating Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24322?af=R","date":1715169267000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Salmonella</i> infections are a serious global health concern, particularly in developing countries, and are further exacerbated by the emergence of antibiotic resistance. San-Huang-Xie-Xin-Tang (SHXXT), a traditional herbal medicine with potent anti-inflammatory properties, has recently gained attention as an alternative treatment. Our study emphasizes on the importance of precise timing in accordance with traditional Chinese medicine principles. A mouse infection model was established while different administration times of SHXXT were recorded for the body weight, clinical scores, bacterial counts in blood, and organs. Additionally, cytokine levels, fatty acids, and amino acids in the serum were also monitored. We found that administering SHXXT 1 day after <i>Salmonella enterica</i> subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (<i>S.</i> Typhimurium) infection (T1 group) leads to positive outcomes. This includes restoration of body weight, improved clinical scores, and reduced bacterial counts in blood and vital organs. Interferon-gamma levels remained consistently high across all treatment groups 6 days post-infection. However, the T1 group showed exclusive suppression of serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). The timing of administration significantly influenced serum fatty acid concentrations, countering <i>Salmonella</i>-induced disruptions, aligning with TNF-α and IL-1β levels. SHXXT had also restored amino acid profiles disrupted by the infection, with notable effects when administered at the correct timing. Our research highlights SHXXT's potential in treating <i>S.</i> Typhimurium infection, emphasizing the importance of precise timing in line with traditional Chinese medicine principles for effective treatment at different disease stages.</p>","author":"Chiung‐Hung Chang, \nShu‐Chiu Wang, \nChia‐Ying Lee, \nChiu‐Hsian Su, \nYen‐Ju Lai, \nWei‐De Lin, \nYuan‐Man Hsu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"5886ac59abdf58989aca37b44c72f7bbba576142ed7486951674cfc358597dcc","category":"Environment"}
