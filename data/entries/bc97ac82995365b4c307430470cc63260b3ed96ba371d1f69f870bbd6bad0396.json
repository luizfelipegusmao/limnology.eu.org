{"title":"Addressing Vaccine Hesitancy: A Review of Factors Contributing to Vaccine Refusal and Effective Communication Strategies for Promoting Vaccine Acceptance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1224/v1","date":1721126436000,"content":"Vaccine hesitancy has emerged as a significant barrier to achieving herd immunity and protecting populations from preventable diseases. Despite the proven effectiveness and safety of vaccines, many individuals remain hesitant or refuse to vaccinate themselves or their children. This review aims to identify the factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy, including misinformation, lack of trust in authorities, cultural beliefs, and access barriers. We also discuss the impact of vaccine hesitancy on public health, including outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases and erosion of trust in public health authorities. Furthermore, we present evidence-based communication strategies for addressing vaccine hesitancy, including building trust, providing accurate information, addressing myths and misconceptions, engaging with local influencers, and utilizing social media and digital platforms. By understanding the factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy and implementing effective communication strategies, healthcare providers, public health officials, and community leaders can work towards promoting widespread vaccine acceptance and protecting public health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc97ac82995365b4c307430470cc63260b3ed96ba371d1f69f870bbd6bad0396","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
