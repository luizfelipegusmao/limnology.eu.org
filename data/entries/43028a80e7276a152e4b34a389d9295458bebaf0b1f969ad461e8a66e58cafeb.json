To promote best catch-and-release practices, understanding the physical and physiological consequences of angling is critical. We assessed the injury and stress of striped bass captured using rod and reel spin and fly tackle in a New England embayment. During 2010–2011, of 95 striped bass captured, only one died immediately after release. Behavioral impairment measured through reflex action mortality predictors increased when hooked in the gullet or gills. While 11.6% were critically hooked (in gills, gullet, or eyes), hooking severity was not related to terminal tackle (lure or fly). However, the most severely impaired were all hooked with J hooks. Physiological stress indicators (sodium, chloride, blood lactate) increased with longer fight times. Our results suggested that different components of an angling event drove physiological and behavioral responses.</p>","author":"Lucas P. Griffin, \nHeather M. Hollema, \nJeff Kneebone, \nStephen D.
