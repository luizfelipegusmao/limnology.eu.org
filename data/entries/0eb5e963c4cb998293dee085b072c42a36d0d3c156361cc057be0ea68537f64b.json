The plant contains significant amounts of bio active compounds such as inulin, flavonoid, and oxyacetylene in its roots. These compounds are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and prediction properties. Traditionally used to alleviate digestive issues, this plant's potential in modern medicine should be further supported by scientific research. The study calls upon the scientific community to explore the potential applications of this endemic plant.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0eb5e963c4cb998293dee085b072c42a36d0d3c156361cc057be0ea68537f64b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
