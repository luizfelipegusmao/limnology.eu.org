{"title":"Innovative Diagnostic Solutions in Hemostasis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1128/v1","date":1728978255000,"content":"Hemostasis describes the process of blood clotting homeostasis. Hemostasis reflects a balance of procoagulant and anticoagulant mechanisms that aim to prevent both bleeding and thrombosis. If hemostasis is disrupted, and bleeding or thrombosis occur, then laboratory testing may ensue to either diagnose the reason for bleeding or thrombosis, or to manage patients under therapy or treatment for bleeding or thrombosis. A wide range of tests of hemostasis are available to laboratories and to clinicians from routine coagulation assays like prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to specialized assays for von Willebrand factor (VWF) and platelet function. In the current narrative review, we highlight some of the history of innovative diagnostic solutions such as the integration of chemiluminescence and flow cytometry in the hemostasis diagnostic armamentarium, as well as providing a glimpse to the possible future of diagnostic hemostasis testing. This review also emphasizes the importance of harmonization and standardization in hemostasis testing to reduce variability and improve diagnostic accuracy. Future directions include the potential for artificial intelligence in diagnostics, the development of more global test systems that can assess both primary and secondary hemostasis, and the innovations required to follow continuous evolution of therapies requiring precise monitoring. This review underscores the ongoing need for innovation to enhance the diagnostic landscape of hemostasis, ensuring better patient outcomes through more accurate and efficient diagnostic methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9199c202362a3b8718c44ca6cb1889aac0591c076a2fea18692c2e5542d88b2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
