{"title":"Age and growth of the blue shark Prionace glauca (Linnaeus, 1758) in the Ecuadorian Pacific: Bayesian multi‐models","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15755?af=R","date":1721274433000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The blue shark <i>Prionace glauca</i> plays a critical role as a predator in marine ecosystems but is threatened by by-catch. To obtain more precise biological data, a Bayesian approach was used, and 536 vertebrae samples collected during 1 year at the landing stage called “Playita Mía” Manta, Ecuador, were analysed. The objective was to estimate the age and growth parameters of the species. The size of the specimens varied between 116 and 310 cm in total length (TL). Using a Bayesian approach based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, growth parameters were evaluated. The von Bertalanffy model was the one that best fitted the data and provided more adequate estimates (females: L∞ = 325.50 cm, L0 = 53.23 cm, and <i>k</i> = 0.12 years; males: L∞ = 331.47 cm, L0 = 51.59 cm, <i>k</i> = 0.12 years −1; combined sexes: L∞ = 329.65 cm, L0 = 53.64 cm, <i>k</i> = 0.11 year−1). The results indicated that females and males have a similar growth, and that the species has a slow growth. Further studies using multi-model Bayesian approaches and covering a broader range of sizes in the Pacific Ocean are suggested. These studies will provide crucial information for the management and conservation of this species.</p>","author":"Suárez‐Aguilar Nicole, \nZambrano‐Cedeño Fernanda, \nKlever Mendoza‐Nieto, \nJesus Briones‐Mendoza","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"f881aa70ea1aed2a83407aff649a0ab6d4dc852a3e3899e66c62a14ea3f12454","category":"Environment"}
