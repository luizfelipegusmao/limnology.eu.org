{"title":"Sustainable Building Construction Materials in the United Arab Emirates: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0225/v1","date":1719910868000,"content":"The construction industry, a major player in economic development, is facing increased pressure to address sustainability concerns amidst rapid population growth and urbanization. With global projections indicating a significant rise in building demand by 2050 , sustainability emerges as a crucial focus area and paradigm shift to enhance environmental friendliness, improved quality, and project outcomes. The UAE, renowned for its vibrant construction industry, offers a unique context for examining the integration of sustainable practices. The growing use of sustainable construction practices is growing in the U.A.E., where the built environment plays a key role in economic growth and environmental stewardship.  \nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) aims to foster long-term sustainability while enhancing the standard of living for current as well as future generations by integrating social, environmental, and economic aspects within construction projects, while also reevaluating conventional sustainable development frameworks and embracing a Triple -Bottom Line approach. Through an exploration of the significance of sustainable construction materials, this researcher underscores the multifaceted benefits of locally sourced, recyclable, and renewable materials in reducing environmental impacts, fostering economic and social well-being, and improving overall project performance, and project management practices. The construction sector's role in economic development and its substantial environmental impact are discussed in, alignment with sustainable construction materials, sustainable construction practices, and the need to enhance environmental sustainability; and create healthier built environments. \nIn the realm of sustainable construction materials, project management knowledge areas encompass a range of factors. These include the properties of materials sourced regionally;, the incorporation of recycled content;, considerations for indoor air quality, energy, and water efficiency parameters;, and how these properties relate to project scope, scheduling constraints, and challenges. Additionally, the availability of resources and competency levels, quality control standards, specifications, communication strategies, and stakeholder involvement play crucial roles. It is important to assess both the positive and negative risks associated with these elements across construction projects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52551d51d77f2cc256c77047af47566c2a12cca79d2888fa0cec2f9f92f998c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
