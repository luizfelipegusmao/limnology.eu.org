{"title":"Cs02526 effector: A double-edged sword in mulberryâ€“pathogen interactions","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/27/7684229?rss=1","date":1716940800000,"content":"<span>For millions of years, there has been a subtle yet intense competition between pathogens and plants. Phytopathogens proliferate by usurping nutrients from plant tissues while host plants deploy diverse defense mechanisms to impede pathogen proliferation. Plants defend themselves using pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), initiating PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) to restrict pathogen growth. As a counter-response, phytopathogens translocate effector proteins into plant cells to sabotage the host cellular machinery and promote infection (<a href=\"#kiae309-B3\">Khan et al. 2018</a>). However, these effectors can be recognized by host cytosolic NOD-like receptors, activating effector-triggered immunity (<a href=\"#kiae309-B2\">Jones and Dangl 2006</a>; <a href=\"#kiae309-B1\">Cui et al. 2015</a>). Extensive studies have highlighted the crucial role of phytopathogen effectors in plant infestation, as these effectors target various host macromolecules and manipulate them through diverse enzymatic activities. Thus, understanding the effector function is crucial for developing novel strategies to manage plant diseases.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"80fca40be68b4b2598752bd96c230ccb18502fe02ad1463ae734c29178fea656","category":"Environment"}
