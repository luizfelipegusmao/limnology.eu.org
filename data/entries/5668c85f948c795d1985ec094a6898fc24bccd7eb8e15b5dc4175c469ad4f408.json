Epidemiologic data on seroprevalence, viremia prevalence and risk factors remain limited in sub-Saharan Africa. In Ghana, HCV-related deaths are estimated to have increased since 2015. Risk factors associated with HCV infection in Ghana are not well described. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of, and risk factors associated with hepatitis C virus infection in the Upper East Region located in the northern part of Ghana. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 9 communities in the Upper East region of Ghana. A total of 1,769 participants aged ≥12 years were screened for HCV antibody (anti-HCV) using rapid diagnostic testing (RDT). Seventy-four participants undertook HCV RNA testing after a positive anti-HCV result. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine risk factors associated with HCV seropositivity. The anti-HCV prevalence was 8.4%, with 149 out of 1,769 testing anti-HCV positive. Mean age (±SD) of seropositive persons was 45.4 (±16.3) years. The highest anti-HCV seroprevalence was amongst persons aged 60 years and above. Forty-four out of 74 (59.5%) seropositive cases had viremic infection and the estimated viremic prevalence in the screened population was 5.0%. Predictors of HCV seropositivity were age (OR 1.03 95% CI 1.01–1.04), history of female genital mutilation or circumcision (OR 1.63 95% CI 1.04–2.55), sexual activity (OR 2.57 95% CI 1.38–4.79), positive maternal HCV status (OR 10.38 95% CI 4.13–26.05) and positive HIV status (OR 4.03 95% CI 1.35–12.05). In conclusion, the Upper East Region demonstrates a high Hepatitis C antibody prevalence. Almost 60% of individuals have viremic infection, however the cost of RNA testing is a barrier to virological diagnosis. There is a need to educate the population about HCV-associated risk factors to reduce HCV transmission and burden of disease.","author":"Ampem Darko Jnr Siaw","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5668c85f948c795d1985ec094a6898fc24bccd7eb8e15b5dc4175c469ad4f408","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
