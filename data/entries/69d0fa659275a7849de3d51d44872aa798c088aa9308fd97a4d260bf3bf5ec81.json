{"title":"Phylogeny and taxonomic revision of Metacephalus (Insecta: Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) with description of seven new leafhopper species","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae090/7796692?rss=1","date":1727654400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Metacephalus</span><a href=\"#CIT0007\">Delong and Martinson, 1973</a> includes leafhopper species from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador (new record), Guyana, French Guiana (new record), Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. In the present revisionary study, we describe seven new species of <span>Metacephalus</span>, propose one species synonymy (<span>M. cinctus</span> as junior synonym of <span>M. facetus</span>), and provide new country records for species, considerably expanding knowledge about species distributions. The study also provides redescriptions and photographs of diagnostic characters for 12 previously described valid species and an identification key to all 21 species of <span>Metacephalus</span>. Molecular phylogenies of <span>Metacephalus</span> species are hypothesized based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses of 1,387â€…bp of mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I and 16S rDNA and nuclear histone H3. Results of the molecular phylogeny generated herein provided a base for understanding character homologies when presenting morphological diagnoses of <span>Metacephalus</span> species and exposed a high level of convergent characters in color pattern and male genitalia morphology usually used in morphological taxonomy of this group of leafhoppers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"69d0fa659275a7849de3d51d44872aa798c088aa9308fd97a4d260bf3bf5ec81","category":"Environment"}
