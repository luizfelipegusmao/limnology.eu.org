{"title":"Salvage Therapy with Rezafungin for Candida parapsilosis Spondylodiscitis: a Case Report from Expanded Access Program","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1015/v1","date":1713277456000,"content":"Candida spondylodiscitis (CS) is a rare disease, for which therapeutic option are limited to fluconazole or echinocandins and the treatment should be administered up to 12 months. In case of reduced azole susceptibility, there is a scarcity of therapeutic options with adequate bone penetration and limited toxicity.\nWe report the first case of successful use of rezafungin for a spondylodiscitis due to Candida parapsilosis with reduced susceptibility to azoles.\nThe patient, affected by paraplegia and short bowel syndrome, was diagnosed with CS with culture on vertebral biopsy guided by a 18-FDG-PET/CT scan. He received rezafungin 200 mg weekly for 26 weeks, after 10 weeks of previous antifungal treatment. He had a full clinical, radiologic and biochemical response to the therapy with rezafungin, with no adverse effects.\nRezafungin is a promising therapy for Candida osteomyelitis, especially when first line therapies are ineffective or contraindicated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf438589413dc8696ef80dfc1f302249c6392c2086f705a1c6bafbac1a559ecb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
