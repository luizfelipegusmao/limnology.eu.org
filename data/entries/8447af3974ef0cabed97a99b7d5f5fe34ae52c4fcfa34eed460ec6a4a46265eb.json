{"title":"Maximizing Synergy: The Benefits of a Joint Implementation of Knowledge Management and Artificial Intelligence Systems Standards","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0777/v1","date":1723450914000,"content":"In response to the increasing importance of knowledge as a key competitive advantage, the role of knowledge management in value creation cannot be overstated. The International Standards Organization (ISO) has recognized this and announced a Management Standard for Knowledge Management Systems (KMS). This initiative is significant because, by viewing knowledge strategically, organizations are seeking ways to enhance their processes and align them to address their challenges. A synergistic effect can be achieved when another management system highly relevant to KMS is joined and later integrated. This new system is Artificial Intelligence Management (AIMS). The paper is structured as follows: Firstly, we explore knowledge and knowledge management (KM), along with the challenges companies face in implementing and operating KM. Next, we examine the ISO 30401:2018 standard as a guide for KM implementation. Finally, we discuss how ISO 30401:2018 and ISO/IEC 42001:2023 can help solve key organizational problems and support machine learning and knowledge extraction through AI. In conclusion, we summarize the key outcomes of the paper. The main purpose of the paper is to determine how these standards contribute to solving practical problems in the creation and development of a knowledge management system supported by artificial intelligence and to demonstrate their synergistic effect when used together.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8447af3974ef0cabed97a99b7d5f5fe34ae52c4fcfa34eed460ec6a4a46265eb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
