{"title":"Modelling of the Evapotranspiration Portion Calculation of the Water Footprint: A Global Sensitivity Analysis in the Brazilian Serra Ga&uacute;cha","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1413/v1","date":1711350201000,"content":"Water footprint has been widely used to illustrate the consumption of water in many situations; for instance, in products, processes or regions of interest. In this work, we analyzed – using a sensitivity analysis approach – the effect of some variables in the calculation of the water footprint in the viticulture in Brazilian Serra Gaúcha (the major producing region of Brazilian Wine).The classical Penman-Monteith model for evapotransporation was considered, with uncertainties in some parameters (dead mulch covering fraction in the vineyard, maximum temperatures for some months, altitudes and latitudes of the site). The sensitivity analysis was conducted using the SAFE toolbox under Octave framework. The results indicated that the the portion of the water footprint corresponding to the evapotranspiration is more sensitive to the values of mulch covering fraction and the altitude of the site in comparison with the latitude and the maximum temperatures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea2d83d09ec60a2124dc0cdaa5042437b90c1e84d1cd3c51e1d105a1c2b552a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
