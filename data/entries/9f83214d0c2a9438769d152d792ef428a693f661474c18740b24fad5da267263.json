{"title":"Functional, Chemical and Phytotoxic Characteristics of Cestrum parqui L&rsquo;Herit: An Overview","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0979/v1","date":1718347159000,"content":"Cestrum parqui L'Herit. (Solanaceae family) is a species of forest shrub, self-incompatible and specialized in pollination, widespread in the subtropical area of the planet and now widely dis-tributed also in the Mediterranean area. The constituents of its leaves have antimicrobial, anti-cancer, insecticidal, antifeedant, and herbicidal properties. The spread of this species represents a valuable source of compounds with high biological value. Research on potential uses, under-standing of the nutritional and functional composition, and applications of C. parqui extracts is important and very promising for its commercial use. To date, there are some reports on the potential applications of C. parqui extracts as selective natural pesticides and for their potential phytotoxic role. Scientific knowledge and the use of extraction techniques for these components are essential for commercial applications. This article summarizes the research and recent studies available on the botany, phytochemistry, functional properties, and commercial applications of C. parqui as a biopesticide.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f83214d0c2a9438769d152d792ef428a693f661474c18740b24fad5da267263","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
