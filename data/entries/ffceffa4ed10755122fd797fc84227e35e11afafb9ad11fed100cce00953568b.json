{"title":"A 6-Months Outcome of Hypertensive Crisis According to Risk Factors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1850/v1","date":1714355854000,"content":"Aim To explore the impact of cardiovascular risk factors on the type and outcome of hypertensive crises. Additionally, to investigate the occurrence of new cardiovascular events in a six-month period for both types of hypertensive crises and to define possible risk factors that may influence this.Method The data from the hospital electronic medical records of  patients who presented with hypertensive crises at the Emergency Medicine Clinic of the Clinical Center of the University of Sarajevo over a six-month period were retrospectively collected. Pregnant women were excluded. Patients who died before completing the diagnostic examination as well as patients with incomplete data were also excluded. Data collection encompassed blood pressure levels, age, sex, history of chronic hypertension, smoking status, and presence of diabetes mellitus as cardiovascular risk factors. Outcomes after initial admission and after 6 months follow up were recorded. Results The study included 243 patients: 66 (27.2%) with hypertensive emergencies and 177 (72.8%) with hypertensive urgencies. There was no significant difference between these groups in age, history of chronic hypertension, presence of dyslipidemia, smoking status, and presence of diabetes mellitus (p&gt;0.05). Men predominated in HE, while women predominated in HU group (p&lt;0.05). Diastolic blood pressure values were higher in HE patients (p&lt;0.05). 98.3% of HU patients were discharged, while 92.4% of HE patients were hospitalized. Mortality after initial admission was 3%, all of whom were hypertensive emergencies. After a 6-month follow-up, there was no significant difference in the number of readmissions between these two groups (p&gt;0.05), but mortality was significantly higher in hypertensive emergencies (15.15% vs 6.21%) (p&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in the investigated risk factors between patients without readmissions, with readmissions without fatal outcomes, and deceased patients (p&gt;0.05) except for age, which was significantly higher in patients with fatal outcomes (p&lt;0.05).Conclusion Male sex and higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are identified as risk factors for hypertensive emergency (HE), suggesting a higher likelihood of hospital treatment and increased intrahospital mortality. Patients with HE also exhibit a higher risk of a lethal outcome within six months. Advanced age is associated with an increased risk of six-month readmission and a lethal outcome.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ffceffa4ed10755122fd797fc84227e35e11afafb9ad11fed100cce00953568b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
