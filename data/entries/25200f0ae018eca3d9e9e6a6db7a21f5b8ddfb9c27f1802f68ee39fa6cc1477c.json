{"title":"Does the esv3587290 Copy-Number Variation in the VANGL1 Gene Differ as a Genetic Factor for Developing Nephritis in Mexican Childhood-Onset Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Patients?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0040/v2","date":1717568725000,"content":"A ~3-kb deletion-type DNA copy-number variation (CNV, esv3587290) located at intron 7 of the VANGL1 gene (1p13.1, MIM*610132) has been proposed as a genetic factor for developing lupus nephritis (LN) in adult systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients across European-descent populations, but its replication in other ethnicities has been inconsistent and its association with LN in childhood-onset SLE (cSLE) remains unknown. Here, we performed an exploratory association study in a sample of 66 unrelated cSLE Mexican patients (11 males, 55 females; ages 7.8 to 18.6 years). Two stratified groups were compared: cSLE patients with (N=39) or without (N=27) LN, as diagnosed by renal biopsy (N=17), proteinuria (N=33), urinary protein:creatinine ratio &gt;0.2 (N=34), and erythrocyturia and/or granular casts in urinary sediment (N=16). For esv3587290 CNV genotyping, we performed an end-point PCR assay with breakpoint confirmation by Sanger sequencing. We also determined the allelic frequencies of the esv3587290 CNV in 181 deidentified ethnically-matched individuals (reference group). The obtained genotypes were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) by c2 test. Associations between LN and esv3587290 CNV were tested by calculating the Odds Ratio (OR) and using Pearson's c2 tests with a 95% confidence interval and Pâ‰¤0.05. The esv3587290 CNV allele (OR 0.108, 95% CI 0.034-0.33, P=0.00003) and the heterozygous genotype (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.119-0.9811, P=0.002) showed a significant protective effect against LN development. Finally, we characterized the precise breakpoint of the esv3587290 CNV as NG_016548.1(NM_138959.3):c.1314+1339_1315-897del (https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/variants/0000918418#00025811) in our population. This report supports the notion that a broad genetic heterogeneity underlies the susceptibility for developing LN.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25200f0ae018eca3d9e9e6a6db7a21f5b8ddfb9c27f1802f68ee39fa6cc1477c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
