{"title":"Involvement of RIPK1 in Alopecia Areata","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0082/v1","date":1725263839000,"content":"We have previously demonstrated that receptor-interacting serine threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) is expressed in hair follicle and regulates hair cycle. RIPK1 inhibitors also accelerated the telogen-to-anagen transition and elongated the anagen period in the mouse model. Here, we first investigated the involvement of RIPK1 in alopecia areata (AA). mRNA and protein expression of RIPK1 was increased in the skin of AA mouse model. Single cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry showed that RIPK1 is highly increased in dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8+ T cells. RIPK1 inhibitors (i.e., Necrostatin-1s and GSK2982772) delayed the onset of AA in mouse model, and reduced the DCs and CD8+ T cells in AA skin. RIPK1 inhibitors also increased the hair length in the mouse hair organ culture mimicking AA. Collectively, these results suggest that RIPK1 is involved in AA onset via modulating immune cells, and RIPK1 inhibitors could prevent AA onset.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a249eccbaf30bc2a3152dbe9c839fd96f9484d37fc5e1f94c62cef581e71ce6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
