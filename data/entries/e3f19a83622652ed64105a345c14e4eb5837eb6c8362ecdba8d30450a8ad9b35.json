Rohan</p>\r\n\r\nChlorpyrifos is an organophosphate pesticide associated with numerous health effects including motor performance decrements. While many studies have focused on the health effects following acute chlorpyrifos poisonings, almost no studies have examined the effects on motoneurons following occupational-like exposures. The main objective of this study was to examine the broad effects of repeated occupational-like chlorpyrifos exposures on spinal motoneuron soma size relative to motor activity. To execute our objective, adult rats were exposed to chlorpyrifos via oral gavage once a day, five days a week for two weeks. Chlorpyrifos exposure effects were assessed either three days or two months following the last exposure. Three days following the last repeated chlorpyrifos exposure, there were transient effects in open-field motor activity and plasma cholinesterase activity levels. Two months following the chlorpyrifos exposures, there were delayed effects in sensorimotor gating, pro-inflammatory cytokines and spinal lumbar motoneuron soma morphology. Overall, these results offer support that subacute repeated occupational-like chlorpyrifos exposures have both short-term and longer-term effects in motor activity, inflammation, and central nervous system mechanisms.","author":"Shannon H.
