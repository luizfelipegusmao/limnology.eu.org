{"title":"Modeling the Surface Thermal Discomfort Index (STDI) in a Tropical Environments using Multi Sensors: A Case Study of East Kalimantan, The Future New Capital City of Indonesia","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12524-024-01919-w","date":1722470400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Thermal Discomfort Index has traditionally relied on parameters such as air temperature and relative humidity, obtained either from meteorological ground stations or through land-physical approaches estimated independently by satellites. These methods often fall short in adequately capturing both seasonal and detailed local spatial variations. This study addresses these limitations by establishing the Surface Thermal Discomfort Index (STDI), a composite of the Meteorological Discomfort Index (MDI) and the Discomfort Index over the land surface (DI<sub>-Land</sub>). Focused on Ibu Kota Negara Nusantara (IKN) in East Kalimantan and neighboring cities, MDI is derived from reanalysis data (ERA5-Land), validated with ground station data, while DI<sub>-Land</sub> is produced primarily from Landsat-8. An equal weighting factor was applied to MDI and DI<sub>-Land</sub> for estimating STDI. Results indicate that STDI captures both seasonal and spatial variations, reaching peak level in May and October, and hitting a low point in July. The spatial distribution of STDI is influenced by landuse types. In 2023, IKN experienced an STDI of 26.2 °C, while Balikpapan and Samarinda recorded at 26.5 and 26.4 °C, respectively. Compared to previous study in Jakarta, IKN and neighboring cities’s STDI are higher up to 0.2 °C, remaining within the partially comfortable range in the tropics. Projecting IKN’s development until 2045, an annual MDI increase of 0.01 °C is anticipated. Moreover, a 4% rise in built-up areas is expected to elevate STDI by 0.1–0.2 °C. This study provides insights into the thermal discomfort status in cities across East Kalimantan, anticipating a gradual increase in discomfort levels during the development of IKN.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"99af5202aa2d851aa6196fae43083d659f2ad0ea6c88edbacfa7745c621f8334","category":"Environment"}
