This study examined the occurrence of MRSA, their ability to form biofilms, <i>agr</i> typing, and the antibiotic resistance profiles of biofilm-forming MRSA strains isolated from environmental surfaces at Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). From 120 swab samples, 86 (71.67%) tested positive for <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i>. MRSA was identified in 86 isolates using the disk diffusion technique, and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 56 (65.1%) isolates were confirmed to carry the <i>mecA</i> gene. The Crystal Violet Microtiter Plate (CVMP) test revealed that 80.35% (45 isolates) were biofilm-forming and 19.6% (11 isolates) were non-biofilm-forming. Out of 45 biofilm producer isolates 37.5% and 42.9% isolates exhibited strong and intermediate biofilm-forming characteristics, respectively. Molecular analysis revealed that 17.78% of MRSA isolates carried at least one gene related to biofilm formation, specifically <i>icaA</i>, <i>icaB</i>, and <i>icaD</i> genes were discovered in 13.33%, 8.89%, 6.67% of the MRSA isolates, respectively. In <i>agr</i> typing, the most prevalent group was <i>agr</i> I (71.11%), followed by group III (17.78%) and group II (11.11%). Group IV was not detected. The distribution of <i>agr</i> gene groups showed a significant difference among biofilm-forming isolates (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In <i>agr</i> group I, 18.75% of isolates carried the <i>icaA</i> gene, 12.5% carried the <i>icaB</i> gene, and 9.37% carried the <i>icaD</i> gene. Biofilm-forming genes were not detected in any of the isolates from <i>agr</i> groups II or III. There are no statistically significant differences between <i>agr</i> groups and the presence of these genes (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Antibiotic resistance varied significantly among <i>agr</i> groups, with <i>agr</i> group I displaying the highest resistance, <i>agr</i> group II, and <i>agr</i> group III exhibiting the least resistance (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Seventy-three (73.3%) of the isolates were multi-drug resistant, with <i>agr</i> group I displaying nineteen MDR patterns. The occurrence of MRSA in hospital environments and their capacity to form biofilm raises concerns for public health. These findings support the importance of further research focused on <i>agr</i> quorum sensing systems as a basis for developing novel antibacterial agents.","author":"Sabrina Sultana Rimi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7266e80d2a3936b066fcf8aeb70626bfbb8f9191f276c5709a3b32489ba4be5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
