{"title":"NMY-2, TOE-2 and PIG-1 regulate <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> asymmetric cell divisions","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304064","date":1716559200000,"content":"<p>by Joseph Robinson, Jerome Teuliere, Shinja Yoo, Gian Garriga</p>\r\n\r\nAsymmetric cell division is an important mechanism that generates cellular diversity during development. Not only do asymmetric cell divisions produce daughter cells of different fates, but many can also produce daughters of different sizes, which we refer to as Daughter Cell Size Asymmetry (DCSA). In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, apoptotic cells are frequently produced by asymmetric divisions that exhibit DCSA, where the smaller daughter dies. We focus here on the divisions of the Q.a and Q.p neuroblasts, which produce larger surviving cells and smaller apoptotic cells and divide with opposite polarity using both distinct and overlapping mechanisms. Several proteins regulate DCSA in these divisions. Previous studies showed that the PIG-1/MELK and TOE-2 proteins regulate DCSA in both the Q.a and Q.p divisions, and the non-muscle myosin NMY-2 regulates DCSA in the Q.a division but not the Q.p division. In this study, we examined endogenously tagged NMY-2, TOE-2, and PIG-1 reporters and characterized their distribution at the cortex during the Q.a and Q.p divisions. In both divisions, TOE-2 localized toward the side of the dividing cell that produced the smaller daughter, whereas PIG-1 localized toward the side that produced the larger daughter. As previously reported, NMY-2 localized to the side of Q.a that produced the smaller daughter and did not localize asymmetrically in Q.p. We used temperature-sensitive <i>nmy-2</i> mutants to determine the role of <i>nmy-2</i> in these divisions and were surprised to find that these mutants only displayed DCSA defects in the Q.p division. We generated double mutant combinations between the <i>nmy-2</i> mutations and mutations in <i>toe-2</i> and <i>pig-1</i>. Because previous studies indicate that DCSA defects result in the transformation of cells fated to die into their sister cells, the finding that the <i>nmy-2</i> mutations did not significantly alter the Q.a and Q.p DCSA defects of <i>toe-2</i> and <i>pig-1</i> mutants but did alter the number of daughter cells produced by Q.a and Q.p suggests that <i>nmy-2</i> plays a role in specifying the fates of the Q.a and Q.p that is independent of its role in DCSA.","author":"Joseph Robinson","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a96511c24777dbff24e99de7e95a113843403867303c8bbd27352b1a32819ca3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
