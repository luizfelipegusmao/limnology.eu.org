{"title":"2 Number of spot samples required when using the GreenFeed System in grazing beef cows","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/77/7618024?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) production from beef cattle occurs through a natural digestive process called enteric fermentation. This has increasingly become an area of focus due to environmental and efficiency concerns. There are several techniques to quantify gas fluxes from beef cattle such as an open circuit gas quantification system (OCGQS). The GreenFeed (C-Lock, Inc.) is an OCGQS, which has been validated in previous literature, that is capable of quantifying CH<sub>4</sub>, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) from grazing beef cattle. However, few studies have reported the minimum number of spot samples to quantify gas fluxes from an individual animal, particularly in a grazing environment. No recommendations have been made to evaluate the number of spot samples for the calculation of metabolic heat production, using the gas fluxes quantified by an OCGQS. A minimum of 100 spot samples each were collected from 17 grazing animals using an OCGQS. The mean gas fluxes were computed starting from the first 10 visits (forward) and increasing by increments of 10 until 100 visits was reached and also from visit 100 moving back in time in increments of 10 (reverse). Mean gas fluxes were used to calculate individual animal metabolic heat production for each interval with both the forward and reverse approach. Pearson and Spearman correlations were computed between the full 100 visits and each shortened visit interval. Mean forward and reverse gas fluxes and metabolic heat production were also computed starting at 30 visits and increasing by 2 until 40 visits and vice versa. The minimum number of spot samples was determined when correlations with the full 100 visits were greater than 0.95. The minimum number of spot samples needed for accurate quantification of CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and metabolic heat production were 38, 40, 40, and 36, respectively. Simultaneous collection of gas fluxes for the calculation of metabolic heat production would require at least 40 spot samples given the recommendations for gas flux components. Animals had an average of 1.2 visits/day to the OCGQS in this study. Therefore, animals met the required number of spot samples for quantification of metabolic heat production, CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub> in 29.5 ± 8.7, 30.5 ± 9.1, 31.8 ± 9.2, and 31.8 ± 9.2 d, respectively. There was large variation in the number of days needed to achieve the recommended number of spot samples. For this reason, protocols for the OCGQS should be based on the total number of spot samples, rather than a test duration. These recommendations can be applied to grazing cattle that typically have more infrequent visits. More research is needed to establish if the minimum number of spot samples would be fewer if animals have more frequent visits, although this is difficult in grazing settings.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"dd861420446bcb82ce2c546b5847e65209109421758ec1242632541253f1efc0","category":"Environment"}
