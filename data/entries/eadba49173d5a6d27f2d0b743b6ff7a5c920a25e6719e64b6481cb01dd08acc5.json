Three experiments were conducted in this study: Exp 1: cells were treated with control, DON (0.5 ppm) or LPS (10 ug/mL) individually and combination of DON and LPS for 24 h, then measure the Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and interleukin 8 (IL8) production in medium and measure the transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) and FITC-dextran passage rate at the end of each experiment. 2) Treat the cells with control or DON for 24 h, then split the two groups for control or LPS treatment for additional 24 h; same measurements were taken as in experiment 1; 3) Treat the cells with control or LPS for 24 h, then split the two groups for control or DON treatment for additional 24 h; same measurements were taken as in previous experiments. In each experiment, six replications were done. Data were analyzed for the effect of DON, LPS and their interaction. Treatments did not affect the LDH in all experiments except for the high LDH release in the treatment of LPS followed by DON in experiment 3. In experiment 1, DON, LPS or combination of DON and LPS significantly reduced the TEER value by 15.1%, 21.7% and 23.9% respectively with only DON has effect on FITC-dextran passage rate (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). LPS significantly increased IL8 secretion in the medium (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). In experiment 2, DON or LPS decreased TEER value whereas the cells treated with DON before were more susceptible to LPS (23.6% more reduction compared without DON treatment before). Similarly, the FITC-dextran passage rate was also increased by LPS in the cells exposed to DON before (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). In addition, LPS significantly increased IL8 secretion no matter the cells was exposed to DON before. In experiment 3, DON or LPS decreased TEER value (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) and cells treated with LPS before were more susceptible to DON (11.8% more reduction compared with no LPS treatment before). However, only DON increased FITC-dextran passage rate. The secretion of IL8 increased by DON or LPS with greatest secretion when cells treated with DON which exposed to LPS before (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the results suggested that cells were more susceptible to LPS when the cells were exposed to DON before or vice versa, and the synergetic effect is limited when LPS and DON were added to cells simultaneously.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"eadba49173d5a6d27f2d0b743b6ff7a5c920a25e6719e64b6481cb01dd08acc5","category":"Environment"}
