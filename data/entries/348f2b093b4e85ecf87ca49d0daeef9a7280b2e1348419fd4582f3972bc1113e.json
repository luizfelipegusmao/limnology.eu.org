{"title":"Transcription factors BZR1 and PAP1 cooperate to promote anthocyanin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis shoots","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3654/7692851?rss=1","date":1718236800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Anthocyanins play critical roles in protecting plant tissues against diverse stresses. The complicated regulatory networks induced by various environmental factors modulate the homeostatic level of anthocyanins. Here, we show that anthocyanin accumulation is induced by brassinosteroids (BRs) in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) shoots and shed light on the underlying regulatory mechanism. We observed that anthocyanin levels are altered considerably in BR-related mutants, and BRs induce anthocyanin accumulation by upregulating the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. Our genetic analysis indicated that BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) and PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT 1 (PAP1) are essential for BR-induced anthocyanin accumulation. The BR-responsive transcription factor BZR1 directly binds to the <span>PAP1</span> promoter, regulating its expression. In addition, we found that intense anthocyanin accumulation caused by the <span>pap1-D</span>-dominant mutation is significantly reduced in BR mutants, implying that BR activity is required for PAP1 function after <span>PAP1</span> transcription. Moreover, we demonstrated that BZR1 physically interacts with PAP1 to cooperatively regulate the expression of PAP1-target genes, such as <span>TRANSPARENT TESTA 8</span>, <span>DIHYDROFLAVONOL 4-REDUCTASE</span>, and <span>LEUKOANTHOCYANIDIN DIOXYGENASE</span>. Our findings indicate that BZR1 functions as an integral component of the PAP1-containing transcription factor complex, contributing to increased anthocyanin biosynthesis. Notably, we also show that functional interaction of BZR1 with PAP1 is required for anthocyanin accumulation induced by low nitrogen stress. Taken together, our results demonstrate that BR-regulated BZR1 promotes anthocyanin biosynthesis through cooperative interaction with PAP1 of the MBW complex.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"348f2b093b4e85ecf87ca49d0daeef9a7280b2e1348419fd4582f3972bc1113e","category":"Environment"}
