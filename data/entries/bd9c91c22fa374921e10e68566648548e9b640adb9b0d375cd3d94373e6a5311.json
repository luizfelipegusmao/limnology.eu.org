{"title":"COVID-19 Therapeutics Use by Social Deprivation in England, July 2020&ndash;April 2023","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1157/v1","date":1710934271000,"content":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has disproportionately affected certain demographics in England, exacerbating existing health disparities. Effective therapeutics are a critical line of defence against COVID-19, particularly for patients at elevated risk for severe disease. Surveillance systems were established to monitor usage of COVID-19 therapeutics in hospital and community settings and inform stewardship.  Three antiviral therapies: nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (Paxlovid®), remdesivir (Veklury®), and molnupiravir (Lagevrio®); and two neutralising monoclonal antibody therapies (nMAbs): sotrovimab (Xevudy®) and casirivimab with imdevimab (Ronapreve®); were in use in England between July 2020 to April 2023. This paper aims to illuminate trends in the utilisation of COVID-19 therapeutics treatment in both hospital and community settings, stratified by the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) in England. Chapter 3 of the English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance (ESPAUR) report 2022 to 2023 also discusses the epidemiological surveillance of these five directly-acting antiviral COVID-19 therapeutics use in England between 2022 to 2023.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd9c91c22fa374921e10e68566648548e9b640adb9b0d375cd3d94373e6a5311","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
