{"title":"Exploring the Relationship Between Telomere Length and Cognitive Changes in post-COVID-19 Subjects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0276/v1","date":1725512118000,"content":"Emerging evidence suggests that patients suffering from COVID-19 may experience neurocognitive symptoms. Besides, other studies indicate a probable association between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and neurocognitive changes in subjects with post-COVID-19 condition. Our study was designed to determine the correlation between telomere length and cognitive changes in subjects post-COVID-19. The study included 256 subjects, categorized based on SARS-CoV-2 infection from 2020 to 2023. On the other hand, those subjects who have a psychiatric diagnosis are considered. Besides, the MoCA and MMSE scales were applied. Telomere length was determined using a Polymerase Chain Reaction, and statistical analysis was employed ANOVA and X2 tests. We identified a decrease in LTL in individuals with post-COVID-19 conditions compared to those without SARS-CoV-2 infection (pâ‰¤0.05). However, no association was found between LTL and cognitive impairment in subjects post-COVID-19. The findings suggest that LTL is affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, this important finding requires further research by monitoring neurological changes in subjects with post-COVID condition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"448b7924c0186e735b5722d5cd9c8993b8b39343c5741ed4aee73d54b1122f40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
