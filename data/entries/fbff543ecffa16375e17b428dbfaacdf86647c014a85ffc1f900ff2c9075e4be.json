The accumulation of elements in the whitefish’s organs and tissues depends to a lesser extent on higher concentrations of toxic elements and the physiological state in water and to a greater extent on the tolerance thereto. The element redistribution in the whitefish’s liver and kidney in terms of its physiological state is modeled. The adaptive response strategy is observed most clearly in changes in iron and zinc metabolism.</p>\n                  </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"fbff543ecffa16375e17b428dbfaacdf86647c014a85ffc1f900ff2c9075e4be","category":"Environment"}
