{"title":"Gibberellin dynamics governing nodulation revealed using GIBBERELLIN PERCEPTION SENSOR 2 in Medicago truncatula lateral organs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4442/7714829?rss=1","date":1721088000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>During nutrient scarcity, plants can adapt their developmental strategy to maximize their chance of survival. Such plasticity in development is underpinned by hormonal regulation, which mediates the relationship between environmental cues and developmental outputs. In legumes, endosymbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) is a key adaptation for supplying the plant with nitrogen in the form of ammonium. Rhizobia are housed in lateral root-derived organs termed nodules that maintain an environment conducive to Nitrogenase in these bacteria. Several phytohormones are important for regulating the formation of nodules, with both positive and negative roles proposed for gibberellin (GA). In this study, we determine the cellular location and function of bioactive GA during nodule organogenesis using a genetically encoded second-generation GA biosensor, GIBBERELLIN PERCEPTION SENSOR 2 in <span>Medicago truncatula</span>. We find endogenous bioactive GA accumulates locally at the site of nodule primordia, increasing dramatically in the cortical cell layers, persisting through cell divisions, and maintaining accumulation in the mature nodule meristem. We show, through misexpression of GA-catabolic enzymes that suppress GA accumulation, that GA acts as a positive regulator of nodule growth and development. Furthermore, increasing or decreasing GA through perturbation of biosynthesis gene expression can increase or decrease the size of nodules, respectively. This is unique from lateral root formation, a developmental program that shares common organogenesis regulators. We link GA to a wider gene regulatory program by showing that nodule-identity genes induce and sustain GA accumulation necessary for proper nodule formation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"0466c4b609fd1e97969fab12074750f24d1a56ba82188558674eebd95bbca087","category":"Environment"}
