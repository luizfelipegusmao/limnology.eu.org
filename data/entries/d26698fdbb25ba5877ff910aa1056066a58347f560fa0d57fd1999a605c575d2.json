{"title":"Evaluation of Facial Aesthetic Changes After Treatment with Herbst or Elastodontics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1070/v1","date":1728905042000,"content":"Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate the facial profile changes of patients treated for class II skeletal malocclusions with the Elastodontic appliance compared to those treated with the Herbst appliance and a control group.\n\nMethods: Forty class II patients were treated using the Elastodontic appliance (Group EA) and were compared with 40 patients treated with a Herbst appliance (Group H) and with 40 untreated class II children (Group C). Aesthetic profile variables were analysed using Arnett's analysis. Cephalograms were compared pre-treatment (T0) and post-treatment (T1). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test or paired-samples t-test were used for pairwise comparison of cephalometric measurements taken at T0 and T1. One-way ANOVA and Tuckey's post-hoc test were performed to assess differences between the groups.\n\nResults: In Group C, from T0 to T1, the LL-TVL distance and POG'-TVL distance decreased. In the EA group, the 1+SN angle increased from T0 to T1, while the POG'-TVL and B'-TVL distances decreased. In Group H from T0 to T1, the POG'-TVL, B'-TVL, LL-TVL, and 1+SN measurements decreased while 1-GOME (IMPA) increased. There were significant differences on ANOVA in 1+SN, IMPA, 1+TVL, LL-TVL, and UL-TVL. Compared to Group C, 1+SN and UL-TVL were lower in Group H, while IMPA and 1+TVL were higher in group H. Compared to the EA group, 1+SN and UL-TVL were lower in the H Group, while IMPA and LL-TVL were higher in the H Group.\n\nConclusion: The profile changes achieved by both devices are favourable for correcting class II skeletal malocclusion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d26698fdbb25ba5877ff910aa1056066a58347f560fa0d57fd1999a605c575d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
