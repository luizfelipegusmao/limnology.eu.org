{"title":"Present and Future Applications of Digital PCR in Infectious Diseases Diagnosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1182/v1","date":1710919471000,"content":"A Infectious diseases account for about 3 million deaths per year. The advent of molecular techniques has led to an enormous improvement in their diagnosis, both in terms of sensitivity and specificity and in terms of the speed with which a clinically useful result can be obtained. Digital PCR, or 3rd generation PCR, is based on a series of technical modifications that result in more sensitive techniques, more resistant to the action of inhibitors and capable of direct quantification, without the need for standard curves.This review presents the main applications that have been developed for the diagnosis of viral, bacterial and parasitic infections, and the potential prospects for the clinical use of this technology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d98bca427445cac2c3a333dc80e8ad983149d3b944c12af829e247cf7304351b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
