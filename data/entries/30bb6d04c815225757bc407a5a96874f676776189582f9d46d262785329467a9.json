Traditionally, EDX/EELS tomography requires high radiation doses (e.g., &gt; 10<sup>7</sup> e/Å<sup>2</sup>) that often exceed the threshold of specimen stability, especially for core excitation spectroscopy. The recent advent of fused multi-modal electron microscopy introduces opportunities to minimize the high dosage requirements [<a href=\"#ozae044.126-B3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.126-B4\">4</a>]. Moreover, combining fused multi-modal microscopy with electron tomography results in three-dimensional chemical analysis of materials with significantly lower electron doses—up to a hundredfold less [<a href=\"#ozae044.126-B4\">4</a>]. Here we show fused multi-modal tomography also improves chemical accuracy and provides stoichiometry without prior knowledge of elemental inelastic cross-sections.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"30bb6d04c815225757bc407a5a96874f676776189582f9d46d262785329467a9","category":"Environment"}
