{"title":"Chronic effect of copper on biology, immunity, and biochemical assessment of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera; Noctuidae) in laboratory bioassays","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/3/457/7639483?rss=1","date":1712102400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Although copper is an essential element for any organism’s well-being, it becomes toxic if present in excess. In the present study, copper was provisioned at 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg in an artificial diet and fed to juvenile larvae of cotton bollworm, <span>Helicoverpa armigera</span> (Lepidoptera; Noctuidae), for 4 generations. The results of this investigation exhibited shortening of larval life in the first 2 generations, but extended duration was observed in third and fourth generations compared to controls, and dietary copper caused reduced total hemocyte counts in all treatments. The number of immunocytes (i.e., granulocytes and plasmatocytes) were also significantly reduced. The changes in activities of certain important enzymes, including catalase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidases, were seen. Furthermore, after treatment, an increase in the activity of 2 detoxifying enzymes, glutathione s-transferase and acetylcholinesterase, was observed. It is clear that metallothioneins are important in maintaining essential and nonessential metal ion homeostasis. While copper is typically regarded as an important essential metal in an organism’s life, excessive amounts can have deteriorating effects. This heavy metal is being used as a nano-based pesticide. Therefore, the present investigation aims to determine the fate of Cu in insects receiving them in new formulations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"342f21e66088f331e1b9c75e2c2007e589019127d0b3c3ef43927034a48d088b","category":"Environment"}
