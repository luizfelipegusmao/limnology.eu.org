{"title":"Association of Vitamin A and Iron Supplementation on Major Clinical of Infectious Diseases in Ghanaian Children: A Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1911/v1","date":1721817133000,"content":"Background: The utilization of nutrient supplementation as a tool to address issues such as iron and vitamin A deficiencies among children in Sub–Saharan Africa (SSA) has been beneficial. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of evidence on the effect of vitamin A and iron supplementation on infectious diseases in pre–school children in SSA. We aimed to assess the association of vitamin A and iron supplementation on the incidence of major clinical features of infectious diseases (diarrhea, cough, and fever) in children aged 6–59 months in Ghana. Methods: A cross–sectional study that utilized data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, involving a sample size of 2,408 children. The collected data was analyzed using binomial logistic regression. Results: Dual supplementation with vitamin A and iron was associated with an increased risk of fever (OR: 1.68 95% CI: 1.22–2.32) and cough (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.02–1.99) in children 6–59 months. Iron supplementation alone was associated with an increased risk of fever (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.01–1.72) while Vitamin A alone significantly increased the risk of diarrhea (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.03–2.92). Conclusions: Dual supplementation of vitamin A and iron is associated with an increase in childhood morbidity, endorsement of combined supplementation should be done with caution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0108cfba1e4eb9bb63f3d8e7a45a4f91e755efa073e7ce96a8c21c824d861af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
