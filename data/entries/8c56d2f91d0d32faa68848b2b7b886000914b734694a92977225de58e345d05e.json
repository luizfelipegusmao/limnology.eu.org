{"title":"A Novel Scarless Low-Level Laser-Assisted Mastopexy Technique: An Analysis in 231 Consecutive Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0599/v1","date":1720422299000,"content":"Introduction: Breast ptosis is characterized by the downward nipple-areola complex displacement below the inframammary fold. Breast ptosis is associated with ageing and its concomitant changes in estrogen levels in conjunction with other factors like macromastia, weight loss, pregnancy, and both alcohol and tobacco consumption products affecting breast tissue architecture impacting the well-being and quality of life in the affected women. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel mastopexy technique in patients with breast ptosis. Methods: A longitudinal, non-experimental, analytical study was done in a cohort of 231 women diagnosed with breast ptosis treated with a novel low-level multifrequency laser-assisted mastopexy assessing sternal notch-to-nipple distance (SNND) and breast ptosis status according to the Regnault system at the first, second, and third postoperative month. Additionally, the incidence and nature of compli-cations within the first 30 days post-surgery were evaluated according to the Clavien-Dindo system. Results: The breast ptosis proportion significantly changed across the three-month fol-low-up period from 100% to only 10% (all ptosis grade I). 90% of the patients achieved the non-ptosis grade according to the Regnault system (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c56d2f91d0d32faa68848b2b7b886000914b734694a92977225de58e345d05e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
