{"title":"A Novel Approach to the Modeling and Control of AC-DC Converters for Smart Microgrids, Incorporating Advanced Model Predictive Control for Offshore Wind Integration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1656/v1","date":1726837404000,"content":"This research explores a novel approach to integrating offshore wind farms into smart microgrids through the development of an advanced model predictive control (MPC) strategy for offshore wind turbines. The MPC strategy comprehensively incorporates complex wind dynamics, such as wind speed, direction, and turbulence, ensuring an accurate representation of turbine behavior. Additionally, the research includes models addressing wind farm layout, wake effects, and electrical infrastructure, enhancing the modeling framework's fidelity and applicability to real-world offshore wind energy systems within a smart microgrid environment. The inherent variability of wind power, transmission technology limitations, and the need for seamless transitions between grid-connected and islanded operation modes in smart microgrids necessitate robust control mechanisms. These mechanisms ensure efficient power capture, grid stability, and optimal energy utilization. To tackle these challenges, the research proposes a smart microgrid design incorporating both AC-DC and DC-DC conversion technologies. This design leverages renewable energy sources like solar and wind with AC-DC conversion for efficient power capture, integrates DC energy storage systems to store excess energy during low demand periods, and utilizes power control mechanisms to manage energy flow effectively within the smart microgrid. The study emphasizes the importance of modeling and control strategies for both AC-DC and DC-DC converters within the smart microgrid framework. To enhance the microgrid's cost-effectiveness, priority is given to the utilization of solar PV energy sources. It also highlights the integration of protection systems for DC faults and coordinated control of AC/DC breakers and converters. This comprehensive approach aligns with the core principles of adaptability, reliability, and sustainability in smart grids, aiming to advance smart microgrid technologies and pave the way for a more resilient, efficient, and secure energy future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de90640aae3efd725120d83bb1d270af7c38ea183a2bdd7b1cee0ce7a6af7f7b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
