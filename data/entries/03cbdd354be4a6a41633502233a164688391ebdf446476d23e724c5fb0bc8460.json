{"title":"Analysis of Land Use Changes in the Sado Estuary (Portugal) from the 19th to the 21st Century, Based on Historical Maps, Fieldwork, and Remote Sensing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0874/v1","date":1713174423000,"content":"This study analyses the changes in land use in the Sado estuary (West-Central Portugal) based on a multitemporal analysis of cartographic data from the 19th century and remote sensing land use maps from the 21st century, updated by field work. A GIS plotting of land-use evolution is summarized in a quantitative table. The comparison shows the changes in land use, with increasing occupation by human economic activities, including extensive agriculture and forestry, as well as localized urbanization and industrialization. The main elements of the landscape impacted by anthropogenic uses were: i) hydrography - river dams affected the flow dynamics and sedimentary processes in the estuary; ii) vegetation – increasing agriculture and forestry reduced the areas of native vegetation, nowadays mostly occupied by vineyards, pine forests and cork oaks. iii) wetlands - tidal and alluvial plains are being occupied by rice cultivation, aquaculture, industries, and ports; iv) coastal dunes – new developments are occupying large areas of Holocene coastal dunes; v) natural environment – mining and dredging affected some habitats and biodiversity. This analysis is intended to help the territorial organization of present and future economic activities, as well as to reduce environmental and social problems, promoting long-term sustainability of this rapidly evolving region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"03cbdd354be4a6a41633502233a164688391ebdf446476d23e724c5fb0bc8460","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
