{"title":"85 Evaluation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product on performance, plasma metabolites, rumen parameters, and fecal pathogen shedding in feedlot steers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/20/7617981?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of the experiment was to evaluate a commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product (SCFP; NaturSafe, Dimond V, Cedar Rapids, IA) on performance, plasma metabolites, rumen parameters, and fecal pathogen shedding in feedlot steers. Crossbred steers (n = 61; 271 ± 48.1 kg) were sourced from 3 different research units at Oklahoma State University and assigned to 1 of 3 experimental treatments in a randomized complete block design. Steers were group housed in pens equipped with an automated individual feed intake system. Treatments consisted of a negative control (CON), CON with tylosin phosphate (TYL; 9.9 mg · kg<sup>-1</sup> of diet DM), or CON with SCFP (1.63 g · kg<sup>-1</sup> of diet DM). Body weight and feed efficiency did not differ among treatments (P ≥ 0.12). However, steers fed SCFP tended to have greater ADG from d 35 to 56 (P = 0.10). In addition, steers fed SCFP exhibited increased DMI from d 56 to 112 (P = 0.03), a tendency for increased DMI from d 112 to final (P = 0.07), and increased DMI overall (P = 0.05). There was no treatment × time interaction for pH, pH change, or lactate concentrations in rumen fluid (P ≥ 0.11), but all were impacted by time (P &lt; 0.01). A treatment × time interaction (P &lt; 0.01) was detected for fecal pH and fecal pH change, with the pH being greater in TYL fed steers on d 56 and in CON fed steers on the final day. Steers that consumed CON had a reduced fecal pH (P &lt; 0.01) and steers consuming SCFP tended to have a reduced fecal pH (P = 0.08) from d 35 to 56 compared with TYL fed steers, while both CON and SCFP fed steers experienced an increase in fecal pH from d 56 to 112 (P &lt; 0.01). A time effect was detected (P ≤ 0.04) for plasma glucose, lactate, urea nitrogen, and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations among treatment groups. A treatment × time interaction was observed (P &lt; 0.02) for stx<sub>2</sub> genes of Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in individual fecal samples where SCFP and TYL fed steers tended to exhibit an increased concentration compared with CON fed steers on d 14, while on d 190 CON and SCFP fed steers exhibited an increased concentration compared with TYL fed steers. Overall, STEC, E. coli O157:H7, and Salmonella concentrations were all impacted by time (P &lt; 0.001). This experiment suggests that SCFP could be utilized as a potential alternative to TYL in feedlot cattle without adversely affecting cattle performance. However, SCFP did not impact pathogen shedding. In addition, CON fed steers performed similarly to both SCFP and TYL fed steers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"ae60fbafd738e89a4ec71680ce6cc6308fc5668e7d0c3b53d382cfe94182aadc","category":"Environment"}
