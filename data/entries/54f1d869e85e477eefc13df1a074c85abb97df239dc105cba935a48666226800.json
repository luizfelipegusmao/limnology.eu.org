{"title":"Drone-Based Localization of Hazardous Chemicals by Passive Smart Dust","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0030/v1","date":1722508821000,"content":"The distribution of tiny sensors over a specific area was first proposed in the late 1990s as a concept known as Smart Dust. Several efforts focused primarily on computing and networking capabilities but quickly ran into problems related to power supply, cost, data transmission, and environmental pollution. To overcome these limitations, we propose using paper-based (confetti-like) chemosensors that exploit the inherent selectivity of chemical reagents, such as colorimetric indicators. In this work, cheap and biodegradable passive sensors made from cellulose could successfully indicate the presence of hazardous chemicals, e.g., strong acids, by a significant color change. A conventional color digital camera attached to a drone could easily detect this from a safe distance. The collected data was processed to define the hazardous area. Our work presents a combination of the smart dust concept, chemosensing, paper-based sensor technology, and low-cost drones for flexible, sensitive, economical, and rapid detection of hazardous chemicals in high-risk scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"54f1d869e85e477eefc13df1a074c85abb97df239dc105cba935a48666226800","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
