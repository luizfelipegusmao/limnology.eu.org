{"title":"The evolutionary safety of mutagenic drugs should be assessed before drug approval","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002570","date":1710511200000,"content":"<p>by Gabriela Lobinska, Vyacheslav Tretyachenko, Orna Dahan, Martin A. Nowak, Yitzhak Pilpel</p>\r\n\r\nSome drugs increase the mutation rate of their target pathogen, a potentially concerning mechanism as the pathogen might evolve faster toward an undesired phenotype. We suggest a four-step assessment of evolutionary safety for the approval of such treatments.\r\n\r\nSome drugs increase the mutation rate of their target pathogen, raising the concern that they might thereby increase the pathogenâ€™s rate of adaptation. This Perspective article proposes a four-step process to evaluate the evolutionary safety of new treatments, calling on regulatory authorities to take this into account before approval for widespread use.","author":"Gabriela Lobinska","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"e39d4b9299be75ad6f985e8b9334299c3e2cdb143582a07e01f798d237358883","category":"Environment"}
