This study aimed to determine the utilization of the electronic logistic management information system (e-LMIS) in public health facilities and its implications for the medicine supply chain. A mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods was used. The study was conducted in 106 healthcare providers from 35 public health facilities in Singida District. Six key informants were interviewed in a qualitative method.  Of 106 participants, (62.3%) said they were somehow competent in e-LMIS utilization. In in-depth interviews, respondents underscored the system's utility for tracking stock levels, procurements, and managing orders. Staff shortage and lack of customized training were mentioned as major challenges, hindering efficiency in managing drug supplies. This study highlighted the positive impact of e-LMIS on various aspects of the medicine supply chain, including the timely submission of orders and enhanced inventory management. Sustained management support and regular utilization of the e-LMIS system are crucial for building and maintaining competence among healthcare providers, thereby optimizing the medicine supply chain and ultimately improving healthcare delivery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d63eb8cb462bc8f9a0561a7006ebb926d7d67b8648c80f20d1e89680afb8b0bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
