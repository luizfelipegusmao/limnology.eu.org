{"title":"Environmental Chamber Characterization of an Ice Detection Sensor for Aviation Using Graphene and PEDOT:PSS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1444/v1","date":1711352858000,"content":"In the context of improving aircraft safety, this study focuses on the development and evaluation of a graphene-based ice detection system using an environmental chamber. The research is driven by the need for more accurate and efficient ice detection methods, crucial in mitigating in-flight icing hazards. The methodology employed involves testing flat graphene-based sensors in a controlled environment, simulating a variety of climatic conditions that could be experienced in an aircraft during its entire flight. The environmental chamber enabled precise manipulation of temperature and humidity levels, thereby providing a realistic and comprehensive test bed for sensor performance evaluation. The results were significant, revealing the graphene sensorsâ€™ heightened sensitivity and rapid response to the subtle changes in environmental conditions, especially the critical phase transition from water to ice. This sensitivity is the key to detecting ice formation at its onset, a critical requirement for aviation safety. The study concludes that graphene-based sensors, tested under varied and controlled atmospheric conditions, exhibit a remarkable potential in enhancing ice detection systems for aircraft. Their lightweight, efficient and highly responsive nature makes them a superior alternative to traditional ice detection technologies, paving the way for more advanced and reliable aircraft safety solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a3c721c067a8b9e112e742d81b8887fa08b050c81f990ea737db75201186a44","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
