{"title":"A chemical analysis of the <i>Pelargonium</i> species: <i>P</i>. <i>odoratissimum</i>, <i>P</i>. <i>graveolens</i>, and <i>P</i>. <i>zonale</i> identifies secondary metabolites with activity against gram-positive bacteria with multidrug-resistance","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306637","date":1720620000000,"content":"<p>by Diana Celi, Evelyn Quiroz, Andrea Beltrán-Noboa, António Machado, Eduardo Tejera, Paulina Fernandez-Soto</p>\r\n\r\nThe <i>Pelargonium</i> genus encompasses around 280 species, most of which are used for medicinal purposes. While <i>P</i>. <i>graveolens</i>, <i>P</i>. <i>odoratissimum</i>, and <i>P</i>. <i>zonale</i> are known to exhibit antimicrobial activity, there is an evident absence of studies evaluating all three species to understand their chemical differences and biological effects. Through the analysis of the hydroalcoholic extracts of <i>P</i>. <i>graveolens</i>, <i>P</i>. <i>odoratissimum</i>, and <i>P</i>. <i>zonale</i>, using HPLC-DAD-MS/MS, quercetin and kaempferol derivatives were identified in these three species. Conversely, gallotannins and anthocyanins were uniquely detected in <i>P</i>. <i>zonale</i>. <i>P</i>. <i>graveolens</i> stood out due to the various types of myricetin derivatives that were not detected in <i>P</i>. <i>odoratissimum</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>zonale</i> extracts. Evaluation of their biological activities revealed that <i>P</i>. <i>zonale</i> displayed superior antibacterial and antibiofilm activities in comparison to the other two species. The antibacterial efficacy of <i>P</i>. <i>zonale</i> was observed towards the clinically relevant strains of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> ATCC 25923, Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) 333, <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> ATCC 29212, and the Vancomycin-resistant <i>E</i>. <i>faecalis</i> INSPI 032. Fractionation analysis of <i>P</i>. <i>zonale</i> suggested that the antibacterial activity attributed to this plant is due to the presence of quercetin derivatives and kaempferol and its derivatives, alongside their synergistic interaction with gallotannins and anthocyanins. Lastly, the three <i>Pelargonium</i> species exhibited notable antioxidant activity, which may be attributed to their high content of total phenolic compounds.","author":"Diana Celi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"29fa50b5e77eac3e4386031872e0f40c52d8d54bc1725e3dd6c40daa98a1c908","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
