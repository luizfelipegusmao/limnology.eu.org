{"title":"A Review of Factors Affecting the Lighting Performance of Light Shelves and Controlling Solar Heat Gain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0620/v1","date":1715266322000,"content":"In areas with a deep floor plan, the distribution of natural light is not uniform. Consequently, relying solely on daylight may not suffice to meet the space's lighting requirements, necessitating the use of artificial lighting in darker areas. Therefore, a lighting system is needed that not only controls the glare near the windows but also increases the light at the end of the room and provides uniform daylight. One of the widely used systems is the “light shelf“which has three main functions: shading, increasing the depth of light penetration and reducing glare. Review articles about light shelves have been done in 2015 and 2017, while more than 80% of the studies have been carried out since 2016 and light shelves with more diverse forms and dynamic elements and many consolidations were proposed. Therefore, there is a need for a more comprehensive review. The main question of this research is how different parameters (including climate, material, ceiling and integrated systems) can help to increase the efficiency of light shelves. By using a systematic review, studies in the past three decades were classified in order to determine the effect of these parameters on improving lighting performance and controlling solar heat gain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3585985e2697c890cf5847b046e5fce2dd326042d6be2e792df063e9a506353f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
