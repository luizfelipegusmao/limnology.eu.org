{"title":"Soil fertility shapes fire activity across Mediterranean‐type climate regions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13796?af=R","date":1707816398000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Aim</h2>\n<p>To quantify the role of soil fertility in the spatial variability of fire activity and to identify the mechanisms that drive this variability.</p>\n<h2>Location</h2>\n<p>The five Mediterranean-type climate regions of the world.</p>\n<h2>Time Period</h2>\n<p>2002–present.</p>\n<h2>Major Taxa Studied</h2>\n<p>Terrestrial plants.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>We compiled remotely sensed data on fire activity, climate, net primary productivity and chemical soil properties for bioclimatically homogeneous zones within the five Mediterranean-type climate regions of the world. Putative direct and indirect effects of the environmental variables on fire activity were evaluated through structural equation modelling.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Fire activity increased with net primary productivity, as expected for ecosystems with fuel-limited fire regimes. Soil acidity and the concentration of exchangeable aluminium also increased fire activity, supporting the idea that low fertility promotes plant characteristics that favour fire initiation and spread.</p>\n<h2>Main Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Our research supports a positive relationship between wildfires and low soil fertility in Mediterranean-type climate regions across the globe. Therefore, soil fertility should be incorporated into models predicting future fires in a warming world.</p>","author":"Susana Paula, \nDiego P. Ramírez, \nSergio Estay, \nJuli G.
