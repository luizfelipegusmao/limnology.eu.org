{"title":"Alternate day fasting aggravates atherosclerosis through the suppression of hepatic ATF3 in Apoe−/− mice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/lifemeta/article/doi/10.1093/lifemeta/loae009/7623933?rss=1","date":1709769600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Atherosclerosis is the major contributor to cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Alternate day fasting (ADF) has gained growing attention due to its metabolic benefits. However, the effects of ADF on atherosclerotic plaque formation remain inconsistent and controversial in atherosclerotic animal models. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of ADF on atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (<span>Apoe</span><sup><span>−/−</span></sup>) mice. Eleven-week-old male <span>Apoe</span><sup><span>−/−</span></sup> mice fed with Western diet (WD) were randomly grouped into <span>ad libitum</span> (AL) group and ADF group, and ADF aggravated both the early and advanced atherosclerotic lesion formation, which might be due to the disturbed cholesterol profiles caused by ADF intervention. ADF significantly altered cholesterol metabolism pathways and down-regulated integrated stress response (ISR) in the liver. The hepatic expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) was suppressed in mice treated with ADF and hepatocyte-specific overexpression of <span>Aft3</span> attenuated the effects of ADF on atherosclerotic plaque formation in <span>Apoe</span><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Moreover, the expression of ATF3 could be regulated by Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) and both the expressions of ATF3 and KLF6 were regulated by hepatic cellular ISR pathway. In conclusion, ADF aggravates atherosclerosis progression in <span>Apoe</span><sup><span>−/−</span></sup> mice fed on WD. ADF inhibits the hepatic ISR signaling pathway and decreases the expression of KLF6, subsequently inhibiting ATF3 expression. The suppressed ATF3 expression in the liver mediates the deteriorated effects of ADF on atherosclerosis in <span>Apoe</span><sup><span>−/−</span></sup> mice. The findings suggest the potentially harmful effects when ADF intervention is applied to the population at high risk of atherosclerosis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Life Metabolism Current Issue","siteHash":"d3cf61b7d69b232b580c1102d6441106867080e8dca2814adef0cc08b7e63ed3","entryHash":"cb607eb6bcbb2d53705c38a0045b2eab7fe282e213c9c2f84d8d624fa147d44a","category":"Environment"}
