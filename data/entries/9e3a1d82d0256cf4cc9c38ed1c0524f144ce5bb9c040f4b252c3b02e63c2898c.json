{"title":"Effects of LP on Immune Function and Intestinal Flora in Immunosuppressive Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1767/v1","date":1716841476000,"content":"To explore the effect of lily polysaccharide (LP) on immune function and intestinal flora in immunosuppressive mice.The immunosuppressive model was established by intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (CTX) in mice, and the immunological indexes were measured. The cecal contents of mice were taken, and the DNA of intestinal flora was extracted for 16S DNA sequence analysis.Compared with CTX group, the body weight and thymus index of mice in each treatment group increased significantly, the liver index decreased significantly,the hepatocyte morphology, liver plate and hepatic sinus arrangement of mice in high and low concentration LP groups were relieved in varying degrees, and the contents of IgA and IgG in serum of mice in low concentration LP group and positive control group increased significantly; The contents of TNF-Î± and IL-6 in colon decreased, while the contents of IL-10 increased significantly. The contents of AST, ALT and MDA in liver decreased significantly, while the content of SOD increased significantly. Compared with the blank group, LP can improve the intestinal flora of immunosuppressive mice , mainly by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as s24-7, Bacteroides and butyrimionas and reducing the abundance of harmful bacteria such as Prevotella, dorea and adlercreutzia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e3a1d82d0256cf4cc9c38ed1c0524f144ce5bb9c040f4b252c3b02e63c2898c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
