{"title":"Metabolite, Biochemical, and Dietary Intake Alterations Associated with Lifestyle Interventions in Obese and Overweight Women","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2035/v1","date":1721904804000,"content":"Differences in metabolic regulation among obesity phenotypes, specifically metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO) women, may lead to varied responses to interventions, which could be elucidated through metabolomics. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the differences in metabolite profiles between MHO and MUO women and the changes following a lifestyle intervention. Serum from 36 MHO and 34 MUO women, who participated in a lifestyle intervention for weight loss were analyzed using an untargeted proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) at baseline and 6 months post-intervention. Anthropometric, clinical and dietary intake parameters were assessed at both time points. Both groups showed differential metabolites profile at baseline and sixth month. Seven metabolites including trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), arginine, ribose, aspartate, carnitine, choline and tyrosine significantly changed between group post-intervention, in which all showed a decreasing pattern in MHO. Significant reduction in body weight and BMI in the MUO correlated with changes in carnitine and tyrosine levels. In conclusion, metabolite profiles differed significantly between MHO and MUO women before and after a lifestyle intervention. Changes in carnitine and tyrosine levels in MUO correlated with weight loss, suggesting potential targets for therapeutic intervention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c0885c2f48b7ff625d78649ca61ccacc7cd9152de6cd45c8dc9556a1c61be206","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
