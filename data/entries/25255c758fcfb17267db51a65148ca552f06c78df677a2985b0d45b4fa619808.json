CagA is the only protein known to be translocated by the Cag T4SS and once inside cells causes numerous alterations in cell signaling, linking it to malignant transformation. How the T4SS physically translocates CagA is not understood.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"25255c758fcfb17267db51a65148ca552f06c78df677a2985b0d45b4fa619808","category":"Environment"}
