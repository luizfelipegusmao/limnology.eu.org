{"title":"Effect of the Duration of Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest on the Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in Children Undergoing Cardiac Surgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1553/v1","date":1721379564000,"content":"Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) is safe, but subtle neurodevelopmental deficits may persist far beyond the perioperative period. We investigated the relationship between DHCA duration and neurodevelopmental outcomes in young children undergoing cardiac surgery with DHCA. Children aged &amp;lt; 42 months, including neonates who underwent cardiac surgery using DHCA without regional perfusion techniques, were included as the DHCA group. Children in the same age range undergoing cardiac surgery without DHCA were included as the control group. All patients underwent neurodevelopmental assessment using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSTID) by a trained pediatrician. Seventeen of 25 DHCA and six of 10 control patients completed the BSTID assessment. The groups showed no preoperative, operative, or postoperative significant differences. In adjusted multivariable analysis, prematurity and age at assessment were significant changing predictors of each of the BSTID components (p &amp;lt; 0.001), other than the gross motor component, where only age at assessment was a significant adjusting predictor. Longer DHCA was associated with lower fine and gross motor BSTID components; however, the association was not statistically significant (p = 0.06). Use of DHCA without regional perfusion techniques may be associated with less optimal neurodevelopmental outcomes if DHCA has a long duration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5dafdec149deb030abdde18fb3d018d91f553db062aa9e02ae0ef56d82742863","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
