{"title":"Detecting DoS Attacks through Synthetic User Behavior with Long-Short Term Memory Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1314/v1","date":1713505208000,"content":"With the escalation of size and complexity of modern Denial of Service attacks, there is a need for research in the context of Machine Learning (ML) used in attack execution and defense against such attacks. This paper investigates the potential use of ML in generating behavioral telemetry data using Long-Short Term Memory network and spoofing requests for the analyzed traffic to look legitimate. For this research, a custom testing environment was built, that listens for mouse and keyboard events and analyzes them accordingly. While the economic feasibility of this attack currently limits its immediate threat, advancements in technology could make it more cost-effective for attackers in the future. Therefore, proactive development of countermeasures remains essential to mitigate potential risks and stay ahead of evolving attack methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab4c1c34d957a424a54f241b4add1722f4f5541369f7668343f8d31a51695e48","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
