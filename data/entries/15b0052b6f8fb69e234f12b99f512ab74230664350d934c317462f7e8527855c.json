{"title":"Furfural production from xylan using a Pueraria Residues carbon‐based solid‐acid catalyst","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13976?af=R","date":1729683818000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The conversion of biomass into high value-added platform compounds is an important method of biomass utilization. The conversion of hemicellulose represented by xylan into furfural can not only reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, but also promotes the development and utilization of non-edible biomass resources. In this study, a bifunctional solid-acid catalyst prepared from agricultural and forestry waste <i>Pueraria</i> (<i>P. eduli)</i> Residues was used to convert xylan into furfural in a biphasic system.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this study, <i>P. eduli</i> Residues was used as raw material to prepare a <i>P. eduli</i> Residues-based carbon solid-acid catalyst (PR/C-SO<sub>3</sub>H-Fe) by one-step sulfonation carbonization and impregnation. The catalyst catalyzes the conversion of xylan to furfural in a biphasic system (2-methyltetrahydrofuran/water). The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, differential thermogravimetric analysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption. Subsequently, the experimental conditions were studied and optimized, such as metal species, iron ion concentration, reaction time and temperature, volume ratio of organic phase to water phase and ratio of substrate to catalyst. The results showed that under conditions of 160 °C, 50 mg catalyst, 100 mg xylan and 7 mL reaction solvent, the yield of furfural could reach 78.94% after 3 h of reaction.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study provides an effective research method for the conversion of xylan into furfural, and provides a reference for the catalytic conversion and utilization of hemicellulose in agricultural and forestry biomass. It also provides a feasible method for the resource utilization of agricultural and forestry waste. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xiangtong Gai, \nWei Ding, \nJian He, \nJie Guo, \nKe Song","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"15b0052b6f8fb69e234f12b99f512ab74230664350d934c317462f7e8527855c","category":"Environment"}
