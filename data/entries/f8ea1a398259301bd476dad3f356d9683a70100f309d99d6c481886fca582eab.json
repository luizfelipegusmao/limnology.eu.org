{"title":"Orthobiologic Management Options for Degenerative Disc Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0012/v1","date":1714542181000,"content":"Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a pervasive condition that limits quality of life and burdens economies. Traditional pharmacological treatments aimed at slowing degeneration are ineffective in the long-term. Orthobiologics, regenerative agents derived from the patientâ€™s own tissue, are a promising emerging therapy for degenerative disc disease. This review first outlines the pathophysiology of degenerative disc disease, highlighting the limitations of existing treatments and explores the orthobiologic tools for treating degenerative disc disease (platelet-rich plasma, mesenchymal stem cells). Their history in regenerative medicine is outlined, demonstrating how in vitro evidence informed preclinical animal studies on their efficacy in treating degenerative disc disease. Finally, clinical trials utilizing these treatment options are reviewed and directions for future research are outlined. Although the current clinical evidence available is limited to propagate their routine clinical usage the field holds immense potential in the management of DDD. There is room for these treatments to be optimized for effective consistent clinical outcomes in DDD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8ea1a398259301bd476dad3f356d9683a70100f309d99d6c481886fca582eab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
