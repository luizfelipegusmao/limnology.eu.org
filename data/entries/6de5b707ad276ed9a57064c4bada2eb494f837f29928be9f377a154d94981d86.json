DUF581-9 negatively regulates the key energy sensor SnRK1","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1273/7457475?rss=1","date":1701388800000,"content":"<span>Resources are limited. We all are aware of this problem, especially when those unforeseen expenses come and force us to spend part of our monthly income on stuff we initially did not intend to buy. Plants are no different. Their resources are equally limited. Therefore, under unfavorable conditions, such as pathogen attacks or extreme temperatures, plants relocate some of the resources initially intended for growth to counteract these challenges. This trade-off is tightly regulated to ensure an optimal exploitation of resources while maintaining the ability to respond quickly and efficiently to unfavorable conditions. In plants, SUCROSE NON-FERMETING RELATED KINASE 1 (SnRK1) senses energy deficits caused by adverse situations and coordinates the cellular responses to adapt (<a href=\"#kiad637-B1\">Baena-González et al. 2007</a>). Whereas the downstream targets of SnRK1 that execute these responses have been extensively studied, the mechanisms that regulate its upstream activation have received less attention (<a href=\"#kiad637-B3\">Broeckx et al. 2016</a>). One of the known activators of SnRK1 is GEMINIVIRUS REP INTERACTING KINASE 2 (GRIK2), which functions in the context of viral infection and young tissue development (<a href=\"#kiad637-B9\">Shen et al. 2009</a>). It was proposed that, contrary to its animal and yeast counterparts, SnRK1 is not specifically activated upon energy deficit but is rather constitutively active but repressed under energy-sufficient conditions (<a href=\"#kiad637-B8\">Ramon et al. 2019</a>). Indeed, several molecules are known to inhibit SnRK1 activity (<a href=\"#kiad637-B3\">Broeckx et al. 2016</a>), although the exact molecular mechanisms remain elusive to date.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"6de5b707ad276ed9a57064c4bada2eb494f837f29928be9f377a154d94981d86","category":"Environment"}
