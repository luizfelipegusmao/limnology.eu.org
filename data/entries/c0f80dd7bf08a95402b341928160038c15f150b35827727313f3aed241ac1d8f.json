{"title":"Association between dietary folate intake and HPV infection: NHANES 2005–2016","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306636","date":1720792800000,"content":"<p>by Shuo Jin, Fangxuan Lin, Liuqing Yang, Qin Zhang</p>\r\nBackground <p>Recent studies have established a correlation between folate levels and the incidence of cervical cancer. Given that Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a primary etiological factor in the development of cervical cancer, the nature of the relationship between dietary folate intake and HPV infection remains an area of ongoing investigation.</p> Methods <p>To investigate the association between dietary folate intake and HPV infection, this study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning from 2005 to 2016. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to examine the potential associations. Furthermore, the use of restricted cubic splines (RCS) facilitated the exploration of any non-linear correlations. Additionally, subgroup analyses were used to explore this correlation in different populations.</p> Results <p>The study encompassed a total of 6747 women aged between 18 and 59 years. For every one mcg increase in folate intake, the incidence of HPV infection is reduced by 1% (OR = 0.99, p&lt;0.05). Besides, folate intake was categorized into quartiles as follows: Q1 (&lt;211 mcg/day), Q2 (211–311 mcg/day), Q3 (311–448 mcg/day), and Q4 (&gt;448 mcg/day). The adjusted odds ratios (OR) for the different folate levels were as follows: Q2: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.76–1.16), Q3: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.67–1.04), and Q4: 0.63 (95% CI: 0.49–0.81). The RCS analysis confirmed a nonlinear relationship between dietary folate intake and HPV infection risk. Notably, a significant inverse association was observed when dietary folate intake exceeded 193.847 mcg/day.</p> Conclusions <p>In conclusion, the findings of this study indicate a negative association between dietary folate intake and the risk of HPV infection. This association demonstrates a nonlinear pattern, particularly evident at higher levels of folate consumption.</p>","author":"Shuo Jin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c0f80dd7bf08a95402b341928160038c15f150b35827727313f3aed241ac1d8f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
