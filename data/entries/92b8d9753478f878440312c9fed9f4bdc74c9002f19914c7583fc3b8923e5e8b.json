{"title":"Gaining Insight into Mitochondrial Targeting: AUTAC-Biguanide as an Anticancer Agent","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1193/v1","date":1721043691000,"content":"AUTAC-Biguanide is a hybrid compound designed to target mitochondria inducing their degradation by mitophagy. This study unveils the potential of biguanides as cancer cell-targeting agents, emphasizing AUTAC-Biguanide's superior antiproliferative properties compared to metformin and its selectivity for cancer cells. The mechanism behind this heightened effect includes the ability of AUTAC-Biguanide to triggers mitophagy. By providing a comprehensive analysis of these findings, the study adds valuable insights to the field of mitochondrial-targeting anticancer agents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92b8d9753478f878440312c9fed9f4bdc74c9002f19914c7583fc3b8923e5e8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
