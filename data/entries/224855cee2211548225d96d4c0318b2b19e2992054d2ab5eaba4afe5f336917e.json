{"title":"Biofilm Formation and Anti-Inflammatory Response of a Probiotic Blend","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0922/v1","date":1726133205000,"content":"Gut dysbiosis and an inflamed bowel are growing concerns in mammals, including dogs. Probiotic supplements have been used to restore the natural microbial community and improve gastrointestinal health. Biofilm formation, antimicrobial activities, and immunological responses of probiotics are crucial to improving gut health. Thus, we tested a commercial probiotic blend (LabMAX-3), a canine kibble additive comprising Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticasibacillus casei, and Enterococcus faecium for their ability to inactivate common enteric pathogens; their ability to form biofilms, epithelial cell adhesion and anti-inflammatory response on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line. Probiotic LabMAX-3 blend, or individual isolates, showed a strong inhibitory effect against Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. LabMAX-3 formed biofilms comparable to Staphylococcus aureus. LabMAX-3 adhesion to the MDCK cell line (with or without lipopolysaccharide, LPS) pretreatment showed comparable adhesion and biofilm formation (p &lt; 0.05) to L. casei ATCC 334 used as a control. LabMAX-3 had no cytotoxic effects on the MDCK cell line during 1 h exposure. The IL-10 and TNFÎ± ratio of LabMAX-3, compared to the L. casei control, showed a significant increase (p &lt; 0.05), indicating a more pronounced anti-inflammatory response. The data show that LabMAX-3, a canine kibble supplement, can improve gastrointestinal health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"224855cee2211548225d96d4c0318b2b19e2992054d2ab5eaba4afe5f336917e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
