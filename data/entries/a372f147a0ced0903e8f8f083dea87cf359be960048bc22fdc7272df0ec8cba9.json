Since the noise and crystalline signals are usually distinguishable in the frequency domain, filtering algorithms have been developed to reduce noise while preserving the crystalline features based on the Fourier transform of the raw images. A Wiener filter has been demonstrated in the 90s for denoising HRTEM images [<a href=\"#ozae044.213-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.213-B2\">2</a>], given as:</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a372f147a0ced0903e8f8f083dea87cf359be960048bc22fdc7272df0ec8cba9","category":"Environment"}
