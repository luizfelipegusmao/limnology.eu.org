Leveraging deep learning models significantly decreases the requisite amount of manual labeling while providing a solution with workable levels of accuracy. Here, we implement the U-Net model [<a href=\"#ozae044.215-B1\">1</a>] on a small sub-sequence of 17 STEM images to accelerate the labeling process for a recorded video of 81 frames with a focal interest in model performance under limited data scenarios (Figure 1).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f89ddacfcc4dfb7f7ea9bfc460cdf723db941f8784d096dc6d42a633ac80015e","category":"Environment"}
