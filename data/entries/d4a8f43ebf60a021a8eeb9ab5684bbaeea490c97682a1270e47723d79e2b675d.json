{"title":"Probabilistic Analysis of Passive Trapdoor in c-ϕ Soil Considering Multivariate Cross-Correlated Random Fields","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10706-023-02649-5","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>This study investigates the effect of multivariate cross-correlated random fields on the failure behaviour of passive trapdoors in <em>c</em>-<em>ϕ</em> soil utilising random finite element limit analysis (RFELA). Failure mechanisms of a trapdoor in <em>c</em>-<em>ϕ</em> soil depend on an activity of the soil unit weight (<em>γ</em>), thus triggering downward and a restriction of soil shear strength (<em>c</em>, <em>ϕ</em>). The cross-correlated coefficients between any two soil parameters were used to generate the spatial variability of correlation, single and multiple dependent random fields. The failure mechanism and probability of design failure were explored with these random fields for a shallow to a deep passive trapdoor in <em>c</em>-<em>ϕ</em> soil. The results indicated that considering the greater cross-correlated coefficients produced a lower probability of design failure. Ignoring multivariate cross-correlated random fields can result in either an underestimation or an overestimation of the probability of design failure, depending on the specific scenarios. This study also provided a required factor of safety to satisfy the probability of design failure for each random field and normalised depth of the trapdoor. Additionally, the multivariate adaptive regression spline model was applied to predict passive load, thereby reducing computational time in practical applications.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"d4a8f43ebf60a021a8eeb9ab5684bbaeea490c97682a1270e47723d79e2b675d","category":"Environment"}
