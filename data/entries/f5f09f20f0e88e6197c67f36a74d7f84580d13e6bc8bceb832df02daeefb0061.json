{"title":"Selection and Multiplexing of Reverse Transcription Quantitative PCR Tests Targeting Relevant Honeybee Viral Pathogens","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0220/v1","date":1714977823000,"content":"Verification of inclusivity of molecular detection methods gives indications on the reliability of viral infections diagnosis because of the tendency of viral pathogens to undergo sequence variation. This study was aimed to select inclusive probe based reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays for the diagnosis of the most widespread and detrimental viruses infecting honeybees, namely the acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), the black queen cell virus (BQCV), the chronic paralysis bee virus (CBPV), the deformed wing virus variants A (DWVA) and B (DWVB), and the sacbrood virus (SBV). Therefore, detection methods previously described were re-evaluated in silico for specificity and inclusivity. Based on this evaluation, selected methods were modified or new ones were designed and tested in duplex RT-qPCR reactions. The limits of detection (LODs), effect of multiplexing on sensitivity and viral RNA quantification potential in bees and hive debris were assessed. This study made available diagnostic assays able to detect an increased number of virus variants compared to previously described tests and two viral pathogens in a single PCR reaction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5f09f20f0e88e6197c67f36a74d7f84580d13e6bc8bceb832df02daeefb0061","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
