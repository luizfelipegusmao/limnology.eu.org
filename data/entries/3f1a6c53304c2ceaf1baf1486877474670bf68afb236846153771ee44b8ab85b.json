{"title":"32 Biotics: Are there differences?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/123/7757108?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In companion animals, the search for dietary ingredients and supplements that may promote health and longevity continues. Because stool quality issues and gastrointestinal diseases are common, substances addressing gastrointestinal health are of interest and some of the most heavily studied. Given the importance that microbiota have on host health and disease, many strategies function by directly or indirectly influencing the microbial species that inhabit the gut. Dietary fibers may impact gut health by maintaining stool quality, providing laxation, reducing fecal odor, and modulating fermentative end-products. A variety of biotic substances may also be used to promote gastrointestinal health. Four primary biotic substances exist, namely probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics. Over the past decade, the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) has sponsored expert consensus panels to update the biotic definitions, offer criteria for qualification, outline guiding principles for research and development, and provide implications for a variety of stakeholders (scientists; media; regulators; industry). In 2014, Hill et al. defined probiotics as “live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit”. Gibson et al. (2017) defined prebiotics as “substrates that are selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit.” Probiotics and prebiotics have been widely used in pet products over the past few decades. Swanson et al. (2020) updated the synbiotic definition to be a “mixture comprising live microorganisms and substrate(s) selectively utilized by host microorganisms that confer a health benefit”. Synbiotics may contain components that operate independently (complementary synbiotic) or in together (synergistic synbiotic) to promote host health. In 2021, Salminen et al. defined postbiotics as “preparations of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confer a health benefit.” Yeast and bacteria-based mixtures falling under this definition have become more popular in pet nutrition as of late, but the postbiotic definition is often misused. This presentation will discuss each biotic substance category in regard to their use in dogs and cats. Mechanisms of action, potential benefits of consumption, evidence of successful use in companion animals, and ideas for the future of biotics will be presented.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"3f1a6c53304c2ceaf1baf1486877474670bf68afb236846153771ee44b8ab85b","category":"Environment"}
