{"title":"Promoting Urban Sustainability Transitions through Multi-Level Governance: The Intermediary Role of the Madrid Deep Demonstration Partnership","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2303/v1","date":1727599659000,"content":"In the fields of partnership research and social innovation, there have been an increasing number of calls for evidence regarding the kind of collaborative multi-level governance structures that might support large scale transformation processes, specially towards climate-neutral cities. This paper conceptualizes a new type of intermediary actor; the Systemic Collaborative Platform (SCP). Using the example of a multi-stakeholder arrangement set up to design and implement Madridâ€™s Climate Neutrality Roadmap, the key features of an SCP include a focus on multi-stakeholder and cross-sectoral collaboration for public policy development, in this case operating at both a systemic level and a city scale, and a strong link to a key actor within this regime (a city council). Our study reveals how a SCP can contribute to articulation of a shared mandate among city actors and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of a targeted transition by attracting, aligning and managing a wide and diverse organizational ecosystem through distributed facilitation, collaborative leadership and continuous learning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c8bfb241c364b60190d60639d6c73ca29d923ea6b6fdef377b9d22bdf936b37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
