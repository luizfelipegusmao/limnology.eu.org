{"title":"A Non-Surgical Wearable Option for a Bone Conduction Implantable Device: A Comparative Study with Conventional Bone Conduction Hearing Aids","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1883/v1","date":1724721415000,"content":"Objectives. To compare the audiological benefits of a non-implantable wearing option  of a bone conduction (BC) implant mounted on an arch (SoundArc) to traditional BC hearing aids (HA) mounted on eyeglasses (BCHA) in patients with moderate to severe conductive or mixed hearing loss. \nMethods: A preliminary cross-sectional observational prospective cohort study was conducted at a Tertiary Audiological Department, University Hospital. Fourteen adults with conductive or mixed hearing loss (PTA at 0.5-1-2-4 KHz = 67 ± 15 dB HL) had been wearing conventional BCHA on eyeglasses for at least 3 years, and refused the surgical implantation of a BC hearing implant (BCHI). Unaided and aided pure-tone AC and BC thresholds and speech test in quiet and in noise were recorded at baseline and in two different settings: with a BCHI mounted on SoundArc®, and with their own BCHA with two couplers, mounted on eyeglasses. International Inventory for Hearing Aids [IOI – HA], the Hearing Handicap Inventory [HHIA/E], Speech, Spatial, Qualities of Hearing Scale [SSQ], a 10-scores visuo-analogic scale [VAS], and Fatigue impact scale [FIS] score were asked in both conditions. \nResults: a statistical significative functional gain was observed for both settings. (p=.0001) Better speech perception performances in quiet and in noise were observed with SoundArc compared to their conventional BCHA on eyeglasses (word repetition score in noise improvement of +19.3 at SNR +10 dB, p=.002; + 12.1 at SNR 0 dB, p=.006; and +11.4 at SNR -10 dB, p=.002) No significant differences were found in IOI–HA, FIS, and HHIA/E scores, while significative better SSQ scores in all domains were reported for SoundArc. (p=.0038) \nConclusions: Although patients were accustomed to their BCHA on eyeglasses, the non-implanted wearable option of the BCHI proved to be a viable alternative in adult patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss unable to receive or refusing BCHI surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cfff99d9985d4465ddcaae284effead426d4885ad065f61394c45b724b7d3c40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
