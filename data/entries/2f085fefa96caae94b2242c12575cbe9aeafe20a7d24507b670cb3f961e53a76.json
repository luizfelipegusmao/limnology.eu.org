{"title":"GIS Framework for Sustainable Logistics Operations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2077/v1","date":1724852202000,"content":"Dispatching goods is becoming more difficult to manage in the field of logistics due to the high demand for order shipments. This is relative to the increasing popularity of the use of e-commerce platforms among consumers, where delivery of products is required as compared to buying in physical stores. Dispatch management is one of the critical components in a supply chain since it covers the coordination tasks among stakeholders from warehouse up to the consumerâ€™s doorstep. In this study, the authors intend to propose a framework leveraging geographic information to sustain the logistics operations, specifically in terms of managing last-mile delivery and return trip orders. This includes scheduling, communications, and inventory of goods shipment. A mobile application built on this framework was integrated with a waypoint order optimization algorithm considering the entire route traversing all the required pick-up and delivery points. It was pilot tested with an actual dispatch operation of a logistics company yielding a decrease of 87% in total shipment time, 79% in operations cost, and 3% in carbon footprint per vehicle. With the adoption of this framework, the study aims to contribute to the overall efficiency and sustainability of logistics operations in a wider geographic range.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f085fefa96caae94b2242c12575cbe9aeafe20a7d24507b670cb3f961e53a76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
