{"title":"Contactless X-band Detection of Steel Bars in Concrete: A Preliminary Numerical and Experimental Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1334/v1","date":1713861919000,"content":"This work presents preliminary experimental results advancing non-destructive testing methods for detecting steel bars in concrete structures via contactless investigation in the X-band spectrum. The study reveals the fieldâ€™s penetration into concrete, extracting insights into embedded bars through scattered data. Applying a quasi-quadratic inverse scattering technique to numerically simulated data yields promising results, confirming the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach. In this realm, using a higher frequency allows the use of lighter equipment and smaller antennas. Identified areas for improvement include accounting for antenna behavior and establishing undeformed target morphology and precise orientation. Transitioning from powder-based and sand specimens to real solid reinforced concrete structures is expected to alleviate laboratory challenges. Although accurately determining concrete properties such as relative permittivity and conductivity is essential, it remains beyond the scope of this study. Finally, overcoming these challenges could significantly enhance non-invasive testing, improving structural health monitoring and disaster prevention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3a458f0f087685efc4ba3e4383fe9802922bdb3baf437fe6546e228b955d32a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
