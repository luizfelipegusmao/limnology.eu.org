{"title":"Phase Error Correction in Magnetic Resonance: A Review of Models, Optimization Functions, and Optimizers in Traditional Statistics and Neural Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2252/v1","date":1727448140000,"content":"Phase errors in magnetic resonance (MR) techniques, including Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), pose significant challenges to data accuracy and interpretation. As MR technologies advance, the demand for more sophisticated phase correction methods continues to grow, enhancing diagnostic precision and analytical outcomes. This review explores the evolution of phase correction models, beginning with simple global phase shifts, progressing through traditional linear statistical models, and culminating in modern machine learning techniquesâ€”specifically, neural networks. We also examine a range of optimization functions and optimizers, including both MR data-specific and common statistical approaches, applied in phase error correction. Despite notable progress, challenges remain in developing fully automatic phase error correction methods, particularly given the absence of ground truth in real-world MR data. This review highlights key methods, discusses their limitations, and proposes future pathways, including ensemble learning, that could guide further innovation in phase error correction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7a59138a280129c41a9e7e9e8c7b9d2fafe93e10e65d6ceeef838f92fb9a9c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
