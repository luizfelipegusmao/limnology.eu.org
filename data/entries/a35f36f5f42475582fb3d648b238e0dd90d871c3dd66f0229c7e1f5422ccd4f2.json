{"title":"Vaccine Refusal and Hesitancy in Spain: An Online Cross-Sectional Questionnaire","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0317/v1","date":1715045068000,"content":"Vaccine refusal and hesitancy pose a critical challenge to public health, leading to delays in vaccination and compromising herd immunity. To address this issue, we conducted a comprehensive observational study on the adult Spanish population in 2021. Through an online questionnaire, we explored the sociodemographic and sociocultural factors, beliefs, and opinions of those refusing or holding hesitancy about vaccines, and their vaccination behaviours by vaccine type and sex. Our findings revealed that vaccine refusal rates were relatively low (16.8%), and mainly associated with influenza vaccination (10.3%). Greater refusal of vaccination was observed in over 60 years old, in those expressing hesitancy due to vaccine components and opposing free and compulsory vaccination, unaware that vaccination protects the community and being against consuming cowâ€™s milk and the use of infant formulas for breastfeeding. Vaccine hesitancy was greatest in individuals under 31 years old, women, parents of children under 15 years old, against compulsory vaccination, unaware that vaccination protects the community, with hesitancy due to vaccine costs, and in favour of alternative and complementary treatments. These insights underscore the need for strategies to improve education about vaccination and dispel misconceptions are crucial for effectively reducing vaccine refusal and hesitancy across the population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a35f36f5f42475582fb3d648b238e0dd90d871c3dd66f0229c7e1f5422ccd4f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
