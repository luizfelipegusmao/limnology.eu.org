{"title":"BDNF-Regulated Modulation of Striatal Circuits and Implications for Neurological Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0328/v1","date":1719999747000,"content":"Neurotrophins, particularly brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), act as key regulators of neuronal development, survival and plasticity. In this review, we focus on the role of BDNF for corticostriatal plasticity in movement disorders, including Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) and dystonia. We discuss the mechanisms how dopaminergic input modulates BDNF/TrkB signaling at corticostriatal synapses and the involvement of these mechanisms in neuronal function and synaptic plasticity. Disruption of these pathways can lead to aberrant plasticity, ultimately affecting motor function. Advancing our understanding of these mechanisms could pave the way towards innovative therapeutic strategies aiming at restoring neuroplasticity and enhancing motor function in these diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d56ad8e7836a30a575d308bf9769d0148f008bc4baa665f56734b01116cee51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
