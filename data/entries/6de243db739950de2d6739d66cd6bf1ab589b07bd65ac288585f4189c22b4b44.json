{"title":"Multiple introductions of divergent lineages and admixture conferred the high invasiveness in a widespread weed (Hypochaeris radicata)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.13740?af=R","date":1718953200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Biological invasion consists of spatially and temporally varying stages, accompanied by ecological and evolutionary changes. Understanding the genomics underlying invasion dynamics provides critical insights into the geographic sources and genetic diversity, contributing to successful invasions across space and time. Here, we used genomic data and model-based approaches to characterize the invasion dynamics of <i>Hypochaeris radicata</i> L., a noxious weed in Korea. Genetic diversity and assignment patterns were investigated using 3563 SNPs of 283 individuals sampled from 22 populations. We employed a coalescent-based simulation method to estimate demographic changes for each population and inferred colonization history using both phylogenetic and population genetic model-based approaches. Our data suggest that <i>H. radicata</i> has been repeatedly been introduced to Korea from multiple genetic sources within the last 50 years, experiencing weak population bottlenecks followed by subsequent population expansions. These findings highlight the potential for further range expansion, particularly in the presence of human-mediated dispersal. Our study represents the first population-level genomic research documenting the invasion dynamics of the successful worldwide invader, <i>H. radicata</i>, outside of Europe.</p>","author":"Soo‐Rang Lee, \nTae‐Young Choi, \nDong‐Chan Son","siteTitle":"Wiley: Evolutionary Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"df2df3df25f90ba55fdf535f13dd2e89e7355c6f34118f20800f9e7201897f76","entryHash":"6de243db739950de2d6739d66cd6bf1ab589b07bd65ac288585f4189c22b4b44","category":"Environment"}
