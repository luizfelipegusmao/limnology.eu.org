{"title":"Culture optimization of <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. KRA16-334 for increased yield of new herbicide 334-W4","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301104","date":1712671200000,"content":"<p>by Young Sook Kim, Kyoung Soo Jang, Jung Sup Choi</p>\r\n\r\nThis study aimed to isolate actinomycetes that exhibit strong herbicidal activity, identify compounds active against weeds, and researching methods to improve the production of these compounds through culture optimization to establish a foundation for the development of environmentally friendly bioherbicides. 334-W4, one of the herbicidal active substances isolated from the culture broth of <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. KRA16-334, exhibited herbicidal activity against various weeds. The molecular formula of 334-W4 was determined to be C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>26</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6,</sub> based on ESI-MS (m/z) and <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectral data. It had molecular weight 365.1689 [M+Na] and 343.1869 [M+H], indicating the presence of the epoxy-<i>β</i>-aminoketone moiety based on HMBC correlations. Additionally, selective culture was possible depending on the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) during culture with GSS medium. Experiments confirmed that exposure of the KRA16-334 strain to UV irradiation (254 nm, height 17 cm) for 45 seconds improved the yield of the active substance (334-W4) by over 200%. As a result of examining yields of active materials of four mutants selected through optimization of culture conditions such as temperature, agitation, and initial pH, the yield of one mutant 0723–8 was 264.7 ± 12.82 mg/L, which was 2.8-fold higher than that of wild-type KRA16-334 at 92.8 ± 5.48 mg/L.","author":"Young Sook Kim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b6e28cf0df7500baf71a7ecea47b321be8f33356920830ac6733152712ac2e91","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
