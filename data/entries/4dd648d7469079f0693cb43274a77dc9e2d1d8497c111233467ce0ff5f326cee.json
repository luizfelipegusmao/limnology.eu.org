{"title":"PSIX-11 Effects of black soldier fly larvae on the serum chemistry, hematology, fecal characteristics, and oral health measures of healthy adult cats","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/569/7757611?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) serve as an alternative protein source for pet food products. Even though BSFL are one of many insect species being added to dog foods and treats, knowledge of its effects in cats remains limited. Further investigations are imperative to delineate the effects of BSFL-based ingredients in cats. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of BSFL on serum chemistry, hematology, fecal characteristics, and oral health measures of adult cats. All procedures were approved by the University of Illinois IACUC prior to experimentation. Adult cats [n = 25; 17 females, 8 males; 6.28 ± 0.27 yr of age; 4.50 ± 0.18 kg body weight (BW)] were used in a completely randomized design. The study was composed of a 21-d baseline phase and a 70-d experimental phase. During the baseline phase, all cats were fed a control diet based on chicken meal (35% of diet). After baseline, cats were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 experimental diets: control diet (n = 12) or BSFL-containing diet (20% whole BSFL meal and 24% chicken meal; n = 13). At baseline, teeth were cleaned by a veterinary dentist. Breath samples were analyzed for volatile sulfur compounds (VSC), salivary pH was measured, and blood samples were collected for serum chemistry and hematology at baseline and after 35 d and 70 d on treatment. At baseline and after 70 d on treatment, fecal samples were scored and collected for pH, dry matter, and metabolite measurement. Gingivitis, plaque, and calculus scores were performed by a veterinary dentist after 70 d on treatment. All data were analyzed using the Mixed Models procedure of SAS. Diet, time, and diet*time interaction effects were tested, with <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05 being considered significant. Over time, VSC increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001) in all cats, but was unaffected by diet. Diet*time interactions were observed for fecal pH, fecal scores, and blood cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. Blood cholesterol concentrations increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) over time in cats fed the control diet, but remained stable in cats fed the BSFL diet. The opposite effect was observed with blood triglycerides. Triglyceride concentrations increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) in cats fed the BSFL diet over time, but were stable in cats fed the control diet. Cats consuming BSFL had reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) fecal pH, dry matter content, and protein catabolite concentrations, but increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations and fecal scores. Overall, 20% BSFL dietary inclusion had comparable effects as chicken meal, suggesting that it will serve as a suitable replacement in cat foods.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"4dd648d7469079f0693cb43274a77dc9e2d1d8497c111233467ce0ff5f326cee","category":"Environment"}
