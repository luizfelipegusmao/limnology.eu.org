Nanoscale wear particles (0.2-0.8Âµm) are a critical component in the activation of macrophages and inflammatory response [<a href=\"#ozae044.1048-B2\">2</a>]. Particle composition, identified using electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), can determine their site of origin [<a href=\"#ozae044.1048-B3\">3</a>] and is a critical factor in macrophage cytotoxicity and the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"#ozae044.1048-B4\">4</a>]. However, EDS can only provide part of the information required to understand the molecular interactions between patient tissue and wear debris. Organic/inorganic molecules and their interactions are not detected by EDS alone.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"492fa41fec6f533ede2d0e9543741e5457eed69c528f1fd5dfe68d654c279332","category":"Environment"}
