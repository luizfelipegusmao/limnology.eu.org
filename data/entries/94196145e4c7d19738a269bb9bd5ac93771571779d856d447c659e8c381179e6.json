{"title":"Optimizing Education with Data Analytics: A Feature Comparison of LMS and SIS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0459/v1","date":1715174039000,"content":"In the realm of educational technology, Data Analytics (DA) is reshaping teaching and learning. This paper investigates the impact of DA on education, specifically comparing Student Information Systems (SIS) and Learning Management Systems (LMS). Data-driven insights from SIS and LMS platforms enable educators to tailor instructional strategies to individual student needs effectively. While SIS manages student data for administrative tasks, LMS offers tools for content delivery and collaboration. Using the strengths of SIS and LMS, educators can optimise teaching and learning experiences, tracking student progress, and fostering collaboration. The comparison emphasises their distinct roles: SIS manages administrative tasks, while LMS focusses on content delivery and collaboration. Using both systems, educators improve the teaching and learning experience, leveraging DA for continuous improvement. In summary, this paper underscores the transformative role of DA in education, framed within the context of comparing the SIS and LMS functionalities. By examining the intersection of data-driven decision making and educational technology, educators are equipped with the tools and knowledge to harness the power of data for meaningful and impactful teaching and learning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94196145e4c7d19738a269bb9bd5ac93771571779d856d447c659e8c381179e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
