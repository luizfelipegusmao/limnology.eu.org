{"title":"Murine Xenograft Models as Preclinical Tools in Endometrial Cancer Research","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1473/v1","date":1729254162000,"content":"Murine xenograft models are valuable and increasingly used preclinical tools in cancer research to understand disease pathogenesis and guide treatment options. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the studies that employed mouse xenograft models, using cell-lines, patient-derived tumors, or organoids, in endometrial cancer (EC) research, detailing their methodology and main findings. We identified 27 articles reporting on heterotopic EC xenografts, including subcutaneous, subrenal capsule, intraperitoneal, and retro-orbital models, and 18 articles using orthotopic xenografts. Subcutaneous xenografts generated using either cell-lines or patient tumors have been widely used, however, their low engraftment rates and the inability to recapitulate main clinical features such as metastases limit their translational value. Subrenal capsule models showed improved engraftment rates compared to subcutaneous models, but tumors exhibited slower and constrained tumor growth. Orthotopic models are technically more challenging to generate and monitor, but tumor growth occurs in a relevant microenvironment and EC ortho-xenografts exhibit high engraftment rates and metastases to clinically relevant sites. Cell-line based xenograft (CDXs) models are attractive tools because they are convenient, easy to use, and amenable to genetic modifications, making them suitable for proof-of-concept approaches and large-scale studies. EC xenografts developed from patient tumors (PDTXs) are more labor/cost intensive for their establishment but can capture the genetic and molecular heterogeneity within and across histologic subtypes and can inform on personalized patient treatment. EC organoid-based xenograft (PDOXs) models combine advantages of both CDXs and PDTXs since are more time and cost effective, maintain faithfully tumor characteristics and therapeutic responses, and can be genetically modified.  \nDespite substantial progress in EC management, there are still several unmet needs. Efficient targeted treatments are currently indicated only for a small subgroup of patients, while women with recurrent or advanced stage EC have very few therapeutic options and their prognosis remains unfavorable. Novel (targeted) drugs, combinational regimens and tools to predict the real drug response in patients are urgently needed. Xenograft models are expected to inform on disease mechanisms and to help identify novel therapeutic options and the suitable target patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf418a4f0e26ad905851d2756c213b33d40ac07816ce69025161867c7e1e89cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
