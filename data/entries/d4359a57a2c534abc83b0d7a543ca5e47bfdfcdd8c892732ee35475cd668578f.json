{"title":"Current Status and Development Trend of Research on Polymer-based Kinetic Inhibitors for Natural Gas Hydrates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0073/v1","date":1719838998000,"content":"As the understanding of natural gas hydrates as a vast potential resource deepens, their importance as a future clean energy source becomes increasingly evident. However, natural gas hydrates tend to secondary generation during extraction and transportation, leading to safety issues such as pipeline blockages. Consequently, developing new and efficient natural gas hydrate inhibitors has become a focal point in hydrate research. Kinetic Hydrate Inhibitors (KHIs) offer an effective solution by disrupting the nucleation and growth processes of hydrates without altering their thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. This paper systematically reviews the latest research progress and development trends of KHIs for natural gas hydrates, covering their development history, classification, and inhibition mechanisms. It particularly focuses on the chemical properties, inhibition effects, and mechanisms of polymer inhibitors such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyvinylcaprolactam (PVCap). Studies indicate that these polymer inhibitors provide an economical and efficient solution due to their low dosage and environmental friendliness. Additionally, this paper explores the environmental impact and biodegradability of these inhibitors, offering guidance for future research, including the development, optimization, and environmental assessment of new inhibitors. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing research, this work aims to provide a theoretical foundation and technical reference for the commercial development of natural gas hydrates, promoting their safe and efficient use as a clean energy resource.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4359a57a2c534abc83b0d7a543ca5e47bfdfcdd8c892732ee35475cd668578f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
