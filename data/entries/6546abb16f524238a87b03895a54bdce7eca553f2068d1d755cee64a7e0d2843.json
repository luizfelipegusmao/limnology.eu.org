A total of 315 nursery pigs, 6.0 ± 1.2 kg body weight (BW), were allotted to one of five dietary treatments with 9 replicates (7 pigs/pen) in a randomized complete block design. Dietary treatments were PC: corn-soybean meal-based diet with 20% CM, NC: corn-soybean meal-based diet with 40% CM; NC+A: NC diet with acidifier at 1,500 ppm, NC+B: NC diet with encapsulated butyrate at 500 ppm, and NC+A+B: NC diet with acidifier and encapsulated butyrate. All diets were formulated to meet or exceed the nutrient requirements of NRC (2012). All pigs received a common Phase 1 nursery diet during week 1 following weaning. Experimental diets were provided in Phase 2 (wk 2 and 3) and Phase 3 (wk 4 to 6). Individual pig BW and pen feed consumption were measured for each phase to calculate growth performance. At the conclusion of each phase, blood samples were collected from one pig per pen for analysis of serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations. The selected pig was euthanized within 24 h, and its organ weights and pH of digesta were measured. The results were analyzed using MIXED procedure in SAS with the pen as an experimental unit. There was no difference in BW and average daily gain throughout the overall period. However, PC treatment exhibited greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) average daily feed intake in phase 3 by 18.2% and overall period by 13.4% compared with NC treatment and no difference with NC+A+B treatment. The NC+A and NC+A+B treatments tended to improve (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.10) gain to feed ratio in phase 3 by 17.9% and overall period by 16.1% compared with PC treatment, respectively. At the end of phase 3, the PC treatment tended (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.10) to have greater serum T4 concentrations compared with NC and NC+A treatments (3.2 vs 2.5 and 2.4 ug/dL, respectively), whereas there was no difference between PC and NC+A+B treatments. In phase 3, the thyroid gland weight for PC treatment was less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) than for NC treatment (0.156 vs 0.202 g/kg), whereas there was no difference among PC, NC+B, and NC+A+B treatments. In phase 3, dietary encapsulated butyrate decreased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) the pH of jejunal digesta compared with PC treatment (6.28 vs 7.01), and dietary encapsulated butyrate treatments (NC+B and NC+A+B) tended to decrease (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.10) the pH of hind-colonic digesta compared with the pH of PC treatment by 6.2% and 7.2%. In conclusion, dietary encapsulated butyrate in combination with acidifier may alleviate thyroid dysfunction that is anti-nutritional effect of high canola meal diets.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"6546abb16f524238a87b03895a54bdce7eca553f2068d1d755cee64a7e0d2843","category":"Environment"}
