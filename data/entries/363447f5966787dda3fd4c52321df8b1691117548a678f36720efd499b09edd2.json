{"title":"Evaluating the influence of working parameters on the efficiency of a solid oxide fuel cell by conducting sensitivity analysis using electrochemical and thermodynamic modeling","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14457?af=R","date":1726641668000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This research article presents an investigation conducted through a numerical model to analyze the influence of various operational parameters on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The parameters studied include operating temperature, current density, pressure, steam-to-carbon ratio, and fuel utilization. The electrochemical model employed the Butler-Volmer equation, Fick's model, and Ohm's law to calculate concentration, activation, and ohmic losses. The primary focus was on evaluating the generated power and electrical efficiency as performance metrics. The study revealed that increasing operating temperature and pressure resulted in higher power generation and specific optimum points were identified for optimal SOFC operation. Notably, the highest power generated was 812 kW, achieved at an operating temperature of 950 K and a current density of 18100 A/m<sup>2</sup>. Additionally, decreasing the fuel utilization factor to 55% at 15250 A/m<sup>2</sup> led to a power output of 706 kW. Similarly, at a current density of 17150 A/m<sup>2</sup> and a pressure of 400 kPa, the fuel cell generated about 780 kW of power. Furthermore, the research demonstrated that reducing the steam-to-carbon ratio increased power generation, with an optimum power output of 704 kW achieved at a current density of 16000 A/m<sup>2</sup> and a low steam-to-carbon ratio. Notably, this point also showcased the improved electrical efficiency of the solid oxide fuel cell. Overall, this study underscores the significance of specific operational factors that significantly impact SOFC performance. By comprehending these parameters, it becomes possible to enhance the utilization of solid oxide fuel cells across various applications.</p>","author":"Ahmed Mouissi, \nRabah Touaibi, \nHasan Köten","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"363447f5966787dda3fd4c52321df8b1691117548a678f36720efd499b09edd2","category":"Environment"}
