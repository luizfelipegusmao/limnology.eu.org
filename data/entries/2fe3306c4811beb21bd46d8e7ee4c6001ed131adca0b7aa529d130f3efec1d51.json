{"title":"Thiazole Functionalization of Thiosemicarbazone for Cu(II) Complexation: Toward Highly Efficient Anticancer Drugs with Promising Oral Bioavailability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1597/v1","date":1721383013000,"content":"In this work, we report the synthesis of a new thiosemicarbazone-based drug of N'-(di(pyridin-2-yl)methylene)-4-(thiazol-2-yl)piperazine-1-carbothiohydrazide (HL) featuring a thiazole spectator for the efficient coordination with Cu(II) to give [CuCl(L)]2 (1) and [Cu(NO3)(L)]2 (2). Both 1 and 2 exhibit dimeric structures ascribed to the presence of di-2-pyridylketone moieties that demonstrate dual functions of chelation and intermolecular bridging. HL, 1 and 2 are highly toxic against hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines Hep-G2, PLC/PRF/5, and HuH-7, with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values as low as 3.26 nmol/mL (HL), 2.18 nmol/mL (1), and 2.54 × 10−5 nmol/mL (2) for PLC/PRF/5. While the free ligand HL may elicit its anticancer effect via sequestration of bio-relevant metal ions (i.e. Fe3+ and Cu2+), 1 and 2 are also capable of generating cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Our preliminary pharmacokinetic studies revealed that oral administration (per os, PO) of HL has a significantly longer half-life t1/2 of 21.61 ± 9.4 h, nearly doubled as compared to that of the intravenous (i.v.) administration of 11.88 ± 1.66 h, certifying HL as an effective chemotherapeutic drug via PO administration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2fe3306c4811beb21bd46d8e7ee4c6001ed131adca0b7aa529d130f3efec1d51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
