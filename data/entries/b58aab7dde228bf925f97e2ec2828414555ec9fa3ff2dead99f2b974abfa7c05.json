Feed additives with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties could help pigs cope with the negative impact of heat stress. The study evaluated the efficacy of feeding diets containing betaine and a plant-based antioxidant blend (AOB) on the growth performance and carcass quality parameters of commercially housed fattening pigs under heat-stress conditions. The study design was a randomized completed block with 2 dietary treatments using 836 pigs [starting body weight (BW) = 22.7 Â± 3.8 kg) and 22 replicate pens/treatment (19 mixed-sex pigs/pen). The treatments were a standard four-phase commercial grow-finish corn-soy based diet (Control) and Control plus 1 kg/MT each of betaine and AOB (BetAOB). Pigs were subjected to a heat stress challenge by increasing the ambient temperature from 18 to 29 <sup>o</sup>C for 8 pigs/d (1000 to 1800 h) from d 10 to 42 and d 85 to 106 of the study. Body weight and feed disappearance of each pen were recorded before and after the heat stress challenge and every third week to calculate average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Morbidity and mortality were recorded daily. Data were analyzed using PROC GLMMIX of SAS with appropriate models for the different data distributions. Pen was the experimental unit. The overall herd mortality was 1.3% and 0.7% of pigs received medical treatment for leg problems. Treatment did not affect the percentage of pigs culled (<span>P</span> = 0.48; Control = 6.7% vs. BetAOB = 5.7%). Pigs fed BetAOB tended to have a decreased FCR (-0.06 kg/kg; <span>P</span> = 0.10) during the first heat stress challenge (d 22 to 42). Further, BetAOB-fed pigs had decreased FCR (-0.07 kg/kg; <span>P</span> = 0.02) and tended to have a greater ADG (+28 g/d; <span>P</span> = 0.07) from d 43 to 61. Pigs fed BetAOB tended to have decreased ADFI (-89 g/d; <span>P</span> = 0.06) from d 62 to 84. Consequently, pigs fed BetAOB had less (<span>P</span> = 0.04) overall FCR compared with the Control (2.53 vs. 2.48 kg/kg). Treatment did not affect carcass weight (<span>P</span> = 0.76), carcass yield (<span>P</span> = 0.76), or any of the carcass quality parameters measured (all <span>P</span> &gt; 0.11). In summary, under heat-stress conditions, pigs receiving a diet containing 1 kg/MT each of betaine and AOB had better feed efficiency than those receiving the Control diet. Therefore, feeding finishing pigs diets supplemented with betaine and the antioxidant blend can help minimize the negative effect of heat stress by improving feed efficiency.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"b58aab7dde228bf925f97e2ec2828414555ec9fa3ff2dead99f2b974abfa7c05","category":"Environment"}
