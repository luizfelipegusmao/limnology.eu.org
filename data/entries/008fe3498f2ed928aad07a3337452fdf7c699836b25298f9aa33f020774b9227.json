{"title":"Critical Discourse Analysis of Student Testimonials of an Erasmus International Exchange Programme","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1946/v1","date":1714459629000,"content":"Given the increased provision of international exchange programmes in higher education, this paper examines students’ perceptions of their learning process in one Erasmus+ programme in Food Innovation and Product Design. Using evaluation model of international exchange programme and triple helix model as the analytical framework, students’ testimonials from 2015–2021 were analysed using a critical discourse analysis. EU and non-EU students had similar perceptions of learning outcomes related to knowledge of the food innovation industry, but non-EU students had a stronger sense of awareness of both the international context and multicultural interaction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"008fe3498f2ed928aad07a3337452fdf7c699836b25298f9aa33f020774b9227","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
