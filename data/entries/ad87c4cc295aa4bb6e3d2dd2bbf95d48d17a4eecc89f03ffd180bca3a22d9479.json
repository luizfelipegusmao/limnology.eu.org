{"title":"Combined leaf gas-exchange system for model assessment","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/2982/7617027?rss=1","date":1709251200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Leaf gas-exchange measurements are useful in assessing plant environmental responses. However, uncertainties in the leaf gas-exchange model potentially limit its application. The main challenge in the model-dependent calculations is to detect violations of assumptions. Here, we developed a system that integrates into one instrument the direct measurement of leaf intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and the standard open-flow (OF) and novel open-diffusion (OD) systems for flux measurement. In the OD system, a gas-permeable membrane between the leaf ambient air and outside air creates CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O differentials, rather than the air flow in the OF chamber. We measured hypostomatous and amphistomatous leaves of several species with different photosynthetic capacities [sunflower (<span>Helianthus annuus</span>), grape (<span>Vitis vinifera</span>), lemon (<span>Citrus limon</span>), and cherry (<span>Prunus avium</span>)]. The CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O differentials in the OD system strictly depend on the flux measured by the OF system. The lower permeability of the membrane resulted in a larger differential per flux, indicating that the OD system can increase the resolution for a small flux. An analysis of the conductance model along with observations suggested that cuticle and leaf intercellular conductances and the unsaturation of leaf humidity contributed to discrepancies between the direct measurement and standard calculation. The combined system developed here provides an opportunity to address these overlooked concepts in leaf gas exchange.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"ad87c4cc295aa4bb6e3d2dd2bbf95d48d17a4eecc89f03ffd180bca3a22d9479","category":"Environment"}
