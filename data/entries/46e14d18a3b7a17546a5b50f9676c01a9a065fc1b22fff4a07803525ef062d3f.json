This qualitative study explores the multifaceted nature of trust in supplier-buyer relationships across diverse industries. Through in-depth interviews and thematic analysis, the study examines how trust develops, evolves, and impacts business interactions. Participants from various organizational settings provided insights into the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of trust, highlighting its role as a strategic asset in fostering resilience and competitive advantage. Findings underscored the importance of transparency, communication, and shared values in building trust, with emotional bonds and cultural compatibility enhancing partnership longevity and mutual commitment. Challenges such as asymmetrical power dynamics, economic uncertainties, and regulatory pressures were identified as barriers to trust, necessitating proactive strategies and ethical standards to mitigate risks. Practical implications include promoting open communication, aligning incentives, and cultivating a culture of trust within supply chains to enhance operational efficiencies and innovation.
