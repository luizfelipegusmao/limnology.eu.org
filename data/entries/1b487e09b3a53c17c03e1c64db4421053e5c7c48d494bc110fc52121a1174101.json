{"title":"Geological Wonders of Italy: The Coveted Privilege of Disseminating Geology and Geomorphology through Science Documentaries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2178/v1","date":1722005839000,"content":"This paper proposes an unusual method for the dissemination of geological sciences and the promotion of geotourism: the scientific documentary, where a representative itinerary of geological and geomorphological evolution of this portion of the Apennines was presented. The considerations that led to the identification of the geological route proposed to the editorial staff of FOCUS TV are presented in detail. At each stop there was an explanation by academic professors and researchers, mainly from the Geology Division of the University of Camerino (MC), who explained in detail the outcrops. During the episode, insights were also given into the anthropogenic frequentation of the epigean caves in Frasassi (AN), ancient places of frequentation and worship thanks to their suggestiveness and the sense of sublime that they can elicit.\nIn addition to the illustration of the individual stops, the article offers further insights into the geomorphology of the most important geosites depicted, all of which are in nature parks or protected areas and characterized by a high landscape value.\nThe result was the production of an episode of the television program 'Geological Wonders of Italy: The Marche and Umbria Regions', which was broadcast in October 2022 by the Italian national Mediaset group.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b487e09b3a53c17c03e1c64db4421053e5c7c48d494bc110fc52121a1174101","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
