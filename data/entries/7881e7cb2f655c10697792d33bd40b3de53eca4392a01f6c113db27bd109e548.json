{"title":"Connectivity between Siberian river runoff and the lower limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12696?af=R","date":1727376791000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Freshwater from the Arctic participates in the globally important Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). We use high-resolution, in situ observations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence to trace the origins of freshwater and organic carbon in the densest component of the AMOC, namely Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW). We find a distinct terrestrial DOM signal in DSOW and trace it upstream to the Siberian shelves in the Arctic Ocean. This implies a riverine origin of freshwater in DSOW. We estimate that the Siberian Shelf water contribution constitutes approximately 1% of DSOW. Ocean circulation modeling confirms the inferred pathway and highlights Denmark Strait as an important location for the entrainment of the riverine signal into DSOW. Our proposed method can be deployed on a range of observing systems to elucidate freshwater dispersion across the Arctic and subarctic, thereby contributing to the broader discussion on freshwater impacts and organic carbon sequestration in the AMOC.</p>","author":"Caroline V.
