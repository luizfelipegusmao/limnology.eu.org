{"title":"Pre-Earthquake Anomaly Analysis of Geoelectric Field Stations Surrounding the M6.2 Jishishan Earthquake","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1103/v1","date":1721098013000,"content":"Through analysis of the constituent components of the observation data from 12 geoe-lectric field stations located approximately 600 km form the epicenter of the Jishishan Ms6.2 earthquake, this study reveals that during earthquake preparation and occurrence, the geoelec-tric field at each station exhibit non-uniform variations. These variations are characterized by significant decreases or increases in correlation coefficients between different azimuths (δxy) and between long and short polar distances within the same azimuth (δxx). Additionally, there are discrete or extruding changes observed in the dominant azimuth angles of the telluric field at the stations, ranging approximately from 40° to 90°. These anomalies indicate local site effects and exhibit quasi-synchronous temporal characteristics. The study found that stations located in regions with intense tectonic activities, such as Menyuan and Jingtai, experience more significant anomalous changes influenced by the tectonic activities of the Qaidam-Qilian Mountain block. When multiple stations with anomalous changes are used to determine the earthquake epicenter, earthquakes often occur within or near the intersection area of the predicted ranges of these sta-tions. The specific time of earthquake occurrence shows no clear relationship with the locations or tectonic activities of the stations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"99b2f885f083b2ec729cf1817455231ecaf0928f5e4f99cf26df4e932bd64eed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
