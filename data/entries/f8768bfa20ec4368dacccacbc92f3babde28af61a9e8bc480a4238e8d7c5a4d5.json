{"title":"Ruderal Plants in Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil: Presence, Collection Status and Attributions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1737/v1","date":1719300517000,"content":"Ruderal plants designate native or exotic plant species that grow spontaneously in anthropized environments, being important from the ecological succession perspective. The present study aimed to identify ruderal plants that occur in an anthropized area of the Campus Floresta of the Federal University of Acre (UFAC), in the municipality of Cruzeiro do Sul, in the Southwest Amazon. Toward this end, botanical material was collected and herborized, and identified based on consultation of the specialized literature, virtual herbariums, and by comparison with the Campus Floresta Herbarium (CFCZS) collection. Finally, these data were incorporated to the referred collection, according to the usual plant systematics procedures. The results revealed 28 species and 28 genera, distributed in 14 families. The most representative families were Fabaceae, Malvaceae and Poaceae, with four species each; followed by Asteraceae with three; Cyperaceae, Rubiaceae and Amaranthaceae with two each; and the others, Plantaginaceae, Ochnaceae, Urticaceae, Verbenaceae, Iridaceae, Lamiaceae and Dennstaedtiaceae with one species each. The occurrence of predominant species in planted pastures, agricultural use, and mining area ecosystems is highlighted, such as Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn., Andropogon bicornis L., and Crotalaria micans Link.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8768bfa20ec4368dacccacbc92f3babde28af61a9e8bc480a4238e8d7c5a4d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
