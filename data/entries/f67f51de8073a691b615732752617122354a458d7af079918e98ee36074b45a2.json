The real-time RPA method is 10-fold more sensitive than RPA-LFD method. The exact number of CyHV-3 can be calculated in each sample by real-time RPA. The sera from koi also can be tested in these methods. In addition, no cross-reaction was observed with other related pathogens, including carp oedema virus (CEV), spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV), cyprinid herpesvirus 1(CyHV-1), cyprinid herpesvirus 2(CyHV-2), type I grass carp reovirus (GCRV-I), type II GCRV (GCRV-II), type III GCRV (GCRV-III), and Aeromonas hydrophila.</p>","author":"Yingying Li, \nRuifan Li, \nXubing Mo, \nYingying Wang, \nJiyuan Yin, \nSven M.
