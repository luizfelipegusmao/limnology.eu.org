{"title":"411 Designing academic talent pipelines to meet employment needs of the animal science industry","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/423/7757255?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>While industry and academia serve different roles when it comes to propelling the animal science industry forward, there is a need to more formally bridge efforts between industry and academia when developing employees, both future and current. Commencement speeches typically include reflections on the great accomplishments students will achieve as they begin their industry careers. But how do animal science educators ensure programming is designed to fill the learner’s metaphoric toolbox with the right skills to tackle the complicated, and ever-evolving challenges of the animal science industry? Design of academic programming needs to be strategic and interdisciplinary in order to equip graduates with the skills needed to solve the wicked problems present in animal science. Often the design process begins with an identified need or gap in knowledge that industry has observed or anticipates based on strategic initiatives. Once a connection is made between a segment of the industry and an academic institution with the willingness to fill the education gap surrounding the identified industry problem, a pipeline of employees educated in that area of need can be established. There are three key characteristics often observed when evaluating successful academic talent pipelines. First, industry must be integrated into all aspects of the process: development, launch, and delivery. Involving subject matter experience from industry allows for real-world experience-based learning in a variety of forms. This could be on-site tours/training, connecting students with industry mentors, or bringing industry-based guest lecturers and panels into the classroom for students to network with. Industry has specific views on how they want to be involved with academia, listening to that feedback ensures respectful use of professional’s time, and effective education for future employees helping with job placement. Secondly, successful academic talent pipeline programs are able to embrace interdisciplinary skill development, while not losing sight of students’ areas of interest. It is crucial that as students are recruited to industry need-based programs, students see clear connections between skills learned and real-world application. Thirdly, successful programs meet students where they are. There is a growing population of students pursuing non-traditional education pathways to meet their career goals. Academic programs need to be prepared to train both the next generation as well as the current generation of employees in the animal science industry. While the diversity in student background experience escalates dramatically when you blend traditional and non-traditional students in the classroom, the enriching insight and discussion that follows a well-designed program highlights the importance of leveraging experience-based learning and fostering an inclusive environment for all types of learners.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"f3dc6b60d19791888339f0234a99bfb1a67b79239d7e4b75f7517080a7c778f6","category":"Environment"}
