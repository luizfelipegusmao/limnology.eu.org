{"title":"Unveiling the Doping and Temperature Dependent Properties of Organic Semiconductor Orthorhombic Rubrene from First-Principles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1483/v1","date":1711367499000,"content":"Due to its large hole mobility, Organic Rubrene (C42H28) has attracted research questions on its applications in electronic devices. In this work, extensive first-principles calculations were made to predict some temperature and doping dependent properties of Organic Semi- conductor Rubrene. We use Density Functional Theory (DFT) to investigate the electronic structure, elastic and transport properties of the Orthorhombic phase of the Rubrene compound. The calcu- lated band structure shows the Orthorhombic phase has a direct bandgap of 1.26 eV. From the Vickers hardness (1.080 GPa), our calculations show that Orthorhombic Rubrene is not a super hard material and can find useful application as a flexible semicon- ductor. The calculated transport Inverse Effective Mass and Elec- tronic Fitness Function show that the Orthorhombic Rubrene Crystal Structure is a p-type thermoelectric material at high temperatures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8cd917ccc8692641436485863c9feb6de182f8950a867f784a4cfa62a4fb195c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
