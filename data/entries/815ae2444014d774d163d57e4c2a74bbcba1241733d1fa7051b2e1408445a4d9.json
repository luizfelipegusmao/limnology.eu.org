{"title":"288 Maternal fatty acid supplementation and its impact on dam and offspring performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/424/7757493?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Fatty acid supplementation has multiple benefits to the offspring when supplemented to the dam during pregnancy; limited to no benefits to the dam have been documented. We hypothesized that maternal fatty acid supplementation during pregnancy would result in improved body weight (BW) and body condition score (BCS) in the ewes and improve lamb growth until weaning and male offspring growth following weaning when ewes were supplemented fatty acids. On d -8 of the study (35 d of gestation), all ewes were weighed, BCS was collected, and pregnancy status determined. Pregnant Targhee ewes (n = 83) were assigned to a treatment group based on age, BW, and BCS, to one of four treatment gr: 1) 22 g/ewe daily of Ca salts of saturated and monosaturated fatty acids based on palmitic and oleic acids (CON; EnerGII, Virtus Nutrition, LLC, Corcoran, CA); 2) 22 g/ewe daily of Ca salts of PUFA based on eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids (ɷ-3, Strata; Virtus Nutrition LLC); 3) 22 g/ewe daily of Ca salts of PUFA based on linoleic acids (ɷ-6, Prequel; Virtus Nutrition LLC); or 4) 11 g/ewe of Ca-salts enriched with EPA+DHA (Strata) and 11 g/ewe of Ca-salts enriched with linoleic acid (Strata) daily (ɷ-3 + 6; Virtus Nutrition LLC). Fatty acid supplementation occurred from d 0 until d 88 of the study, and all ewes were fed grass hay. Ewe BW and BCS were recorded at d -8, 51, 93, and 240 of the study. Twenty-four hours after birth, lamb sex was identified and weighed (n = 136 lamb; CON = 33; ɷ-3 = 32; ɷ-6 = 36; ɷ-3 + 6 = 35). Lambs were weighed at d 175 and 240 (weaning) of the study (n = 86; CON = 22; ɷ-3 = 22; ɷ-6 = 21; ɷ-3 + 6 = 21). Body weight, BCS, and scrotal circumference (SC) were collected on all ram lambs at d 352, 380, and 408. No differences were observed in ewe BW or BCS at d -8, 51, or 93 of the study (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.26) between the treatment groups (Table 1). A treatment × day interaction was observed at d 240 of the study when ɷ-6 ewes had a greater (<span>P</span> = 0.03) BCS compared with group cohorts. No differences in lamb birth weight, lamb weight or average daily gain at d 175 or 240 of the study between treatment groups (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.25; Table 2). No differences were reported in ram lamb BW, BCS, or SC at d 352, 380, and 408 (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.31; Table 3). These results indicate that maternal fatty acid supplementation alters ewe BCS at the time of weaning; however, supplementation does not impact lamb growth from birth until weaning or ram lamb growth and scrotal circumference.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"815ae2444014d774d163d57e4c2a74bbcba1241733d1fa7051b2e1408445a4d9","category":"Environment"}
