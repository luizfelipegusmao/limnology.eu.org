Unlike other platforms like liquid helium, ultracold atoms have a viable theoretical framework for dynamics, but simulations push the edge of current classical computers. We present the largest simulations of fermionic quantum turbulence to date and explain the computing technology needed, especially improvements in the Eigenvalue soLvers for Petaflop Applications library that enable us to diagonalize matrices of record size (millions by millions). We quantify how dissipation and thermalization proceed in fermionic quantum turbulence by using the internal structure of vortices as a new probe of the local effective temperature. All simulation data and source codes are made available to facilitate rapid scientific progress in the field of ultracold Fermi gases.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"4c349dcebdf707c3dca23f38b94e0a6b953f76d365deae9edda96d53ae9e24ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
