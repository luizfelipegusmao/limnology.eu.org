{"title":"Genetic and Epigenetic Interactions Involved in Senescence of Stem Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0653/v1","date":1723425622000,"content":"Cellular senescence is a permanent condition of cell cycle arrest caused by a progressive shorten-ing of telomeres defined as replicative senescence. Stem cells may also undergo an accelerated se-nescence response, distinct from telomere shortening, known as premature senescence as a re-sponse to different stress agents. Various treatment protocols have been developed based on epi-genetic changes in cells throughout senescence, using different drugs and antioxidants, senolytic vaccines, or reprogramming of somatic senescent cells using Yamanaka factors. Even with all the recent advancements, it is still unknown how different epigenetic modifications interact with ge-netic profile and how other factors such as microbiota physiological conditions, psychological states and diet influence the interaction between genetic and epigenetic pathways. The aim of this review is to highlight the new epigenetic modifications that are involved in stem cell senescence. Here, we review recent senescence-related epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation, chro-matin remodeling, histone modification, RNA modification, and non-coding RNA regulation outlining new possible targets for therapy of aging-related diseases. The advantages and disad-vantages of the animal models used in the study of cellular senescence are also briefly presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e30d8acc996556f82b32d18a0985c022e9a1b14b53a60dd8f95bab7aaca65536","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
