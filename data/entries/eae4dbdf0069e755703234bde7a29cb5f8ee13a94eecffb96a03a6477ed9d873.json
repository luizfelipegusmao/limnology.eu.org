{"title":"Results of the Terrestrial Laser Scanning Survey in the Underground Mining of the Oyu Tolgoi Project to Determine Cross Penetrating Length and Volumes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1583/v2","date":1722920026000,"content":": In this paper, the results of a high-precision control survey carried out in the underground mining of the Oyu Tolgoi project using terrestrial laser scanning technology are presented. The purpose of the measurements was to ensure that the direction, total length and volume of the penetration and excavation works were being implemented in accordance with the planned and designed dimensions. The coordinates of the geodetic traverse checkpoints were also assessed. In addition, we checked a traverse network of 18 checkpoints in the tunnel of the selected underground level. These checkpoints were repeatedly measured four times by two using readings of the Trimble S7 1‚Äù total station and were processed using the Compass/Bowditch method with Trimble Business Center software. All points except for one were within the tolerance limits. Based on these points, the excavation length and volumes were determined using the terrestrial laser scanners (TLSs) Trimble X7 and Trimble SX12 [25]. The difference between the planned work quantity provided by the Oyu Tolgoi project and the actual values measured using laser scanner was calculated with the comparative method. The TLS partial control measurements in the excavations made through the ore bodies revealed a length of 20285.72m and a volume of 441128.80m3 for the seven underground mine levels, while their project values were 16158.26m length and 422837.50m3 volume.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eae4dbdf0069e755703234bde7a29cb5f8ee13a94eecffb96a03a6477ed9d873","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
