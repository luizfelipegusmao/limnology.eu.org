Fraser</p>\r\n\r\nAtlantic ghost crabs (<i>Ocypode quadrata</i>) are predators of beach-nesting shorebird nests and chicks on the United Statesâ€™ Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Ghost crabs may also disturb birds, altering foraging, habitat use, or nest and brood attendance patterns. Shorebird conservation strategies often involve predator and disturbance management to improve reproductive success, but efforts rarely target ghost crabs. Despite the threat to shorebird reproductive success, ghost crabs are a poorly understood part of the beach ecosystem and additional knowledge about ghost crab habitat selection is needed to inform shorebird conservation. We monitored ghost crab activity, defined as burrow abundance, throughout the shorebird breeding season on Metompkin Island, Virginia, an important breeding site for piping plovers (<i>Charadrius melodus</i>) and American oystercatchers (<i>Haematopus palliatus</i>). We counted burrows at shorebird nests and random locations throughout the breeding season and investigated whether ghost crab activity was greater at nest sites relative to random locations without shorebird nests. While we observed burrows at all nest sites (<i>n</i> = 63 nests), we found that burrow counts were lower at piping plover nests with shell cover, relative to random locations with no shell cover. Ghost crabs may avoid piping plover nest sites due to anti-predator behaviors from incubating adults or differences in microhabitat characteristics selected by piping plovers. We also investigated the effects of habitat type, date, and air temperature on the abundance of ghost crab burrows. We found that while crab burrows were present across the barrier island landscape, there were more burrows in sandy, undisturbed habitats behind the dunes, relative to wave-disturbed beach. Additionally, ghost crab activity increased later in the shorebird breeding season. Understanding when and where ghost crabs are most likely to be active in the landscape can aid decision-making to benefit imperiled shorebird populations.","author":"Mikayla N.
