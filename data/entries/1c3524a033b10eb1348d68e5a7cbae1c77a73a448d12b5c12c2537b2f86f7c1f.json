{"title":"Lassa Fever: Critical Review and Prospects for Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1745/v1","date":1721650653000,"content":"Lassa Fever is a deadly viral haemorrhagic disease, causing annually several hundreds of deaths in the Gulf of Guinea. This zoonotic disease is primarily transmitted to humans by rodents of the genus Mastomys, while secondary interhuman transmission accounts for approximately 20% of cases. Although this disease has been endemic in rural zones of the Gulf for hundreds of years, it is also characterised by epidemic outbreaks in the dry season, responsible for heavy death tolls. No licensed vaccine or satisfying treatment is currently available. Disease management is hindered by the incomplete knowledge of the epidemiology and distribution of the disease, resulting from an inadequate health and surveillance system. Additional scientific constraints such as the genetic diversity of the virus and the lack of understanding of the mechanisms of immune protection complexify the development of a vaccine. The intricate socio-economic context in the affected regions, and the lack of monetary incentive for drug development, allow the disease to persist in some of West Africa’s poorest communities. The increase in the number of reported cases and in the fatality rate, the expansion of the endemic area, as well as the threat Lassa Fever represents internationally should urge the global community to work on the disease control and prevention. The disease control requires collaborative research for medical countermeasures and tailored public health policies. Lassa Fever, created by the interconnection between animals, humans, and ecosystems, and embedded in an intricate social context, should be addressed with a ‘One Health’ approach. This article provides an overview of Lassa Fever, focusing on Nigeria, and discusses the perspectives for the control of disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1c3524a033b10eb1348d68e5a7cbae1c77a73a448d12b5c12c2537b2f86f7c1f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
