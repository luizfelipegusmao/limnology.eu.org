In preclinical animal studies, a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes eNAMPT has been generated to successfully reduce the extent of inflammatory cascade activation. Thus, the rapid detection of eNAMPT concentration in plasma samples at the point of care (POC) would be of great utility in assessing the benefit of administering an anti-eNAMPT therapeutic. To determine the feasibility of this POC test, we conducted a particle immunoagglutination assay on a paper microfluidic platform and quantified its extent with a flow rate measurement in less than 1 min. A smartphone and cloud-based Google Colab were used to analyze the flow rates automatically. A horizontal flow model and an immunoagglutination binding model were evaluated to optimize the detection time, sample dilution, and particle concentration. This assay successfully detected eNAMPT in both human whole blood and plasma samples (diluted to 10 and 1%), with the limit of detection of 1–20 pg/mL (equivalent to 0.1–0.2 ng/mL in undiluted blood and plasma) and a linear range of 5–40 pg/mL. Furthermore, the smartphone POC assay distinguished clinical samples with low, mid, and high eNAMPT concentrations. Together, these results indicate this POC assay, which utilizes low-cost materials, time-effective methods, and a straightforward immunoassay (without surface immobilization), may reliably allow rapid determination of eNAMPT blood/plasma levels to advantage patient stratification in clinical trials and guide ALT-100 mAb therapeutic decision-making.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"5b68b840b52621e22861f9bf50f5e26c29f4e43d072675fd3ade52902f50446e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
