{"title":"Advancing Secure and Efficient Sensor Data Integration in Smart Cities: A Blockchain-Based Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0230/v1","date":1717566298000,"content":"As technology advances, people are increasingly adopting IoT (Internet of Things) devices in smart cities. These devices are equipped with sensors that are connected everywhere, from energy infrastructure and transportation to telecommunications, health and human services, waste management, public safety, and more. People want to access sensor data anytime and everywhere to make better decisions and improve their lives. To achieve this, a sensor integration model has been developed where multiple sensors are integrated under one gateway to manage and share sensor data. However, effective sharing of sensor data requires data security, privacy, confidentiality, fairness, effective architectural design, and low communication and computation costs. These issues need to be addressed in the sensor integration model in smart cities. Existing storage models face challenges in managing sensor data effectively. To overcome these issues and hurdles, a data storage framework leveraging blockchain technology has been proposed within the sensor integration model. This framework ensures data security, privacy, confidentiality, and a fair and transparent financial model, all while minimizing communication and computation costs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1d047149d12645d90a31a587e3780b65889ef2c72e4ba08eea563da6c8fb593","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
