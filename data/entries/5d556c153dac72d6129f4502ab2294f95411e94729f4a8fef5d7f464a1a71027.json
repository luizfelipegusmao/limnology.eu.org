{"title":"Microscopy and Machine Learning Segmentation Methods for Fatigue Fracture Surface Defect Analyses of LPBF Ti-6Al-4V","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.514/7720111?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The first author was recruited by Terry Mitchell to join CWRU in January 1986 as an Assistant Professor from a post-doc appointment at University of Cambridge. A number of fruitful interactions evolved over the years with Terry and collaborators at CWRU and LANL, using microscopy as a tool to unravel various metallurgical and materials science mysteries. This talk will focus on our recent work that attempts to use machine learning algorithms for feature segmentation to characterize fatigue fracture surfaces of additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V. Process-induced defects were identified and quantified by feature training an image classification system using SEM images of fatigue fracture surfaces. Process-induced defects were found to range in size, shape, and population due to variations in AM process parameters. All process-induced defects across each fracture surface were quantified, with ‘killer’ fatigue crack initiating defects being identified. The fracture surface defect characteristics are compared to the corresponding S-N fatigue data for defect-based fatigue life modeling in a fatigue initiating defect-based Kitagawa-Murakami-type approach. In addition, this computer vision method is compared to ground truth manual quantification of fracture surface defects. The advantages and challenges of various imaging techniques and ML algorithms to streamline fracture surface defect quantification will be discussed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5d556c153dac72d6129f4502ab2294f95411e94729f4a8fef5d7f464a1a71027","category":"Environment"}
