{"title":"Celestial and Quantum Propagation, Spinning, and Interaction as 4D Relativistic Cloud-Worlds Embedded in a 4D Conformal Bulk: From String to Cloud Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202010.0320/v9","date":1673485373000,"content":"Considerable efforts have been devoted to modifying gravity, which aim to elucidate the possible existence or nature of dark matter and energy, describe observational data more effectively, and formulate quantum gravity. In addition, despite the immense success of the quantum field theory, the framework requires renormalization techniques and breaks down at high energies. Recently, the Planck legacy 2018 release has confirmed the existence of an enhanced lensing amplitude in the cosmic microwave background power spectra, which prefers a positively curved early Universe with a confidence level higher than 99%. This study considers the implied curvature of the early Universe as the curvature of “the background or 4D conformal bulk as a manifestation of vacuum energy” and distinguishes it from the localized curvature that is induced in the bulk by the presence of celestial objects that are regarded as ”4D relativistic cloud-worlds.” Analogously, because gravity appears to emerge owing to spacetime curvature and does not exhibit critical characteristics shared by other fields, it has been incorporated as the local curvature of the bulk affecting the embedded quantum fields that are regarded as propagating “4D relativistic quantum clouds.” To consider the effects of the bulk on embedded clouds, this paper presents interaction field equations in terms of brane-world modified gravity and the perspective of geometrization of the quantum mechanics wherein gravity is manifested by the curvature of 4D conformal bulk as an indicator of the field strength of vacuum energy on the embedded 4D relativistic clouds in addition to the boundary interactions, which could remove the singularities and satisfy a conformal invariance theory. A visualization of the evolution of the 4D relativistic cloud-worlds over the conformal spacetime of the 4D bulk is presented, whereas the standard said theories can be recovered from the interaction field equations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5332dad4cb2e52e7e2b8dc889904a138156ce0321e48e4685339296109f3c0d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
