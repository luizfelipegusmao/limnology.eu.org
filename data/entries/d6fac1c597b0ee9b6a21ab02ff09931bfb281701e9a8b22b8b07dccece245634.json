{"title":"A Systematic Review of the Current State of Numerical Groundwater Modeling in Latin American Countries: Challenges and Future Research","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1394/v1","date":1726649703000,"content":"In arid and semi-arid regions, groundwater is often the only available source of water. However, overexploitation and pollution have led to a decrease in both the quantity and quality of ground-water. Therefore, proper management of groundwater resources is essential to promote sustainable development. Numerical simulation has emerged as a valuable tool to address these challenges due to its ability to accurately and efficiently model groundwater systems. This systematic review aims to evaluate the current knowledge on the use of numerical groundwater flow models for planning and water resources management in Latin American countries. A total of 166 research articles published between years 2000 and 2024. We analyzed, summarizing details as: the study regions, numerical simulation methods and software, performance metrics, modeling units, modeling limitations, and prediction scenarios. In addition, we discuss alternatives to address the constraints and difficulties and suggests recommendations for future research. Continued research, improvement and de-velopment of numerical groundwater models is essential to ensure the sustainability of groundwater resources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6fac1c597b0ee9b6a21ab02ff09931bfb281701e9a8b22b8b07dccece245634","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
