Here, we describe a non-lethal method for detecting the tapeworm <i>Eubothrium crassum</i> in fish using anal swabs and real-time PCR detection. Two assays were developed to detect cytochrome oxidase I (COI) mitochondrial DNA and 18S ribosomal DNA sequences of <i>E. crassum</i>, respectively. The assays were tested on swab samples from confirmed pathogen free Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i> L.) and on samples from farmed Atlantic salmon, where the presence and intensity of parasites had been established through autopsy. The COI assay was shown to be specific to <i>E. crassum</i>, while the 18S assay also amplified the closely related <i>E. salvelini</i>, a species infecting Arctic charr (<i>Salvelinus alpinus</i> L.) in freshwater. The COI assay detected <i>E. crassum</i> in all field samples regardless of parasite load while the 18S assay failed to detect the parasite in two samples. The results thus demonstrates that this non-lethal approach can effectively detect <i>E. crassum</i> and can be a valuable tool in assessing the prevalence of infection in farmed salmon, aiding in treatment decisions and evaluating treatment effectiveness.</p>","author":"Haakon Hansen, \nBjørn Spilsberg, \nSigmund Sevatdal, \nTrine Sakariassen, \nChristoph Hahn, \nSaima Nasrin Mohammad, \nEgil Karlsbakk","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"ccfaa65e65cf38b9afa1313b7d72b19bf348665961c27ec51913aca4a2864761","category":"Environment"}
