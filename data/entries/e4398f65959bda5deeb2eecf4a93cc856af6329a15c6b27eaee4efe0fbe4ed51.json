{"title":"Effect of Tacticity on London Dispersive Surface Energy, Polar Free Energy, and Lewis Acid-Base Surface Energies of Poly Methyl Methacrylate by Inverse Gas Chromatography","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0863/v1","date":1713107474000,"content":"This research was devoted to study the effect of the tacticity of PMMA on the surface physicochemical properties such as the London dispersive component of the surface energy of the polymer, the polar and dispersive free energies, the Lewis’s acid-base surface parameters, and the Lewis acid and base surface energies of atactic, isotactic and syndiotactic PMMAs as a function of the temperature. Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) at infinite dilution was used to determine the surface thermodynamic properties of PMMA at different tacticities. The experimental values of the net retention time and volume of model organic molecules adsorbed on the atactic, isotactic and syndiotactic PMMAs, were obtained by IGC technique at infinite dilution. The London dispersion interaction energy was used for the separation of the polar and dispersive energy of the different n-alkanes and polar solvents adsorbed on the different PMMA surfaces. The London dispersive surface energy γ_s^d (T) of PMMAs was determined by applying the Hamieh thermal model that took into account the effect of the temperature on the surface area of adsorbed molecules. The obtained results showed non-linear variations of γ_s^d (T) of atactic, isotactic, and syndiotactic PMMAs with three maxima characterizing the three transition temperatures of PMMAs, T_g, T_g and T_(liq-liq)  with a shift of these temperatures with the isotactic and syndiotactic PMMAs. It was showed that the polar interaction free energy ∆G_a^p (T) also showed the presence of the three above transition temperatures of the polymers. The study showed an important non-linearity variation of the different acid-base parameters in the various polymer surfaces proving the highest effect of the temperature and the tacticity on these parameters.  The determination of the enthalpic and entropic Lewis’s acid-base parameters showed an amphoteric character for the different PMMAs. The basicity of the atactic PMMA was about four times larger than its acidity outside the neighborhood of the transition temperatures of the polymer. Whereas, the isotactic PMMA was about 2 to 2.5 times more basic than acid, while the syndiotactic PMMA exhibited the highest basicity by showing a surface 5 to 8 times more basic than acid. However, the Lewis acid-base parameters strongly depended on the temperature and sudden variations of these surface parameters were observed around the transition temperatures largely depending on the PMMA tacticity. The determination of the polar acid and base surface energies of the three PMMAs led to the same previous transition temperatures with an important effect of the tacticity of PMMA on the values of these acid-base surface energies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4398f65959bda5deeb2eecf4a93cc856af6329a15c6b27eaee4efe0fbe4ed51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
