{"title":"A COBRA family protein, PtrCOB3, contributes to gelatinous layer formation of tension wood fibers in poplar","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/323/7689812?rss=1","date":1717718400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Angiosperm trees usually develop tension wood (TW) in response to gravitational stimulation. TW comprises abundant gelatinous (G-) fibers with thick G-layers primarily composed of crystalline cellulose. Understanding the pivotal factors governing G-layer formation in TW fiber remains elusive. This study elucidates the role of a <span>Populus trichocarpa</span> COBRA family protein, PtrCOB3, in the G-layer formation of TW fibers. <span>PtrCOB3</span> expression was upregulated, and its promoter activity was enhanced during TW formation. Comparative analysis with wild-type trees revealed that <span>ptrcob3</span> mutants, mediated by Cas9/gRNA gene editing, were incapable of producing G-layers within TW fibers and showed severely impaired stem lift. Fluorescence immunolabeling data revealed a dearth of crystalline cellulose in the tertiary cell wall (TCW) of <span>ptrcob3</span> TW fibers. The role of <span>PtrCOB3</span> in G-layer formation is contingent upon its native promoter, as evidenced by the comparative phenotypic assessments of <span>pCOB11::PtrCOB3</span>, <span>pCOB3::PtrCOB3</span>, and <span>pCOB3::PtrCOB11</span> transgenic lines in the <span>ptrcob3</span> background. Overexpression of <span>PtrCOB3</span> under the control of its native promoter expedited G-layer formation within TW fibers. We further identified 3 transcription factors that bind to the <span>PtrCOB3</span> promoter and positively regulate its transcriptional levels. Alongside the primary TCW synthesis genes, these findings enable the construction of a 2-layer transcriptional regulatory network for the G-layer formation of TW fibers. Overall, this study uncovers mechanistic insight into TW formation, whereby a specific COB protein executes the deposition of cellulose, and consequently, G-layer formation within TW fibers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"b56aae4a2b565c144dc993af4c99c0ab48cff21aa721b0534778a60fda071a9d","category":"Environment"}
