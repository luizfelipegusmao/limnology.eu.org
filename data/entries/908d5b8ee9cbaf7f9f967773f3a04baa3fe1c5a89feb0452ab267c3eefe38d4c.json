{"title":"Astromineralogy of the Nearby Exoplanetary Systems II. The Impact of the Variability of the Stellar Mg/Si, C/O, Ca/Si, Al/Si, Na/Si and Fe/Si Ratios on the Mineral Diversity of Rocky Exoplanets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0283/v1","date":1717582226000,"content":"The bulk planetary compositions are thought to be linked to the chemical abundances of their host stars. The abundances of 8 key rock-forming elements and the key planetary abundance ratios in G– and F–type main sequence stars located in the Solar neighborhood within 50 pc were statistically analyzed. The averaged C/O, Mg/Si, and Fe/Si elemental ratios of the planetary systems have a crucial role in the chemical composition and the mineralogy of a rocky planet's interior. We also studied the variation of the calculated Ca/Si, Al/Si, Na/Si and Fe/Si ratios in the samples of the examined stars using the Ca, Al, Na, and Fe abundances from the catalog and then attempt to constitute plausible occurrence trends of the analyzed abundance ratios for the rocky planet population in the near – solar galactocentric distances. Considering these results, we provide simple predictions for the most likely bulk compositions of the potential rocky planets. We further apply our results to compare them to the solar averaged abundance ratios, finding that the key elemental ratios for rocky planet composition in the Solar System are not typical amongst most of the studied stellar samples.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"908d5b8ee9cbaf7f9f967773f3a04baa3fe1c5a89feb0452ab267c3eefe38d4c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
