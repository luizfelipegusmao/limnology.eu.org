{"title":"Managing diabetes and hypertension in western Kenya: A qualitative study of experiences of patients supported by the primary health integrated care for chronic conditions (PIC4C) model of care","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003245","date":1723730400000,"content":"<p>by Violet Naanyu, Ruth Willis, Jemima Kamano, Hillary Koros, Adrianna Murphy, Pablo Perel, Ellen Nolte</p>\r\n\r\nThe Primary Health Integrated Care for Chronic Conditions (PIC4C) pilot project was launched in 2018 to strengthen prevention and control of four non-communicable conditions at primary health care level in western Kenya. We conducted a qualitative study to explore the extent to which PIC4C integrated services supported people with hypertension and/or diabetes towards timely diagnosis and referral, treatment, follow-up and adherence, from the perspective of those receiving care. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposively sampled patient cohort at two time points, with the intention of capturing changes over time (total (n) = 43, completion of both interviews (n) = 37). We extracted existing survey data to describe socio-demographic characteristics and analyzed qualitative data thematically. We identified two cross-cutting contextual factors, individual’s financial resources and their social situation, which shaped each stage of their interactions with PIC4C services. The PIC4C model successfully engaged people in accessing screening services to enable timely diagnosis and referred them to enter care. Free community level screening services and decentralization of care to lower level facilities reduced cost barriers for patients. However, retention in care and adherence to treatment were affected by the wider system context in which PIC4C was operating, including inconsistencies in medication availability and patients’ limited financial capacity. Individually tailored advice from health care workers to work around some of these challenges supported self-management strategies. Further development of the service should focus on supporting health care workers to adopt flexible, contextually responsive approaches in order to support patients facing economic and other constraints to engage in (self) care.","author":"Violet Naanyu","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"53627bdcc3f169fa5d49c7b50c366d25d5fdf3b309ca9247123fc47ebf8d528e","category":"Environment"}
