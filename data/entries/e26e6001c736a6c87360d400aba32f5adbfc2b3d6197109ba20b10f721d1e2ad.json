{"title":"The first report of complete mitogenomes of two endangered species of genus <i>Propomacrus</i> (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Euchirinae) and phylogenetic implications","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310559","date":1726668000000,"content":"<p>by Chuanhui Yi, Xu Shu, Lingmin Wang, Jing Yin, Youhui Wang, Yuchen Wang, Honghui Zhang, Qiuju He, Min Zhao</p>\r\n\r\nTo understand the mitochondrial genome structure of two endangered and long-armed scarab beetles, <i>Propomacrus davidi</i> and <i>Propomacrus bimucronatus</i>, their complete mitogenomes were sequenced for the first time in this study. The complete mitogenomes of <i>P</i>. <i>davidi</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>bimucronatus</i> were 18, 042 bp and 18, 104 bp in length, respectively. The gene orders of their mitogenomes were highly consistent with other Coleopteran species, and the typical ATN was used as the start codon in most protein coding genes. The incomplete stop codon T was used in <i>cox1</i>, <i>cox2</i>, and <i>nad5</i>, and TAN was used as a complete stop codon in most protein coding genes. All predicted tRNAs could form a typical cloverleaf secondary structure, except that trnS1 lacked the dihydrouridine arm. Based on the maximum likelihood and the Bayesian inference methods, phylogenetic trees of 50 species were reconstructed. The results showed that <i>P</i>. <i>davidi</i>, <i>P</i>. <i>bimucronatus</i>, <i>Cheirotonus jansoni</i> and <i>Cheirotonus gestroi</i> clustered in the same branch, and were the most closely related. The results supported that subfamily Euchirinae is a monophyletic group of Scarabaeidae, which was consistent with the morphological classification. These molecular data enriched the complete mitogenome database of Euchirinae, and improved our understanding of the phylogenetic relationship and evolutionary characteristics of these two endangered species.","author":"Chuanhui Yi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e26e6001c736a6c87360d400aba32f5adbfc2b3d6197109ba20b10f721d1e2ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
