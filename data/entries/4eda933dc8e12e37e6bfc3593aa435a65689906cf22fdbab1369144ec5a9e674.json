{"title":"Implementation of an innovative ERAS protocol in cardiac surgery: A qualitative evaluation from patients’ perspective","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303399","date":1715349600000,"content":"<p>by Mona Elisabeth Schmid, Sina Stock, Evaldas Girdauskas</p>\r\nObjective <p>Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols aim to optimize the recovery process for patients after surgical interventions and focus on patient-centered care. In cardiac surgery, the ERAS concept is still in its early stages. Our university hospital has implemented an innovative ERAS protocol for minimally invasive heart valve surgery since 2021. Therefore, our study aimed to comprehensively assess the patient experience within this newly established ERAS protocol and focused on exploring and understanding the nuances of optimal healthcare delivery under the ERAS framework from the unique perspective of the patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</p> Methods <p>Qualitative research was conducted using semi-structured interviews. Data was analyzed using Kuckartz´s qualitative content analysis.</p> Results <p>The following main themes emerged from the 12 completed patient interviews: 1) information and communication flow, 2) perioperative patient care, and 3) rehabilitation. Patients found the pre-operative patient education and preconditioning very helpful. Patients were satisfied with the flow of information throughout the whole perioperative care process. Most patients expressed a need for more information about the course of surgery. The intensity of care provided by different professions was perceived as optimal. The support and inclusion of relatives in perioperative care were considered crucial. Patients appreciated the direct transfer to the rehabilitation and mainly were able to cope with daily life tasks afterward.</p> Conclusion <p>In summary, all patients experienced the ERAS protocol positively, and their healthcare process was well established. Active inclusion and education of patients in their treatment can improve patient empowerment. Two further aspects that deserve major consideration in the healthcare process are the inclusion of relatives and interprofessional cooperation.</p>","author":"Mona Elisabeth Schmid","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4eda933dc8e12e37e6bfc3593aa435a65689906cf22fdbab1369144ec5a9e674","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
