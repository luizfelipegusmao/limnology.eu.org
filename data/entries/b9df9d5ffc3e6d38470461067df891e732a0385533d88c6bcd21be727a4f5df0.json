{"title":"Effect of micro‐oxygenation on color of wines made with toasted vine‐shoots","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13932?af=R","date":1728570197000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Toasted vine-shoots (SEGs) are an enological tool to improve wines, to differentiate them, and to encourage sustainable wine production. Micro-oxygenation (MOX) is typically combined with the use of alternative oak products to simulate the oxygen transmission rate of traditional barrel aging, affecting wine color. Its use alongside SEGs has been studied.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Tempranillo wines were treated with SEGs at two doses (12 and 24 g L−1) after malolactic fermentation at two fixed micro-oxygenation levels: (a) low, which received 6.24 ± 0.87 mg L<sup>−1</sup>·month<sup>−1</sup> of oxygen; and, (b) high, which received 11.91 ± 0.71 mg L<sup>−1</sup>·month<sup>−1</sup> of oxygen. The wines were bottled and stored for 6 months. At the end of the treatment, MOX affected the anthocyanins and color parameters, but not the enological characteristics. At this time, the anthocyanins content reduction presented a negatively significant correlation with oxygen for wines treated with 12 g L<sup>−1</sup>. The factors that most influenced the development of color parameters during the time after bottling were the period for which the wine evolved in the bottle and SEG dose. The visual sensorial descriptors showed an evolution according to aged red wines, but without differences according to the SEG-MOX treatments.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The SEG-MOX treatments caused significant changes in wine color. It would be advisable to adjust SEG-MOX techniques to increase their effectiveness. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Rosario Sánchez‐Gómez, \nCristina Cebrián‐Tarancón, \nAna María Martínez‐Gil, \nIgnacio Nevares, \nGonzalo L.
