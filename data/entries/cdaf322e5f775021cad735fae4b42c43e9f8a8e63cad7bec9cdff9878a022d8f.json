{"title":"When size matters: A novel compact Cas12a variant for in vivo genome editing","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002637","date":1721224800000,"content":"<p>by Felix Bubeck, Dirk Grimm</p>\r\n\r\nA new study characterizes and improves a novel small Cas12a variant before adapting it for in vivo genome editing by delivery via adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, showcasing the potential of small CRISPR systems and their compatibility with viral vectors.\r\n\r\nAdopting Cas12a nucleases for AAV-based gene therapy has been difficult due to their large size. A new study in PLOS Biology characterizes and engineers a new Cas12a nuclease variant that is compatible for in vivo genome editing via an all-in-one AAV delivery system.","author":"Felix Bubeck","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"cdaf322e5f775021cad735fae4b42c43e9f8a8e63cad7bec9cdff9878a022d8f","category":"Environment"}
