{"title":"A study on the effect of using magnetized water in dilution of the milt of Black Sea trout (Salmo trutta labrax) on sperm motility","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16104?af=R","date":1667394512000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Sperm motility is an important character for the assessment of milt quality and indicator to the expected rate of fertilization. Many factors can affect the sperm motility, including nature of water used as sperm activator medium after stripping the milt from the male fish. The aim of this study was to gain motility to spermatozoa and improve sperm kinematic parameters by applying a non-chemical method. The effects of magnetic field on samples of hatchery water exposed to magnetic field of 2.71, 4.51 and 8.11 mT for the duration of 12, 24 and 36 hours on <i>Salmo trutta labrax</i> sperm motility were investigated with computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system; 4.51 mT exposure for 36 hours (A2H3) was greater in motility kinematic parameters (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and progressive kinematic parameters (VAP, VSL and VCL) with values of (93.1244 ± 37.222, 88.6111 ± 36.137, 96.8378 ± 35.396 μm/s) and (102.9167 ± 32.546, 100.9767 ± 31.894, 105.8778 ± 30.401 μm/s) respectively. But there was no (<i>p</i> ≥ 0.05) in the slow phase just in the VCL parameter had (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) (35.8789 ± 39.127 μm/s) among other parameters. There was (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) in starting motility time until vibration point (s) for 4.51 mT in 12 hour (A2H1) (27.3333 ± 1.527 s), but total time of motility was greater for 4.51 mT in 36 hour (A2H3) with (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) (49.6667 ± 2.081 s) compared with other treatments.</p>","author":"Mohmmed Hassan Ahmed, \nİlker Keskin, \nSuat Özkorucuklu, \nAygül Ekici","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"9d8898212db4b84730f54af06e2310129e4502e5e34c9f1ad4bef4b794cbf7bb","category":"Environment"}
