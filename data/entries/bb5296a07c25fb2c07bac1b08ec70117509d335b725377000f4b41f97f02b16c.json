{"title":"Fish Viscera Hydrolysates and Their Use as Biostimulants for Plants as an Approach towards Circular Economy: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1666/v1","date":1721634685000,"content":"Crop production has become a priority issue in the last few years due to the exponential growth of the world population and the need to substitute chemical fertilizers. This last matter is under the spotlight to achieve a more sustainable approach in a cost-effective way. Biostimulants have gained attention as an alternative to chemical fertilizers. Although they are not considered fertilisers as inputs of nutrients, they stimulate plantsâ€™ nutrition and tolerance to stress, among other characteristics. Amino acid-based biostimulants have been found to be effective in literature. This review focuses on the effectiveness of biostimulants, their presence in the global market, and mainly in their production with fish by-products as a source, using enzymatic hydrolysis and autolysis, focusing especially on fish viscera, their possibilities in the agricultural sector and their availability in Europe for possible opportunities. Fish viscera protein hydrolysates for biostimulant production seems a feasible alternative to fishmeal production in Europe, mainly in areas located far away from fishmeal plants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb5296a07c25fb2c07bac1b08ec70117509d335b725377000f4b41f97f02b16c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
