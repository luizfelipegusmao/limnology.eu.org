As frog plays a vital role in the environment and recreational activities in Taiwan, this study aimed to quantify the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of the public for conserving the selected endangered frog species. Respondents were asked using a semistructured questionnaire with auxiliary audio and video files. After deleting incomplete responses following regular data handling, 585 valid responses were used in the estimation. Using the contingent valuation method and single-bounded dichotomous choice model, the results showed that people are willing to pay an amount of 32.01 USD (922.85 New Taiwan Dollars) per person annually. Factors affecting the public's WTP include price, age, support for establishing conservation areas, payment through donations, number of trips in ecotourism, and the place of residency in Taiwan. The result of this study can be used as a benchmark for the government for the implementation of the conservation and rehabilitation of the habitat of the endangered frog species in the future.</p>","author":"Jerald M.
