{"title":"Insights into lignin bioconversion: lignin‐derived compounds treatment of a novel marine fungus K‐2","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13942?af=R","date":1728118187000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The potential for the efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass has been extensively explored to produce a wide range of bioproducts. Many approaches have been sought for the deep conversion of lignin to generate products that are toxin-free and beneficial for processing into high-value-added components.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>This study reported a fungus isolated from the deep sea with strong synthesis of multiple lignocellulases, conversion of lignin and guaiacol (0.1%) by 71.6% and 86.1% within 9 days at 30 °C respectively, and outstanding environmental adaptability (20–50 °C and pH 3–8). Metabolic pathway profiling showed that this fungus utilized lignin to rapidly activate multiple ring-opening reactions including the 2,3- and 3,4-cleavage pathways, with the 2,3-cleavage pathway predominating after 5 days. Conversion of metabolic intermediates confirmed the superb potential of this strain for lignin treatment. Meanwhile, its shikimic acid pathway was metabolically active under lignin.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This further expands the potential to produce valuable bioproducts during lignin treatment, especially under ambient conditions, which can significantly enhance high-value precursor compound production. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Wenxian Liu, \nLiting Xu, \nHaina Cheng, \nZhu Chen, \nHongbo Zhou, \nYuguang Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"ad6314eb3f0d5e5cb9e9ae1467423b12d3a4ec6aa7f1648be4fcbf1e0e5d5a16","category":"Environment"}
