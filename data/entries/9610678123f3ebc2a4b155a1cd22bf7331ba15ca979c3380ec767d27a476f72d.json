{"title":"Role of GLP-1 Agonists in Obesity: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1829/v1","date":1729748049000,"content":"Obesity is a major public health concern globally, significantly increasing the risk of numerous metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. While lifestyle interventions remain the primary strategy for weight management, pharmacotherapy is increasingly recognized as an essential component for patients with obesity, especially when lifestyle modifications alone are insufficient. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, originally developed for the management of type 2 diabetes, have emerged as effective agents in promoting weight loss in both diabetic and non-diabetic populations. This literature review examines the efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists, focusing on liraglutide and semaglutide, in obesity treatment. Furthermore, it discusses the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on obesity-related comorbidities, their comparison with other pharmacological treatments, and future perspectives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9610678123f3ebc2a4b155a1cd22bf7331ba15ca979c3380ec767d27a476f72d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
