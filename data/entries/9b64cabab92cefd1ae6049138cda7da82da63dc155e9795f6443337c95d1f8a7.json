{"title":"ASYNAPSIS3 has diverse dosage-dependent effects on meiotic crossover formation in Brassica napus","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3838/7719573?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Crossovers create genetic diversity and are required for equal chromosome segregation during meiosis. Crossover number and distribution are highly regulated by different mechanisms that are not yet fully understood, including crossover interference. The chromosome axis is crucial for crossover formation. Here, we explore the function of the axis protein ASYNAPSIS3. To this end, we use the allotetraploid species <span>Brassica napus</span>; due to its polyploid nature, this system allows a fine-grained dissection of the dosage of meiotic regulators. The simultaneous mutation of all 4 <span>ASY3</span> alleles results in defective synapsis and drastic reduction of crossovers, which is largely rescued by the presence of only one functional <span>ASY3</span> allele. Crucially, while the number of class I crossovers in mutants with 2 functional <span>ASY3</span> alleles is comparable to that in wild type, this number is significantly increased in mutants with only one functional <span>ASY3</span> allele, indicating that reducing ASY3 dosage increases crossover formation. Moreover, the class I crossovers on each bivalent in mutants with 1 functional <span>ASY3</span> allele follow a random distribution, indicating compromised crossover interference. These results reveal the distinct dosage-dependent effects of ASY3 on crossover formation and provide insights into the role of the chromosome axis in patterning recombination.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"9b64cabab92cefd1ae6049138cda7da82da63dc155e9795f6443337c95d1f8a7","category":"Environment"}
