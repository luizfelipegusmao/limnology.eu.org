{"title":"Advances in Ultrasound-Guided Surgery and Artificial Intelligence Applications in Musculoskeletal Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0132/v1","date":1722571479000,"content":"Ultrasound imaging is a vital imaging tool in musculoskeletal medicine, with the number of publications on ultrasound-guided surgery increasing in recent years. However, ultrasound imaging has drawbacks, such as operator dependency and image obscurity. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL), a subset of AI, can address these issues. DL methods, including segmentation, detection, and localization of target tissues and medical instruments, potentially allow physicians and surgeons to perform ultrasound-guided procedures more accurately and efficiently. This review summarizes recent advances in ultrasound-guided procedures for musculoskeletal diseases and provides a comprehensive overview of the utilization of AI/DL in ultrasound for musculoskeletal medicine, particularly focusing on ultrasound-guided surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40bb31dd68cda11592146acc54edb86f63ef8fcb066f3af3bba8f0d5f97d8840","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
