In comparison to black phosphorus, violet phosphorus exhibits increased thermal stability, an important consideration for device design and implementation [<a href=\"#ozae044.336-B5\">5</a>]. Thus, our inquiries here aim to examine the thermal behavior of violet phosphorus to better determine the structural transformations that lead to its ultimate decomposition at ∼400 °C. To accomplish this, we conducted three sets of complementary <span>in situ</span> scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) thermolysis experiments: (1) low kV <span>in situ</span> STEM to examine the morphological changes within violet phosphorus nanosheets, (2) detailed atomic-resolution structural analysis of observed morphologies using <span>in situ</span> aberration-corrected STEM, (3) evaluation of band structure dynamics using monochromated, aberration-corrected STEM and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). The results of this highly effective analytical combination allowed us to develop a more comprehensive mechanism for the thermal breakdown of violet phosphorus nanosheets.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d2018e8af75dc26820442c9f39229633fe91f630f029589427fa223e510d626d","category":"Environment"}
