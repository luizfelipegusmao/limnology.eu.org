{"title":"Region-Specific Decellularization of Porcine Uterine Tube Extracellular Matrix: A New Approach for Reproductive Tissue-Engineering Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1629/v1","date":1716544577000,"content":"Uterine tube extracellular matrix is a key component that regulates tubal tissue physiology, and it has a region-specific structural distribution, which are directly associated to their functions. Considering this, application of biological matrices in culture systems is an interesting strategy to develop biomimetic tubal microenvironments and enhance their complexity. However, there are no established protocols to produce tubal biological matrices that consider the organ morphophysiology for such applications. Therefore, this study aimed to establish region-specific protocols to obtain decellularized scaffolds derived from porcine infundibulum, ampulla, and isthmus to provide suitable sources of biomaterials for tissue-engineering approaches. Porcine uterine tubes were decellularized in solutions of 0.1% SDS and 0.5% Triton X-100. Decellularization efficiency was evaluated by DAPI staining and DNA quantification. We analyzed ECM composition and structure by optical and scanning electronic microscopy, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. DNA and DAPI assays validated the decellularization, presenting significative reduction of cellular content. Structural and spectroscopy analyses revealed that produced scaffolds remained well structured and with ECM composition preserved. YS and HEK293 cells were used to attest cytocompatibility, allowing cell survival and successful interaction with the scaffolds. These results suggest that such matrices are applicable for future biotechnological approaches in the reproductive field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0ccb6f17bd96e94d1144fb84cee6484a7ce57bd450a7e0bd52abe251d6a70d95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
