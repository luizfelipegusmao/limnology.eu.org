{"title":"A Novel Methodological Approach to Simulating the Growth of Photosynthetic Organisms Using Long-Term Meteorological Sequences: A Case Study of a Microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0282/v1","date":1725375358000,"content":"The growth of photosynthetic organisms requires specific ranges of temperature and photosynthetically active radiation that are technically difficult to achieve and control, especially in outdoors cultures. In such cases, a typical meteorological sequence can be a useful tool to estimate the growth of photosynthetic organisms. This work proposes a new methodology based on long-term meteorological sequences to simulate the growth of photosynthetic organisms. A case of study that addresses the simulation of the growth of microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) in Riosequillo, north of the Madrid region (Spain), is shown for the four seasons of the year, and these estimates are then compared with the observed results of an experimental microalgae culture in domestic wastewater. The results also show great agreement with the probability distribution function of the biomass concentration per day, obtaining the best results for typical meteorological sequences of summer and spring. The methodology seems to confirm the representativeness of typical meteorological sequences and also allows the identification of the most likely production scenarios for the feasibility analysis of projects, which has potential application in decision-making processes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7380672702ae3987e7c62e7753514911cb1808a8c2e9b03daa8694f84b63dc39","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
