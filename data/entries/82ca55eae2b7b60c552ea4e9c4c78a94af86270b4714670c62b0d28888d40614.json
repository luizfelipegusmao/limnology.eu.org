Then, these DEGs were applied to KEGG and GO analyses to predict the related signaling pathways and molecular functions. Comparison of GRAMD1C expression levels in the putamen of normal and Parkinson’s patients by bioinformatic analysis. PC12 cells were cultured to construct a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Parkinson’s cell model. RT-qPCR was performed to detect the efficiency of GRAMD1C siRNA. MTT assay was conducted to examine the proliferation of cells. Then, the apoptosis of each group of cells was measured by flow cytometry. Western blot was carried out to determine the expression of apoptosis-related proteins.<div>Results</div>Through bioinformatics, GRAMD1C was confirmed to be one of the most significantly upregulated genes in PD. Furthermore, GRAMD1C was notably enhanced in the PD patients and 6-OHDA-induced PC12 cells. Besides, 6-OHDA stimulation significantly reduced PC12 cell proliferation, and it reverted with the GRAMD1C siRNA. Moreover, the flow cytometry results showed that knockdown of GRAMD1C could effectively reduce the high apoptosis rate of PC12 cells induced by 6-OHDA treatment. Similarly, western blot results found that 6-OHDA stimulation markedly increased the expression levels of Bax and Caspase 3Caspase 3 and decreased the Bcl-2 expression in PC12 cells, and GRAMD1C knockdown reversed these changes.<div>Conclusion</div>GRAMD1C is upregulated in PD, and may affect the PD process through the apoptotic pathway.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"82ca55eae2b7b60c552ea4e9c4c78a94af86270b4714670c62b0d28888d40614","category":"Environment"}
