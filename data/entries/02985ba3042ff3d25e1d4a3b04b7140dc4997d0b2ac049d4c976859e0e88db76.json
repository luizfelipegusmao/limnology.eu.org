Therethrough, ‘being healthy’ is essential for a high quality of life, and interest in health and disease prevention grew significantly after the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic boosted digital health technology adoption, and emphasizing the need for tailored health strategies based on age group. KIHASA conducted the study of digital confidence and health management methods involving the use of digital devices, and it examines differences in digital device use and confidence between 359 young adults (20–39Y) and 641 middle-aged adults (40–69Y). Respondents were asked about their use of digital health tools, such as wearable devices and mobile apps and confidence in using digital systems and managing health via digital tools was assessed using a five-point Likert scale. We an-alyzed the results, and it indicated that while young adults have lower rates of using digital devices for health care, they exhibit higher confidence in using such devices. In contrast, middle-aged adults, despite having lower confidence, report higher usage of digital devices for health care purposes. This study explored differences in digital confidence and health care usage between age group.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02985ba3042ff3d25e1d4a3b04b7140dc4997d0b2ac049d4c976859e0e88db76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
