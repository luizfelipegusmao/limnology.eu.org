{"title":"A deep learning-based dynamic deformable adaptive framework for locating the root region of the dynamic flames","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301839","date":1713362400000,"content":"<p>by Hongkang Tao, Guhong Wang, Jiansheng Liu, Zan Yang</p>\r\n\r\nTraditional optical flame detectors (OFDs) in flame detection are susceptible to environmental interference, which will inevitably cause detection errors and miscalculations when confronted with a complex environment. The conventional deep learning-based models can mitigate the interference of complex environments by flame image feature extraction, which significantly improves the precision of flame recognition. However, these models focus on identifying the general profile of the static flame, but neglect to effectively locate the source of the dynamic flame. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel dynamic flame detection method named Dynamic Deformable Adaptive Framework (DDAF) for locating the flame root region dynamically. Specifically, to address limitations in flame feature extraction of existing detection models, the Deformable Convolution Network v2 (DCNv2) is introduced for more flexible adaptation to the deformations and scale variations of target objects. The Context Augmentation Module (CAM) is used to convey flame features into Dynamic Head (DH) to feature extraction from different aspects. Subsequently, the Layer-Adaptive Magnitude-based Pruning (LAMP) where the connection with the smallest LAMP score is pruned sequentially is employed to further enhance the speed of model detection. More importantly, both the coarse- and fine-grained location techniques are designed in the Inductive Modeling (IM) to accurately delineate the flame root region for effective fire control. Additionally, the Temporal Consistency-based Detection (TCD) contributes to improving the robustness of model detection by leveraging the temporal information presented in consecutive frames of a video sequence. Compared with the classical deep learning method, the experimental results on the custom flame dataset demonstrate that the AP<sub>0.5</sub> value is improved by 4.4%, while parameters and FLOPs are reduced by 25.3% and 25.9%, respectively. The framework of this research extends applicability to a variety of flame detection scenarios, including industrial safety and combustion process control.","author":"Hongkang Tao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4e5b7f5d7a7e61af15a895c9dad3537343798f616650d7f18c59a6159e86e1b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
