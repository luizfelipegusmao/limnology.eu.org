{"title":"The Association of a Single Nucleotide Variants in TNXB to Arterial Aneurysmal Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1376/v1","date":1724144577000,"content":"Thoracic aortic and arterial aneurysms are cardiovascular conditions associated with life-threatening endpoints including dissection and rupture. The genetic basis underlying the development these disease states is an evolving field, and the reporting of variants associated with aneurysms in patients are essential for advancing screening and diagnostic tools. Among all patients in our program who underwent clinical genetic screening (N=145) for arterial aneurysm and dissection disorders, we identified three patients with single nucleotide variants in the TNXB gene. This gene has known roles in collagen fibrillogenesis and classic Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. This is one of the first reports to associate this gene with aortopathy/arteriopathy and advances the literature relating extracellular matrix genes to arterial aneurysm development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24cbb90b81bfffc04ce95f30b80a6eebaca1e03f1abc611a09e1088bfb3ad110","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
