{"title":"Study of Thermal Fields Inside Pipes in Solar Collectors Working with Ionanofluids by Means of the Heatt&reg; Platform","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0201/v1","date":1727875047000,"content":"Solar electric and solar thermal energies are often considered as part of the solution to the current energy emergency. In the present work, a study of the characteristic length of tubes in flat photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) hybrid solar devices has been carried out using three heat transfer fluids: water, Emim-Ac ionic liquid and ionanofluid of graphene nanoparticles suspended in the above ionic liquid. Experimental measurements and numerical simulations have been performed using the HEATTÂ® platform. Slower fluid velocities are recommended if high fluid outlet temperatures are the goal of the application, but this penalizes the overall thermal energy production. The characteristic process length, or most efficient distance at which heat transfer occurs, is not typically achieved in parallel tube PVT collectors; coil-type panels can improve the thermal and temperature performance of INFs in PVT solar collectors depending on the application.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc13cb7d1afa1f70d7f65d3d0556f53f5645b4f3223821222c3b5646a783d1cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
