{"title":"A cucumber protein, Phloem Phosphate Stress-Repressed 1, rapidly degrades in response to a phosphate stress condition","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/7/2176/7479387?rss=1","date":1702944000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Under depleted external phosphate (Pi), many plant species adapt to this stress by initiating downstream signaling cascades. In plants, the vascular system delivers nutrients and signaling agents to control physiological and developmental processes. Currently, limited information is available regarding the direct role of phloem-borne long-distance signals in plant growth and development under Pi stress conditions. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of a cucumber protein, <span>Cucumis sativus</span> Phloem Phosphate Stress-Repressed 1 (CsPPSR1), whose level in the phloem translocation stream rapidly responds to imposed Pi-limiting conditions. CsPPSR1 degradation is mediated by the 26S proteasome; under Pi-sufficient conditions, CsPPSR1 is stabilized by its phosphorylation within the sieve tube system through the action of CsPPSR1 kinase. Further, we discovered that CsPPSR1 kinase was susceptible to Pi starvation-induced degradation in the sieve tube system. Our findings offer insight into a molecular mechanism underlying the response of phloem-borne proteins to Pi-limited stress conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"b090506442928464cee6fdccaa1c728d966d6b85c913e270b72835e00385f713","category":"Environment"}
