The role of exercise programs during Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment is considered particularly supportive in fostering positive psychological and behavioral changes. The aim of this feasibility study was to explore the acute effects of cycling exercise in an immersive virtual reality (IVR) environment on attentional control and self-efficacy expectations of indi-viduals undergoing SUD treatment. \nMethods. A total of 20 individuals (mean age of 37.75 years) enrolled in a SUD treatment program participated in the study. They were instructed to complete a single session of cycling with a self-selected duration within the IVR system.\nResults. Following the cycling session, pre-post measures indicated a statistically significant im-provement in self-efficacy expectations and attentional control measured with the Stroop test. The results revealed that participants expressed high levels of intention for future use, inter-est/enjoyment, and positive attitudes toward the IVR exercise system. Qualitative data indicated that participants found the IVR exercise system enjoyable, expressed a strong intention to use it, and did not encounter technical difficulties or negative emotions. \nConclusions: In conclusion, it seems that engaging in a brief period of self-selected exercise within a virtual environment can result in temporary activation of cognitive changes, heightened self-efficacy expectations, and a motivating approach to increasing physical activity participation among individuals with SUD, thus suggesting the feasibility of this approach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b41072ad95953040306afa9bc45ea07b5bc63e5b5ed923d53d4136c610704fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
