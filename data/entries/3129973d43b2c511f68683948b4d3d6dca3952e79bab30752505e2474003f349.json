{"title":"Nutrient Dynamics in Integrated Crop-Livestock Systems: Effects of Stocking Rates and Nitrogen System Fertilization on Litter Decomposition and Release","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1418/v1","date":1721298605000,"content":"Current fertilizer recommendations often neglect nutrient cycling across crop rotations. This study aimed to assess the decay rate and nutrient (N, P, K) release patterns of sorghum, black oat, and corn residues and their effects on corn yield in an integrated crop-livestock system. The experiment used factorial treatments based on two sward heights (high and low) and two nitrogen fertilization levels (N-Pasture at 200 kg N ha-1 and N-Corn at 0 kg N ha-1. Litter bags were collected at various intervals from each crop to measure nutrient release patterns and decomposition rates. The results showed that pasture height and nitrogen fertilization significantly influenced decomposition and nutrient release, affecting the subsequent grain crop phase. Potassium was released rapidly and in high amounts. Nitrogen fertilization during the pasture phase prevented nitrogen and phosphorus immobilization in black oat residue and reduced immobilization in corn residue.These findings highlight the importance of accounting for nutrient cycling and decomposition rates in fertilization strategies to enhance the sustainability of integrated crop-livestock systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3129973d43b2c511f68683948b4d3d6dca3952e79bab30752505e2474003f349","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
