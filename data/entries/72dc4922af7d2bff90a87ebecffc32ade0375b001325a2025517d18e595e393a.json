{"title":"Comparison of differences in performance between pigs whose sires were identified using different selection strategies after experimental infection with PRRSV","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae128/7739846?rss=1","date":1724371200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to evaluate differences in the performance of offspring of boars selected with an index emphasizing resilience and boars selected based on a traditional index, emphasizing feed efficiency and carcass quality (traditional) index vs. a customized (resilience) index. The resilience index was identical to the traditional index, except that extra emphasis was placed on piglet vitality (increased by 66%), growth rate (decreased by 14%), and feed intake (increased substantially by 5,157%). Sows were mated to either boars selected based on the resilience index or boars selected on the traditional index. Weaned offspring were vaccinated for Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) and experimentally infected with PRRSV RFLP 1-7-4 four weeks later. Offspring were allocated to pens (<span>n</span> ~ 27 pigs/pen; <span>n</span> = 27 pens/group) by sire-selection group for a total of 1,458 pigs in 54 pens. The weight of each pen was recorded on 0, 42, and 110 d postinfection (DPI) and used to calculate average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Mortalities were recorded from 0 to 110 DPI and necropsies were routinely performed to characterize pathogens present within the barn. Pigs classified as full value (i.e., &gt;104 kg and void of defects) were slaughtered and hot carcass weight (HCW), backfat, loin depth, and lean weight were obtained from the slaughter plant. Effects of progeny group on performance, carcass characteristics, and mortality rate were estimated with a mixed linear model. Differences between progeny groups in ADG (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.27), HCW (<span>P</span> = 0.68), backfat (<span>P</span> = 0.13), or loin depth (<span>P</span> = 0.39), and mortality rate (<span>P</span> = 0.29) were not detected. From 0 to 42 DPI, offspring of boars selected based on the resilience index had higher ADFI (0.06 kg/d, <span>P</span> = 0.01) and higher FCR (0.12, <span>P</span> = 0.01). In summary, results from this study do not support selection of boars for increased feed intake, piglet viability, and robustness in order to prevent losses caused by PRRSV, but selection response was only measured after one generation of male selection. The impact of multiple generations of selection, or the development of an index including traits derived from data collected under disease-challenged conditions should be explored. The data collected for this study are a valuable resource to explore additional genetic selection strategies for enhanced resilience to a multifactorial PRRS challenge.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"72dc4922af7d2bff90a87ebecffc32ade0375b001325a2025517d18e595e393a","category":"Environment"}
