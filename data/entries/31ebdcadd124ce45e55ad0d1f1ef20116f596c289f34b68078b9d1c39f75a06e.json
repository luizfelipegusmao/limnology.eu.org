{"title":"Visitors’ Behaviors and Perceptions of Spatial Factors of the Uncultivated Internet-Famous Sites in Urban Riverfront Public Spaces: A Case Study in Changsha, China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0523/v1","date":1728315673000,"content":"This article takes the representative uncultivated riverfront internet-famous sites (the uncultivated RIFSs) in Changsha city, China as an example, to explore the internal mechanism of its formation, and finds out that they are closely related to \"urban subculture\" and \"informality of urban public space\". In terms of methodology, through questionnaire surveys and in-depth interviews, this study investigates the behavioral characteristics of on-site visitors, overall perceptions and satisfaction of public spaces, and perceptions of spatial and humanistic elements of visitors. It also compares the online-offline differences of the spatial perceptions on the uncultivated RIFSs between this study and previous research, that is, instead of focus on the urban physical spaces, the online social media users pay more attention to their self-presentation. Meanwhile, the visitors place greater emphasis on the functionality, practicality, and experiential activities of the urban physical spaces. Finally, this article proposes the optimization strategies for the uncultivated RIFSs from two aspects: planning and governance, and public space design. Firstly, it is necessary to protect this special type of spaces, avoiding the binary opposition between \"formal spaces\" and \"informal spaces”, achieving a gradual integration of \"subculture spaces\" and \"mainstream culture spaces\", and highlighting the city's inclusiveness. Secondly, human-centric space design should be demonstrated, that is, paying practical attention to people's diverse lifestyles and value needs, strengthening the composite utilization of riverside spaces to enhance diverse vitality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31ebdcadd124ce45e55ad0d1f1ef20116f596c289f34b68078b9d1c39f75a06e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
