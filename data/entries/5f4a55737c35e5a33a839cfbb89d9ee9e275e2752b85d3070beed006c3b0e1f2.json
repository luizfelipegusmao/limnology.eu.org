From this perspective, it is essential to expand the knowledge about the genetic diversity of vulnerable bats. Genomic sequencing can be useful to generate robust and informative genetic references, increasing resolution when analyzing relationships among populations, species, or higher taxonomic levels. In this study, we sequenced and characterized in detail the first complete mitochondrial genomes of <i>Furipterus horrens</i>, <i>Lonchorhina aurita</i>, and <i>Natalus macrourus</i>, and investigated their phylogenetic position based on amino acid sequences of protein-coding genes (PCGs). The mitogenomes of these species are 16,516, 16,697, and 16,668 bp in length, respectively, and each comprises 13 PCGs, 22 tRNA genes, two rRNA genes, and a putative control region (CR). In the three species, genes were arranged similarly to all other previously described bat mitogenomes, and nucleotide composition was also consistent with the reported range. The length and arrangement of rrnS and rrnL were also consistent with those of other bat species, showing a positive AT-skew and a negative GC-skew. Except for trnS1, for which we did not observe the DHU arm, all other tRNAs showed the cloverleaf secondary structure in the three species. In addition, the mitogenomes showed minor differences in start and stop codons, and in all PCGs, codons ending in adenine were more common compared to those ending in guanine. We found that PCGs of the three species use multiple codons to encode each amino acid, following the previously documented pattern. Furthermore, all PCGs are under purifying selection, with atp8 experiencing the most relaxed purifying selection. Considering the phylogenetic reconstruction, <i>F</i>. <i>horrens</i> was recovered as sister to <i>Noctilio leporinus</i>, <i>L</i>. <i>aurita</i> and <i>Tonatia bidens</i> shared a node within Phyllostomidae, and <i>N</i>. <i>macrourus</i> appeared as sister to Molossidae and Vespertilionidae.","author":"Michele Molina","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5f4a55737c35e5a33a839cfbb89d9ee9e275e2752b85d3070beed006c3b0e1f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
