{"title":"Primordial Black Holes in the Pre-Inflationary Period, the Probabilities of Their Occurrence Taking Into Account Quantum-Gravitational Corrections, and Some Cosmological Implications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1688/v1","date":1716788355000,"content":"In the last decades the primordial black holes ({\\bf pbhs}) have attracted much attention of cosmologists and astrophysicists. This is associated with origination of such black holes in the early Universe as a result of a gravitational collapse of the high-density matter, making them natural ''detectors'' of the processes involved.  In inflationary cosmology of particular importance are {\\bf pbhs} originated during the pre-inflationary period. And, since they are small and generated at the energies close to the Planck energies, for them we should take into consideration the quantum-gravitational corrections ({\\bf qgcs}). In turn, these corrections change (shift) the inflationary parameters.  The paper presents a study of the above-mentioned shifts with regard to these corrections for different scenarios. It is shown that probabilities of occurrence of the {\\bf pbhs} under study with due regard for the given {\\bf qgcs} are rising as compared to the semiclassical consideration. Besides, high-energy deformations of Friedmann Equations created on the basis of these corrections have been derived for different patterns. Conclusion contains the general remarks concerning the above-mentioned {\\bf qgcs} for cosmological parameters and perturbations due to inflation; the steps for their investigation are outlined and the key problems of such a study are formulated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9563c17f2ea5cfe8b792328359427e81056d27f4a8a7bb570902baac71ba8d94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
