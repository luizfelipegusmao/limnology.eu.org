{"title":"MYB transcription factors encoded by diversified tandem gene clusters cause varied Morella rubra fruit color","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/598/7601781?rss=1","date":1707177600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Chinese bayberry (<span>Morella rubra</span>) is a fruit tree with a remarkable variation in fruit color, ranging from white to dark red as determined by anthocyanin content. In dark red “Biqi” (BQ), red “Dongkui” (DK), pink “Fenhong” (FH), and white “Shuijing” (SJ), we identified an anthocyanin-related MYB transcription factor-encoding gene cluster of four members, i.e. <span>MrMYB1.1</span>, <span>MrMYB1.2</span>, <span>MrMYB1.3</span>, and <span>MrMYB2</span>. Collinear analysis revealed that the <span>MYB</span> tandem cluster may have occurred in a highly conserved region of many eudicot genomes. Two alleles of <span>MrMYB1.1</span> were observed; <span>MrMYB1.1-1</span> (<span>MrMYB1.1n</span>) was a full-length allele and homozygous in “BQ”, <span>MrMYB1.1-2</span> (<span>MrMYB1.1d</span>) was a nonfunctional allele with a single base deletion and homozygous in “SJ”, and <span>MrMYB1.1n</span>/<span>MrMYB1.1d</span> were heterozygous in “DK” and “FH”. In these four cultivars, expression of <span>MrMYB1.1</span>, <span>MrMYB1.2</span>, and <span>MrMYB2</span> was enhanced during ripening. Both alleles were equally expressed in <span>MrMYB1.1n</span>/<span>MrMYB1.1d</span> heterozygous cultivars as revealed by a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker. Expression of <span>MrMYB1.3</span> was restricted to some dark red cultivars only. Functional characterization revealed that <span>MrMYB1.1n</span> and <span>MrMYB1.3</span> can induce anthocyanin accumulation while <span>MrMYB1.1d</span>, <span>MrMYB1.2</span>, and <span>MrMYB2</span> cannot. DNA–protein interaction assays indicated that <span>MrMYB1.1n</span> and <span>MrMYB1.3</span> can directly bind to and activate the promoters of anthocyanin-related genes via interaction with a MYC-like basic helix-loop-helix protein MrbHLH1. We concluded that the specific genotype of <span>MrMYB1.1</span> alleles, as well as the exclusive expression of <span>MrMYB1.3</span> in some dark red cultivars, contributes to fruit color variation. The study provides insights into the mechanisms for regulation of plant anthocyanin accumulation by <span>MYB</span> tandem clusters.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"e0132cbff1dc5d159491613a6a6f1f84011fd72923436dfbaa49be930f855c23","category":"Environment"}
