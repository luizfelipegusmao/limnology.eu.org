{"title":"Unbreakable SU(3) Atoms of Vacuum Energy: A Solution for Cosmological Constant Problem","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1534/v2","date":1728298365000,"content":"Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and General Relativity (GR) are pillars of modern physics, each supported by extensive experimental evidence. QFT operates within Lorentzian spacetime, while GR ensures local Lorentzian geometry. Despite their successes, these frameworks diverge significantly in their estimations of vacuum energy density, leading to the cosmological constant problem—a discrepancy where QFT estimates exceed observed values by 123 orders of magnitude. This paper addresses this inconsistency by tracing the cooling evolution of the universe's gauge symmetries—from \\(SU(3) \\times SU(2) \\times U(1)\\) at high temperatures to \\(SU(3)\\) alone near absolute zero—motivated by the experimental Meissner effect. This symmetry reduction posits that \\(SU(3)\\) forms the fundamental \"atoms\" of vacuum energy. Our analysis demonstrates that the calculated number of \\(SU(3)\\) vacuum atoms reconciles QFT's predictions with empirical observations, effectively resolving the cosmological constant problem. The third law of thermodynamics, by preventing the attainment of absolute zero, ensures the stability of \\(SU(3)\\) vacuum atoms, providing a thermodynamic foundation for quark confinement. This stability guarantees a strictly positive mass gap, defined by the vacuum energy density, and implies a Lorentzian quantum structure of spacetime. Moreover, it offers insights into the origins of both gravity/gauge duality and gravity/superconductor duality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c9c845282100ca81724fcd9658e864bf6ae426bfd256807e4369286e70d6c5a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
