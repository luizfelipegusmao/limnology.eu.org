{"title":"5-HT receptors exert differential effects on seizure-induced respiratory arrest in DBA/1 mice","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304601","date":1717164000000,"content":"<p>by Yundan Pan, Zheren Tan, Jialing Guo, Hua-Jun Feng</p>\r\n\r\nBoth clinical and animal studies demonstrated that seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) contributes importantly to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). It has been shown that enhancing serotonin (5-HT) function relieves S-IRA in animal models of SUDEP, including DBA/1 mice. Direct activation of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors suppresses S-IRA in DBA/1 mice, indicating that these receptors are involved in S-IRA. However, it remains unknown if other subtypes of 5-HT receptors are implicated in S-IRA in DBA/1 mice. In this study, we investigated the action of an agonist of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> (8-OH-DPAT), 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> (TCB-2), 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> (BW723C86), 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> (MK-212), 5-HT<sub>6</sub> (WAY-208466) and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> (LP-211) receptor on S-IRA in DBA/1 mice. An agonist of the 5-HT receptor or a vehicle was intraperitoneally administered 30 min prior to acoustic simulation, and the effect of each drug/vehicle on the incidence of S-IRA was videotaped for offline analysis. We found that the incidence of S-IRA was significantly reduced by TCB-2 at 10 mg/kg (30%, n = 10; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, Fisherâ€™s exact test) but was not altered by other agonists compared with the corresponding vehicle controls in DBA/1 mice. Our data demonstrate that 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors are implicated in S-IRA, and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>6</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors are not involved in S-IRA in DBA/1 mice.","author":"Yundan Pan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"78b25b771fa1d4b6ee7e04e2e808d85fb3ccf802ecb9d3551d0ed81437606b27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
