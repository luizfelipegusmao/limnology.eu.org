{"title":"Surfperches versus Damselfishes: Trophic Evolution in Closely Related Pharyngognath Fishes with Highly Divergent Reproductive Strategies","link":"https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/doi/10.1093/iob/obae018/7683272?rss=1","date":1716768000000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>Surfperches and damselfishes are very closely related ovalentarians with large reproductive differences. Damselfishes are typical of most Ovalentaria in that they lay demersal eggs that hatch into small, free-feeding larvae. Surfperches are unusual among ovalentarians and most acanthomorphs in having prolonged internal development. They are born at an advanced stage, some as adults, and bypass the need to actively feed throughout an extended period of ontogeny. Damselfishes and surfperches possess the same modifications of the fifth branchial arch that allow them to perform advanced food processing within the pharynx. This condition (pharyngognathy) has large effects on the evolution of feeding mechanics and trophic ecology. Although the evolution of pharyngognaths has received considerable attention, the effects of different reproductive strategies on their diversification have not been examined. We compared head shape evolution in surfperches and damselfishes using geometric morphometrics, principal component analyses, and multiple phylogenetic-comparative techniques. We found that they have similar mean head shapes, that their primary axes of shape variation are comparable and distinguish benthic-feeding and pelagic-feeding forms in each case, and that, despite large differences in crown divergence times, their head shape disparities are not significantly different. Several lines of evidence suggest that evolution has been more constrained in damselfishes: Head shape is evolving faster in surfperches, more anatomical traits have undergone correlated evolution in damselfishes, there is significant phylogenetic signal in damselfish evolution (but not surfperches), and damselfishes exhibit significant allometry in head shape that is not present in surfperches.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Organismal Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ad96bcf7a80ab7e3a1a88c34298d761f9695964c0badbbef4e1166baa6580fcc","entryHash":"cc63402d1589ba5fdf46a9ca4f8e2c6ae0b31c010505e4ae20ce2da1b742ad46","category":"Environment"}
