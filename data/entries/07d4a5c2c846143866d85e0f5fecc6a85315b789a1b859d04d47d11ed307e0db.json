{"title":"Improving Arabica Coffee Quality: Examining Post-Harvest Practices among Farmers in Bener Meriah District, Aceh, Indonesia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0938/v1","date":1718281769000,"content":"Coffee has become a significant commodity for the people of Indonesia, including in Bener Meriah Regency. However, the quality of coffee remains low, partly due to deficiencies in the post-harvest process. This study aimed to analyze coffee farmers' post-harvest process in the Permata Sub-district and identify strategies to enhance coffee quality through farmers' institutions. The research method was qualitative, with data collection techniques comprising in-depth interviews and observation. The findings indicated that most coffee farmers in the Permata Sub-district lacked comprehensive post-harvest processing, impacting the coffee quality. The recommendations of this study emphasize the importance of strengthening coffee farmers' institutions, such as coffee farmer groups, to improve farmers' knowledge and skills in conducting optimal post-harvest processing following specialty coffee standards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07d4a5c2c846143866d85e0f5fecc6a85315b789a1b859d04d47d11ed307e0db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
