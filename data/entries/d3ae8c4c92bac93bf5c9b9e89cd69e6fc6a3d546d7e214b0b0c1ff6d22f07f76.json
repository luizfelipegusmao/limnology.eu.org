{"title":"Oil Distribution around Ball-Raceway Local Contact Region in Under-Race Lubricating Ball Bearing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1871/v1","date":1724712378000,"content":"The distribution of oil and gas phases around ball-raceway local regions is an important basis and foundation for determining whether a bearing is sufficiently lubricated. To obtain the oil phase distribution law in the inner raceway-ball contact local region (IBCR) and outer raceway-ball contact local region (OBCR) of the under-race lubrication ball bearing, the numerical simulation method is used. The effects of bearing rotation speed, oil flow rate, oil viscosity and oil density on these two regions are studied. The results indicate that the oil phase exhibited significant periodic changes in both time and space. Compared with that in the IBCR, the oil phase distribution in the OBCR is more uniform. Increasing the bearing rotation speed and reducing the oil flow rate made the IBCR and OBCR more uniform. Changing the oil viscosity only alters the distribution pattern of the OBCR. The oil density may not affect the fluid flow state or the oil phase distribution in the bearing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d3ae8c4c92bac93bf5c9b9e89cd69e6fc6a3d546d7e214b0b0c1ff6d22f07f76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
