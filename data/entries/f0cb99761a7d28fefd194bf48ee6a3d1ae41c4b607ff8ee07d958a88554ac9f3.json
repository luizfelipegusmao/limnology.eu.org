{"title":"Influence of the Weaving Method (Plain, Twill, Satin) on the Hydrodynamic Behavior of Filtration Membranes Based on Banana Pseudostem Fibres (Musa balbisiana)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1588/v1","date":1726825779000,"content":"The way in which a filtration membrane is woven influences its lifespan and purification performance. This study explores the impact of the weaving method on the hydrodynamic sta-bility of a membrane made from banana pseudotrunk fibres. After extraction, the yarns were characterised. Three membranes were obtained using different weaving methods (plain, twill and satin), and the hydrodynamic study was used to determine the surface density, porosity, per-meability and membrane resistance. Filtration tests were carried out on a suspension of 30 NTU, and the yarn obtained had a twist number of 10, a diameter of 0.75 mm and a tex of 168. The surface density and the percentage of surface voids for the three membranes, plain, twill and satin, were 8.82 g/m2 and 50%, 12.54 g/m2 and 30% and finally 15.77 g/m2 and 12.54%.  The uni membrane showed the best permeability, i.e. 5.60.10-10m2, but lower particle retention with a residual turbidity of 12 NTU, compared with the twill and satin membranes, which have per-meability values of 5.31.10-10m2 and 4.80.10-10m2 and 9 and 7 NTU.The twill membrane appears to be the most suitable for filtration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0cb99761a7d28fefd194bf48ee6a3d1ae41c4b607ff8ee07d958a88554ac9f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
