Despite the efforts made by the National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP), including distribution of Long-Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLINs) to households through periodic Point Mass Distribution (PMD) campaigns and continuous channels (antenatal, schools and postnatal), there is a gap between access and use of LLINs in Ghana. An effective and functional community-based group that would seek to improve the effectiveness of LLIN distribution before, during, after PMD Campaigns and continuous distribution at the community level could help address this gap. This paper assesses the implementation outcomes and short-term effectiveness of the pilot implementation of co-created community health advocacy teams (CHAT) intervention in Ghanaian communities to plan and implement campaigns to increase LLIN use. The study employed a one-group pre-post study design and measured implementation outcomes (acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility) and effectiveness outcomes (LLIN awareness, LLIN access, willingness to purchase LLIN, and LLIN use) among 800 community households. The CHAT intervention was implemented for four months across six districts in the Eastern and Volta regions of Ghana. The data were downloaded directly from REDCap and analyzed statistically (descriptive and McNemar test of association) using SPSS 22 software. After the implementation period, the majority of respondents in all six districts indicated that the CHAT intervention was acceptable (89.8%), appropriate (89.5%), and feasible (90%). Also, there was a significant association between baseline and end-line assessment on all four effectiveness outcome measures. Household membersâ€™ awareness of, access to, willingness to purchase, and use of LLINs increased significantly over the four-month period that the CHAT intervention was implemented. The study concludes that CHAT is an acceptable, appropriate, and feasible intervention for supporting the National Malaria Programme in LLIN PMD and for engaging in Social and Behaviour Change Communication activities through the continuous channels of distribution. Additionally, the CHAT demonstrates short-term effectiveness outcomes in terms of creating LLIN awareness, providing access to LLIN, and encouraging Ghanaian community members to be willing to purchase and use LLINs. Although the activities of CHAT members were largely voluntary, integration into the existing primary health care system will make it sustainable.","author":"Franklin N.
