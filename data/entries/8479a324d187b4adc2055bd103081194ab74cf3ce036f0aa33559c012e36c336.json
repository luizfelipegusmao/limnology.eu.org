{"title":"Circular Modality in Construction: an Interdisciplinary Review in Detecting Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Trajectories","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0946/v1","date":1718281563000,"content":"A general consensus is that the conventional linear modalities guarantee no industrial sustenance in long run for many obvious reasons. This is where the topicality of circularity has been accentuated for the last two decades or so in socio-political arena. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the emphasis given to circularity in the construction industry is relatively low. Tackling this issue essentially warrants a rigorous co-production of integrated knowhow preferably beyond sectorial boundaries. The present study sheds light on interdisciplinary approaches taken to deal with the slowness in transmuting circularity into construction sector. A comprehensive literature survey was undertaken to understand this phenomenon at policy, firm and site level. The analysis included one hundred twenty-eight (128) articles published in high impact journals between 2003 and 2024. Eighty seven (87) gaps in terms of theory, knowledge, practice, method, empiricism and policy were observed. Forty four (44) thematic sub-clusters have the potential of empirical research. A new framework was finally proposed to scaffold the systemic transition towards a circular construction sector. On a practical level, the study offer valuable insights and instruments for the industry personnel to gauge the efficacy of their own circular approaches and initiatives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8479a324d187b4adc2055bd103081194ab74cf3ce036f0aa33559c012e36c336","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
