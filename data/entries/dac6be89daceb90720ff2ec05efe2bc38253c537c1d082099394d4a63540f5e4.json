{"title":"The Generating Functions and Goldbach Conjecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0732/v1","date":1710254613000,"content":"It is proved that there exist two odd prime numbers, pi and pj , such that pi + pj = 2r + 2(r ⩾ 2), where pn denote the n-th odd prime number, 1 ⩽ i, j ⩽ n. By the theory of generating functions, we prove that there exist two positive integers, hi and hj , such that hi + hj = r(r ⩾ 2), where hn = (pn − 1)/2，(pn ⩾ 3).Then we complete the proof.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dac6be89daceb90720ff2ec05efe2bc38253c537c1d082099394d4a63540f5e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
