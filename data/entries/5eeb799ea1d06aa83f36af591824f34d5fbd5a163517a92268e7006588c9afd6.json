{"title":"Targeted psychological and psychosocial interventions for auditory hallucinations in persons with psychotic disorders: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306324","date":1720015200000,"content":"<p>by Laura Fässler, Irene Bighelli, Stefan Leucht, Michel Sabé, Malek Bajbouj, Christine Knaevelsrud, Kerem Böge</p>\r\nBackground <p>In recent years, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) including positive symptoms such as auditory hallucinations (AH). However, clinical trials predominantly examine general treatment effects for positive symptoms. Therefore, previous research is lacking in comprehensive and clear evidence about psychological and psychosocial approaches that are primarily tailored to treat AH. To overcome this knowledge gap in the current literature, we will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of clearly targeted psychological and psychosocial interventions for AH in persons with SSD.</p> Methods and analysis <p>This study protocol has been developed according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols. We will include all randomized controlled trials analyzing the efficacy of targeted psychological and psychosocial interventions especially aimed at treating AH in SSD. We will include studies on adult patients with SSD experiencing AH. The primary outcome will be the change on a published rating scale measuring AH. Secondary outcomes will be delusions, overall symptoms, negative symptoms, depression, social functioning, quality of life, and acceptability (drop-out). We will search relevant databases and the reference lists of included literature. The study selection process will be conducted by two independent reviewers. We will conduct a random-effect meta-analysis to consider heterogeneity across studies. Analyses will be carried out by software packages in R. The risk of bias in each study will be evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Assessment of heterogeneity and sensitivity analysis will be conducted.</p> Discussion <p>The proposed study will augment the existing evidence by providing an overview of effective treatment approaches and their overall efficacy at treating AH in SSD. These findings will complement existing evidence that may impact future treatment implementations in clinical practice by addressing effective strategies to treat AH and therefore improve outcomes for the addressed population.</p> Ethics and dissemination <p>No ethical issues are foreseen. We will publish the results from this study in peer-reviewed journals and at relevant scientific conferences.</p> Trial registration <p>PROSPERO registration number: CRD42023475704.</p>","author":"Laura Fässler","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5eeb799ea1d06aa83f36af591824f34d5fbd5a163517a92268e7006588c9afd6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
