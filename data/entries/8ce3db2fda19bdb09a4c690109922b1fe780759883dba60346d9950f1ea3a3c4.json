{"title":"The microbial-driven nitrogen cycle and its relevance for plant nutrition","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/18/5547/7696643?rss=1","date":1718841600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Nitrogen (N) is a vital nutrient and an essential component of biological macromolecules such as nucleic acids and proteins. Microorganisms are major drivers of N-cycling processes in all ecosystems, including the soil and plant environment. The availability of N is a major growth-limiting factor for plants and it is significantly affected by the plant microbiome. Plants and microorganisms form complex interaction networks resulting in molecular signaling, nutrient exchange, and other distinct metabolic responses. In these networks, microbial partners influence growth and N use efficiency of plants either positively or negatively. Harnessing the beneficial effects of specific players within crop microbiomes is a promising strategy to counteract the emerging threats to human and planetary health due to the overuse of industrial N fertilizers. However, in addition to N-providing activities (e.g. the well-known symbiosis of legumes and <span>Rhizobium</span> spp.), other plantâ€“microorganism interactions must be considered to obtain a complete picture of how microbial-driven N transformations might affect plant nutrition. For this, we review recent insights into the tight interplay between plants and N-cycling microorganisms, focusing on microbial N-transformation processes representing N sources and sinks that ultimately shape plant N acquisition.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"8ce3db2fda19bdb09a4c690109922b1fe780759883dba60346d9950f1ea3a3c4","category":"Environment"}
