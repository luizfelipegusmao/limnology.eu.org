{"title":"Genetic Characterization of Some Accessions of Barley in Algeria with Microsatellites (SSR) Markers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0205/v1","date":1719924571000,"content":"A total of 27  microsatellites markers , scattered all over the genom of barley, were used for characterization,and diversity analysis in 33 barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) accessions and cultivars of Algeria.Over the 27 genetic loci studied, 110 alleles were identified with a mean of 4.1 alleles per locus and the average polymorphism information content (PIC) of 0.46,the marker Ebma0806 showed the greatest value of PIC with 0.83.Genetic diversity at 27 microsatellite loci varied from 0 to 0.84 (Mean=0.50) for 33 Algerian cultivars. The genetic distance among the cultivars ranged from 0.2 to 0.85. Cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on the SSR data clearly differentiate the all genotypes studied.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"85633c0945a8e627e808cc9a6d1c93289b6f66fd3c9ca7dcc85feac86f6d3d21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
