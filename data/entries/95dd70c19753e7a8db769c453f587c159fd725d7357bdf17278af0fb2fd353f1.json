{"title":"E-cigarette use among university students in Palestine: Prevalence, knowledge, and determinant factors","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302946","date":1715176800000,"content":"<p>by Mustafa Ghanim, Maha Rabayaa, Mohammad Abuawad, Munther Saeedi, Johnny Amer</p>\r\nBackground <p>Recent reports indicated accelerated rates of e-cigarette use, especially among youth in various Middle Eastern countries, including Palestine. Nevertheless, little is known about knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions regarding this topic in Palestine. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of e-cigarette use among Palestinian university students, along with their knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions about e-cigarette use.</p> Methods <p>An observational cross-sectional study, utilizing an online self-administered questionnaire, was conducted on Palestinian students from five universities between 17/04/2023 and 04/11/2023.</p> Results <p>A total of 1002 Palestinian university students completed the questionnaire. The prevalence of e-cigarette use among students was 18.1%. The mean knowledge score about e-cigarettes was significantly lower among the users of e-cigarettes compared to non-users. E-cigarette use was significantly associated with the participants’ smoking status. Among e-cigarette users, 43.6% were also current traditional cigarette users, and 66.9% were current waterpipe users. E-cigarette use was significantly associated with having a friend who is a smoker and/ or a smoking mother. Binary logistic regression revealed a significant positive effect between the participant’s smoking status, the mother’s smoking status, knowledge about e-cigarettes, and the use of e-cigarettes (p-value &lt; 0.05). Among e-cigarette users, 18.8% used them in indoor places at the university, and 25% reported using them daily in the past month. Affordability of e-cigarettes was the most reported reason for their use (47.5%).</p> Conclusion <p>This study concluded that e-cigarette use is prevalent and rapidly rising among university students in Palestine. This is worrisome as it is significantly associated with insufficient knowledge about the adverse health effects of E-cigarette use, and its addictive nature. These findings focus on the importance of improving the students’ knowledge about e-cigarette use by implementing educational campaigns and considering age regulations on e-cigarette availability and use.</p>","author":"Mustafa Ghanim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"95dd70c19753e7a8db769c453f587c159fd725d7357bdf17278af0fb2fd353f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
