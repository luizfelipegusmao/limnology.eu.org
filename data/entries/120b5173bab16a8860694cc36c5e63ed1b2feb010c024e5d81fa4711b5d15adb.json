{"title":"Simplified Modelling Techniques for Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1231/v1","date":1726630520000,"content":"Dynamic wireless charging (DWC) for electric vehicles (EVs) is gaining traction as a more accessible charging method, with the added benefits of extending vehicle range and reducing battery size. By providing a charging connection through the road surface, DWC offers an additional charging option without the need for a physical connection. This approach inherently links the charging load profile to the vehicle's movement relative to the charging pad(s), thus introducing more stochastic charging events to the grid. For dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT), these events involve high instantaneous power and are short in duration. To better understand the impact of DWPT, accurate models are required to test control systems and potential solutions. Additionally, these systems require high-frequency simulation for wireless power transfer (WPT), which results in long simulation times during development. In this paper, a simplified model is presented to ensure the efficiency of grid-connected simulations and achieve a certain level of accuracy that reflects the internal dynamics of wireless charging. This model achieves a 30-fold reduction in simulation time with only a 6% deviation from the base model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"120b5173bab16a8860694cc36c5e63ed1b2feb010c024e5d81fa4711b5d15adb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
