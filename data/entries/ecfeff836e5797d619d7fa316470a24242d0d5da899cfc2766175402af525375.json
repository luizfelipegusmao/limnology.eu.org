{"title":"Seeing hormones in action: High-resolution gibberellin dynamics in nodules","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4280/7718588?rss=1","date":1721692800000,"content":"<span>Imagine watching plant hormones like gibberellin (GA) orchestrate developmental processes from seed germination to stem elongation at the cellular level in real time. Using FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) biosensors, which permit single-cell GA measurements in vivo, researchers have unveiled intricate dynamics of GA in the hypocotyls of Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) (<a href=\"#koae216-B3\">Griffiths et al. 2024</a>) and the root nodules of <span>Medicago truncatula</span> (<a href=\"#koae216-B1\">Drapek et al. 2024</a>). This visualization illustrates how GA accumulates and regulates cell division and elongation in response to environmental cues across different tissues.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"ecfeff836e5797d619d7fa316470a24242d0d5da899cfc2766175402af525375","category":"Environment"}
