{"title":"Professional Quality of Life and Job Satisfaction of School Nursing in Spain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0098/v1","date":1719880842000,"content":"Background: School nursing plays a crucial role in promoting the health and well-being of students in educational settings. Previous research has highlighted its protective effect across various health domains, including substance use, mental health, violence, and sexual health. Despite its importance, the job satisfaction of school nurses and the factors influencing it have been insufficiently addressed in scientific research, underscoring the need to better understand their challenges and barriers. Therefore, the objective of this research is to evaluate the perceived job satisfaction and professional quality of life of school nurses at a national level in Spain. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using the Font-Roja Job Satisfaction Questionnaire and the CPV-35 Professional Quality of Life Questionnaire. The sample included 553 school nurses from different geographical regions in Spain, selected through school nursing groups and associations. Data were collected from November 2023 to February 2024. Results: The majority of the nurses were women (68%), with a median age of around 40 years and predominantly less than 5 years of work experience (56%). Significant differences were observed in job satisfaction and professional quality of life depending on the employing entity (healthcare and educational settings). Factors such as workload, institutional support, and work experience influenced the perception of job satisfaction. Conclusions: We affirm that this study, being one of the first of its kind at a national level in Spain, highlights the need to develop effective strategies to improve the job satisfaction and professional quality of life of school nurses. School nurses in Spain present a moderately high level of job satisfaction, although there are significant differences in factors such as status and job monotony depending on the sector of employment (Healthcare, Education, Others). Nurses in educational contexts report lower levels of job satisfaction, influenced by the nature of the work, interpersonal relationships, opportunities for professional development, and institutional support. Additionally, work experience impacts satisfaction, being more positive for nurses with greater experience. We also affirm that the professional quality of life of school nurses is homogeneous, with an average score of 6.000 on the CPV-35. Although professional competence is uniformly perceived, work pressure is a common concern. Working more than 37.5 hours per week is associated with higher professional quality of life, although also with lower job satisfaction. Only half of the schools have a school nurse, highlighting the need for policies that ensure equity in service provision. There is also a recognized need for health training for teachers, which could improve support for nurses and student health. Active interaction with the educational community reinforces the integral role of school nurses and emphasizes the importance of the socioeconomic context in interventions and resource allocation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"498059e1502b5d7c11bcdb6a50b13172cd4fde265715c014718f85deff727d07","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
