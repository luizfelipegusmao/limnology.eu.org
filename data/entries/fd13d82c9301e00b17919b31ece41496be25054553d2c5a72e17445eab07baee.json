{"title":"Immobilization of Cell Walls with Laccase in L-DOPA-Alginate Beads and Investigation of the Influence of Photopolymeriza-Tion on the Temperature Stability of Immobilized Cells and Their Ability for Textile Dye Decolorization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0638/v1","date":1712660881000,"content":"Alginate is naturally occurring polymer derived from brown algae biomass, which has found numerous applications in various fields. Chemical modification of alginate is widely used to improve the physicochemical properties of alginate and to provide new potential for various applications. In this article, we modified alginate with L-DOPA, using periodate oxidation and reductive amination, in order to be get more suitable biopolymer for biocatalysts immobilization and hydrogel formation. Obtained modified alginate was used for immobilization of laccase on cell walls. For this purpose, laccase from Streptomyces cyaneus was expressed on the surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY100 cells. Obtained cell wall laccase was immobilized within L-DOPA-alginate beads, by crosslinking of L-DOPA-alginate with calcium ions and laccase. The effect of additional crosslinking of beads by green light induced photopolymerization with eosin Y was investigated. The immobilized laccase systems were used for dye decolorization and also investigated in multiple treatment processes of dye decolorization. Beads with L-DOPA-alginate with higher degree of modification (5.0 mol%) showed higher enzymatic activity and better de-colorization efficiency compared to those with lower degree of modification (2.5 mol%). Obtained immobilized biocatalysts are suitable for the decolorization of dye Evans Blue due to their high efficiency and reusability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd13d82c9301e00b17919b31ece41496be25054553d2c5a72e17445eab07baee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
