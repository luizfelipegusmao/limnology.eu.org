The binder function (Co) is to join the carbide hard particles and provide higher toughness to the cemented carbide [<a href=\"#ozae044.658-B1\">1</a>]. In the last decades, high entropy alloys (HEAs) have increased interest in the scientific community due to their structural and mechanical properties. Most high-entropy alloys are made up of at least 5 metallic elements in equiatomic or close compositions. One of the alloys that is presented in most studies by researchers is the Cantor alloy (CocrFeMnNi) due to the great thermodynamic stability it presents and an FCC crystalline structure, which makes it ideal to function as a binder due to FCC structure, which tend to be very ductile [<a href=\"#ozae044.658-B2\">2</a>]. This work focuses on evaluating the microstructure and the mechanical properties incorporate the high entropy alloy (CoCrFeMnNi), as substitute for cobalt in cemented carbides.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ec55342710d77090105614d581b37c31861d7ad353df3cbb59e75bb6d21c29b2","category":"Environment"}
