{"title":"The Planck Computer is the Quantum Gravity Computer We Live Inside a Gigantic Computer, the Hubble Sphere God Computer?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0137/v1","date":1722569328000,"content":"Recent developments in the quantization of general relativity theory provide a new perspective on matter and even the whole universe. Already in 1922, Eddington suggested that a future quantum gravity theory had to be linked to the Planck length. This is today the main view among many working with quantum gravity. Recently, it has been demonstrated how the Planck length, the Planck time can be extracted from gravity observations with no knowledge of G, ħ or even c. Rooted in this, both general relativity theory and multiple other gravity theories can be quantized and linked to the Planck scale. A revelation from this is that matter seems to be ticking at the reduced Compton frequency, where each tick can be seen as one bit, and one bit corresponds to a Planck mass event. This new way of looking at gravity also can tell us considerably about what quantum gravity computers are and what they potentially can do. We will claim that all quantum gravity and quantum gravity computers are directly linked to the Planck scale and the Compton frequency in matter, something we will discuss in this paper. Quantum gravity computers, we will see, in many ways are nature’s own designed computers with enormous capacity to 3D “print” real time. Basically, we live inside a gigantic quantum gravity computer known as the Hubble sphere, and we even are quantum gravity computers. The observable universe is basically a quantum gravity computer that calculates approximately 10^104 bits per second (bps).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"79921364b10f8f957d61552ad4518c8815ea6396b76f2e91e6a704ef4653aae6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
