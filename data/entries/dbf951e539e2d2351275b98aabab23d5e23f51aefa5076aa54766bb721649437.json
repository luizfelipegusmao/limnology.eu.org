{"title":"Case Study for Predicting Failures in Water Supply Networks Using Neural Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1605/v1","date":1711457031000,"content":"This study addresses the prediction of recurring failures in water supply networks, a complex and costly task, but essential for the effective maintenance of these vital infrastructures. Using historical failure data provided by Companhia de Água e Esgotos da Paraíba (CAGEPA), the research focuses on predicting the time until the next failure at specific points in the network. The authors divided the failures into two categories: Occurrences of New Faults (ONF) and Recurrences of Faults (RF). To make the predictions, they used predictive models based on Machine Learning, more specifically on MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) neural networks. The study revealed that, by analyzing data from past failures and considering factors such as altitude, number of failures on the same street and days between failures, it is possible to achieve an accuracy greater than 80% in predicting failures within a 90-day interval. This demonstrates the feasibility of using fault history to predict future water supply outages with significant accuracy. These forecasts allow water utilities to plan and optimize their maintenance, minimizing inconvenience and losses. The article contributes to the field of water infrastructure management by suggesting that the data-driven approach can be applied in other cities or in networks of different types, such as energy or communication networks. The conclusions highlight the importance of data collection and analysis in preventing failures and optimizing water utilities’ resources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbf951e539e2d2351275b98aabab23d5e23f51aefa5076aa54766bb721649437","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
