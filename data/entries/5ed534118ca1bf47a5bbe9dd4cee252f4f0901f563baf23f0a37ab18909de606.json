In recent years, it has been considered a suitable material for construction and engineering applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.274-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.274-B3\">3</a>], in addition to its traditional use. Clay presents several advantages as a structural material, including its abundance, low cost, and environmental friendliness. To be used in applications, clay must undergo a firing process. This process leads to the acquisition of certain properties, both desired and undesired, such as structural strength, porosity, and thermal conductivity. These properties result from the chemical and morphological changes that take place in the mineral structure during firing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5ed534118ca1bf47a5bbe9dd4cee252f4f0901f563baf23f0a37ab18909de606","category":"Environment"}
