{"title":"Characterization of a Peruvian coastal fishery targeting the Pacific guitarfish Pseudobatos planiceps","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15834?af=R","date":1718002800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>From December 2012 to June 2014, 796 Pacific guitarfish were caught in 183 fishing sets in northern Peru. Catch occurred in 86.3% of sets. Most individuals caught were mature with a bias toward males. The mean total length for females and males was 83.4 cm, and 91.1 cm, respectively. The capture per unit effort (CPUE) was 12.6 ± 3.4 guitarfish (km.12 h)<sup>−1</sup>. The length–weight relationships showed that this species presents a sexual dimorphism in growth. These results support the importance of Sechura Bay as a key area for this species. This study represents the first species-specific fishery data for the Pacific guitarfish.</p>","author":"Astrid Jimenez, \nSergio Pingo, \nAdriana González‐Pestana, \nJoanna Alfaro‐Shigueto, \nJeffrey C.
