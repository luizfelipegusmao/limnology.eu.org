While bulk TMDs are usually indirect semiconductors, WS<sub>2</sub> becomes a direct band gap material in the 2D limit. The direct K-point band gap leads to an enhanced quantum efficiency and a significant increase in photoluminescence (PL) [<a href=\"#ozae044.732-B1\">1â€“3</a>]. Excitons, which are quasiparticles describing bound electron-hole pairs, are of key interest in 2D TMDs. Due to the reduced dimensionality of the 2D system, the Coulomb screening is reduced [<a href=\"#ozae044.732-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.732-B5\">5</a>], resulting in an order of magnitude increase in the binding energy of excitons compared to those in bulk materials, making them observable at room temperature. Applications of TMDs are therefore often linked to the behavior of excitons. By creating structural variations, such as changing the number of layers or applying different layer stacking, the excitonic properties of the material can be manipulated. A detailed understanding of these properties is crucial for tailoring device applications such as solar cells [<a href=\"#ozae044.732-B6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.732-B7\">7</a>] or battery electrodes [<a href=\"#ozae044.732-B8\">8</a>]. In particular, the WS<sub>2</sub>/graphene heterostructure is of great relevance for field-effect tunneling transistors [<a href=\"#ozae044.732-B9\">9</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.732-B10\">10</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3bb968e083af7fc4faec6eed9c607e5e6bde8850472515a9c0be34d1f184b33a","category":"Environment"}
