DIR not only drives organic carbon (OC) mineralization, but also sequesters inorganic carbon (IC) via iron abiotic-phase transformation, and the OC-microbe-mineral interface facilitates abiotic and biotic processes. The iron-rich environment with high calcium and OC supports rapid DIR, generating sufficient Fe<sup>2+</sup> and CO<sub>2</sub>, which is conducive to increasing IC sequestration.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) can drive the release of organic carbon (OC) as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) by mediating electron transfer between organic compounds and microbes. However, DIR is also crucial for carbon sequestration, which can affect inorganic-carbon redistribution via iron abiotic–phase transformation. The formation conditions of modern carbonate-bearing iron minerals (IC<sub>Fe</sub>) and their potential as a CO<sub>2</sub> sink are still unclear. A natural environment with modern IC<sub>Fe</sub>, such as karst lake sediment, could be a good analog to explore the regulation of microbial iron reduction and sequential mineral formation. We find that high porosity is conducive to electron transport and dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria activity, which can increase the iron reduction rate. The iron-rich environment with high calcium and OC can form a large sediment pore structure to support rapid DIR, which is conducive to the formation and growth of IC<sub>Fe</sub>. Our results further demonstrate that the minimum DIR threshold suitable for IC<sub>Fe</sub> formation is 6.65 μmol g<sup>−1</sup> dw day<sup>−1</sup>. DIR is the dominant pathway (average 66.93%) of organic anaerobic mineralization, and the abiotic-phase transformation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> reduces CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by ~41.79%. Our findings indicate that as part of the carbon cycle, DIR not only drives mineralization reactions but also traps carbon, increasing the stability of carbon sinks. Considering the wide geographic distribution of DIR and IC<sub>Fe</sub>, our findings suggest that the “iron mesh” effect may become an increasingly important vector of carbon sequestration.</p>","author":"Cheng Zhao, \nFan Xun, \nBiao Li, \nXiaotong Han, \nHuan Liu, \nYingxun Du, \nQinglong L.
