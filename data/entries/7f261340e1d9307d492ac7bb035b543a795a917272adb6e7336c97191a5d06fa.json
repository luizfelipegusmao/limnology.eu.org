{"title":"Sensitivity Analysis of Airfoil Deformation for Aerial-Aquatic Navigation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0760/v1","date":1723458899000,"content":"This paper aims to explore the relationship between airfoil deformation and airfoil aerial-aquatic adaptation. The form of “flexible skin and rigid drive structura” holds immense potential for various applications. In this study, we utilize the B-spline method to parametrically describe the airfoil shape. An airfoil deformation parameterization method is proposed based on the isogeometric method. This method allows us to depict airfoil deformation as the position and displacement of the driving point, enabling an expression of the flexible skin's deformation driven by the internal structure. We utilize the Xfoil application and Gaussian regression method to elucidate the relationship between driving point position and displacement and the airfoil's dynamic performance. Additionally, we employ the Sobol method to assess the sensitivity of the driving point variables to the airfoil's dynamic performance. Our findings indicate that the attack angle of the airfoil exhibits the highest sensitivity index to the airfoil's dynamic performance. Furthermore, variables of the driving point situated at the leading and trailing edges of the lower surface significantly impact the airfoil lift coefficient, those located at the mid-section of the upper surface have a considerable effect on the airfoil drag coefficient.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f261340e1d9307d492ac7bb035b543a795a917272adb6e7336c97191a5d06fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
