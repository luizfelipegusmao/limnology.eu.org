{"title":"Prospects and Potential Applications of Nanomaterials in PCOS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1950/v1","date":1729772709000,"content":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the predominant endocrine disorder among women of re-productive age and represents the leading cause of anovulatory infertility, which imposes a con-siderable health and economic burden. Currently, medications used to treat PCOS can lead to certain adverse reactions, such as affecting fertility and increasing the risk of venous thrombosis. Drug delivery systems utilizing nanomaterials, characterized by prolonged half-life, preci-sion-targeted delivery, enhanced bioavailability, and reduced toxicity, are currently being em-ployed in the management of PCOS. This innovative approach is gaining traction as a favored strategy for augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of medications. Consequently, this paper dis-cusses the roles of nanoparticles, nanocarriers, and targeted ligands within nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems, aiming to identify optimal methodologies for treating PCOS using nano-materials. Additionally, prospective research avenues concerning nanomaterial-based delivery systems in the context of PCOS, as well as the implications of existing insights on the advancement of novel therapies for PCOS, are highlighted.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eca49b3a6d0c39c346bfe8e39fe9b7a1eafe849c60fc74e8d1be5fdaa222f31c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
