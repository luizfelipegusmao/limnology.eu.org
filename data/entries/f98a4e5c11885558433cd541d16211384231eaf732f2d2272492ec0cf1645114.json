{"title":"A Review of the Current Greenhouse Technology Status in China and Development Prospects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0666/v1","date":1718093465000,"content":"China’s greenhouse industry has thousands of years of development history, although the development of modern greenhouses has come late. After decades of development of China, its greenhouse industry is in the forefront of the world. China’s greenhouse industry is experiencing rapid development, transformation and upgrading. China ranks first in the world in terms of greenhouse area, used mainly for vegetable cultivation and plays an important role in the utilization of agricultural resources and food production. In 2023, the cumulative area of new greenhouses nationwide was 1835.87 million ha. In this paper we present the latest developments in the greenhouse sector. More specifically, we present a greenhouse market development overview, the greenhouse production, the greenhouse industry, and technology development. Current problems are underpinned, development opportunities and prospects are analyzed, and measures and specific proposals are detailed for the technological development of the greenhouse sector both for increasing product quantity and quality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f98a4e5c11885558433cd541d16211384231eaf732f2d2272492ec0cf1645114","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
