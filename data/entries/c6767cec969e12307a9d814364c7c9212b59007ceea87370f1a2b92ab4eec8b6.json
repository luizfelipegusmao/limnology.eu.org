{"title":"Metabolomics Comparison and Nutrition Evaluation of Geographical Indication Newhall Navel Oranges in China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1761/v1","date":1729694067000,"content":"The metabolomics of Newhall navel oranges with geographical indication (GI) was measured by LC-MS/MS from three areas Ganzhou, Fengjie, and Zigui in China. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis was performed for samples classification and important metabolites identification. This approach identified the best markers (i.e. tricarboxylic acid, amino acids, and phenolics) of the geographical origin able to discriminated Fengjie, Ganzhou, and Zigui organge samples. The results showed that peeled-samples from Zigui were richest and those from Fengjie lowest in all of the top ten most important markers. In whole samples, the highest levels of seven important markers occurred in those from Zigui, and the other three important markers appeared the highest levels in those from Ganzhou. According to the variation of the best markers, and the highest value of titratable acidity in those from Zigui, the samples planted in Ganzhou have the best balance between taste and nutrition. This work confirms the approach of metabolomics combined with OPLS-DA is an effective way for origin tracing and overall quality evaluation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6767cec969e12307a9d814364c7c9212b59007ceea87370f1a2b92ab4eec8b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
