{"title":"Comparative pathogenicity of Nocardia seriolae in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), milkfish (Chanos chanos) and Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13947?af=R","date":1717797159000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Nocardiosis, caused by <i>Nocardia seriolae</i>, has been a prominent disease in Southeast Asian aquaculture in the last three decades. This granulomatous disease reported in various fish species is responsible for significant economic losses. This study investigated the pathogenicity of <i>N. seriolae</i> in three cultured species in Taiwan: Nile tilapia (omnivore), milkfish (herbivore) and Asian seabass (carnivore). Administration of an infective dose of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/ fish in tilapia, seabass and milkfish demonstrated mortalities of 100%, 90% and 75%, respectively. Additionally, clinical signs namely, granuloma and lesions displayed varying intensities between the groups and pathological scores. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification specific for <i>N. seriolae</i> was confirmed to be positive (432 bp) using NS1/NG1 primers. Post-mortem lesions revealed the absence of granulomas in tilapia and milkfish and their presence in the seabass. Interestingly, the gut in tilapia showed an influx of eosinophils suggesting its role during the acute stages of infection. However, post-challenge, surviving milkfish exhibited granulomatous formations, while surviving seabass progressed toward healing and tissue repair within sampled tissues. Overall, in conclusion, these results demonstrate the versatility in the immunological ability of individual Perciformes to contain this pathogen as a crucial factor that influences its degree of susceptibility.</p>","author":"Sandra Celenia Nazareth, \nLi‐Wu Cheng, \nPei‐Chi Wang, \nShih‐Chu Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"c91313ffaf727385ec7d1685bdc10885b24522a67f8ba48adb380500c5a1feeb","category":"Environment"}
