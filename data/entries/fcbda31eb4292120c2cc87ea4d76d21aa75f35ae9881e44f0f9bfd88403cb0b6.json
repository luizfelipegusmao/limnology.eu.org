{"title":"The Function of Florigen in the Vegetative-to-Reproductive Phase Transition in and around the Shoot Apical Meristem","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/3/322/7511236?rss=1","date":1704412800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants undergo a series of developmental phases throughout their life-cycle, each characterized by specific processes. Three critical features distinguish these phases: the arrangement of primordia (phyllotaxis), the timing of their differentiation (plastochron) and the characteristics of the lateral organs and axillary meristems. Identifying the unique molecular features of each phase, determining the molecular triggers that cause transitions and understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these transitions are keys to gleaning a complete understanding of plant development. During the vegetative phase, the shoot apical meristem (SAM) facilitates continuous leaf and stem formation, with leaf development as the hallmark. The transition to the reproductive phase induces significant changes in these processes, driven mainly by the protein FT (FLOWERING LOCUS T) in <span>Arabidopsis</span> and proteins encoded by <span>FT</span> orthologs, which are specified as ‘florigen’. These proteins are synthesized in leaves and transported to the SAM, and act as the primary flowering signal, although its impact varies among species. Within the SAM, florigen integrates with other signals, culminating in developmental changes. This review explores the central question of how florigen induces developmental phase transition in the SAM. Future research may combine phase transition studies, potentially revealing the florigen-induced developmental phase transition in the SAM.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"fcbda31eb4292120c2cc87ea4d76d21aa75f35ae9881e44f0f9bfd88403cb0b6","category":"Environment"}
