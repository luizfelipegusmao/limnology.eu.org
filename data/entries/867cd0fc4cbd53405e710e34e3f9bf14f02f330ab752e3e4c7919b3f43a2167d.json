{"title":"Rare Earth Doped Anhydrite â€“ a Cryo-cathodoluminescence Study","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.015/7719484?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>A process that has been developed to mimic ore formation processes of hydrothermal zinc deposits to grown zinc sulphide (ZnS) and anhydrite (CaSO<sub>4</sub>) in the laboratory [<a href=\"#ozae044.015-B1\">1</a>] has been extended to measure the uptake of germanium [<a href=\"#ozae044.015-B2\">2</a>] and rare earth (RE) ions within these deposits. Natural calcite crystals are introduced into a solution together with trace RE ions and under hydrothermal conditions dissolved and reprecipitated as CaSO<sub>4</sub> together with ZnS. We have previously reported that the ZnS nucleates with the anhydrite and forms crystal bundles (rosettes) which accumulate into layers of tens of microns [<a href=\"#ozae044.015-B3\">3</a>]. One of the issues encountered when these samples were originally imaged was the sensitivity of the anhydrite to beam damage, and since the RE ions can be finely zoned the imaging requirements necessitate fine scale mapping and micron to sub-micron quantitative microanalysis. The solution has been to examine these samples at cryogenic temperatures in the EPMA, typically 80K. We have now extended this technique to imaging 22mm rounds contained in a 25 mm brass cup. This new stage has advantages over the previous cold stage holder which had a 10mm diameter and required a specialised holder for polishing. The new holder allows larger samples to be mounted and conventional polishing procedures can be utilized enabling larger regions to be readily available for imaging. In the EPMA cryogenic setup, samples require thin metal coating, Ir 2 nm, to be applied prior to imaging and the films only appear to take one temperature cycle before becoming non-conductive or lifting from the surface. This necessitates imaging and point analyses being performed in the one run without the sample being warmed between different analytical techniques.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"867cd0fc4cbd53405e710e34e3f9bf14f02f330ab752e3e4c7919b3f43a2167d","category":"Environment"}
