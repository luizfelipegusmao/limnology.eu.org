{"title":"Advances in Modeling Approaches for Oral Drug Delivery: Artificial Intelligence, Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic, and First-Principle Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0471/v2","date":1721050583000,"content":"Oral drug absorption is the primary route for drug administration. However, this process hinges on multiple factors, including the drugâ€™s physicochemical properties, formulation characteristics, and gastrointestinal physiology. Given its intricacy and the exorbitant costs associated with experimentation, the trial-and-error method proves prohibitively expensive. Theoretical models have emerged as a cost-effective alternative by assimilating data from diverse experiments and theoretical considerations. These models fall into three categories: data-driven models, encompassing classical pharmacokinetics, quantitative-structure models (QSAR), and machine/deep learning. Mechanism-based models include quasi-equilibrium, steady-state, and physiologically based pharmacokinetics, alongside first principles such as molecular dynamics and continuum models. This review provides an overview of recent modeling endeavors across these categories, evaluating their respective advantages and limitations. Additionally, a primer on partial differential equations and their numerical solutions is included in the supplementary materials, recognizing their utility in modeling physiological systems despite their mathematical complexity limiting their widespread application in this field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3ce8014a2a96fe9f98b1fe94fffbcbd5939056a64cc08005d0bdbdb33ea39eb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
