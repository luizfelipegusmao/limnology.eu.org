{"title":"Patterns and Emerging Trends in Acute Poisoning with Substances of Abuse Used for Recreational Purposes in Adolescents: a six-year multicentre study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1634/v1","date":1721634055000,"content":"This six-year multicentre study investigated acute intentional poisoning with substances of abuse in adolescents to identify changes and patterns in substance use. Data from 568 adolescents were collected from three paediatric poison centres in Romania between January 2017 and December 2022. The study analysed the epidemiological and sociodemographic characteristics of the adolescents, including age, gender, place of residence, history of substance abuse, psychiatric history, and history of institutionalized care. The findings revealed that cannabis and new psychoactive sub-stances (NPSs) are the most commonly implicated substances, each with distinct profiles among adolescents. Cannabis was involved in 45.6% of cases, with a significant association with urban residency. NPSs were identified as the second most prevalent substance, accounting for 38.9% of cases. These were more prevalent in rural areas and among patients with psychiatric disorders. Cannabis and NPSs were also the most commonly implicated substances in acute intentional poisoning cases with substances of abuse. These substances have distinct profiles among adolescents, including age, gender, residency area, history of substance abuse, psychiatric history, and institutional care. These findings underscore the necessity of targeted public health interventions and integrated care approaches to address substance use and related mental health issues in adolescents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"692c1c0feff90f0cfaabdc8ddb7b920dd531d6f2c57eec19085c07493b68e729","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
