{"title":"Emerald Ash Borer Management and Research: Decades of Damage and Still Expanding","link":"https://new.annurev.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ento-012323-032231?TRACK=RSS","date":1706140800000,"content":"<div><p>Since the discovery of the ash tree (<span>Fraxinus</span> spp.) killer emerald ash borer (EAB; <span>Agrilus planipennis</span>) in the United States in 2002 and Moscow, Russia in 2003, substantial detection and management efforts have been applied to contain and monitor its spread and mitigate impacts. Despite these efforts, the pest continues to spread within North America. It has spread to European Russia and Ukraine and is causing sporadic outbreaks in its native range in China. The dynamics of EAB's range expansion events appear to be linked to the lack of resistant ash trees in invaded ranges, facilitated by the abundance of native or planted North American susceptible ash species. We review recently gained knowledge of the range expansion of EAB; its ecological, economic, and social impacts; and past management efforts with their successes and limitations. We also highlight advances in biological control, mechanisms of ash resistance, and new detection and management approaches under development, with the aim of guiding more effective management.</p></div>","author":"Jianghua Sun, Tuuli-Marjaana Koski, Jacob D.
