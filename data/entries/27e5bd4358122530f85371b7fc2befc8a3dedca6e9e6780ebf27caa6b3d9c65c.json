{"title":"Compaction and Segregation of DNA in Escherichia coli","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0089/v1","date":1711969872000,"content":"Theoretical and experimental approaches have been applied to study the polymer physics under-lying compaction of DNA in the bacterial nucleoid. Knowledge of the compaction mechanism is necessary to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the process of segregation of replicating chromosome arms (replichores) during the cell cycle.\nIn the first part of this review light microscope observations are discussed that have demonstrated that the nucleoid has a lower refractive index and thus a lower density than the cytoplasm. A polymer-physical explanation for this phenomenon was given by the theory of Theo Odijk pro-posed in 1998. By assuming a phase separation between nucleoid and cytoplasm and by imposing equality of osmotic pressure and chemical potential between the two phases, a minimal energy situation is obtained in which soluble proteins are depleted from the nucleoid, thus explaining its lower density. The theory is compared with recent views for DNA compaction that are based on mere exclusion of polyribosomes from the nucleoid or on the transcriptional activity of the cell. These new views raise the question of whether they can still explain the lower refractive index or density of the nucleoid.\nIn the second part of this review the question is discussed how DNA segregation occurs in Esche-richia coli, in the absence of the so-called active ParABS system, present in the majority of bacteria. How is entanglement prevented of nascent chromosome arms, generated at the origin in the pa-rental network of the E. coli nucleoid? The observations of the groups of Sherratt and Hansen in 2006, that the four nascent chromosome arms synthesized in the initial replication bubble, segre-gate to opposite halves of the sister nucleoids implies that extensive intermingling of daughter strands does not occur. Based on the hypothesis that leading and lagging replichores synthesized in the replication bubble, fold into micro-domains that do not intermingle, a passive \"four-excluding-arms model\" for segregation is proposed. This model implies that the key for seg-regation already lies in the structure of the replication bubble at the very start of DNA replication; it explains the different patterns of chromosome arms as well as the segregation distances between replicated loci as experimentally observed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"27e5bd4358122530f85371b7fc2befc8a3dedca6e9e6780ebf27caa6b3d9c65c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
