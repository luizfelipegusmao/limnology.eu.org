The book also includes short interviews with contributors on what additional <strong>lessons, challenges, and tips</strong> they have to share some time after the case studies were written.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Performance</strong> includes examples of measuring, budgeting, optimizing, and monitoring performance, in addition to tips for building a performance culture.</li>\n<li><strong>Capabilities</strong> is about bridging the gap between native capabilities and the modern web. You’ll explore web apps, native apps, and progressive web applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> makes web apps viable for diverse users, including people with temporary or permanent disabilities. Most of us will have a disability at some point in our lives, and these case studies show how we can make the web work for all of us.</li>\n<li><strong>Developer Experience</strong> is about building a project environment and culture that encourage support, growth, and problem-solving within teams. Strong teams build great projects!</li>\n</ul>\n\nWe’re Trying Out Something New\n<p>In an effort to conserve resources here at Smashing, we’re trying something new with <em>Success at Scale</em>. The printed book will be 304 pages, and we’ll make an <strong>expanded PDF version available to everyone who purchases a print book</strong>. This accomplishes a few good things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We will use <strong>less paper and materials</strong> because we are making a smaller printed book;</li>\n<li>We’ll use fewer resources in general to print, ship, and store the books, leading to a <strong>smaller carbon footprint</strong>; and</li>\n<li>Keeping the book at more manageable size means we can <strong>continue to offer free shipping</strong> on all Smashing orders!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Smashing Books have always been printed with materials from <a href=\"https://fsc.org/en\">FSC Certified</a> forests. We are committed to finding new ways to conserve resources while still bringing you the best possible reading experience.</p>\n\n\n    <a href=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/success-at-scale-shipping-soon/success-at-scale-photoshop-opt.png\">\n    <img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/success-at-scale-shipping-soon/success-at-scale-photoshop-opt.png\" />\n    </a>\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/addyosmani\"><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/authors/addy-osmani-success-at-scale.jpg\" /></a><em>Addy Osmani</em> is an engineering leader working on Google Chrome.
