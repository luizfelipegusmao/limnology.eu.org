{"title":"Responsible Reasoning - a Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0985/v1","date":1728956798000,"content":"The integration of responsible artificial intelligence (RAI) principles with emerging neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) systems is crucial for the development of fair, explainable, and trustworthy AI technologies. This paper presents a systematic review exploring the convergence of RAI and NSAI, analyzing current research to assess how RAI principles such as explainability, bias, robustness, transparency, and privacy have been applied to NSAI. This work employed a systematic literature review to synthesize findings from a sample of papers demonstrating RAI principle implementations. Our analysis reveals two main trends: significant research demonstrates the application of NSAI to enhance RAI principles in other AI systems, while limited work directly applies RAI principles to NSAI architectures. Key challenges include the lack of established frameworks for implementing RAI within NSAI systems and the com- plexities inherent in merging neural and symbolic reasoning methods. This review highlights open research gaps and suggests pathways for future work, emphasizing the need for robust RAI frameworks tailored to NSAI systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2573f7c5404be728b1ec3d2936017bf73307084d4d87e772a0b8e9baaba73877","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
