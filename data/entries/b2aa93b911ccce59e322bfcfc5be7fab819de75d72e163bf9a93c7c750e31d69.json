{"title":"Staff perspectives on fall prevention activities in long-term care facilities for older residents: \"Brief but often\" staff education is key","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310139","date":1725890400000,"content":"<p>by Neah Albasha, Catriona Curtin, Ruth McCullagh, Nicola Cornally, Suzanne Timmons</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Falls are a serious health problem in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), affecting more than 50% of residents. A key role of LTCF staff is to assess fall risks and implement fall prevention activities. Understanding the barriers and facilitators is key to successful implementation.</p> Methods <p>This descriptive qualitative study involving four LTCF facilities (varied provider types and sizes) in southwest Ireland. We recruited a convenience sample of 17 LTCF staff, who participated in semi-structured online 1:1 interviews (n = 7) or small group interviews (n = 10). The data were analysed using Braun and Clarke’s reflective thematic analysis.</p> Results <p>The participants included two directors of nursing, three therapists, one ward manager, one general practitioner, five nurses and five healthcare assistants. Six main themes were identified, reflecting factors that influenced fall prevention: a need for sufficient staff and appropriate skill mix; fall policy, documentation and leadership; equipment and safe environments; person-centred care; staff knowledge, skills and awareness in falls prevention; and staff communication and collaborative working. A wide range of approaches that supported LTCF staff to overcome barriers were identified, including audits and feedback, falls champions, fall prevention leaders, daily communication (e.g., safety pauses) and staff collaboration. Formal multidisciplinary meetings and identification systems to highlight residents at high risk of falling were not considered helpful. Staff suggested that education should be briefer, ongoing and practice-based (“brief but often”) to promote ownership and responsibility.</p> Conclusion <p>LTCF staff identified several approaches to prevent falls in LTCFs as part of usual care, rather than lengthy, formal meetings and training. The potential role of families in fall prevention was under-appreciated and should be investigated further.</p>","author":"Neah Albasha","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b2aa93b911ccce59e322bfcfc5be7fab819de75d72e163bf9a93c7c750e31d69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
