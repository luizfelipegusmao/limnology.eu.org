{"title":"Managing emissions with smart city technology | Science","link":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adr0001","date":1726146060000,"content":"By 2050, an estimated 70% of the human population will live in cities (1), which will likely lead to increases in greenhouse gases emitted by transportation, infrastructure, and waste (2). In addition to exacerbating climate change, emissions contribute to air pollution, which already poses a substantial risk to human health (1, 2). Smart technology—networked, online devices that can collect detailed data and automate the efficient use of materials and energy—could mitigate the risks of increased urbanization and the resulting emissions and pollution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"ce43e2b06268d1ef2fb37e9b249794bd52dbbf3f94cfcc2a2f4a164df1acf4d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
