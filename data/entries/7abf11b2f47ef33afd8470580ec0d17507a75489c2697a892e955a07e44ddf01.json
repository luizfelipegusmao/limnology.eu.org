However, identifying the fundamental limits of such dynamics and the properties controlling them has been elusive. Here, using a novel implementation of scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (SUEM), in bulk n-GaAs and p-InAs, we simultaneously measure picosecond carrier dynamics along with three related quantities: sub-surface band bending, above-surface vacuum potentials, and surface trap densities. We make two surprising observations. First, we uncover a negative-time contrast in secondary electrons resulting from an interplay among these quantities. Second, despite dopant concentrations and surface state densities differing by many orders of magnitude between the two materials, their carrier dynamics, measured by photo-excited band bending and filling of surface states, occur at a seemingly common timescale of about 100 ps. This observation indicates fundamental surface-state-limited universal kinetics in optoelectronic III-V semiconductors, and also the crucial need for techniques that simultaneously measure electro-optical kinetic properties [<a href=\"#ozae044.718-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7abf11b2f47ef33afd8470580ec0d17507a75489c2697a892e955a07e44ddf01","category":"Environment"}
