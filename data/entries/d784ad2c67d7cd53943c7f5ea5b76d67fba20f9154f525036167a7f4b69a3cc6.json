{"title":"A Distance Based One-Sample Test of Means Difference for Multivariate Datasets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0613/v1","date":1725863301000,"content":"In this note, we suggest a one-sample version of the recently proposed two-sample test for comparison of the means of multivariate samples. The test checks a hypothesis that the mean of multivariate sample is equal to a certain value with the alternative hypothesis that the mean does not equal to this value. The suggested test is illustrated by analysis of real-world and simulated data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d784ad2c67d7cd53943c7f5ea5b76d67fba20f9154f525036167a7f4b69a3cc6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
