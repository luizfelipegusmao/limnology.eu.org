{"title":"On the Thorny Issue of Single-Submission","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1506/v1","date":1716441367000,"content":"This article examines varying viewpoints on the single-submission policy in scientific publishing, which has recently come under attack. The rule permits the sequential, rather than simultaneous, submission of a manuscript to more than one journal and dictates that an author(s) must wait for a response from one journal before resubmitting the same work to another for consideration. A corollary is that legitimising multiple-submissions would create more problems than it could solve.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"01982a50791d048385cbbbf265430794d0e07cbf896e889709feecfc13171c7c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
