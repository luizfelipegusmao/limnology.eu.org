{"title":"On Double Fuzzy Topological Spaces: Some New Types of Separation Axioms, Continuity, and Compactness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1125/v1","date":1713337222000,"content":"In this article, we first introduced new types of higher separation axioms called (r,s)-GFS-regular and (r,s)-GFS-normal spaces with the help of (r,s)-generalized fuzzy semi-closed sets (briefly, (r,s)-gfsc sets) and discussed some topological properties of them. Thereafter, we defined a stronger form of (r,s)-gfsc sets called (r,s)-g*fsc sets and investigated some of its features. Moreover, we showed that (r,s)-fsc set  →  (r,s)-g*fsc set  →  (r,s)-gfsc set, but the converse may not be true. In addition, we explored new types of fuzzy generalized mappings between double fuzzy topological spaces (U, τ, τ*) and (V, η, η*), and the relationships between these classes of mappings were examined with the help of some illustrative examples. Finally, some new types of compactness via (r,s)-gfso sets were defined and the relationships between them were introduced.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd225934b51cf99965ce9994698101b8772b7867e424ca194c5c914a0ef30ba1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
