{"title":"Worldwide variation in shape and size of orca (Orcinus orca) saddle patches","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.13171?af=R","date":1726812258000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The global distribution of <i>Orcinus orca</i> (orcas/killer whales) encompasses populations which differ from each other. Saddle patch shapes and sizes were compared for nearly 4,000 individuals, in 48 geographically or ecologically divided groups/populations/ecotypes (GP/E), in four Ocean Basins. Some Antarctic GP/E had five shapes, contrary to previous studies, which found only one shape in these Southern GP/E. Pacific Resident ecotypes had the highest variation in saddle patch shapes. Globally, the most common shape was the ‘Smooth’ category. Saddle patch sizes were measured using a ratio of the width of the saddle patch compared to the width of the dorsal fin base and averaged within each GP/E. The narrowest saddle patches were observed in New Zealand waters. The widest saddle patches were observed at the Crozet Islands and the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas). Globally, we found that the shape and size of saddle patches helped to define various GP/E, reinforcing earlier predictions that this pigmentation may be indicative of population divisions. Our findings may help with describing poorly defined or undescribed ecotypes. Such results may therefore aid assessments by management authorities/policy makers and provide levels of guidance in the creation of conservation or recovery plans.</p>","author":"Pirjo H.
