{"title":"Importance of Soil Health for Coffea spp Cultivation, from a Cooperative Society in Puebla, Mexico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1096/v1","date":1710822458000,"content":"The cultivation systems of Coffea spp in a cooperative society in Puebla, Mexico, include rustic, traditional polyculture, commercial polyculture, unshaded monoculture and shaded monoculture. In this work, the properties of the soil were analyzed through physical, chemical, and biological analysis to determine its nutritional status. Composite sample analyses were conducted to determine physical, chemical and microbiological parameters (fungi, actinomycetes, mesophilic bacteria, nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria). Leaf nutrients were determined. Rustic was the cropping system with the highest amount of K (0.76 cmol kg-1) in soil and nutrient assimilation in leaf (N= 2.79%, P= 660.01, K= 17297.22 and Fe= 271.24 mg kg-1) (p= 0.001); in addition to presenting high populations of mesophilic bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes (30.16, 0.59 and 0.83 respectively, x10 6 CFU g-1 soil) and very low nitrification and denitrification rates. The principal component analysis (PCA) (&gt;3.25%) indicated that actinomycetes and K in soil favor the assimilation of Fe, K and P. This Coffea spp cultivation system had a lower impact on soil health than the rest of the systems and favored forest ecosystem conservation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d26766644fdff7c0ff5bfc0408cedb418588870e52aa66a625c1307af4d30e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
