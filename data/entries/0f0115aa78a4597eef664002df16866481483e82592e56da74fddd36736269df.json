{"title":"New Look on Nuclear Diffraction Scattering Mechanism. A Leading Role of Micro-Gravitational Waves.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1773/v2","date":1726555405000,"content":"Any material object vibrating or rotating excites in spacetime around gravitational waves. Atomic nucleus being highly dynamical object also excites continuously micro gravitational waves which might form around the nucleus specific structure resembling optical diffraction grating and which gives huge effect to nuclear elastic scattering cross sections. The close similarity between the nuclear diffractive scattering and the optical Debye-Sears Effect is shown.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0f0115aa78a4597eef664002df16866481483e82592e56da74fddd36736269df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
