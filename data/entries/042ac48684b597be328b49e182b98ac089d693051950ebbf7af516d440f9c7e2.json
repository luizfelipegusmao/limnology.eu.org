{"title":"Echocardiography in Cardiac Arrest: Incremental Diagnostic and Prognostic Role during Resuscitation Care","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0540/v1","date":1725618420000,"content":"Cardiac arrest (CA) is a life-critical condition. Patients who survive after CA, they go into a defined post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS). In this clinical context, the role of the echocardiogram in recent years has become increasingly important to assess the causes of arrest, the prognosis, and any direct and indirect complications dependent on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) maneuvers. The aim of our review is to evaluate the increasingly important role of the transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram in the CA phase and especially post-arrest, analyzing the data already present in the literature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"042ac48684b597be328b49e182b98ac089d693051950ebbf7af516d440f9c7e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
