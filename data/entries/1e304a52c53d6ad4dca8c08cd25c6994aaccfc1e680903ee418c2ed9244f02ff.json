Restoring frequent fire to dry conifer forests can mitigate high-severity fire risk, but the effects of these treatments on the vegetation composition and structure under projected climate change remain uncertain.\n\nWe used a forest landscape model to assess the impact of thinning and prescribed burns in dry conifer forests across an elevation gradient, encompassing low-elevation pinyon-juniper woodlands, mid-elevation ponderosa pine and high-elevation mixed-conifer forests.\n\nOur results demonstrated that the treatments decreased the probability of high-severity fires by 42% in the study area. At low elevation, the treatments did not prevent loss in forest cover and biomass with decreases in <i>Pinus edulis</i> and <i>Juniperus monosperma</i> abundances. At mid-elevation, changes in fire effects maintained a greater diversity of tree species by favouring the maintenance of cohorts of old trees, in particular <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> which accumulated 5.41 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> more above-ground biomass than without treatments by late-century. Treatments in dry conifer forests modified fire effects beyond the treated area, resulting in increased cover and biomass of old <i>Picea englemannii</i> and <i>Abies lasiocarpa</i> cohorts.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>: Our findings indicate that thinning and prescribed burning can enhance tree species diversity in dry conifer forests by protecting old cohorts from stand-replacing fires. Moreover, our results suggest that treatments mainly implemented in dry pine forests with high risk of high-severity fires can be beneficial for subalpine species conservation by reducing the chance that high-severity fire at mid-elevation is transmitted into high-elevation forest.\n</p>","author":"Cécile C.
