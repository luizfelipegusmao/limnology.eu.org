{"title":"Eczematous Adverse Drug Reaction after Selpercatinib Treatment: Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2145/v1","date":1727361899000,"content":"This study reports a 50-year-old patient presented with eczematous drug-eruption induced by selpercatinib after the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient has symmetric erythematous papules and plaques all over the body with dry, scaly skin accompanied by severe pruritus and visible scarring. After systemic treatment with glucocorticoids, the skin lesions of the patient were well reduced. Currently, the medical literature on the incidence of selpercatinib-induced cutaneous eczematous reactions and their clinical management is scarce. Therefore, this study provides novel evidence for the treatment of selpercatinib-induced cutaneous eczematous reactions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef3612e13b1a77982310452fea2ecec8d90921fcf774d86a17e7d440269ca0be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
