{"title":"Physical Investigations of Microbiologically Influenced Corrosion on Naval Materials and Assets using Scanning Probe Microscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.1080/7720405?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Naval materials and assets are frequently utilized around the world in hot, humid environments. For some assets, such as naval aircraft, organic coatings are often used to protect interior structural membranes from corrosion. In interior regions of the aircraft where sunlight/ultraviolet light cannot penetrate and, exacerbated by the heat and humidity, mold and mildew (fungal) spores may attach and proliferate leading to microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC). Digesting the organic content, fungi can leave by-products such as organic acids, esterases, and lipases which are corrosive and destructive to protective coatings and structural metals. Because naval materials and assets are regularly challenged by elevated humidity, heat, rainfall, fungi/mildew and numerous other factors which can synergistically combine to reduce overall performance, it is critical to understand material susceptibility to environmental and microbial decomposition.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1081885e80d028ea84bf749a353ee561cd6c67d3a2e223ba40d13171d9faea27","category":"Environment"}
