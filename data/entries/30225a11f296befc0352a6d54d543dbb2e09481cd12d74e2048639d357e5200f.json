{"title":"Enhancing Performance of Nanocrystalline SnO2 by Photonic Curing Using Impedance Spectroscopy Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1686/v1","date":1724489237000,"content":"Wide-bandgap tin oxide (SnO2) thin-films are frequently used as an electron-transporting layers in perovskite solar cells due to superior thermal and environmental stabilities. However, its crystallization by conventional thermal methods requires typical temperatures between 300 and 900 ◦C [1] with up-to 60 min crystallization times. These post-processing conditions severely limit the choice of substrates and reduce the large-scale manufacturing capabilities. This work describes the intense pulsed light-induced crystallization of SnO2 thin films using only 500 μs of exposure time. Thin-film properties are investigated using both impedance spectroscopy and photoconductivity characteristic measurements. Nyquist plot analysis establishes that the process parameters have a significant impact on the electronic and ionic behaviors of the SnO2 films. Most importantly, we demonstrate that light-induced crystallization yields improved topography and excellent electrical properties through enhanced charge transfer, improved interfacial morphology and better ohmic contacts compared to thermally-annealed SnO2 films.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30225a11f296befc0352a6d54d543dbb2e09481cd12d74e2048639d357e5200f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
