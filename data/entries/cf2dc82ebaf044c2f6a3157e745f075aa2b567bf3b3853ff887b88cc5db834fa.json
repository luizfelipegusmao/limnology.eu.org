We ran an experiment in stream mesocosms (small model systems), looking at the individual and interactive effects of heatwaves, carbon dioxide, variability in flow velocity, and fine sediment (related to agriculture). We found changes in community composition from all four, and several interactions involving CO<sub>2</sub> and sediment. Our results, although limited, provide insight into potential effects of some poorly understood climate variables and suggest certain CO<sub>2</sub> effects in streams may be strongly influenced by sediment.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Climate change and land-use change are widely altering freshwater ecosystem functioning and there is an urgent need to understand how these broad stressor categories may interact in future. While much research has focused on mean temperature increases, climate change also involves increasing variability of both water temperature and flow regimes and increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, all with potential to alter stream invertebrate communities. Deposited fine sediment is a pervasive land-use stressor with widespread impacts on stream invertebrates. Sedimentation may be managed at the catchment scale; thus, uncovering interactions with these three key climate stressors may assist mitigation of future threats. This is the first experiment to investigate the individual and combined effects of enriched CO<sub>2</sub>, heatwaves, flow velocity variability, and fine sediment on realistic stream invertebrate communities. Using 128 mesocosms simulating small stony-bottomed streams in a 7-week experiment, we manipulated dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> (ambient; enriched), fine sediment (no sediment; 300 g dry sediment), temperature (ambient; two 7-day heatwaves), and flow velocity (constant; variable). All treatments changed community composition. CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment reduced abundances of Orthocladiinae and Chironominae and increased Copepoda abundance. Variable flow velocity had only positive effects on invertebrate abundances (7 of 13 common taxa and total abundance), in contrast to previous experiments showing negative impacts of reduced velocity. CO<sub>2</sub> was implicated in most stressor interactions found, with CO<sub>2</sub> × sediment interactions being most common. Communities forming under enriched CO<sub>2</sub> conditions in sediment-impacted mesocosms had ~20% fewer total invertebrates than those with either treatment alone. Copepoda abundances doubled in CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched mesocosms without sediment, whereas no CO<sub>2</sub> effect occurred in mesocosms with sediment. Our findings provide new insights into potential future impacts of climate change and land use in running freshwaters, in particular highlighting the potential for elevated CO<sub>2</sub> to interact with fine sediment deposition in unpredictable ways.</p>","author":"J.
