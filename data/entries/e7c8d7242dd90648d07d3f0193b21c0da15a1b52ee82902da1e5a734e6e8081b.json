{"title":"Development of Chitosan Scaffold Carrier Device for  Absorption and Controlled Release of Iron Chloride Using  In Vitro Methods of Characterization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1297/v1","date":1726566911000,"content":"Abstract: Chitosan spherical scaffolds, derived from the deacetylation of chitin, are natural polymers with significant potential, though challenges remain in optimizing their properties. The use of chitosan as a carrier for the controlled release of iron chloride is not yet fully established, despite ironâ€™s critical role in various essential biological processes, including as a component of metalloenzymes and in the maintenance of life. Methods: This study aimed to develop a novel protocol for synthesing chitosan scaffolds and to characterize their properties using analytical techniques. Additionally, the release profile of iron was modeled using two primary controlled-release mathematical models. Results: The results demonstrated successful synthesis and physicochemical characterization of the chitosan sphere scaffolds. These scaffolds exhibited appropriate topography for iron loading and cellular interaction, as confirmed by SEM analysis, and contained functional groups as identified by FTIR. The scaffolds were also semi-crystalline (XRD), showed controlled degradation, and were confirmed to be non-toxic biomaterials. Furthermore, the modeling of the controlled release of iron chloride adsorbed on the scaffold surface, as well as the modeling of iron chloride specimens using the MEDUZA software, was successfully conducted. A theoretical curve was generated from the experimental dose-response data collected over time, considering variations in pH and medium concentration. Conclusions: In conclusion, a novel protocol for chitosan-based carriers was successfully developed, enabling thorough physicochemical characterization and modeling of both absorption and controlled release.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7c8d7242dd90648d07d3f0193b21c0da15a1b52ee82902da1e5a734e6e8081b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
