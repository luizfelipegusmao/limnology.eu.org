{"title":"Development of pollinated and unpollinated ovules in Ginkgo biloba: unravelling the role of pollen in ovule tissue maturation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/11/3351/7624718?rss=1","date":1709942400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In gymnosperms such as <span>Ginkgo biloba</span>, the arrival of pollen plays a key role in ovule development, before fertilization occurs. Accordingly, <span>G. biloba</span> female plants geographically isolated from male plants abort all their ovules after the pollination drop emission, which is the event that allows the ovule to capture pollen grains. To decipher the mechanism induced by pollination required to avoid ovule senescence and then abortion, we compared the transcriptomes of pollinated and unpollinated ovules at three time points after the end of the emission of pollination drop. Transcriptomic and <span>in situ</span> expression analyses revealed that several key genes involved in programmed cell death such as senescence and apoptosis, DNA replication, and cell cycle regulation were differentially expressed in unpollinated ovules compared to pollinated ovules. We provide evidence that the pollen captured by the pollination drop affects auxin local accumulation and might cause deregulation of key genes required for the ovuleâ€™s programmed cell death, activating both the cell cycle regulation and DNA replication genes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"6293ee709345155579dc6f01d60fb34e527195ebdc25d3e072fb2a6bffc9764b","category":"Environment"}
