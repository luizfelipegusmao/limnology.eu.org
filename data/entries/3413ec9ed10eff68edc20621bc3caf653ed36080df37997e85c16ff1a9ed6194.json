{"title":"Waste Management and Environmental Health Impact &ndash; Sustainable Laboratory Medicine as Mitigating Response","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0273/v1","date":1725386675000,"content":"Laboratories generate various forms of wastes which contribute to a complex network of profound and multifaceted environmental challenges and associated public health issues if not properly managed.Traditional laboratory practices particularly in developing countries, often lead to excessive waste generation, chemical contamination and resource depletion, coupled with inefficient waste management which poses risks to both ecosystem and public health. As the environmental impact of laboratory waste escalates, the need for effective waste management becomes increasingly important and urgent for safeguarding environmental health. This review examines the impact of laboratory waste management practices on environmental health and explores sustainable laboratory medicine as a mitigating response. Sustainable laboratory medicine adopts practices such as green laboratory principles involving waste minimization, resource conservation, the use of eco-friendly materials as well as energy-efficient protocols and innovative waste segregation and treatment technologies. This approach complies with regulatory standards as well as emphasizes proactive orientation towards environmental stewardship, operational efficiency and innovation while maintaining scientific integrity. Sustainable laboratory medicine appears to be a crucial framework that mitigates the environmental health impacts associated with laboratory-derived waste. This review advocates for a paradigm shift towards sustainable laboratory operations and emphasizes the need for comprehensive training, institutional commitment, and regulatory support.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3413ec9ed10eff68edc20621bc3caf653ed36080df37997e85c16ff1a9ed6194","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
