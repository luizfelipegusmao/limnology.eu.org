Mobile technologies have revolutionized the retail experience by providing unprecedented convenience, allowing consumers to shop at any time and from any location. This shift has led to a marked preference for mobile shopping over traditional methods, fundamentally altering consumer behavior. Key findings reveal that personalization plays a crucial role in enhancing consumer engagement and satisfaction, with mobile technologies enabling tailored recommendations and offers based on individual preferences. Access to real-time information, such as product details and price comparisons, empowers consumers to make more informed purchasing decisions, reflecting a shift towards deliberate and confident buying choices. Social media and social commerce have also become significant factors, with consumers discovering new products and brands through these platforms and benefiting from integrated shopping features. Impulse buying behavior has increased due to the convenience of mobile shopping, with promotional alerts and simplified payment processes contributing to spontaneous purchases. The integration of mobile technologies with physical store experiences has created a more seamless shopping journey, bridging the gap between online and offline interactions. However, challenges such as privacy concerns, data security, and information overload remain significant. Consumers are increasingly aware of data collection risks and may experience fatigue from excessive marketing messages. To navigate this evolving landscape, retailers must balance the advantages of mobile technologies with addressing these challenges to effectively meet consumer needs and expectations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dcad827f0716acd5bfb5398bc9d60ed1e900a421fde986c6b3db8cc1f3660fbf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
