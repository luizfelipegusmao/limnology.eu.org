{"title":"Effect of Plant Extracts on Characteristics of Growth Promotion in Rice (Oryza sativa)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0033/v1","date":1725259876000,"content":"Plant extracts are widely used in sustainable agriculture practices to enhance crop production and reduce chemical usage in agriculture. Using various extraction solutions of different plant extracts, this study synthesized planting and spraying techniques and extracted the persistence efficacy of rice. The influence of four water extracts on rice plant secondary compounds applied at various planting times. Psidium guajava, Aloe vera, Allium sativum, and Medicago sativa extracts with concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5% produced better growth promotion rates than urea 0.6%. Water extracts were more effective than foliar extracts in promoting rice growth when applied as soil. When direct seeding and transplanting methods were used, plants treated with these four selected extracts showed increases in shoot fresh weight of 48 and 68%, respectively. Thus, transplanted plants were more suitable for determining the influence of plant extracts on rice growth. The highest shoot fresh weight of two rice varieties was obtained seven days after treatment (DAT), followed by 14, 21, and 28 DAT. This study suggests that photosynthesis and antioxidant activities may play crucial roles in plant growth. These extracts can be used to promote plant growth in organic farming.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"174886b45def42ddf8bd10ca6937dd3e9e31a53a0e87599fc61583eb75f690c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
