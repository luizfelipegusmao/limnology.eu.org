{"title":"Spectral-Kinetic Characterization of YF3: Eu3+ and YF3: (Eu3+, Nd3+) Nanoparticles for Optical Temperature Sensing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0863/v1","date":1710687845000,"content":"Abstract: The YF3: (Eu3+, Nd3+) nanoparticles (orthorhombic phase, D ~ 130 nm)) were synthesized via the co-precipitation method with subsequent hydrothermal treatment and annealing. The Eu3+ τdecay linearly descends with the increase of temperature in the 80 - 320 K range. The τdecay (T) slope values of the annealed YF3: Eu3+ (2.5 and 5.0 mol. %) nanoparticles were the highest (110·10-4 and 67·10-4, μs/K in the whole 80 – 320 K range, respectively. Thus, these samples were chosen for further doping with Nd3+. The maximum Sa and Sr values based on the LIR (IEu/INd) function were 0.67 K-1 (at 80 K) and 0.86 %·K-1 (at 154 K), respectively. As it was mentioned above, the sin-gle-doped YF3: Eu3+ (2.5. %) nanoparticles showed the linearly decreasing τdecay (T) function (5D0 – 7F1 emission). The main idea of Nd3+ co-doping was to increase this slope value (as well as the sensitivity) by increasing the rate of τdecay (T) descent via the addition of one more tempera-ture-dependent channel of 5D0 excited state depopulation. Indeed, we managed to increase the slope (Sa) up to 180·10-4 K-1 at 80 K. This result is one of the highest compared to the world analogs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"000b9e8b29bf9bf3cbb5b35c5b3a37ae85093911094891f41718fd49c02f2ce1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
