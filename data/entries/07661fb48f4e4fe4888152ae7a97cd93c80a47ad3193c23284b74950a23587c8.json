{"title":"VaIN after Hysterectomy is Strongly Associated with Persistent HR-HPV Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2079/v1","date":1717080736000,"content":"Previous studies show that women with a history of high-grade CIN have a greater risk of subsequent high-grade anogenital intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer, and the risk is greater for vaginal cancer than for anal and vulvar cancers. It is hypothesized that the laparoscopic hysterectomy procedure may cause a higher incidence of VaIN in hysterectomized women. There are few studies addressing this issue and they show mixed results. This study aimed to investigate the incidence of high-grade or worse VaIN in the population of women undergoing hysterectomy for CIN3 or benign uterine disease, illustrate treatment options and follow-up. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on 170 women who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) or benign gynecological disease. The follow-up strategy included performing a cotest and colposcopy with biopsy if necessary. The median time between primary treatment and diagnosis of high-grade VaIN was 18 months. Results: High grade or worse VaIN was found in 8 patients after hysterectomy (4.7%). All cases of high-grade VaIN occurred in women with persistent HPV infection. The most frequent genotype was 16. Women hysterectomized for CIN3 showed an 8-fold greater risk than women hysterectomized for benign disease of developing high-grade VaIN. The risk of VaIN is low in women hysterectomized for benign disease. The risk of developing VaIN is greater in women with viral persistence Conclusion. All these elements suggest that it is the history of HPV-related disease of the lower genital tract and viral persistence, rather than hysterectomy itself, that should be considered a risk factor for the development of high-grade VaIN. After hysterectomy, patients with a history of CIN should undergo annual screening with vaginal dome cytology and HPV testing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07661fb48f4e4fe4888152ae7a97cd93c80a47ad3193c23284b74950a23587c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
