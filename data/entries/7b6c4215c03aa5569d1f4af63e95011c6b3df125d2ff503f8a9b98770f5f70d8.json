{"title":"X-ray Microscopy of Magnetic Topological Spin Textures – From van der Waals Magnets to Bulk Chiral Systems","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.499/7720101?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM) exploits the effects of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism to achieve magnetic contrast (Fig. 1). In this talk, I will highlight the capabilities of STXM – in particular the MAXYMUS microscope at the synchrotron BESSY II in Berlin – for the investigation of magnetic spin textures. I will draw comparisons to typical electron-based magnetic imaging techniques, demonstrating that STXM can provide complementary information, while offering advantages such as the ease of applying arbitrary external magnetic fields to the sample, the possibility for cryogenic cooling, and the opportunity for stroboscopic time-resolved imaging of dynamics.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7b6c4215c03aa5569d1f4af63e95011c6b3df125d2ff503f8a9b98770f5f70d8","category":"Environment"}
