{"title":"General Dynamics and Generation Mapping for Collatz-type Sequences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2050/v4","date":1725454750000,"content":"Let an odd integer \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) be expressed as $\\mathcal{X} = \\left\\{\\sum\\limits_{M &gt; m} 2^M\\right\\} + 2^m - 1,$ where $2^m - 1$ is referred to as the Governor. In Collatz-type functions, a high index Governor is eventually reduced to $2^1 - 1$. For the $3\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence, the Governor occurring in the trivial cycle is $2^1 - 1$, while for the $5\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence, the Trivial Governors are $2^2 - 1$ and $2^1 - 1$. Therefore, in these specific sequences, the Collatz function reduces $\\mathcal{X}$ to $\\mathcal{X} = \\left\\{\\sum\\limits_{N &gt; \\mathcal{T}} 2^N\\right\\} + 2^{\\mathcal{T}} - 1,$ where $2^{\\mathcal{T}} - 1$ is the Trivial Governor. Once this Trivial Governor is reached, it can evolve to a higher index Governor through interactions with other terms. This feature allows $\\mathcal{X}$ to reappear in a Collatz-type sequence, since $2^m - 1 = 2^{m - 1} + \\cdots + 2^{\\mathcal{T} + 1} + 2^{\\mathcal{T}} + (2^{\\mathcal{T}} - 1).$ Thus, if $\\mathcal{X}$ reappears, at least one odd ancestor of $2^{m - 1} + \\cdots + 2^{\\mathcal{T} + 1} + 2^{\\mathcal{T}} + (2^{\\mathcal{T}} - 1)$ must have a Governor $2^m - 1$. Ancestor mapping shows that all odd ancestors of $\\mathcal{X}$ have the Trivial Governor for the respective Collatz sequence. This implies that odd integers that repeat in the $3\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence have the Governor $2^1 - 1$, while those forming a repeating cycle in the $5\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence have either $2^2 - 1$ or $2^1 - 1$ as the Governor. Successor mapping for the $3\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence further indicates that there are no auxiliary cycles, as the Trivial Governor is always transformed into a different index Governor. Similarly, successor mapping for the $5\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence reveals that the smallest odd integers forming an auxiliary cycle are smaller than $2^5$. Finally, attempts to identify integers that diverge for the $3\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence suggest that no such integers exist.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22b991cd2ef7973e7751334d1bbe9802adb4775de9310a428bb4dcdef48c3214","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
