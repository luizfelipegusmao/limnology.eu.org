{"title":"Exploring App-Based Physiotherapy for Somatic Tinnitus: Results from a Pilot Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0007/v1","date":1727776666000,"content":"Background: Somatic tinnitus (ST) is a type of tinnitus that is influenced by changes in somatosensory input from the cervical spine or temporomandibular area. Although traditional physiotherapy has been shown to reduce ST symptoms, in-clinic treatment is not always available, and adherence to home exercise programs is often low. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of an app-based physiotherapy program to enhance compliance and availability of treatment for ST patients. Methods: This pilot randomized controlled trial included 38 adult patients with chronic somatic tinnitus. Participants were randomly assigned to a treatment group receiving a 9-week app-based cervical spine exercise program or a control group. The primary outcome was tinnitus distress measured using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). As a secondary outcome we the Mini-Tinnitus Questionnaire (Mini-TQ). Results: Participants in the treatment group showed significant reductions in tinnitus distress, with a large effect size for both the THI and Mini-TQ (Cohenâ€™s d = 1.71 and 1.02, respectively). The control group showed no significant changes. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that an app-based physiotherapy intervention is a feasible and effective treatment for ST. Further research with larger sample sizes, comparisons to traditional in-clinic treatments is needed to confirm these findings. Additional studies on personalized treatment might further improve the treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78b39b38c71cb7cf4593d51625e75176e818616d74e53b5e41a2d832e63f0a67","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
