{"title":"Horndeski-Like Gravity Perturbation Induced by Large-Magnitude Earthquake","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0914/v1","date":1715662244000,"content":"We hypothesis that large earthquakes generate Horndeski-like Gravitational Wave (GW). We find that such a Horndeski-like GW propagates with the speed of sound. The sound waves generated by an earthquake make a local and temporal change to the Earth’s diagravitational medium; therefore, they modify the GW speed in a standard, Alternative-Theory-of-Gravity (ATG) sense. The quantum of the Horndeski-like GW is a massless scalar quasiparticle and cannot exist outside of the propagation region of the P-field. The Horndeski-like GW may be detectable by future GW detectors with a sensitivity of 10−15 Hz−1/2 in the region of 0.1–1 Hz.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c8cdd73e64186bca4d2eb066fe15d05a38c6aa9ebdf4542f7e230bbe7fbebcca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
