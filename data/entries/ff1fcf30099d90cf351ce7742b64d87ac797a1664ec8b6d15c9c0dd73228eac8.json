{"title":"Improving patient-centred counselling skills among lay healthcare workers in South Africa using the Thusa-Thuso motivational interviewing training and support program","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0002611","date":1713967200000,"content":"<p>by Idah Mokhele, Tembeka Sineke, Marnie Vujovic, Robert A.

We present the results of a pilot study to determine the program’s impact on MI technical skills and qualitatively assess the feasibility of a training-of-trainers (TOT) scale-up strategy among counselling staff of non-governmental (NGO) support partners of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment program in South Africa. We enrolled adult (≥ 18 years) lay counsellors from ten primary healthcare clinics in Johannesburg (South Africa) selected to participate in the Thusa-Thuso training and support program. Counsellors attended the ten-day baseline and quarterly refresher training over 12 months (October 2018-October 2019). Each counsellor submitted two audio recordings of mock counselling sessions held during the ten-day baseline training and two additional recordings of sessions with consenting patients after each quarterly contact session. We reviewed the recordings using the MI treatment integrity (MITI) coding system to determine MI technical (cultivating change talk and softening sustain talk) and relational (empathy and partnership) competency scores before and after training. After 12 months of support with pilot site counsellors, we were asked to scale up the training to NGO partner team trainers in a once-off five-day Training of trainers (TOT) format (n = 127 trainees from November 2020 to January 2021). We report TOT training experiences from focus group discussions (n = 42) conducted six months after the TOT sessions. Of the 25 enrolled lay counsellors from participating facilities, 10 completed the 12-month Thusa-Thuso program. Attrition over the 12 months was caused by death (n = 3), site exclusion/resignations (n = 10), and absence (n = 2). MI competencies improved as follows: the technical skills score increased from a mean of 2.5 (standard deviation (SD): 0.8) to 3.1 (SD: 0.5), with a mean difference of 0.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04, 0.9). The MI relational skills score improved from a mean of 3.20 (SD: 0.7) to 3.5 (SD: 0.6), with a mean difference of 0.3 (95% CI: -0.3, 8.5). End-point qualitative data from the counsellors highlighted the value of identifying and addressing specific skill deficiencies and the importance of counsellors being able to self-monitor skill development using the MITI review process. Participants appreciated the ongoing support to clarify practical MI applications. The TOT program tools were valuable for ongoing on-the-job development and monitoring of quality counselling skills. However, the MITI review process was perceived to be too involved for large-scale application and was adapted into a scoring form to document sit-in mentoring sessions. The Thusa-Thuso MI intervention can improve counsellor motivation and skills over time. In addition, the program can be scaled up using an adapted TOT process supplemented with fidelity assessment tools, which are valuable for skills development and ongoing maintenance. However, further studies are needed to determine the effect of the Thusa-Thuso program on patient ART adherence and retention in care.\r\nTrial registration: Pan African Clinical Trials Registry No: PACTR202212796722256 (12 December 2022).","author":"Idah Mokhele","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"ff1fcf30099d90cf351ce7742b64d87ac797a1664ec8b6d15c9c0dd73228eac8","category":"Environment"}
