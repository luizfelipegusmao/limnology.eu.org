These cells were subjected to <i>TAOK1</i> overexpression or knockdown and treated with BMS-986299 (NLRP3 inflammasome agonist), MCC950 (NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor), or verteporfin (Yes-associated protein [YAP] inhibitor). Thereafter, their pyroptosis, proliferative capacity, and gene and protein expression levels were detected. Doxorubicin-induced HF rats were used as <i>in vivo</i> models and subjected to <i>TAOK1</i> overexpression. Thereafter, their myocardial pathology, NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis, and YAP/TEAD pathway function were evaluated.</p> Results <p>IL-17 treatment increased the pyroptosis and decreased the proliferative capacity of H9C2 cells. Additionally, IL-17 treatment inducedto the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasomes and inhibition of the YAP/TEAD pathway in the H9C2 cells. Moreover, the IL-17-mediated effects on the H9C2 cells were alleviated by <i>TAOK1</i> overexpression and augmented by <i>TAOK1</i> knockdown. Furthermore, treatment with BMS-986299 or verteporfin affected the pyroptosis, proliferative capacity, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation of the H9C2 cells independently of TAOK1 expression. In the doxorubicin-induced HF rat model, <i>TAOK1</i> overexpression mitigated myocardial injury, suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome pathway activation, and restored the YAP/TEAD pathway activity.</p> Conclusion <p>TAOK1 played a crucial role in regulating IL-17-mediated increase in the pyroptosis and decrease in the proliferation of cardiomyocytes by regulating the activities of the NLRP3 inflammasomes and the YAP/TEAD pathway.</p>","author":"Jiani Zhou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"aa80b9e5a155ea5cf8f09f7327b14539655bb5a8c1637af2bee9c5a7b30f7419","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
