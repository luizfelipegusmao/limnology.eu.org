The study explores how organizations, ranging from large multinational corporations to smaller enterprises, navigate sustainability challenges and opportunities within their procurement strategies. Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with procurement professionals and sustainability managers across diverse industries. Themes identified include varying organizational commitments to sustainability, from structured policies and resource allocation in larger firms to reactive approaches constrained by resource limitations in smaller entities. Effective supplier relationship management emerged as crucial, facilitating collaborative partnerships aimed at improving environmental and social performance across supply chains. Motivations for sustainable procurement practices encompass regulatory compliance and responding to consumer demands for eco-friendly products, shaping procurement decisions to enhance market competitiveness and stakeholder satisfaction. Environmental and social criteria integration in supplier evaluations highlighted strategies such as lifecycle assessments and sustainable sourcing practices, aimed at minimizing environmental footprints and promoting ethical labor practices. Benefits included cost savings and enhanced brand reputation, tempered by challenges such as higher procurement costs and supplier resistance. Leadership commitment and organizational culture were identified as critical enablers of sustainable procurement, influencing strategic alignment and fostering a culture of sustainability within organizations. The study underscores the transformative potential of sustainable procurement in achieving organizational resilience and contributing to global sustainability goals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"565c94577a3b7ad56d634a4dc74032806383d5ff2f4cf48c085ae1949e25d287","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
