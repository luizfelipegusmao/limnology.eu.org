{"title":"Cell Wall Profiling of the Resurrection Plants Craterostigma plantagineum and Lindernia brevidens and Their Desiccation Sensitive Relative  Lindernia subracemosa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1917/v1","date":1719478297000,"content":"Vegetative desiccation tolerance has evolved within the genus Craterostigma and Lindernia. A centre of endemism and diversification for these plants appears to occur in ancient tropical montane rainforests of east Africa in Kenya and Tanzania. Lindernia subracemosa, a desiccation-sensitive relative of C. plantagineum, occurs in these rainforests and experiences adequate rainfall and thus does not require desiccation tolerance. However, sharing this inselberg habitat, another species Lindernia brevidens does retain vegetative desiccation tolerance and is also related to the resurrection plant C. plantagineum found in South Africa. Leaf material was collected from all three species at different stages of hydration: fully hydrated, half-dry (ca. 45% relative water content), and fully desiccated. Cell wall monosaccharide datasets were collected from all three species. Comprehensive microarray polymer profiling (CoMPP) was performed using ca. 27 plant cell wall specific antibody and carbohydrate binding module probes. Global datasets do not show significant differences between the selected species suggesting that cell wall modifications in response to vegetative desiccation involve subtle cell wall remodelling not reflected by compositional analysis and that the plants and their walls are constitutively protected against desiccation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"606fb0cf47a35c0108ee2689adcf77ad34a3c462da693beb7034b6d17bfc40e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
