{"title":"Chloroplast Ribosome Biogenesis Factors","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/4/516/7232364?rss=1","date":1690416000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The formation of chloroplasts can be traced back to an ancient event in which a eukaryotic host cell containing mitochondria ingested a cyanobacterium. Since then, chloroplasts have retained many characteristics of their bacterial ancestor, including their transcription and translation machinery. In this review, recent research on the maturation of rRNA and ribosome assembly in chloroplasts is explored, along with their crucial role in plant survival and their implications for plant acclimation to changing environments. A comparison is made between the ribosome composition and auxiliary factors of ancient and modern chloroplasts, providing insights into the evolution of ribosome assembly factors. Although the chloroplast contains ancient proteins with conserved functions in ribosome assembly, newly evolved factors have also emerged to help plants acclimate to changes in their environment and internal signals. Overall, this review offers a comprehensive analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying chloroplast ribosome assembly and highlights the importance of this process in plant survival, acclimation and adaptation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"4e3ea4a3ca96fa856a16125bc64bfa4f297b58f7b62285bbce218d11bd7788d4","category":"Environment"}
