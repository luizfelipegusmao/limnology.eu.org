We will also study metal hydrides and clusters, totally composed of metals, which adopt forms analogous to molecular organic picene and anthracene; also calculating its TC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"142143611b18b5acdc71a6080f87507854d2f7a4f135a52070e963ca0185cd23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
