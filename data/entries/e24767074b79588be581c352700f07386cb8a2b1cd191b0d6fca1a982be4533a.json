{"title":"Markers of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Mucinous Histology in Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1461/v1","date":1718890199000,"content":"Approximately 20% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) are diagnosed with a mucinous subtype of this tumor, have a worse prognosis, and often show resistance to available therapies. Molecules from the mucin family are involved in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which significantly determines the cancer aggressiveness. This study aimed to examine the diagnostic and prognostic significance of mucinous histology and EMT markers in patients with early-onset CRC and their association with disease severity and tumor characteristics. The study included tumor tissue samples from 106 patients diagnosed with CRC before the age of 45, 53 with mucinous and 53 with non-mucinous tumors. The EMT status was determined by immunohistochemical analysis of E-cadherin and Vimentin in tissue sections. Mucinous tumors had a significantly higher cytoplasmic E-cadherin score (P=0.043), they were significantly less differentiated (P=0.007), more advanced (P=0.005), and predominately affected right colon (P=0.030) in comparison to non-mucinous tumors. Epithelial tumors were significantly better differentiated (P=0.034) and with less prominent tumor budding (P &lt; 0.001) than mesenchymal tumors. The process of EMT appears to be more prominent in tumors of younger patients regardless of mucinous histology. EMT status may represent a useful prognostic tool in early-onset CRC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e24767074b79588be581c352700f07386cb8a2b1cd191b0d6fca1a982be4533a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
