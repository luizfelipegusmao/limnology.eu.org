{"title":"Gross primary production of Mediterranean watersheds: Using isotope mass balance approach to improve estimations","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2619?af=R","date":1706081380000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Global-scale estimates of carbon fluxes from satellite data-driven models are constrained by considerable uncertainties regarding Gross Primary Production (GPP) and the lack of the watershed-scale measurements required for model calibration. Recently conducted global modelling efforts indicate that semiarid ecosystems dominate the increasing trends and inter-annual variation of net CO<sub>2</sub> exchange with the atmosphere, but semi-arid regions have received little attention with regard to GPP estimation. In this study, we used the distinct isotope effect of transpiration and evaporation to calculate transpiration losses and subsequently CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by terrestrial vegetation through the water and carbon cycle using the water use efficiency of plants. By studying two Mediterranean watersheds with contrasted environmental conditions over several hydrological years, we found a strong dependence of GPP on annual and seasonal water availability. The results demonstrated that when compared to GPP values obtained in worldwide biomes using biological methods, our isotope approach was validated, highlighting the limitations of satellite-data-driven models like MODIS in capturing the impact of water stress on photosynthesis and GPP estimates. These results encourage investigation of GPP by the isotope mass balance approach where direct carbon flux measurements are rare or absent in order to help to substantiate, modify or shed doubt on interpolated GPP for those regions and achieve consensus on global GPP estimates. Given the relevant role of semi-arid ecosystems in the global carbon balance as well as the limitation of existing data sets, our improved method based on the isotope mass balance approach helps to obtain rapid and affordable estimates of GPP for semi-arid ecosystems.</p>","author":"Alexandra Mattei, \nFrédéric Huneau, \nEmilie Garel, \nSébastien Santoni, \nThomas Leydier, \nYuliya Vystavna","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"718629f20478e94b64fb788dd435e3c236e5ed9b8af0afd7b49fade2b8b14924","category":"Environment"}
