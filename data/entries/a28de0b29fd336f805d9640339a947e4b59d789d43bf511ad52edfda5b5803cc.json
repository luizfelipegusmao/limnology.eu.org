{"title":"Advancing Sustainable Healthcare Technology Management: Developing a Comprehensive Risk Assessment Framework with Fuzzy AHP, Integrating External and Internal Factors in the Gulf Region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1711/v1","date":1719325970000,"content":"In the context of healthcare technology management (HTM) in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region, this study addresses a significant gap by exploring both external and internal risk factors affecting HTM performance. Previous research has primarily focused on modeling or predicting failures in medical devices, mostly examining internal (endogenous) factors that impact device performance and the development of optimal service strategies. However, a comprehensive investigation of external (exogenous) factors has been notably absent. This research introduces a novel hierarchical risk management framework, designed to accommodate the broad array of healthcare technologies, not limited to medical devices. It significantly advances the field by thoroughly investigating and validating a comprehensive set of 53 risk factors and assessing their influence on HTM. Additionally, this study embraces the perspective of enterprise risk management (ERM) and expands it to identify and incorporate a wider range of risk factors, offering a more holistic and strategic approach to risk assessment in healthcare technology management. The findings reveal that several external and internal factors previously underexplored significantly impact HTM performance. Notably, the Fuzzy AHP survey identified “design risk” under facility and environmental risks as the highest risk for HTM in the region. Furthermore, the study reveals that three out of the top ten risks are related to “facility and internal environmental” factors, six are related to technological endogenous factors, and only one is related to managerial factors. This distribution underscores the critical areas for intervention and the need for robust facility and technology management strategies. \nIn conclusion, this research not only fills a critical void by providing a robust framework for healthcare technology risk assessment but also broadens the scope of risk analysis to include a wider array of technologies, thereby enhancing the efficacy and safety of healthcare interventions in the region. Additionally, the proposed hierarchy provides insights into the underlying risk factors for healthcare technology management, with potential applications extending beyond the regional context to a global scale. Moreover, the equation we propose offers a novel perspective on the key risk factors involved in healthcare technology management, presenting insights with far-reaching implications applicable not only regionally but also on a global level. This framework also supports sustainability goals by encouraging the efficient and responsible utilization and management of healthcare technologies, essential for ensuring the long-term economic and environmental sustainability of medical technology use.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a28de0b29fd336f805d9640339a947e4b59d789d43bf511ad52edfda5b5803cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
