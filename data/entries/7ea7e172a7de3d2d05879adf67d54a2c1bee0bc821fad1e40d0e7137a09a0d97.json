{"title":"Optimizing machine learning for water safety: A comparative analysis with dimensionality reduction and classifier performance in potability prediction","link":"https://journals.plos.org/water/article?id=10.1371/journal.pwat.0000259","date":1723125600000,"content":"<p>by Debashis Chatterjee, Prithwish Ghosh, Amlan Banerjee, Shiladri Shekhar Das</p>\r\n\r\nIn this study, we investigated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting water potability based on water quality attributes. Initially, we applied seven classification-based methods directly to the original dataset, yielding varying accuracy scores. Notably, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the highest accuracy of 69%, while other methods such as XGBoost, k-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest demonstrated competitive performance with scores ranging from 62% to 68%. Subsequently, we employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the datasetâ€™s dimensionality to six principal components, followed by reapplication of the machine learning techniques. The results showed an increase in accuracy across all classifiers, increasing to nearly 100%. This study provides insights into the impact of dimensionality reduction on predictive accuracy and underscores the importance of selecting appropriate techniques for water potability prediction.","author":"Debashis Chatterjee","siteTitle":"PLOS Water","siteHash":"76ba47a8597c89f4cf217272433133ba8aa6d0dba9c907d21e63f90c34e21e00","entryHash":"7ea7e172a7de3d2d05879adf67d54a2c1bee0bc821fad1e40d0e7137a09a0d97","category":"Environment"}
