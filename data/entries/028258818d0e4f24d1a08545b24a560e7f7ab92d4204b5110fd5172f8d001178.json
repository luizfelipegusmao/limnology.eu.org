{"title":"Marine Peloids for Skin Care and Thalasso-Wellness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0709/v1","date":1720506919000,"content":"Background: Peloids are therapeutic agents used in thermal and thalasso centers for curative, preventive, and skin care purposes. Marine peloids are those that include seawater and algae, both macro and/or microalgae. The aim of this study is to investigate the suitability of a marine peloid composed by seawater, clay and microalgae for thalasso-wellness and dermocosmetic uses; Methods: the thermophysical properties of the marine peloid were determined and compared with a non-marine peloid using different techniques as densimetry, conductimetry, calorimetry, and viscometry; skin hydration was also measured by means of Corneometry; Results: marine peloid has been shown to be suitable for thermotherapy and thalaso-wellness treatments as its thermophysical properties were similar to other peloids used for this purpose; marine peloids also showed to improve skin hydration after seven days of treatment; Conclusions: this research provides a comprehensive study of the thermophysical properties of a marine peloid composed by clay, seawater and microalgae for thalasso-wellness and cosmetic uses, as well as its moisturizing properties, highlighting its potential as a valuable natural product for skin care applications as well as for wellness treatments in form of cataplasm, poultices and/or wraps.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"028258818d0e4f24d1a08545b24a560e7f7ab92d4204b5110fd5172f8d001178","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
