{"title":"Assessing Parental Intention for Child COVID-19 Vaccination: Validation of the Modified Japanese 7C Readiness Scale","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0508/v1","date":1728307995000,"content":"Parental willingness is a prerequisite for childhood immunization. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether parental vaccine readiness and willingness using the modified Japanese 7C Readiness Scale can predict vaccination behavior. In December 2021, 2 months before the approval of COVID-19 vaccination for children aged 5â€“11 years in Japan, we asked 1,190 parents of such children about their children's vaccination against COVID-19 using the modified 7C scales in online. The modified 7C scales consist of 7 components, namely, confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, collective responsibility, compliance, and conspiracy. The modified 7C scales were analyzed for model fit and association with parental intention using structural equation modeling. The model fit of the modified 7C scale was good (goodness-of-fit index: 0.98), and the factor loadings and model fit for parental readiness were high (standardized factor loadings: 0.84). In January 2024, we asked the same parents about their children's COVID-19 vaccination (valid responses: 536). The components of the modified 7C scale were compared with actual vaccination behavior. Parents with a low readiness to vaccinate their children had a high non-vaccination rate with the actual COVID-19 vaccine. The use of the modified 7C scale may assist in the development of childhood vaccine policy interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0177a9dac6d7abd2102c104743ce05e6744e878615c8d4c3ac07544da7e8eb09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
