Existing methods for continuous, noninvasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring suffer from poor accuracy, uncomfortable form factors, or a need for frequent calibration, limiting their adoption. We introduce a new framework for continuous BP measurement that is noninvasive and calibration-free called resonance sonomanometry. The method uses ultrasound imaging to measure both the arterial dimensions and artery wall resonances that are induced by acoustic stimulation, which offers a direct measure of BP by a fully determined physical model. The approach and model are validated in vitro using arterial mock-ups and then in multiple arteries in human subjects. This approach offers the promise of robust continuous BP measurements, providing significant benefits for early diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"bfa76beb892660e0bcf3176f8c5fa83d538af43ded7324d04184c726bdaa197f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
