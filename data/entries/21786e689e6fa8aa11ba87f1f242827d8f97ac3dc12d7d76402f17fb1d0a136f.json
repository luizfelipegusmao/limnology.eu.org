Spider subjects underwent 24-h dehydration prior to ingestion of treatment droplet—sterile water (uninfected/control) versus inoculated water (infected). All combinations of infected and control males and females were paired, and behavior was recorded; revealing that among spider pairs that did not mate, females were significantly more resistant and aggressive toward infected males than control males.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Resistance to mating by females has been hypothesized as a tactic to assess potential mates and avoid undesirable ones. Previous studies show infection with the pathogenic bacteria, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, triggers a costly immune response and negatively impacts fitness in the wolf spider <i>Schizocosa ocreata</i> (Hentz 1844). Studies also show that infection can be transmitted during copulation, suggesting that there are potential fitness costs associated with mating with an infected individual. We examined impacts of infection on mating interactions of male and female <i>S. ocreata</i>. As studies show infection can be detected through chemical cues, we tested whether males or females avoid mating with infected individuals when given the opportunity. We paired infected and uninfected (control) males and females and recorded their behavior. We found that mating outcome was independent of infection for males and females. While higher male courtship rates and more frequent female receptivity displays were associated with successful mating, we saw no direct effect of infection status on mating outcome. However, among spider pairs that did not mate, females were found to be significantly more resistant and aggressive toward infected males than control males. Male aggression, on the other hand, was greater in pairs that did result in mating. These results suggest that sexual conflict in mating can be related to infection status, and that females can recognize infected males and alter their behavior in response.</p>","author":"Olivia Bauer‐Nilsen, \nMegan McConnell, \nGeorge Uetz","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ethology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7a94182f50d5fe321f60efa1a57eebe5c3e6a74d1fa25ba04a906a999025c0b6","entryHash":"21786e689e6fa8aa11ba87f1f242827d8f97ac3dc12d7d76402f17fb1d0a136f","category":"Environment"}
