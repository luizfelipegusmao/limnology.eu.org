{"title":"PSV-30 Effects of divergent residual feed intake on performance, feed efficiency, feeding behavior and gaseous exchange in replacement beef heifers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/739/7757851?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to examine the differences in performance, feed efficiency, feeding behavior and gaseous exchange (methane, carbon dioxide and oxygen) in replacement beef heifers with divergent phenotypes for residual feed intake (RFI). Crossbred beef replacement heifers [n = 63; initial body weight (BW) = 277 ± 21 kg] were blocked by BW and assigned to 1 of 2 pens each equipped with electronic feed bunks (GrowSafe Systems) and GreenFeed gaseous-exchange measurement systems (GEM; C-Lock). Heifers were fed a corn-silage based ration twice daily. Individual dry matter intake (DMI), feeding behavior, and gas flux data were collected for 70 d and BW measured weekly. Carcass ultrasound data were collected at the beginning and end of the study. Residual feed intake was calculated as the residual from the regression of DMI on ADG and mid-test BW<sup>0.75</sup> and heifers assigned to low-, medium-, and high-RFI classes (± 0.5 SD from the mean RFI). A mixed model with RFI class as fixed effect and pen as a random effect was used for data analysis. There were no differences due to RFI class in BW and ADG. However, low-RFI heifers consumed 16% less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) DMI and had more favorable gain to feed (G:F) then high-RFI heifers. High-RFI heifers had a greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) backfat gain during the 70-d study, with backfat gain accounting for an additional 4.2% of the variation in DMI. Low-RFI heifers exhibited more favorable feeding behavior, with 10.4% fewer (<span>P</span> = 0.057) bunk visit events and spent numerically less time at the feed bunk (103 vs 122 min/d) compared with high-RFI heifers. Methane emissions (g/d) did not differ between heifers with divergent RFI (<span>P</span> = 0.138; 129 vs 140 g/d in low- and high RFI heifers respectively), however, methane yield (g/kg DMI) was 9% greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) in low- compared with high-RFI heifers. Additionally, low-RFI heifers produced 7.9% less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) carbon dioxide (g/d) and consumed 6.9% less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) oxygen than high RFI heifers. Further research is warranted to investigate the biological mechanisms influencing RFI and the effects of selection for RFI as a strategy to mitigate reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cattle production systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"cf0d90d0928973d3ea95f4b930a073246e0f496b46eb8d68c82143db6fc563a4","category":"Environment"}
