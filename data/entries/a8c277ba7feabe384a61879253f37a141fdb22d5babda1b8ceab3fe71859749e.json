{"title":"Performance of High Entropy Alloys Under Severe Environments via In-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy-Irradiation Experiments","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.662/7719757?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Beyond the current coarse-grain W approach [<a href=\"#ozae044.662-B1\">1</a>], multiple strategies are being pursued in the quest for new materials that can withstand severe irradiation, thermal, and mechanical extremes for advanced fusion applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.662-B2\">2</a>]. In the last two decades, a novel set of alloys known as high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with nearly equi-atomic compositions of principal constituent elements have been developed [<a href=\"#ozae044.662-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.662-B4\">4</a>]. HEAs represent a radical departure from traditional alloy design, which involves a single principal alloying element with small additions (&lt;20 at%) of alloying elements chosen to achieve specific properties. Refractory HEAs ( have been recently developed for high-temperature applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.662-B5\">5</a>] and possess high melting temperatures (above 2873 K) and superior high-temperature mechanical properties as compared to Ni-based superalloys or pure tungsten [<a href=\"#ozae044.662-B6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.662-B7\">7</a>]. For fusion applications, where W is the main choice as a plasma facing component, HEAs can offer some advantages. However, high throughput characterization of the performance of these materials is critical to down-select elements and compositions relevant to the application.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a8c277ba7feabe384a61879253f37a141fdb22d5babda1b8ceab3fe71859749e","category":"Environment"}
