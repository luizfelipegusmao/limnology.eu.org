The current treatment options for LC have not been particularly successful in improving patient outcomes. Yifei Sanjie (YFSJ), a well-applicated traditional Chinese medicine formula, is widely used to treat pulmonary diseases, especially LC, yet little is known about its molecular mechanisms. This study was conducted to explore the molecular mechanism by which YFSJ ameliorated LC progression. The A549, NCI-H1975, and Calu-3 cells were treated with the YFSJ formula and observed for colony number, apoptosis, migration, and invasion properties recorded via corresponding assays. The PRMT6-YBX1-CDC25A axis was tested and verified through luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and rescue experiments. Our results demonstrated that YFSJ ameliorated LC cell malignant behaviors by increasing apoptosis and suppressing proliferation, migration, and invasion processes. We also noticed that the xenograft mouse model treated with YFSJ significantly reduced tumor growth compared with the control untreated group in vivo. Mechanistically, it was found that YFSJ suppressed the expression of PRMT6, YBX1, and CDC25A, while the knockdown of these proteins significantly inhibited colony growth, migration, and invasion, and boosted apoptosis in LC cells. In summary, our results suggest that YFSJ alleviates LC progression via the PRMT6-YBX1-CDC25A axis, confirming its efficacy in clinical use. The findings of our study provide a new regulatory network for LC growth and metastasis, which could shed new insights into pulmonary medical research.</p>","author":"Jie Tang, \nChenyan Yin, \nMeiyun Chen, \nMengjia Dong, \nYouqi Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"dc65b346221e9b121886abd12608fb1c138db0ed67611ec506795732adc1ff15","category":"Environment"}
