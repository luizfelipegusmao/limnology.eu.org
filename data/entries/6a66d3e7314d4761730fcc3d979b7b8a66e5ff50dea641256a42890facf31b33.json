{"title":"Distribution of MRI-derived T2 values as a biomarker for in vivo rapid screening of phenotype severity in <i>mdx</i> mice","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310551","date":1726754400000,"content":"<p>by Emily A.

Demonbreun</p>\r\nBackground <p>The pathology in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by degenerating muscle fibers, inflammation, fibro-fatty infiltrate, and edema, and these pathological processes replace normal healthy muscle tissue. The <i>mdx</i> mouse model is one of the most commonly used preclinical models to study DMD. Mounting evidence has emerged illustrating that muscle disease progression varies considerably in <i>mdx</i> mice, with inter-animal differences as well as intra-muscular differences in pathology in individual <i>mdx</i> mice. This variation is important to consider when conducting assessments of drug efficacy and in longitudinal studies. We developed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation and analysis pipeline to rapidly and non-invasively measure the severity of muscle disease in <i>mdx</i> mice.</p> Methods <p>Wildtype and <i>mdx</i> mice were imaged with MRI and T2 maps were obtained axially across the hindlimbs. A neural network was trained to rapidly and semi-automatically segment the muscle tissue, and the distribution of resulting T2 values was analyzed. Interdecile range and Pearson Skew were identified as biomarkers to quickly and accurately estimate muscle disease severity in mice.</p> Results <p>The semiautomated segmentation tool reduced image processing time approximately tenfold. Measures of Pearson skew and interdecile range based on that segmentation were repeatable and reflected muscle disease severity in healthy wildtype and diseased <i>mdx</i> mice based on both qualitative observation of images and correlation with Evans blue dye uptake.</p> Conclusion <p>Use of this rapid, non-invasive, semi-automated MR image segmentation and analysis pipeline has the potential to transform preclinical studies, allowing for pre-screening of dystrophic mice prior to study enrollment to ensure more uniform muscle disease pathology across treatment groups, improving study outcomes.</p>","author":"Emily A.
