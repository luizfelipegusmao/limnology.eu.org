{"title":"Obesity in Bangladesh: Study food near schools | Science","link":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp6537","date":1721307660000,"content":"Childhood malnutrition is a well-known problem in low- and middle-income countries, but children in countries such as Bangladesh also face increasing rates of obesity (1). Obesity in both public and private schools in Bangladesh ranges from 14 to 38% (2), and about 23.6% of adolescents are overweight (3). Because the food environment— i.e., the type and amount of food that is available and accessible—affects children’s dietary preferences and health outcomes, it is considered a primary cause of obesity (4, 5). Bangladesh must collect data about the food environment in and near schools and then use that information to address childhood obesity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"2c190e8e534fe520ce6cad5523076b269998639879a4e0d194c301dfd1aabae8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
