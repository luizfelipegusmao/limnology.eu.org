{"title":"An Application of the UTAUT2 Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0210/v2","date":1715673222000,"content":"This study explored factors influencing the adoption of blockchain technology in US educational settings using the UTAUT2 model. Results from 160 IT officers via an online survey and PLS-SEM analysis showed that performance expectancy and social influence significantly predict behavioral intentions towards blockchain adoption, impacting actual utilization. While some factors like effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value, and habit did not show significant relationships, this research underscores UTAUT2's relevance in blockchain acceptance in education. Future studies should address limitations and explore diverse stakeholder perspectives for strategic implementation approaches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a94e00c58a54141255f78d96994541f436ef0c0e726a889c07c949341cf4428","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
