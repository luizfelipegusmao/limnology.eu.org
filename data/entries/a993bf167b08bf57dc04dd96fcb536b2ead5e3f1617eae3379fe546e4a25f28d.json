{"title":"DIAMOnD Genes Expression in Human Macrophages Infected with Leishmania major","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1761/v1","date":1724421390000,"content":"Leishmania spp. commonly infects phagocytic cells of the immune system, particularly macrophages, employing various immune evasion strategies that enable their survival by altering the  intracellular environment. In mammals, these parasites establish persistent infections by modulating gene expression in macrophages thus interfering with immune signaling and response pathways  ultimately creating a favorable environment for the parasite survival and reproduction. In this study,  our objective was to use data mining and subsequent filtering techniques to identify the genes that  play a crucial role in the infection process of Leishmania spp. We aimed to pinpoint genes that have  the potential to influence the progression of Leishmania infection. To achieve this, we exploited   prior, curated knowledge from major databases and constructed 16 datasets of human molecular information consisting of coding genes and corresponding proteins. We obtained over 400 proteins, identifying approximately 200 genes. The proteins coded by these genes were subsequently used  to build a network of protein-protein interactions, which enabled the identification of key players. Approximately 10% of these genes were then selected for biological validation. THP-1 cells, a line of   human macrophages, were infected with L. major in vitro for the validation process. We observed   that L. major has the capacity to impact crucial genes involved in the immune response, resulting  in macrophage inactivation and creating a conducive environment for the survival of Leishmania  parasites","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a993bf167b08bf57dc04dd96fcb536b2ead5e3f1617eae3379fe546e4a25f28d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
