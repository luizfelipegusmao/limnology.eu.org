We show that positioning these bristles on the corrugation ridges of the wing chord cross-section facilitates encoding the local angle of attack. These sensory bristles are accompanied by a cuticular bump structure that confers directional selectivity, filtering out spanwise flow.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>One feature of animal wings is their embedded mechanosensory system that can support flight control. Insect wings are particularly interesting as they are highly deformable yet the actuation is limited to the wing base. It is established that strain sensors on insect wings can directly mediate reflexive control; however, little is known about airflow sensing by insect wings. What information can flow sensors capture and how can flow sensing benefit flight control? Here, we use the dragonfly (<i>Sympetrum striolatum</i>) as a model to explore the function of wing sensory bristles in the context of flight control. Combining our detailed anatomical reconstructions of both the sensor microstructures and wing architecture, we used computational fluid dynamics simulations to ask the following questions. (1) Are there strategic locations on wings that sample flow for estimating aerodynamically relevant parameters such as the local effective angle of attack? (2) Is the sensory bristle distribution on dragonfly wings optimal for flow sensing? (3) What is the aerodynamic effect of microstructures found near the sensory bristles on dragonfly wings? We discuss the benefits of flow sensing for flexible wings and how the evolved sensor placement affects information encoding.</p>","author":"Myriam J. Uhrhan, \nRichard J.
