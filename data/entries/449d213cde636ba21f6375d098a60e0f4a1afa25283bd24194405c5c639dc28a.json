{"title":"Structural equation modeling for the effects of family dysfunctions and communication on perceived mental health status among under/graduate students in the U.S.","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301914","date":1713967200000,"content":"<p>by En-Jung Shon, Lena Lee</p>\r\nBackground <p>Many of the college students expressed experiencing moderate or severe psychological distress. In their emergence as adults, college students encounter significant periods of drastic change. Family functions play a crucial role in determining individuals’ mental health status.</p> Objectives <p>The first objective of this study was to investigate whether family communication mediates the relationships between family dysfunctions and perceived mental health status among under/graduate students. The second objective was to investigate whether the mediation effects of family communication on the relationships between family dysfunctions and perceived mental health status differ by gender.</p> Methods <p>The current study applied Minuchin’s Structural Family Theory with under/graduate students (<i>N</i> = 348) in Ohio. Structural Equation Modeling was conducted to examine the effects of family dysfunctions and communication on perceived mental health status among under/graduate students.</p> Results <p>Disengaged family function significantly influenced family communication, which, in turn, significantly impacted perceived mental health (mediation effect). Enmeshed family function did not show a significant relationship with family communication, whereas family communication had a significant impact on perceived mental health (no mediation effect). The model comparison test indicated that there were differences between males and females: the structural weights of the current path models were consistent with the full models, and there was a significant difference in the effect of parents’ marital status on perceived mental health, with males being significantly impacted in both models.</p> Conclusions <p>Practitioners should recognize that improving positive communication skills within the family unit can be a realistic approach to supporting the perceived mental health of under/graduate students. Colleges/universities should offer regular education programs to promote an understanding of the relationship between family communication strategies and the mental health of under/graduate students.</p>","author":"En-Jung Shon","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"449d213cde636ba21f6375d098a60e0f4a1afa25283bd24194405c5c639dc28a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
