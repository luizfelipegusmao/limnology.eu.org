{"title":"A Reaction-Based Approach to Colorimetric Detection of Organic Analytes in Water Using a Chlorine-Containing Carbocyanine Dye and Hypochlorite","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0312/v1","date":1725431556000,"content":"Water quality control employs techniques mostly targeting individual analytes; group detection is also practiced, but the choice of group methods is limited, which supports interest in developing such methods. We have examined an interaction of hypochlorite with a chlorine-containing heptamethine carbocyanine dye in the presence of 30 organic and inorganic model analytes that were found to induce diverse color changes in the system. The main supposed mechanisms are retardation of the dye oxidation with hypochlorite (presumably by scavenging chlorine radicals) and substitution of chlorine atom in the dye by the most nucleophilic analytes (amines, amino acids, proteins, DNA, phenol). The grass-green substitution product is more contrastingly visible against the dark-purple hypochlorite oxidation product of the dye than against the original emerald-green dye. The indicator reaction is monitored photographically for 10â€“40 min and the images are processed using principal component analysis (PCA) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA), allowing for data convolution for the complex color transitions. Nitrogen compounds are discriminated from the others, and more reactive analytes (tryptophan, cysteine, bovine serum albumin, and DNA) are detected in the presence of less reactive ones in natural water. The system is promising for the development of group assays for dissolved organic matter and discrimination of water samples.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a12a1a799b83c32300f63b2583edfe575682e3ecb6b206e2f704df956b56d19","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
