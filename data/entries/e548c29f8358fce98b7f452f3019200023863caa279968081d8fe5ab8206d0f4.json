{"title":"Impacts of human forest management on seed dispersal patterns by scatter-hoarding rodents","link":"https://academic.oup.com/forestry/article/97/2/234/7223811?rss=1","date":1689206400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Scatter-hoarding rodents play a central role in seed dispersal, predating and dispersing seeds that affect many plant speciesâ€™ population dynamics and influence forest regeneration. Anthropogenic changes in forest structure, such as clear-cutting in dense forests, may alter the ecological interactions between seeds and dispersers. This study compared predation and dispersal patterns of holm oak (<span>Quercus ilex</span> L.) acorns by wood mouse (<span>Apodemus sylvaticus</span> L.) in original dense forest [less managed forest (MF)] vs open MF (more MF) in north-eastern Spain. Results showed variations in the patterns of acorn predation and dispersal by wood mouse between forest types. In the MF, a greater fraction of acorns was harvested, and the acorns were being dispersed further than in the original forest. Despite the greater fraction of acorns dispersed in the MF, the proportion of acorns that survived and had the potential to grow was reduced in the MF because of increased predation. This shows that forest management has a significant influence on seed dispersal by rodents and thereby influences the natural regeneration potential of forests.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Forestry: An International Journal of Forest Research Current Issue","siteHash":"674daa49a10aca976a546578a4b89e6a296c5e7ca75e6f3ff66a7154daf5b0cb","entryHash":"e548c29f8358fce98b7f452f3019200023863caa279968081d8fe5ab8206d0f4","category":"Environment"}
