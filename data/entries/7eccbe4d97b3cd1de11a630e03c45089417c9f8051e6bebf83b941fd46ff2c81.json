{"title":"Congenital Radioulnar Synostosis Review: Recommendations and Treatment Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0933/v1","date":1726132379000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Congenital Radioulnar Synostosis (CRS) is a rare elbow joint disorder resulting from abnormal fusion of the radius and ulna during fetal development. Methods: Although predominantly sporadic, familial cases exist with autosomal dominant inheritance. Diagnosis relies on clinical evaluation and radiological findings, showcasing synostosis. Surgical decisions hinge on factors like age and symptom severity. Results: Multiple surgical treatments have been described but derotation osteotomy offers predictable results. Challenges include potential complications and cultural considerations influencing final forearm positioning. Conclusions: A nuanced approach is crucial for optimal management, highlighting the need for ongoing research to refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for improved outcomes in CRS patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7eccbe4d97b3cd1de11a630e03c45089417c9f8051e6bebf83b941fd46ff2c81","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
