{"title":"104 Effects of providing vitamin and mineral supplementation throughout gestation on subsequent F1 replacement heifer liver and muscle oxygen consumption and mitochondrial function throughout pregnancy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/28/7664967?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The study aimed to assess the impact of maternal vitamin/mineral supplementation during gestation on the energy utilization in liver and muscle tissues of F1 heifer offspring. We hypothesized that VTM supplementation during gestation would mitigate mitochondrial energy loss and uncoupling of liver and muscle tissue in pregnant offspring. At breeding, crossbred Angus heifers [n = 31; initial body weight (BW) = 412.5 ± 53.68 kg] were randomly assigned to either a basal diet targeting BW gains of 0.45 kg•heifer<sup>-1</sup>•d<sup>-1</sup>(CON; n = 14) or the basal diet plus 113 g•heifer<sup>-1</sup>•d<sup>-1</sup>of a vitamin/mineral supplement (VTM; n = 17). Heifers remained on their respective dietary treatments until calving. After calving, all F1 heifer calves were raised in a single management group with their dams until weaning (BW = 209 ± 4.82 kg; VTM, n = 17; CON, n = 12) and fed a common diet throughout postnatal development. At breeding and throughout gestation, F1 heifers (n = 9, VTM; n = 7, CON) were allotted daily feed intakes of 1.5% of BW on a dry-matter basis as a total mixed ration and used to evaluate cellular energy metabolism throughout pregnancy. Liver and Longissimus dorsi muscle biopsies were collected on d 179 and d 247 +/- 3 of gestation and mitochondrial function was assessed via high resolution respirometry (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria). The following respiratory states were evaluated: LEAK respiration (L), OXPHOS capacity (P), NADH-linked OXPHOS (PI), and electron transfer capacity (E). Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS with repeated measures where appropriate. No treatment × trimester interaction (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.13) was observed for any of the respiratory states in liver and muscle. Hepatic oxygen consumption was not influenced by maternal gestational VTM supplementation (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.68), or stage of gestation (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.27). In muscle, L respiration was the only state affected by maternal dietary treatments, being greater (<span>P</span> = 0.05) in CON than VTM heifers. Additionally, L respiration was greater (<span>P</span> = 0.02) during the third trimester compared with the second trimester. This observation in CON heifers is important because increased L respiration (proton leak) results in decreased ATP production. Protons that escape the intermembrane space, are dissipated as heat rather than be used for ATP synthesis; thus, oxygen consumption increases to compensate for the reduction of protons entering ATP turnover. Results show increased muscle mitochondria inefficiency in offspring with dams lacking supplementation during pregnancy. The increased incidence of proton leak results in potentially less efficient cattle as protons escape the electron transport chain rather than be transformed for energy utilization need of the animal, thus VTM supplementation throughout pregnancy impacts fetal development with potential effects in live offspring 18 to 22 mo post-parturition.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"8144adb06597a072a26ccdfb383f9663492e7f59ed8cf6561c6a7716f7985f16","category":"Environment"}
