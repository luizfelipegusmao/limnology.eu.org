{"title":"Capsinoids Promotes an Increase in Enzyme Antioxidative Activity and Prevents the Injury Cardiac Induced by Obesity without Positively Modulate the Cardiac Oxidative Biomarkers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1805/v1","date":1721798869000,"content":"Capsinoids (CAP) are potential antioxidant agents capable of reducing oxidative damage and the resulting complications triggered by obesity. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CAP on adiposity and biomarkers of cardiac oxidative stress in rats with obesity induced by a high-fat diet. Male Wistar rats were exposed to a high-fat diet for 27 consecutive weeks. After characterization of obesity (week 19), some of the obese (Ob) animals began to receive capsinoids (10 mg/kg/day) by orogastric gavage. Adiposity and comorbidities were assessed. In the heart, remodeling, injury and biomarkers of oxidative stress were determinated. The treatment did not reduce the adiposity induced d by obesity, but they were efficient in reducing cholesterol levels. CAP treatment did not cause a difference in heart and LV mass, despite having reduced troponin I concentrations. Furthermore, capisinoids did not reduce the increase in advanced oxidation of proteins products (AOPP) and carbonylated proteins (CBO) caused by obesity in cardiac tissue. Besides that, it was observed that ObCap rats presented high levels of malondialdehyde and greater activity of antioxidant enzymes compared to Ob. In conclusion, treatment with capsinoids did not lead to significant positive effects in reducing obesity-induced oxidative stress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ab08a4c8dcef5b4ad17da25df7308db470494a627a6399d0700f42df6b66fc2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
