{"title":"MacroLoops for microRNAs: shall we revise the maximum allowed size?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1572/7585182?rss=1","date":1705881600000,"content":"<span>When it comes to RNA, size matters. So much so, that the shortest among these molecules are named just after their sizeâ€”we simply call them <span>microRNAs</span> (miRNAs). But do not let their stature deceive you. miRNAs can destroy much larger RNAs once they find their Achilles' heel: an exposed stretch of nucleotides with enough complementarity to their own sequences. By base-pairing to these target sites, miRNAs bring in endoribonucleolytic enzymes to slice their victims. As treacherous as this may sound, miRNA activity is indispensable for ridding cells of messenger RNAs no longer needed, and this function is essential for the correct development of plants, animals, and other organisms.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"0adc6f0c5a00259adf6d4e79dcd972b84345a6106d2304f64759109e14f91d09","category":"Environment"}
