{"title":"Assessing Education Quality in Bangladeshi Universities: A Statistical Analysis of Secondary Data and Its Implications for Academic Standards","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2360/v1","date":1727662028000,"content":"The quality of education in Bangladeshi universities has long been a topic of concern, yet comprehensive studies on its statistical impact remain limited. This research aims to assess the current state of education quality in Bangladeshi higher education institutions using secondary data from national surveys, academic reports, and global rankings. A variety of statistical methods are employed to identify key factors influencing educational outcomes, including faculty-to-student ratios, infrastructure, research output, and employability of graduates. The findings reveal significant disparities in academic standards across public and private universities, highlighting challenges such as inadequate funding, lack of modern teaching practices, and low research productivity. This study provides data-driven insights and recommendations for policymakers and educators to enhance the quality of university education in Bangladesh, with the ultimate goal of aligning it with global standards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"947e64b57268305e837539b8c2736c761ff4331179f14a4b7e47ef16b2bcfb55","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
