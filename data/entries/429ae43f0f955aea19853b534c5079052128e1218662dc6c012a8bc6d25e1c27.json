{"title":"Disposition of glycolic acid into the embryo following oral administration of ethylene glycol during placentation in the rat and rabbit","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/198/1/31/7510864?rss=1","date":1704326400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In order to evaluate the role of the placenta in the etiology of ethylene glycol (EG) developmental toxicity, the distribution of EG and its main metabolites, glycolic acid (GA) and oxalic acid (OX), into the conceptus was determined at the beginning and completion of placentation in the rat and rabbit. Two groups (<span>n</span> = 28) of timed-pregnant Wistar rats were administered EG (1000 mg/kg bw/day, oral gavage) from gestation day (GD) 6 to either GD 11 or GD 16; similarly, two groups (<span>n</span> = 28) of timed-pregnant New Zealand White rabbits were administered EG from GD 6 to either GD 10 or GD 19. Four animals from each group were sacrificed at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, or 24 h after the final administration, and maternal blood, extraembryonic fluid, and embryonic tissue were removed for analysis of EG, GA, and OX. The three analytes were predominantly cleared from all compartments in both species within 24 h. Neither EG nor OX preferentially accumulated into the conceptus compartments, compared with the maternal blood, in either species. Critically, GA was preferentially accumulated from the maternal blood only into the rat embryo at GD 11, but not at GD 16 and not into the rabbit embryo at either GD 10 or GD 19. The accumulation of GA into the rat embryo, and its decline over the course of placentation, is discussed in relation to the expression of monocarboxylate transporter isoforms across the syncytiotrophoblast.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"429ae43f0f955aea19853b534c5079052128e1218662dc6c012a8bc6d25e1c27","category":"Environment"}
