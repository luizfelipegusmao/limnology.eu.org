{"title":"The Effectiveness of Pattern Scanning Laser Trabeculoplasty as an Additional Treatment for the Patients of Open-Angle Glaucoma Receiving Full Ocular Hypotensive Medications.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1932/v1","date":1714397114000,"content":"Purpose: To examine the effectiveness of patterned laser trabeculoplasty (PSLT) as an additional treatment for patients of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) receiving maximized ocular hypotensive medications (OHM).\nMethods: Forty eyes of 33 patients (average age 72.7±10.7 years) who had not previously undergone open glaucoma surgery or laser trabeculoplasty and were treated with maximized OHM between June 2018 and March 2022 were included. A 360-degree PSLT was conducted and postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) and survival curves at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were evaluated.\nResults: According to the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the average survival time was 8.1 months with death defined as postoperative IOP reduction of less than 10% or requiring additional treatment. The average survival time was 4.9 months with death defined as postoperative IOP reduction of less than 20% or requiring additional treatment. In the 31 eyes which received no additional treatment after PSLT, the mean preoperative IOP was 18.5±3.9 mmHg, which reduced to 15.3±4.1 mmHg (p=1.62 x 10-6)), 15.5±3.4 mmHg (p=1.51 x 10-5), 15.7±4.0 mmHg (p=1.75 x 10-5), 14.7±4.38 (p=2.89 x 10-6), and 15.0±4.0 mmHg (p=5.74 x 10-9) at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after PSLT, respectively. The IOP reduction rate one year after PSLT was 18.7%. Thirteen of the 31 eyes (42%) achieved a 20% reduction in IOP compared to the baseline. \nConclusion: Adjunctive treatment with PSLT in OAG patients receiving maximized OHM may be effective over 12-months of follow-up.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1aab4428d12664c1c47970b4818c21e45f5aaf526119faa09dde0f3cdc3d406","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
