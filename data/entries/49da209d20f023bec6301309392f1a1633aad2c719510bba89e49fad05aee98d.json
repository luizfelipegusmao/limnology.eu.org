{"title":"Adapting spatiotemporal gait symmetry to functional electrical stimulation during treadmill walking","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312285","date":1729260000000,"content":"<p>by Seung-Jae Kim, Alex Worthy, Brandom Lee, Setareh Jafari, Olivia Dyke, Jeonghee Cho, Elijah Brown</p>\r\n\r\nIndividuals with neurological impairments often exhibit asymmetrical gait patterns. This study explored the potential of using functional electrical stimulation (FES) as a perturbation method during treadmill walking to promote gait symmetry adaptation by investigating whether the FES perturbation could induce gait adaptation concerning spatial and temporal gait symmetry in healthy subjects. In the FES perturbation, both legs received electrical pulses at the same period as the subjects’ initial stride duration, and the temporal gap between the two pulses for each leg was manipulated over a 7-min period. Following this, subjects continued to walk for another 5 minutes without FES. Subjects participated in two trials: implicit and explicit. In the implicit trial, they walked comfortably during FES perturbation without consciously adjusting their gait. In the explicit trial, they voluntarily synchronized their toe-off phase to the stimulation timing. To examine the effects of the FES perturbation, we measured step length and stance time and then analyzed changes in step length and stance time symmetries alongside their subsequent aftereffects. During the explicit trial, subjects adapted their gait patterns to the electrical pulses, resulting in a directional change in stance time (temporal) symmetry, with the left stance becoming shorter than the right. The stance time asymmetry induced by FES perturbation showed a slight residual effect. In the implicit trial, the directional change trend was slightly observed but not statistically significant. No consistent trend in step length (spatial) symmetry changes was observed in either condition, indicating that subjects may adapt their spatial gait patterns independently of their temporal patterns. Our findings suggest that the applied FES perturbation strategy under explicit condition can induce adaptations in subjects’ temporal gait asymmetry, particularly in stance. The implicit condition showed a similar slight trend but was not statistically significant. Further experiments would provide deeper understanding into the mechanism behind subjects’ response to FES perturbations, as well as the long-term effects of these perturbations on the spatial and temporal aspects of gait symmetry.","author":"Seung-Jae Kim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"49da209d20f023bec6301309392f1a1633aad2c719510bba89e49fad05aee98d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
