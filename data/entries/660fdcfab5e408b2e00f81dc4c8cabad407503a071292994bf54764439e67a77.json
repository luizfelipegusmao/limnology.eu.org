{"title":"Malignances Stage Development in vitro: The Role of (Very) Small Cancer and Leukemic Stem-Like Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0584/v1","date":1718020364000,"content":"Simple Summary: This review explores the origin of Leukemic Stem-Like Cells (LSLCs) from (Very) Small Leukemic Stem-Like Cells ((V)SLSLCs) and Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) from trans-formed Very Small Embryonic-Like Stem Cells (VSELSCs). Understanding this relation is a step toward uncovering the mechanisms behind cancer and leukemia initiation and development. We explore how these very small precursor cell stages might contribute to the initiation and progres-sion of cancer as well as leukemia with a focus on Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) as a model.\n\nAbstract: Recent experimental findings indicate that CSCs originate from transformed VSELSCs, which are early precursor stages of healthy stem cells. This discovery marks a crucial step in understanding the mechanisms that drive cancer development and initiation. Our team's follow-up studies on leukemia, lung cancer, and healthy embryonic kidney cells have, for the first time, identified stag-es resembling very small precursor stem cells in continuously growing cell lines. These findings suggest the existence of (Very) Small Cancer Stem Cells ((V)SCSCs) or (V)SLSCs within respective subpopulations of CSCs and LSCs in vivo. In this review, we explore theoretical examples of how leukemia progresses through various stages, highlighting the role of these very small precursor cells as fundament primitive stages. We also discuss the potential implications of further research into these unique cellular stages for advancing cancer and leukemia treatment and prevention strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"660fdcfab5e408b2e00f81dc4c8cabad407503a071292994bf54764439e67a77","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
