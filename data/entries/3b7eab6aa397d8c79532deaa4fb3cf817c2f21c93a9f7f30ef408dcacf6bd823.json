{"title":"Rebuilding Quantum Homeostasis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1192/v1","date":1721081687000,"content":"Homeostasis and its interaction with gene expression in the development and maintenance of living systems is discussed in order to formulate a new method to diagnose and treat diseases on this causative level. This includes an inquiry into the unsolved homeostasis problems of: location (where in the cell are calculations performed?), communication (what language used?), identity (set of plans/hierarchy of set points?) and computational (mechanisms used to make necessary adjustments?). As these functions require the processing of vast amounts of information which is communicated at every level of organization including the mechanisms of epigenetics, different computer models are discussed, with examples for each; analog, digital and the possibility of quantum biological. Each one allows certain properties and cell functions to emerge. The difference between functional homeostasis and dysfunctional homeostasis is discussed with strategies to indirectly study them in terms of epigenetic signatures. Hormesis is discussed as a mechanism to reverse the epimutations, leading to a method of treatment to almost any chronic disease. These topics are discussed as being a whole interconnected system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b7eab6aa397d8c79532deaa4fb3cf817c2f21c93a9f7f30ef408dcacf6bd823","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
