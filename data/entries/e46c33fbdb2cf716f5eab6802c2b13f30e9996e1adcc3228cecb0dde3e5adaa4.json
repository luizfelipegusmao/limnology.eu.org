{"title":"Paradoxes in Telemedicine Services: Analysis of Challenges and Opportunities for the Future of Digital Health - A Systematic Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0879/v1","date":1726041771000,"content":"Telemedicine has become an interesting research topic in recent years, especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. This article conducts research using a systematic literature review to identify paradoxes in telemedicine services. The research method follows the steps in a systematic literature review, by accessing the Scopus journal database to search for relevant articles between 2018 and 2024. The selected articles were selected based on certain inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in 28 relevant articles which were then analyzed to understand findings related to paradoxes in telemedicine services. The research results show four main clusters of paradoxes in telemedicine research, namely health services, health quality, the COVID-19 pandemic, and technology. Each cluster shows complex opportunities and challenges in efforts to improve health services through telemedicine. Understanding the clusters for each article can then be mapped to the organizational categories in the Dynamic Equilibrium Model. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive insight into the paradoxes in telemedicine services, highlighting the importance of understanding the various aspects involved in the adoption and implementation of this technology. With a better understanding of this paradox, it is hoped that society and health practitioners can overcome the challenges and exploit the opportunities offered by telemedicine to improve the accessibility and quality of health services in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e46c33fbdb2cf716f5eab6802c2b13f30e9996e1adcc3228cecb0dde3e5adaa4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
