{"title":"Evaluation of bioavailable <sup>137</sup>Cs transfer from forest litter to Scarabaeidae beetle (<i>Protaetia orientalis</i>) through a breeding experiment in Fukuhshima","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310088","date":1725631200000,"content":"<p>by Jaeick Jo, Yumiko Ishii, Rie Saito, Asuka Tanaka, Seiji Hayashi</p>\r\n\r\nFollowing the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in 2011, most of the released <sup>137</sup>Cs remained in the litter and surface soil of the adjacent forest floor. However, <sup>137</sup>Cs absorption by large soil invertebrates near this site has not been estimated. The aim of this study was to understand the role of soil macroinvertebrates in <sup>137</sup>Cs uptake from forest litter into forest ecosystems. Breeding experiments were conducted using scarab beetle larvae (<i>Protaetia orientalis</i>). Dissection experiments revealed that 85% of the total <sup>137</sup>Cs was concentrated in the digestive tract of larvae, while a low proportion was absorbed into the skin and muscle tissues. The <sup>137</sup>Cs absorption rate, indicating the transfer of <sup>137</sup>Cs from consumed litter to larval tissue, was low (0.39%). <sup>137</sup>Cs concentrations decreased to one-fourth from larva to imago, possibly due to excretion from the digestive tract and during eclosion. In the elimination experiment, biological half-lives were 0.26–0.64 and 0.11–0.47 days and 3.35–48.30 and 4.01–17.70 days for the digestive tract and muscle/skin tissues in the fast and slow components, respectively, corresponding to <sup>137</sup>Cs discharge from the gastrointestinal tract and physiological clearance. In the sequential extraction experiment, litter digestion by flower chafer larvae significantly reduced the bioavailable fraction of <sup>137</sup>Cs including water-soluble, exchangeable, oxidized, and organic forms, from 23.2% in litter to 17.7% in feces. Residual <sup>137</sup>Cs was not reduced by digestion, probably because it was fixed in soil clay. Our study on breeding experiments of the Scarabaeidae beetle confirmed the low bioavailability of <sup>137</sup>Cs in the litter in Fukushima. However, litter feeders may play an important role in transferring <sup>137</sup>Cs to higher trophic levels in the forest ecosystem by extracting the bioavailable fraction of the vast stock of <sup>137</sup>Cs on the forest floor.","author":"Jaeick Jo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4f38050d75084e309b46cbc5310c1abfe8b907391b78177378dba534b2affe11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
