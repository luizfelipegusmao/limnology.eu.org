{"title":"Effects of Continuous Prenatal Low Dose Rate Irradiation on Neurobehavior, Hippocampal Cellularity, \nmRNA and miRNA Expression on B6C3F1 Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0050/v1","date":1722518895000,"content":"Abstract: Epidemiological, experimental, and ecological data have indicated the controversial effect of in utero chronic low dose rate (100 mGy) dose radiation exposure. Our main goal of this study was to examine if different low dose rates of chronic pre- or/and post-natal radiation exposure with accumulative high doses could induce hippocampal cellular, mRNA, and miRNA changes leading to neuropsychiatric disorders. The comprehensive mouse phenotypic traits, organ weight pathological, blood mRNA and miRNA changes were also studied. Using different approaches including SmithKline, Harwell, Imperial College, Royal Hospital, Phenotype Assessment (SHIRPA), neurobehavioral tests, pathological examination, immunohistochemistry, mRNA and miRNA sequencing, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) validation, we found that in prenatally irradiated (100 mGy/d for 18 days with an accumulative dose of 1.8 Gy) 1-year-old mice, no cellular changes including neurogenesis, mature neurons and glial cells in the hilus of the dentate gyrus and development of cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric disorders occurred. However, a significant reduction in body weight and mass index (BMI) was indicated by the SHIRPA test. A reduced exploratory behavior was shown by an open field test. Organ weight measurement showed a significant reduction of the testes, kidneys, heart, liver, and epididymides although no abnormal changes from pathological examination. mRNA and miRNA sequencing and qRT-PCR validation revealed the upregulation of Rubcnl, Abhd14b and downregulation of Hspa1b, P4ha1, and Banp genes in both hippocampus and blood of mice prenatally irradiated with 100 mGy/d. Meanwhile, downregulation of miR-448-3p, miR1298-5p in the hippocampus, miR-320-3p, miR-423-5p, miR-486b-5p, miR-486b-3p, miR-423-3p, miR-652-3p, miR-324-3p, miR-181b-5p, miR-let-7b and miR-6904-5p in the blood was induced. The target scan revealed that Rubcnl is one of the miR-181b-5p targets in the blood. We, therefore, concluded that prenatal chronic irradiation with a low dose rate of 100 mGy/d and accumulative dose of 1.8Gy or below may not induce significant adverse health effects on the offspring. Further study of different low dose rate radiation exposure with accumulative high doses may provide threshold doses for authorities or regulators to set new radiation safety guidelines to replace those extrapolated from acute high dose/dose rate irradiation to reduce unnecessary emergency evacuation or expanding once a nuclear accident or leakage occurs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e543d69867431205f428a89b29208ba5eafe7fd9a47224d885d91a05b789f39d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
