{"title":"ARGONAUTE1-binding Tudor domain proteins function in small interfering RNA production for RNA-directed DNA methylation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1333/7623186?rss=1","date":1709683200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Transposable elements (TEs) contribute to plant evolution, development, and adaptation to environmental changes, but the regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is 1 TE regulatory mechanism in plants. Here, we identified that novel ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1)-binding Tudor domain proteins Precocious dissociation of sisters C/E (PDS5C/E) are involved in 24-nt siRNA production to establish RdDM on TEs in <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>. PDS5 family proteins are subunits of the eukaryote-conserved cohesin complex. However, the double mutant lacking angiosperm-specific subfamily PDS5C and PDS5E (<span>pds5c/e</span>) exhibited different developmental phenotypes and transcriptome compared with those of the double mutant lacking eukaryote-conserved subfamily PDS5A and PDS5B (<span>pds5a/b</span>), suggesting that the angiosperm-specific PDS5C/E subfamily has a unique function in angiosperm plants. Proteome and imaging analyses revealed that PDS5C/E interact with AGO1. The <span>pds5c/e</span> double mutant had defects in 24-nt siRNA accumulation and CHH DNA methylation on TEs. In addition, some lncRNAs that accumulated in the <span>pds5c/e</span> mutant were targeted by AGO1-loading 21-nt miRNAs and 21-nt siRNAs. These results indicate that PDS5C/E and AGO1 participate in 24-nt siRNA production for RdDM in the cytoplasm. These findings indicate that angiosperm plants evolved a new regulator, the PDS5C/E subfamily, to control the increase in TEs during angiosperm evolution.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"8e06ea8ad2b8d1ad926966c7aebe1a5ef25013ce6150a23f64f098db567c5d38","category":"Environment"}
