{"title":"Australian Tourist Flow: A Gravity Model Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1791/v1","date":1711686006000,"content":"This research uses a gravity model method to investigate the factors determining the number of tourists visiting Australia. Understanding the variables that draw visitors to specific locations is essential for policymakers and other stakeholders in the tourism sector since tourism continues to play a significant role in the economy of many countries worldwide. Despite the widespread use of gravity models in the analysis of international tourism flows, only a tiny amount of attention has been paid to particularly researching the flow of tourists to Australia. This research addresses this knowledge gap by analyzing the variables influencing travel patterns to Australia. The gravity model framework is used, and it considers factors like gross domestic product, gross domestic product per capita, migratory stocks, distance, population size, cost of living, and cultural similarities. The purpose of this research is to aid in developing focused marketing strategies by providing insights into the factors that influence the flow of tourists to Australia via the analysis of these variables. The results are anticipated to add to the current literature on gravity modeling in tourist research and give practical implications for industry stakeholders and policymakers. The discussion of the findings, their ramifications, and possible directions for further study serves as the conclusion of the work.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d2d3dabbc8904ae37be512b9783eb97a0dc227471d20953d6f1da222089e19c2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
