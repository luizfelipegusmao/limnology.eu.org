{"title":"Hydro‐modeling the ecosystem impact of wastewater reuse under climate change: A case study in upper Red River basin, Oklahoma","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.13208?af=R","date":1722501654000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Water reuse, as a viable option for water supply, must be implemented to minimize the adverse impacts on stream ecosystems that previously received this wastewater effluent. In the State of Oklahoma (OK), USA, local communities have implemented wastewater reuse, and many seek to expand the reuse programs. This study presents a hydro-modeling analysis based on the Coupled Routing and Excess STorage with VECtor routing (CREST-VEC) model focusing on the potential ecosystem impacts and societal benefits of wastewater reuse under climate change in the OK portion of the Red River basin. First, a CREST-VEC model is established for the upper Red River basin and validated against observed streamflow for a 30-year historical period (1990–2020). Based on the established model, we then assess the sensitivity of ecosystem impact to various climate change scenarios and hypothetical wastewater reuse scenarios. Results show that dominant effects of climate change cause the annual time below environmental flow to increase in the next 30 years, which constrains the room to implement wastewater reuse. However, at sub-catchment scale, the analyses identify viable locations for allocating wastewater reuse while maintaining ecosystem health. The results also reveal that wastewater reuse brings about the most societal water benefits at minimal cost of ecosystem health under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 followed by RCP 4.5 and then RCP 8.5. Overall, the study demonstrates capabilities of the hydro-modeling framework in developing water management plans facing the changing climate.</p>","author":"Shang Gao, \nZhi Li, \nGrant Graves, \nHannah A.
