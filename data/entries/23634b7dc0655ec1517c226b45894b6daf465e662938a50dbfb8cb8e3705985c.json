This qualitative study explores the impact of supply chain transparency on consumer behavior, focusing on its influence on brand trust and purchase decisions. Through semi-structured interviews with 30 participants, the research examines consumer attitudes towards transparency, highlighting key factors that influence trustworthiness and credibility perceptions of brands. The findings reveal that consumers prioritize brands that demonstrate openness about their sourcing, production practices, and ethical standards, viewing transparency as a critical indicator of corporate responsibility and integrity. Factors such as product safety, environmental sustainability, and labor practices within supply chains emerge as significant concerns driving consumer preference for transparent brands. Demographic insights indicate that younger consumers and those with higher education levels exhibit heightened sensitivity to transparency issues, underscoring a generational and educational divide in consumer expectations. Moreover, income levels influence the perceived importance of transparency, with higher-income participants showing greater preference for brands that prioritize ethical and sustainable practices. Challenges associated with supply chain transparency, including information overload and concerns about greenwashing, highlight the complexities brands face in effectively communicating their ethical commitments to consumers. The study concludes by advocating for strategic transparency initiatives that integrate sustainability, technology-enabled verification, and stakeholder engagement to build consumer trust and competitive advantage. By addressing these insights, brands can navigate the evolving landscape of consumer expectations and regulatory requirements, fostering long-term relationships based on trust and ethical business practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"23634b7dc0655ec1517c226b45894b6daf465e662938a50dbfb8cb8e3705985c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
