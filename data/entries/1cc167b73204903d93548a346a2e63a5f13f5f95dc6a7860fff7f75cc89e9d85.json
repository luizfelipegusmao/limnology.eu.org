{"title":"Cosmic Ionizing Radiation: A DNA Damaging Agent That May Underly Excess Cancer in Flight Crew","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0398/v1","date":1717670219000,"content":"In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration has officially classified flight crew (FC) consisting of commercial pilots, cabin crew or flight attendants as “radiation workers” since 1994 due to the potential for cosmic ionizing radiation (CIR) exposure at cruising altitudes originating from solar activity and galactic sources. Several epidemiological studies have documented elevated incidence and mortality for several cancers in FC, but it has not yet been possible to establish whether this is attributable to CIR. CIR and its constituents are known to cause a myriad of DNA lesions, which can lead to carcinogenesis unless DNA repair mechanisms remove them. But critical knowledge gaps exist with regard to CIR dosimetry, the role of other genotoxic exposures among FC, and possible biological mechanisms underlying higher cancer rates observed in FC exist. This review summarizes our understanding of the role of DNA damage and repair responses relevant to CIR exposure in FC. We aim to stimulate new research directions and provide information that will be useful for guiding regulatory, public health, and medical decision-making to protect and mitigate risks for those who travel by air.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1cc167b73204903d93548a346a2e63a5f13f5f95dc6a7860fff7f75cc89e9d85","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
