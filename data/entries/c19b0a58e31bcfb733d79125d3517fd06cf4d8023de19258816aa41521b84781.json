{"title":"Endocrine Disruptors in Pregnancy: Effect on Mother and Fetus - A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0923/v1","date":1723540465000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Endocrine disruptors are ubiquitous agents in the environment and are present in everyday consumer products. These agents can interfere with the endocrine system, and subsequently the reproductive system, especially in pregnancy. Increasing research has been conducted to discover and describe the health effects of these agents on humans, including pregnant women, their fetuses, and the placenta. This review discusses prenatal exposure to various endocrine disruptors focusing on Bisphenols, Phthalates, Organophosphates, and Perfluoroalkyl substances, and their effects on pregnancy and fetal development. Methods: We reviewed the literature via PubMed and EBSCO databases and included the most relevant studies. Results: Our findings reveal that several negative health outcomes were linked to endocrine disruptors. However, despite the seriousness of this topic and the abundance of research on these agents, it remains challenging to draw strong conclusions about their effects from the available studies. This does not allow for strong, universal guidelines and might result in poor patient counseling and heterogeneous approaches to regulating endocrine disruptors. Conclusion: The urgency of the matter calls for urgent efforts, as more studies are needed in this realm, to protect pregnant patients ultimately and in the long term, society.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c19b0a58e31bcfb733d79125d3517fd06cf4d8023de19258816aa41521b84781","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
