{"title":"Exploring Next-Generation Antenna Designs: A Literature Review on Antenna Design for 6G Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0628/v1","date":1715268319000,"content":"This literature review offers a comprehensive analysis of antenna designs tailored for 6G applications and THz communications. Various antenna types, including elliptical lens, WHEMS, grid array, CP horn, Quasi Yagi-Uda, patch, transmit array, Vivaldi patch, SRR slotted waveguide array, RCA, and Cassegrain antennas, are scrutinized in terms of their dimensions, characteristics, frequency ranges, and materials. The study highlights existing works on antenna design for 6G applications, exploring different fabrication techniques like PCB technology, LCP technology, Topas fabrication, Wire-cutting EDM, 3D Printing, Laser-drilling processes, and CNC machining. Notably, PCB technology exhibited promise with antennas such as WHEMS, patch, and Vivaldi patch, achieving significant bandwidth and gain. However, gaps remain in research, urging further exploration into additional fabrication methods and antenna designs to meet the demands of 6G networks. The study underlines the need for advanced, intelligent antennas capable of higher bandwidth and better performance in view of future wireless communications technologies such as 6G.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0ef6c02f11c54b11d104c7db4c224f9583291866e27573c4a190525f3336be11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
