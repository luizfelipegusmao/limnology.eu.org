{"title":"275 Frequency of chronic passive congestive livers at harvest in the Texas Panhandle and the association with carcass outcomes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/55/7757013?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Chronic passive congestive (CPC) livers are reported as one of the most common clinical signs of right-sided Bovine Congestive Heart Failure (BCHF). Frequency of CPC livers at harvest and the associated loss of offal and carcass value does not appear in the literature. Our objectives were to 1) quantify the frequency of CPC livers at harvest within the Texas Panhandle, and 2) evaluate the association with offal and carcass outcomes. Audits were performed over the duration of a production week (both harvest shifts) per each large commercial beef processing facility (4 total) in the Texas Panhandle. West Texas A&amp;M University trained personnel identified CPC (large blue) livers at evisceration and documented heart score (HS; scale 1 = normal to 5 = extreme structural changes), liver weight, USDA-FSIS inspection fate (U.S. Inspected &amp; Passed; U.S. Condemned) of the liver, remaining viscera, and carcass. Other visual observations (sex, predominant black hair coat color, carcass/visceral edema, liver abscesses) were noted. 1) Frequency data were documented among cattle-type populations: sex (steers, heifers, cows, bulls), and phenotype [native, dairy-cross, dairy, category-B (Mexico-origin)]. 2) Carcass and lot identification were collected for the purpose of tracking and obtaining carcass grading data. Of carcasses deemed wholesome-U.S. Inspected &amp; Passed, USDA yield and quality metrics [hot carcass weight (HCW), 12<sup>th</sup>-rib fat thickness (FT), ribeye area (REA), marbling score (MS)] of those identified with CPC, as well as data for the balance of respective lots were collected. Carcass outcomes of those exhibiting a CPC liver were compared with the outcomes of remaining lot. Frequency data were analyzed via chi-square. Carcass data were analyzed using mixed models, where occurrence of CPC liver was the fixed effect; facility, cattle type, and sex were random effects. A total of 83,527 animals were audited, with a CPC liver frequency of 0.17% (n = 144). Frequencies among sex (steer = 0.16%; heifer = 0.17%; cow = 0.33%; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) and phenotypes (native = 0.15%; category-B = 0.04%; dairy cross = 0.14%; <span>P</span> = 0.01) were documented. Heart scores ranged from 1 to 4, with HS 3 occurring most frequently [HS 1 (n = 2); HS 2 (n = 39); HS 3 (n = 62); HS 4 (n = 17)]. Weights of CPC livers ranged from 7.3 kg to 34.4 kg; the heaviest CPC livers were recorded in cows (mean = 17.2 kg; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Despite USDA-FSIS guidelines, 2.08% of CPC livers were U.S. Inspected &amp; Passed, along with 16.90% of viscera and 84.03% of carcasses. Cow carcasses encountered the greatest U.S. Condemn-rates (38.24%) among the sex categories. Within the fed-beef population, natives were the only category resulting in U.S. Condemned carcasses (10.64%). All carcass outcomes were decreased (<span>P</span> â‰¤ 0.01) by CPC livers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"c280bc68e36de2527111d5a4b504859d41f3df0b50168a76a0d951205fdc0e96","category":"Environment"}
