{"title":"A Cloud Infrastructure for Health Monitoring in Emergency Response Scenarios","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0440/v1","date":1725532390000,"content":"Wearable devices have a significant impact on society and recent advancements in modern sensor technologies are opening up new possibilities for healthcare applications. Continuous vital sign monitoring using IoT can be a crucial tool for emergency management, reducing risk in rescue operations and ensuring the safety of workers.The massive amounts of data, high network traffic, and computational demands of a typical IoT monitoring application can be challenging to manage with traditional infrastructure. Cloud computing provides a solution with its built-in resilience and elasticity capabilities.This article presents a cloud-based monitoring architecture for remote vital sign tracking of paramedics and medical workers through the use of a mobile wearable IoT device. It enables the management of ECG, breathing patterns, and other vital signs during work sessions, and sends real-time alarm events to a personnel management center. The platform was extensively used and tested in a large-scale monitoring application for tracking the activities of emergency room and ambulance workers, and the results of this testing are presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4ce9cbecbe4a84f6b0ec4826fefb261b80ff3296c9794f838a7f4b9af9c0cb4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
