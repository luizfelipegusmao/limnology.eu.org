{"title":"Servo Control of a Current-Controlled Attractive-Force Type Magnetic Levitation System Using Fractional Order LQR Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0210/v1","date":1719924271000,"content":"Recent research on fractional order control laws has introduced the fractional calculus concept into the field of control engineering. As described herein, we apply fractional order LQR control to a current-controlled attractive-force type magnetic levitation system, which is a strongly nonlinear and unstable system, to investigate its control performance through experimentation. First, to design the controller, a current-controlled attractive-force type magnetic levitation system expressed as an integer-order system is extended to a fractional order system expressed using fractional order derivatives. Then target value tracking control of levitated objects is achieved by adding states, described by the integrals of the deviation between the output and the target value, to the extended system. Next, a fractional order LQR controller is designed for the extended system. For state-feedback control such as fractional order servo LQR control, which requires information of all states, a fractional order state-observer is configured to estimate fractional order states. Simulation results demonstrate that fractional order servo LQR control can achieve equilibrium point stabilization and enable target-value tracking. Finally, to verify the fractional order servo LQR control effectiveness, experiments using the designed fractional order servo LQR control law are done with comparison to conventional integer-order servo LQR control.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43240e4be7f38ed621600de53d6b4d86437db4b67b153e31adab11927bc9849c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
