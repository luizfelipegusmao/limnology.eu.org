{"title":"Smartphone-Based Fundus Camera and Telemedicine: A Study in the Brazilian Amazon Forest","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0834/v1","date":1715588871000,"content":"Smartphone-based fundus camera and telemedicine are an opportunity for accessing ocular health inequalities in underresourced areas. The objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of retinal findings in a community in the Amazon and propose strategies to enhance ocular health. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a river side community. Retinal photos from the posterior pole and optic disc were captured using a portable fundus camera. All photos and data were analyzed remotely by a retina specialist. The final sample was 107 participants, aged 52±17. Retinal findings were detected in 37.4% (95%CI 28.7–46.8) of the sample, the three main retinal findings were epithelial changes (10.3%, 95%CI 5.6–17.1), chorioretinal scars (8.4%, 95%CI 4.2–14.8), and dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (7.5%, 95%CI 3.6–13.6). This study detected retinal alterations in similar prevalence of other underresourced areas. Telemedicine is an opportunity to address health inequities, especially in ophthalmology, through relatively low-cost portable devices, supporting clinical decisions in areas with low health access, however, maintaining assistance after implementation is a challenge. Enhancing medical education and training local non-specialized health professionals for risk assessment, device handling, and data base use is reasonable to ensure follow-up.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a14b4a659608fdfe5293eed2f9f3a1c723a3cd8205efbb580e050f0007447e94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
