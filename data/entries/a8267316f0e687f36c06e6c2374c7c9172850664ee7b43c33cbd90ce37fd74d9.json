{"title":"Surgical Outcomes of Modified Intraocular Lens Suturing With Forceps-Assisted Haptics Extraction: A Clinical and Basic Evaluation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1740/v1","date":1719371299000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Postoperative intraocular lens (IOL) is a risk associated with IOL scleral fixation. However, the cause of IOL tilt during IOL suturing remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the surgical outcomes of a modified IOL suturing technique and investigate the factors contributing to postoperative IOL tilt and decentration. Methods: We included 25 eyes of 22 patients who underwent IOL suturing between April 2018 and February 2020. A modified IOL suturing technique that decreased the need for intraocular suture manipulation was used. Factors contributing to IOL tilt and decentration were investigated using an intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) system. Results: The mean postoperative best-corrected visual acuity improved from 0.15 ± 0.45 to -0.02 ± 0.19 (p = 0.02). The mean IOL tilt angle at the last visit after  surgery was 1.84 ± 1.28 degrees. The study revealed that the distance of the scleral puncture site from the corneal limbus had a stronger effect on IOL tilt; while, the suture position of the haptics had a greater effect on IOL decentration. Conclusions: The modified IOL suturing technique, which avoids intraocular suture handling, had favorable surgical outcomes with improved postoperative visual acuity and controlled IOL tilt and decentration. Accurate surgical techniques and careful measurement of distances during surgery are crucial for preventing postoperative IOL tilt and decentration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8267316f0e687f36c06e6c2374c7c9172850664ee7b43c33cbd90ce37fd74d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
