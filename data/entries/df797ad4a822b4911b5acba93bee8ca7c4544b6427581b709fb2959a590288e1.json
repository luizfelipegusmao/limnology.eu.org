{"title":"Characteristic Features of Lif Parameters of Microalgae Alexandrium catenella and Their Dependence on Temperature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1384/v1","date":1724117959000,"content":"Harmful algal blooms are a serious problem for humanity, so the development of tools and methods for their timely detection is an urgent task. The use of optical methods often allows scientists to solve problems of remote and automated monitoring. Temperature spectra of fluorescence can be used as distinctive features of algae, and the fluorescence parameters obtained from them can be used for identification. The paper presents a description of the fluorescence parameters of Alexandrium catenella, and shows their stability during cumulative cultivation. In addition, the cytometric properties of the culture and its pigment composition were studied. In addition, the article compares all the studied properties of this microalga with the alga Prorocentrum cordatum. We demonstrated clear differences in their fluorescence parameters, which makes it possible to distinguish these microalgae by optical methods, for example, during their dominant blooms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df797ad4a822b4911b5acba93bee8ca7c4544b6427581b709fb2959a590288e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
