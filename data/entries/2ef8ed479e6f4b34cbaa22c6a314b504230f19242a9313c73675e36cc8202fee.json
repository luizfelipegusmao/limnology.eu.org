{"title":"Investigating the feasibility of a Campus Circular Economy to Advance Sustainable Consumption","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0575/v1","date":1723111184000,"content":"While the concept of a circular economy offers the solutions necessary to enable economies to move away from consumptive, wasteful practices and towards more sustainable alternatives, in practise, few economies have been able to transition to circularity. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of a circular economy on a small-scale university campus, leveraging both research by sustainability-focused academics, and attitudes of students who generally care more about sustainability than older cohorts [1]. It begins with a literature review based on five identified pillars of circularity [2]: waste management; data management; business operations and infrastructure; policy and regulation; and education and collaboration. A qualitative methodology was adopted, involving a series of interviews with campus representatives either working or researching some element of sustainable circularity. By bringing together dedicated scholars with knowledge and capacity and a motivated consumer target, all in one location, we present a framework for a Campus Circular Economy (CCE) with potential for replication to advance sustainable consumption in campus environments and beyond.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ef8ed479e6f4b34cbaa22c6a314b504230f19242a9313c73675e36cc8202fee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
