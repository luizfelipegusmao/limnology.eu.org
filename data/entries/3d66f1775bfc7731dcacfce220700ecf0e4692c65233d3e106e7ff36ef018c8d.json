In river networks, the abundance and accessibility of food and the energetic consequences of foraging vary among habitats and through time, providing a shifting mosaic of growth opportunities for mobile consumers. However, a framework integrating the spatiotemporal dynamics of growth potential within riverscapes has been lacking. We present the concept of foodscapes to depict the dynamic changes in food abundance, food accessibility, and consumer physiology that contribute to spatial and temporal variation of fish growth in rivers. Drawing on case studies of salmonid fishes from Alaska to California, we illustrate how foodscapes can provide a plethora of foraging, growth, and life history opportunities that potentially contribute to population resilience. We identify knowledge gaps in understanding foodscapes and approaches for stewardship that focus on restoring diverse foraging and growth opportunities for fish and other mobile consumers in river networks.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"BioScience Current Issue","siteHash":"b284d132cf96f029686596d0a1781780964c795fe639c624cd504e01b404d8ff","entryHash":"3d66f1775bfc7731dcacfce220700ecf0e4692c65233d3e106e7ff36ef018c8d","category":"Environment"}
