{"title":"Evidence of Oxidative Stress as a Mechanism of Pharmaceuticals-Induced Toxicity in Amphibians","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1727/v1","date":1727142562000,"content":"Amphibians, which are essential components of ecosystems, are susceptible to pharmaceutical contamination, a phenomenon of increasing concern owing to the widespread consumption and detection of pharmaceutical compounds in environmental matrices. This review investigates oxidative stress (OS) as the primary mechanism of drug toxicity in these organisms. The evidence gathered reveals that various pharmaceuticals, from antibiotics to anesthetics, induce OS by altering biomarkers of oxidative damage and antioxidant defense. These findings underscore the deleterious effects of pharmaceuticals on amphibian health and development and emphasize the necessity of incorporating OS biomarkers into ecotoxicological risk assessments. Although further studies on diverse amphibian species, drug mixtures, and field studies are required, OS biomarkers offer valuable tools for identifying sublethal risks. Furthermore, the development of more refined OS biomarkers will facilitate early detection of adverse effects, which are crucial for protecting amphibians and their ecosystems. Ultimately, this review calls for continued research and mitigation strategies to safeguard biodiversity from pharmaceutical contamination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"426cc528bd6fae86074495619fd72126aeb38ae1bad6f7d14cdb9fd77361f785","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
