The disease carries a high risk of end stage liver disease, i.e., cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have revolutionized therapy, the emergence of drug-resistant strains has become a growing concern. Conventional cellular models, Huh7 and its derivatives were very permissive to only HCVcc (JFH-1), but not HCV clinical isolates. The lack of suitable host cells had hindered comprehensive research on patient-derived HCV. Here, we established a novel hepatocyte model for HCV culture to host clinically pan-genotype HCV strains. The immortalized hepatocyte-like cell line (imHC) derived from human mesenchymal stem cell carries HCV receptors and essential host factors. The imHC outperformed Huh7 as a host for HCV (JFH-1) and sustained the entire HCV life cycle of pan-genotypic clinical isolates. We analyzed the alteration of host markers (i.e., hepatic markers, cellular innate immune response, and cell apoptosis) in response to HCV infection. The imHC model uncovered the underlying mechanisms governing the action of IFN-Î± and the activation of sofosbuvir. The insights from HCV-cell culture model hold promise for understanding disease pathogenesis and novel anti-HCV development.","author":"Yongyut Pewkliang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c897405907d584cc63037c92ff984d99798c13214c91203c0feb517ea3a3c9d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
