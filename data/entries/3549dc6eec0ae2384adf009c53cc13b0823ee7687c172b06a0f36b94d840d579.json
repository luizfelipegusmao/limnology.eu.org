{"title":"Quantitative Multi-Parametric MRI of the Prostate Reveals Racial Differences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2234/v1","date":1727441054000,"content":"This study investigated whether quantitative MRI and histology of the prostate reveals differences between races that can affect diagnosis. Cancer signal enhancement rate (α) on DCE-MRI was significantly higher for African Americans (AA) compared to Caucasian Americans (CA). Signal washout rate (β) was significantly lower in benign tissue in AAs and significantly elevated in cancers in AAs. However, no significant differences were found for ADC and T2. ROC analysis showed that ADC and T2 are slightly less effective in AA compared to CA. DCE significantly improves the differentiation of PCa from benign in AAs (α: 52%, β: 62% more effective in AA compared to CA). Histologic analysis showed cancers have a greater proportion of epithelium and lower lumen in AA compared to CA. This study shows that the different races have different quantitative MRI values and histologic makeup. Quantitative DCE-MRI is highly effective and improves PCa diagnosis in African Americans.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3549dc6eec0ae2384adf009c53cc13b0823ee7687c172b06a0f36b94d840d579","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
