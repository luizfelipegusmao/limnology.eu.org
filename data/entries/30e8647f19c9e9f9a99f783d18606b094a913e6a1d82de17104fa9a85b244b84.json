{"title":"A case-matched study of imatinib mesylate between different formulations on plasma trough concentration, adverse events, quality of life and outcomes in gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303290","date":1715695200000,"content":"<p>by Li Zeng, Xiang Cheng, Juan Li, Jun Zhang, Xingye Wu</p>\r\n\r\nGenike, the imatinib (IM)-alpha form is widely used in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients in China. We wanted to investigate whether there are differences in IM plasma concentrations, adverse events, health-related quality of life (QOL) and outcomes between patients treated with Genike and Glivec. Thirty included GIST patients receiving IM treatment were matched to either Genike or Glivec according to gastrectomy, body weight, body surface area and sex. There was no statistically significant difference in IM trough plasma levels between the two groups. There were no significant differences in very common adverse events of IM between the Genike and Glivec groups. IM was well tolerated, although it was associated with a significant change in cognitive function (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), fatigue (<i>P</i> = 0.015), pain (<i>P</i> = 0.015), nausea/vomiting (<i>P</i> = 0.029), insomnia (<i>P</i> = 0.019), diarrhea (<i>P</i> = 0.003) and financial difficulties (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Physical functioning, financial burden and insomnia were significantly different between the two groups (<i>P</i> = 0.026). Until Aug. 2022, there was no significant difference in time to imatinib treatment failure (TTF) between the two groups. In conclusion, there was no difference in IM plasma concentration and adverse events between Genike and Glivec. Both Genike and Glivec could partially decrease the QOL of GIST patients. Physical functioning was worse in Genike group than in Glivec group, while the economic burden and symptoms of insomnia in Glivec patients were worse. There was no significant difference in TTF between the two groups.","author":"Li Zeng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"30e8647f19c9e9f9a99f783d18606b094a913e6a1d82de17104fa9a85b244b84","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
