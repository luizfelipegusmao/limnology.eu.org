{"title":"A Case Report of Undiagnosed Bicuspid Aortic Valve: A Global Health Challenge","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0648/v1","date":1725868843000,"content":"Introduction and importance: Congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common cardiac malformation predisposing individuals to aortic stenosis, regurgitation, and aortopathy. This risk persists even after aortic valve replacement (AVR). Case presentation: We report a case of a male in his 60s with a history of BAV who underwent bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (BVR) and ascending aorta/root repair in 2014. The patient was noncompliant with follow-up and presented nine years later with severe bioprosthetic aortic stenosis and an 8.0 cm ascending aortic aneurysm with no symptoms. Emergent redo BVR and aneurysm repair were successful. Clinical discussion: It should be emphasized that successful outcomes for BAV patients require a lifelong commitment to surveillance, even after surgical intervention. Noncompliance can lead to life-threatening consequences like bioprosthetic valve deterioration or progressive aortic dilation. Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of early BAV diagnosis for ongoing monitoring, accessible follow-up care after complex cardiac procedures, and addressing patient barriers to treatment adherence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a2bd4680abc4190efbae014e9a619461799ace388e1d72476b77e076237639c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
