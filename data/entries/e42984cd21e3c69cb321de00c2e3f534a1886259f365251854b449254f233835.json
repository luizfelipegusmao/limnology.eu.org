{"title":"In-Depth Analysis and Countermeasures for Ransomware Attacks: Case Studies and Recommendations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2261/v1","date":1725268129000,"content":"Ransomware, a combination of \"ransom\" and \"malware,\" is a type of malicious software designed to encrypt or block access to a victim's data or system, demanding a ransom for its release Initially targeting individuals, ransomware has evolved to attack businesses for greater financial gain. It mainly exists in two forms: encrypting ransomware, which holds data hostage, and non-encrypting ransomware, which blocks system access and displays a ransom note. The energy sector has been notably targeted by ransomware, exemplified by the 2021 attack on Colonial Pipeline by the DarkSide group, which led to a temporary shutdown and a significant fuel shortage on the US East Coast. Similarly, in 2023, Russian hackers using LockBit ransomware disrupted Royal Mail, halting international deliveries and incurring millions in recovery costs despite no ransom payment. These incidents underscore the need for comprehensive cybersecurity strategies that combine human vigilance with advanced technologies like AI and machine learning. By adopting a multi-layered protection approach, organizations can better prepare for and mitigate the risks posed by ransomware attacks safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring business continuity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e42984cd21e3c69cb321de00c2e3f534a1886259f365251854b449254f233835","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
