{"title":"National Beef Quality Audit—2022: in-plant assessments of quality and yield determining carcass characteristics of fed steers and heifers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae098/7693848?rss=1","date":1718409600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The National Beef Quality Audit – 2022 serves as a benchmark of the current fed steer and heifer population of the U.S. beef industry and allows comparison to previous audits as a method of monitoring industry progress. In-plant cooler assessments and collections of beef carcass data took place from July 2021 to November 2022. During in-plant evaluations, 10% of 1-d production was surveyed for quality and yield indicating characteristics of fed beef carcasses (<span>n =</span> 9,746 beef carcasses). Distributions of sex classes among sampled carcasses were steer (65.0%) and heifer (35.0%), whereas distributions of breed type were native (87.7%), dairy (11.3%), and <span>Bos indicus</span> (0.9%). Mean values were observed for USDA Yield Grades (<strong>YG</strong>; 3.3), USDA Quality Grade (<strong>QG</strong>; Choice<sup>16</sup>), marbling score (Small<sup>98</sup>), ribeye area (91.0 cm<sup>2</sup>), adjusted fat thickness (1.49 cm), hot carcass weight (401.9 kg), and KPH (2.5%). Mean overall maturity was A<sup>66</sup>, with a mean lean maturity of A<sup>56</sup> and mean skeletal maturity of A<sup>72</sup>. There were 28.1% of carcasses identified for use in a USDA-certified beef G-Schedule Program. Defects, such as dark cutting and blood splash, were observed at 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Distributions of USDA YG were YG 1 (8.2%), YG 2 (30.7%), YG 3 (40.2%), YG 4 (16.6%), and YG 5 (4.3%). USDA QGs were observed at 7.5% Prime, 69.2% Choice, 16.4% Select, and 6.8% other. The results of this study provide an updated look at the current grading trends of beef carcasses in the United States to drive progress in the fed beef industry.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"8f9bb9311e9a9a0afa4ff53648a6c4c237bea9788b38d4b4294493a73139fd28","category":"Environment"}
