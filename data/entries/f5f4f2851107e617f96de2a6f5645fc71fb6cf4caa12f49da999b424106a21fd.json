{"title":"Biochar and Deactivated Yeast as Seed Coatings for Restoration: Performance on Alternative Substrates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1730/v1","date":1721662707000,"content":"Seedling establishment is often a critical bottleneck to revegetation of mine tailings and similar substrates with a low capacity to retain water and plant nutrients. Biochar and deactivated yeast are potential sustainable, low-cost materials with high nutrient- and water-holding capacity that could be used in this context as seed coatings to aid in seedling establishment on challenging sub-strates. We conducted a greenhouse study to assess the effectiveness of biochar and deactivated yeast, applied alone in a factorial combination, as seed coatings, on the germination, establish-ment, and early growth of white clover (Trifolium repens) and purple prairie clover (Dalea pur-purea). Coated seeds were applied to a mine tailing, a coarse granitic sand, and potting soil mix substates; seedling establishment and growth were monitored over 75 days. Results indicate strong interactive effects of seed coatings with species and substrate. Biochar coatings enhanced seedling establishment of Trifolium, with biochar or biochar plus yeast coatings giving the best results. In some cases, these effects persisted throughout the experiment: biochar coatings resulted in a ~5-fold increase in Trifolium biomass at harvest for plants in the potting soil mix but had neutral effects on sand or tailings. Biochar seed coatings also enhanced Dalea germination in some cases, but benefits did not persist. Our results indicate that biochar-based seed coatings can have lasting effects on plant growth well beyond germination, but also emphasize highly spe-cies-specific responses that highlight the need for further study of broader patterns and mecha-nisms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5f4f2851107e617f96de2a6f5645fc71fb6cf4caa12f49da999b424106a21fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
