{"title":"Designing Insulin Analogues with Lower Binding Affinity to Insulin Receptor than That of Insulin Icodec","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1922/v1","date":1714384675000,"content":"Insulin therapy is a cornerstone in the management of diabetes, yet the pursuit of optimizing its pharmacokinetic profile remains a focal point in diabetes research. For instance, insulin icodec of Novo Nordisk is a novel long-acting insulin analogue that exhibits an extended duration of action, providing a promising once-weekly treatment option for diabetic patients. However, designing insulin analogues with lower receptor affinity than that of insulin icodec could still produce a further extended duration of action than that of insulin icodec through the suppression of receptor-mediated internalization of insulin analogues. In this study, therefore, I present the design of a novel series of insulin analogues engineered towards lower binding affinity to the insulin receptor compared to that of insulin icodec.  Through computational structural biophysics-based rational design strategies, this article aims to further extend the duration of action while maintaining therapeutic efficacy of insulin analogues.  Utilizing homology molecular modeling and structural biophysics-based binding affinity calculations, this article puts forward a set of insulin analogues with lower binding affinity to insulin receptor than that of insulin icodec from a structural and biophysical point of view. Overall, this article calls for subsequent in vitro and in vivo evaluations of the efficacy and prolonged action of the engineered insulin analogues to pharmacokinetically test whether these analogues acutally surpass that of insulin icodec as hopeful candidates for next-generation insulin analogue therapies with improved duration of action and enhanced control of blood glucose levels for diabetic patients in future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c8baebf90f1471adfe436b3ccc43ad06f9a2318ccc012042312661301a3d308","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
