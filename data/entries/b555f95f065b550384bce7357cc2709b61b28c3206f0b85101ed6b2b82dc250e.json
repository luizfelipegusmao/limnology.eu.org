{"title":"A standard calibration method based on a symmetric resistance network matrix for galvanic logging instruments","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302032","date":1713362400000,"content":"<p>by Yongli Ji, Zhiqiang Li, Jigen Xia, Jiajia Song</p>\r\n\r\nAn increasing number of measurement electrodes have been designed to satisfy the demand for high-resolution detection using galvanic logging technology in complex formations. The forward modeling response analysis of logging tools has important guiding significance in the design of galvanic logging tools. Based on a three-dimensional finite element numerical simulation method, we established a forward model of galvanic multi-electrodes in a complex formation. We also designed a symmetrical resistance network model of the formation with equivalent resistance between two electrodes. A symmetrical resistance network was derived using the balanced bridge method. The asymmetrical admittance matrix was extended to a symmetrical extended admittance matrix to realize a convenient calculation of the equivalent symmetrical resistance network in complex formations. Verification of the microcolumn-focused logging tool, with nine electrodes in a simulated standard well, and an evaluation of the degree of invasion in an actual oil well indicate that this calibration method can improve the measurement accuracy of galvanic logging instruments.","author":"Yongli Ji","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b555f95f065b550384bce7357cc2709b61b28c3206f0b85101ed6b2b82dc250e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
