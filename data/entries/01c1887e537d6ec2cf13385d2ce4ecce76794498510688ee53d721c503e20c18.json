{"title":"The age and growth information of a ctenoid scale fossil from the Upper Cretaceous Nenjiang Formation in Songliao Basin, China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303198","date":1714744800000,"content":"<p>by Zhaoqing Liu, Xiaobo Li, Robert R. Reisz</p>\r\n\r\nThe study of morphological characteristics and growth information in fish scales is a crucial component of modern fishery biological research, while it has been less studied in fossil materials. This paper presents a detailed morphological description and growth analysis of a fossil ctenoid scale obtained from the Upper Cretaceous Campanian lacustrine deposits in northeastern China. The morphological features of this fossil scale are well-preserved and consistent with the structures found in ctenoid scales of extant fish species and display prominent ring ornamentation radiating outward from the central focus, with grooves intersecting the rings. A comparative analysis of the morphological characteristics between the fossil ctenoid scale and those well-studied extant fish Mugilidae allows us to explore the applicability of modern fishery biological research methods to the field of fossil scales. The scale length, scale width, the vertical distance from the focus to the apex of the scale, and the total number of radii have been measured. The age of the fish that possessed this ctenoid scale has been estimated by carefully counting the annuli, suggesting an age equal to or more than seven years. The distribution of growth rings on the scale potentially reflects the warm paleoclimatic condition and fish-friendly paleoenvironment prevalent during that period. This paper, moreover, serves as a notable application of fishery biological methods in the examination of fossil materials.","author":"Zhaoqing Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"01c1887e537d6ec2cf13385d2ce4ecce76794498510688ee53d721c503e20c18","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
