{"title":"Human Vault RNAs&ndash;Small Molecules and Great Perspectives. The Insight on Their Role in Cellular Metabolism","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0663/v1","date":1710247318000,"content":"Non-coding RNAs have been described as crucial regulators of gene expression and guards for cellular homeostasis. Some recent papers are focused on vault RNAs, one of the classes of non-coding RNA, and their role in cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, apoptosis, cancer response to therapy, and autophagy, which made them potential therapy targets in oncology. In the human genome, four vault RNA paralogues can be distinguished. They are associated with vault complexes, considered the largest ribonucleoprotein complex. The protein part of these complexes consists of a major vault protein (MVP) and two minor vault proteins (vPARP and TEP1). The name of the complex, as well as vault RNA, comes from the hollow barrel-shaped structure that reminds a vault. Their sequence and structure are highly evolutionary conserved and show many similarities in comparison with different species, but vault RNAs show various roles. Vaults were discovered in 1986, and their functions remained unclear for many years. Although not much is known about their contribution to cell metabolism, it has become clear that vault RNAs are involved in various processes and pathways associated with cancer progression and modulating cell functioning in normal and pathological stages. In this review, we discuss known functions of the human vault RNAs in the context of cellular metabolism, emphasizing processes related to cancer and cancer therapy efficacy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a6ad15944db4a61548674e24006c388a919cd099717978ee48102db49a89335","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
