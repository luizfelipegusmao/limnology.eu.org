{"title":"OPTIMIZATION OF ULTRASOUND‐ASSISTED PECTIN RECOVERY FROM COCOA BY‐PRODUCTS USING RESPONSE SURFACE METHODOLOGY","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13498?af=R","date":1711719784000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Purpose</h2>\n<p>This research aims to address the significant challenges associated with agricultural wastage and cocoa waste disposal within the context of global food wastage concerns. The research acknowledges the staggering magnitude of global food wastage, estimated at 1.6 gigatonnes of primary product equivalents, with 1.3 gigatonnes attributed specifically to the edible part of food. Focusing on cocoa waste, which constitutes around 80% of total cocoa production, management poses a considerable environmental challenge, with over 60% of this waste either burned or left to rot in plantations.</p>\n<h2>Method</h2>\n<p>Ultrasound-assisted extraction of pectin from Cocoa Pulp Mucilage (CPM), Cocoa Pod Husk (CPH), and Cocoa Bean Shell (CBS) was achieved by the Central Composite Design (CCD) using response surface methodology (RSM).</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Ultrasound-assisted extraction considers independent factors such as temperature, sonication time, pH, solid-liquid ratio, and ultrasonic power intensity. Under optimum conditions (sonication time of 20 mins, pH of 2.5, the solid-solvent ratio of 1:40 g/mL, ultrasonic power intensity of 64 W/cm2), the research achieves the highest yield, anhydrouronic acid content, and degree of esterification. The composition and characterization of pectin extracted from CPH, CBS and CPM showed that the pectin had an anhydrouronic acid percentage of 68.59±0.2%, 50.7±0.5% and 43.97±0.17% respectively when extracted with citric acid.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The research underscores the potential to reduce the environmental impact of cocoa waste, offering improved pectin extraction and sustainable methods for handling agricultural by-products. This work holds significance for individuals interested in waste reduction and resource efficiency within the broader agricultural industry, showcasing the potential for practical and sustainable solutions in cocoa waste management.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
