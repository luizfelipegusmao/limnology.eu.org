{"title":"Fractional Order, Interval Parameter, State Space Model of the One-Dimensional Heat Transfer Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0835/v1","date":1718189355000,"content":"In the paper the new, fractional order, state space model of a heat transfer in a one- 1\ndimensional metallic rod is addressed. The fractional orders of derivative along space and time 2\nare not exactly known and they are described by intervals. The proposed model is the interval 3\nexpanding of the state space fractional model of the one dimensional heat transfer. It is expected to 4\nbetter describe the reality because interval order of each real process is hard to estimate. Elementary 5\nproperties of the proposed model are analysed. Theoretical results are experimentally validated using 6\ndata from real experimental laboratory system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"accf7f5b913cd163703d3b2a1de9f3125bdc8aa64fd9c3dd56746e881d4f7410","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
