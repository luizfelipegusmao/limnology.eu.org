{"title":"A century journey of organelles research in the plant endomembrane system","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1312/7558431?rss=1","date":1705363200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We are entering an exciting century in the study of the plant organelles in the endomembrane system. Over the past century, especially within the past 50 years, tremendous advancements have been made in the complex plant cell to generate a much clearer and informative picture of plant organelles, including the molecular/morphological features, dynamic/spatial behavior, and physiological functions. Importantly, all these discoveries and achievements in the identification and characterization of organelles in the endomembrane system would not have been possible without: (1) the innovations and timely applications of various state-of-art cell biology tools and technologies for organelle biology research; (2) the continuous efforts in developing and characterizing new organelle markers by the plant biology community; and (3) the landmark studies on the identification and characterization of the elusive organelles. While molecular aspects and results for individual organelles have been extensively reviewed, the development of the techniques for organelle research in plant cell biology is less appreciated. As one of the ASPB Centennial Reviews on “organelle biology,” here we aim to take a journey across a century of organelle biology research in plants by highlighting the important tools (or landmark technologies) and key scientists that contributed to visualize organelles. We then highlight the landmark studies leading to the identification and characterization of individual organelles in the plant endomembrane systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"4089b5baa2debfd090a4ccec662f9bf99e8d42e725d051383cdb5d8283fcc3ae","category":"Environment"}
