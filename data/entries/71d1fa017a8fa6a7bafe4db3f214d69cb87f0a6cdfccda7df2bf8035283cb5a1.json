However, many insect pests infest poplar trees and have caused significant damage. To control poplar pests, we transformed a poplar species, <span>Populus davidiana</span> × <span>P. bolleana</span> Loucne, with the dsRNA of the chitinase gene of a poplar defoliator, <span>Clostera anastomosis</span> (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Notodontidae), employing an <span>Agrobaterium</span>-mediated approach. The transgenic plant has been identified by cloning the T-DNA flanking sequences using TAIL-PCR and quantifying the expression of the dsRNA using qPCR. The toxicity assay of the transgenic poplar lines was carried out by feeding the target insect species (<span>C. anastomosis</span>). The results showed that, in <span>C. anastomosis,</span> the activity of chitinase was significantly decreased, consistent with the expression on mRNA levels, and the larval mortality was significantly increased. These results suggested that the transgenic poplar of dsRNA could be used for pest control.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"71d1fa017a8fa6a7bafe4db3f214d69cb87f0a6cdfccda7df2bf8035283cb5a1","category":"Environment"}
