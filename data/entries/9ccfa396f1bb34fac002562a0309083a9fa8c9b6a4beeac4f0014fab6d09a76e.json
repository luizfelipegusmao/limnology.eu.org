{"title":"Practices for preventing Hepatitis B infection among health science students in Ethiopia: Systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306965","date":1720620000000,"content":"<p>by Gemeda Wakgari Kitil, Abiy Tasew Dubale, Adamu Ambachew Shibabaw, Alex Ayenew Chereka</p>\r\nBackground <p>Hepatitis B virus infection remains a significant public health concern globally, particularly among healthcare workers, including health science students who are at high risk due to their exposure to infected patients and contaminated medical equipment. In Ethiopia, where the burden of HBV infection is substantial, preventive practices among health science students are critical for minimizing transmission and ensuring a healthy workforce. However, there is a lack of comprehensive evidence regarding the effectiveness of these practices specifically among this population in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of preventive measures for Hepatitis B infection among Health Science Students in Ethiopia.</p> Methods <p>This study followed the guidelines outlined in the PRISMA checklist and focused on research conducted within Ethiopia. Seven relevant studies were identified through comprehensive searches across various databases including Google, Medline, PubMed, and Scholar. Data retrieval was systematically conducted using a checklist, and analysis was performed using STATA version 14. Heterogeneity was assessed using both the Cochrane Q test and the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. Additionally, publication bias was evaluated using Egger’s weighted regression, a funnel plot, and Begg’s test.</p> Results <p>In this meta-analysis and systematic review, we identified a total of 515 research articles, of which seven studies met the eligibility criteria for analysis. The overall pooled magnitude of practices aimed at preventing Hepatitis B infection among Health Science Students in Ethiopia was 41.21% (95% CI: 30.81–51.62). Factors significantly associated with these practices included better understanding of Hepatitis B infection prevention (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.20–3.29), age group 20–24 years (OR = 5.79, 95% CI: 2.43–13.78), needle stick injury exposure (OR = 3.43, 95% CI: 1.10–10.70), and students enrolled in medicine or public health officer departments (OR = 4.20, 95% CI: 2.65–6.65).</p> Conclusion <p>Our analysis indicates that only 41.21% of Health Science students in Ethiopia adhere to Hepatitis B prevention practices. To improve these practices, it is essential to mandate vaccination, provide targeted training on infection prevention, and increase awareness of vaccine uptake. Tailored educational programs should equip students with practical strategies. Additionally, intelligent interventions must address factors influencing preventive practices. Collaboration between institutions and ongoing monitoring is crucial to ensuring success.</p>","author":"Gemeda Wakgari Kitil","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9ccfa396f1bb34fac002562a0309083a9fa8c9b6a4beeac4f0014fab6d09a76e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
