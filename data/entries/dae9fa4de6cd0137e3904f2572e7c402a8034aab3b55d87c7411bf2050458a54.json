{"title":"Nitric oxide, energy, and redox-dependent responses to hypoxia","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/15/4573/7638665?rss=1","date":1711929600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Hypoxia occurs when oxygen levels fall below the levels required for mitochondria to support respiration. Regulated hypoxia is associated with quiescence, particularly in storage organs (seeds) and stem cell niches. In contrast, environmentally induced hypoxia poses significant challenges for metabolically active cells that are adapted to aerobic respiration. The perception of oxygen availability through cysteine oxidases, which function as oxygen-sensing enzymes in plants that control the N-degron pathway, and the regulation of hypoxia-responsive genes and processes is essential to survival. Functioning together with reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), such as nitric oxide (·NO), nitrogen dioxide (·NO<sub>2</sub>), <span>S-</span>nitrosothiols (SNOs), and peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>–</sup>), hypoxia signaling pathways trigger anatomical adaptations such as formation of aerenchyma, mobilization of sugar reserves for anaerobic germination, formation of aerial adventitious roots, and the hyponastic response. NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> participate in local and systemic signaling pathways that facilitate acclimation to changing energetic requirements, controlling glycolytic fermentation, the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt, and amino acid synthesis. NO enhances antioxidant capacity and contributes to the recycling of redox equivalents in energy metabolism through the phytoglobin (Pgb)–NO cycle. Here, we summarize current knowledge of the central role of NO and redox regulation in adaptive responses that prevent hypoxia-induced death in challenging conditions such as flooding.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"dae9fa4de6cd0137e3904f2572e7c402a8034aab3b55d87c7411bf2050458a54","category":"Environment"}
