{"title":"Microbicides for Topical HIV Immunoprophylaxis: Current Status and Future Prospects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1091/v1","date":1715841219000,"content":"Microbicides, topical antiseptic agents, and a revolutionary advance in HIV prevention aim to prevent the entry of infectious agents into the human body, thus stopping the sexual transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Microbicides represent the promise of a new age in preventive measures against one of the world's most pressing health challenges. In addition to their direct antiviral effects during HIV transmission, microbicides also influence vaginal mucosal immunity. This article reviews microbicides by presenting different drug classifications and highlighting significant representatives from each group. It also explains their mechanisms of action and presents information about vaginal mucosal immune responses, emphasizing the critical role they play in responding to HIV during sexual transmission. For each chemical compound, the article provides a brief overview of relevant preclinical and clinical research, emphasizing their potential as microbicides.The article offers insights into the multifaceted impact of microbicides, which signify a pivotal step forward in the pursuit of effective and accessible pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2edc07a52fb2e2de111a9f81ab80b921e142e05ce83920462f2bc938eddffa2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
