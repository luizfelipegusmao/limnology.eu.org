{"title":"Silica-Ti3C2Tx MXene Nanoarchitectures with Simultaneous Adsorption and Photothermal Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0225/v1","date":1717572839000,"content":"Layered Ti3C2Tx MXene has been successfully intercalated and exfoliated with the simultaneous generation of a 3D silica network by treating its cationic surfactant intercalation compound (MXene-CTAB) with an alkoxysilane (TMOS) resulting in a MXene-silica nanoarchitecture that exhibits porosity along with the intrinsic properties of MXene (e.g., photothermal response). The ability of these new materials to produce thermal activation reactions of compounds previously adsorbed on MXene-SiO2 is shown here. For this purpose, the pinacol rearrangement reaction has been selected as a first model example, testing the effectiveness of NIR laser-assisted photothermal irradiation in these processes. This work shows that Ti3C2Tx â€“ based nanoarchitectures open new avenues for applications that rely on the combined properties inherent to their integrated nanocomponents that could be extended to the broader MXene family.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"022dc813a385ec8d34a15b35bd4bd7d1293d8ce99551a751c9270f6bb64c4d54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
