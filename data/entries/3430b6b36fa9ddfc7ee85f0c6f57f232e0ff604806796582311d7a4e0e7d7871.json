{"title":"Impact of Component Quality on Electronic Product Reliability and Environmental Sustainability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2000/v1","date":1724829278000,"content":"The electronics industry is a significant contributor to environmental challenges, generating approximately 50 million tons of electronic waste annually and high levels of carbon dioxide emissions throughout the production and disposal of devices. This paper investigates the interplay between reliability and sustainability by analyzing how degraded components affect the environmental footprint of electronic products. Using a board with 215 components as a baseline, we calculate the mean time between failures (MTBF) and compare it to scenarios involving degraded components. Our findings demonstrate that degraded components can reduce MTBF by up to 50%, resulting in higher failure rates, increased electronic waste, and up to 30% more CO2 emissions due to shortened product lifespans. This study underscores the crucial importance of component quality control in the production process to improve both reliability and sustainability. Additionally, the broader economic and environmental impacts of using unchecked components are highlighted, showing their contribution to elevated failure rates, shortened product lifespans, and an estimated 20% increase in e-waste. By adopting a 100% inspection protocol, leveraging advanced technologies, and enforcing stringent material quality controls, manufacturers can significantly enhance the reliability of electronic products while reducing their environmental impact, thus fostering a more sustainable electronics industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3430b6b36fa9ddfc7ee85f0c6f57f232e0ff604806796582311d7a4e0e7d7871","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
