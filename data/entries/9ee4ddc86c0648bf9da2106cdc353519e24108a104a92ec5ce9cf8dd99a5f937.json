{"title":"Evaluating the Sustainability of Longtime Operating Infrastructure for Romanian Flood Risk Protection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0138/v1","date":1725285839000,"content":"Flood protection infrastructures are crucial for enhancing the resilience of societies exposed to natural hazards. Newly designed infrastructures are evaluated for sustainability using a coherent and internationally recognized method defined by the International Hydropower Association (IHA). However, older structures require a different assessment approach. Popescu et al. (2024) proposed a modified IHA protocol, mHSAP, which identifies opportunities for improvement and develops a sustainability evaluation framework for existing infrastructures. This paper applies the modified protocol to evaluate the sustainability of two types of flood protection structures: a unique canal system for flood-drought protection of an urban area and a flood protection dyke. The time of operation of over 250 years, and respectively over 50 years. The application of the modified framework demonstrates its advantages in identifying areas for improvement in operating the flood protection structure, such that it is maintained sustainable. It also illustrates how Romanian water boards can use such tools to facilitate collaboration between structure owners and stakeholders, allowing them to assess the risks and effects of flooding on society. Potentially water boards, could use the results of the method to account for the effects of climate change and addressing the issue in a coordinated and efficient manner. Through these two examples from Romania, we also show that the mHSAP framework has the potential to actively support the fulfillment of the United Nations Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ee4ddc86c0648bf9da2106cdc353519e24108a104a92ec5ce9cf8dd99a5f937","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
