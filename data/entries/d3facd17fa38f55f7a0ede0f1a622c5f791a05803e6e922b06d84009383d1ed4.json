Nassar, Saif Alislam Alamleh, Abdullah Aboqubo, Abdullah Aljebori</p>\r\nBackground <p>Rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>) has a rich historical use for various reasons due to its beneficial characteristics including stimulating hair growth, providing antioxidant and antibacterial effects, and functioning as a skin conditioner and fragrance enhancer. The plant is cultivated in Jordan and using it is gaining popularity among the population.</p> Aim of the study <p>To assess the knowledge, attitude and perception of rosemary use among Jordanians.</p> Materials and methods <p>A cross-sectional study was conducted targeting at least 385 participants via social media platforms. Face and content validity of the questionnaire was performed by independent researchers. The questionnaire was divided into three main sections including the demographics section, the knowledge section and the attitude toward rosemary use. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS including descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and multiple linear regression.</p> Results <p>The studyâ€™s participants (n = 407) had a mean age of 30.98 years old (SD = 12.76). The mean knowledge score for the participants ranged from -5 to 7, with a mean of 2.96 (SD = 2.61), with younger participants exhibiting higher knowledge scores regarding rosemary. Approximately half of the participants (48.2%) reported using rosemary for medical purposes. About three-quarters reported using rosemary oil, but a higher percentage reported using the leaves. Around three quarters administered it orally or applied it topically. Most participants obtained rosemary by growing it at home or from herbalists. Family and friends were the main influencers for rosemary users. Most of the study participants strongly agreed/agreed that plants possess a healing power (94.4%). The most reported reason for using rosemary was improving the hair condition (82.1%) followed by gastrointestinal problems (67.9%).</p> Conclusions <p>The study highlights the widespread use of rosemary for different reasons through different methods of application. Addressing misconceptions and enhancing knowledge dissemination may allow informed decision-making and promote the safe and effective use of herbal therapies.</p>","author":"Samar Thiab","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d3facd17fa38f55f7a0ede0f1a622c5f791a05803e6e922b06d84009383d1ed4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
