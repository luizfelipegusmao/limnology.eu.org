{"title":"Pharmacovigilance Strategies to Address Resistance to Antibiotics and Inappropriate Use&mdash;A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1967/v1","date":1714456685000,"content":"The spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global challenge. Close and continuous surveillance for quick detection of AMR can be difficult, especially in remote places. This narrative review focuses on the contributions of pharmacovigilance (PV) as an auxiliary tool for identifying and monitoring the ineffectiveness of, resistance to, and inappropriate use of antibiotics (ABs). The terms “drug ineffective,” “therapeutic failure,” “drug resistance,” “pathogen resistance,” and “multidrug resistance” were found in PV databases and dictionnaires, and denote ineffectiveness. These terms cover a range of problems that should be better investigated because they are useful in warning about possible causes of AMR. “Medication errors,” especially those related to dose and indication, are highlighted in the literature, suggesting inappropriate use of ABs. Hence, the included studies show that the terms of interest related to AMR are not only present but frequent in PV surveillance programs. This review illustrates the feasibility of using PV as a complementary tool for antimicrobial stewardship activities, especially in scenarios where other resources are scarce.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec50f59d48dbe90420a7bc94ce5272773f746c484006a8f85676fc13a3ffe4e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
