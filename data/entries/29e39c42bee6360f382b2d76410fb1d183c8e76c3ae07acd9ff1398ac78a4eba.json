{"title":"Online Learning Support as a Pedagogical Strategy for Student Learning in the Developing Universities in South Africa: A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0421/v1","date":1722939446000,"content":"There is limited evidence showing how developing universities in South Africa have successfully adopted and effectively used online learning to support students for positive learning experiences. Presently, there are numerous challenging factors with regards to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) adoption in South African developing universities. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the extent of online learning support for student learning at developing universities in South Africa. The study resides in an interpretive framework from a philosophical perspective as it adopts a hermeneutic framework, with the literature obtained being classified, mapped, critically assessed, and themes and arguments developed. There is scant evidence of studies conducted and published between 2000 and 2024 on online learning support as a pedagogical strategy for student learning in the developing universities in South Africa. The findings resulted in five emerging themes from the literature review. These major themes include lack of ICT governance; poor digital infrastructure; lack of ICT skills; budget constraints; and accessibility and inclusivity challenges. This study is expected to have a significant impact on the development of universities' online learning policies and practices. It will also contribute to the pedagogical strategies and frameworks of academics and scientific knowledge on how scholars should perceive online learning support in the context developing universities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"29e39c42bee6360f382b2d76410fb1d183c8e76c3ae07acd9ff1398ac78a4eba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
