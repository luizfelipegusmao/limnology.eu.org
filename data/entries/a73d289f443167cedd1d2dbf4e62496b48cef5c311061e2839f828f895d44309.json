{"title":"Sustainable Charging Stations for Electric Vehicles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0337/v1","date":1725432229000,"content":"In this work, we develop a detailed analysis of the current panorama for electric vehicle charging technology, focusing on the various levels and types of charging protocols and used connectors. We propose a charging station for electric cars powered by solar photovoltaic energy, performing the analysis of the solar resource in the selected location, sizing the photovoltaic power plant to cover the demand completely, and exploring different configurations such as grid connection or physical and virtual electric energy storage. Despite the current development applying for specific working conditions, operating voltage, charging rate, power demand, etc., the proposed configuration is modular, adaptable, and resilient. The simulated system operates within the 360 V to 800 V range of continuous current for charging the electric vehicles, with a selectable power range between 20 and 180 kW. The basic layout includes four charging poles, each servicing all working voltages. An oversized PV plant powers the charging station at any time of the year, saving money compared to the alternative of the electric storage unit. In addition, we build simulation tools and algorithms that optimize the design of future projects, providing a solid basis for sustainable energy infrastructure planning and design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a73d289f443167cedd1d2dbf4e62496b48cef5c311061e2839f828f895d44309","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
