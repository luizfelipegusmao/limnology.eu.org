{"title":"Numerical Study of Hydrodynamic Characteristics of Three-Dimensional Oscillating Water-Column Wave-Power Device","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0843/v1","date":1718197456000,"content":"The effect of wave forces on the structural safety of fixed oscillating water-column (OWC) devices is critical. In this study, a three-dimensional numerical model of an oscillating water column (OWC) device is constructed using the computational fluid dynamics software OpenFOAM. Subsequently, the hydrodynamic performance of the numerical model is comprehensively validated. Finally, the hydrodynamic performance data are analyzed in detail to obtain meaningful conclusions. The results indicate that the horizontal wave force on the OWC device is approximately 6.6 to 7.9 times greater than the vertical wave force, whereas the lateral wave force is relatively small. Both the horizontal and vertical wave forces decrease as the relative water depth increases under a constant wave period and height. The horizontal wave force increases linearly with the wave height, whereas the vertical wave force increases with the square of the wave height. In addition, the highest dynamic water pressure is observed at the interface between the water surface and device, both within and outside the front wall of the gas chamber. The dynamic water pressure at different locations on the front chamber increases and subsequently decreases as the wave frequency increases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8e80c7741b48bf5b5b7192ecf73558ea796be70b294f9f87559a99eba5e2d49","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
