{"title":"Exploring the Influence of IL-8, IL-10, Patient Reported Pain and Physical Activity on Endometriosis Severity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2067/v1","date":1719613433000,"content":"Endometriosis is known to be a chronic, debilitating disease. The pathophysiological mechanisms of endometriosis development include local chronic inflammation and a certain degree of local immune deficit. We investigated the relationship between the endometriosis severity, IL-8, IL-10, BDNF, VEGF-A serum and tissue levels, patient-related pain, and physical activity in a cohort of 46 patients diagnosed with endometriosis who underwent surgery. The same panel of biomarkers was investigated in a control group of 44 reproductive-aged patients with non-endometriotic gynecological pathology who underwent surgical intervention. Our data show a high statistical significance between tissue expression of IL-8, IL-10, patient-related pain and the severity of endometriosis. No relationship was identified between serum or tissue levels of VEGF-A and BDNF and the severity of endometriosis. These results validate the presence of local chronic inflammation and immune deficit, thereby creating, alongside other studies in the field, an opportunity for the development of innovative and personalized treatment approaches in endometriosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3704dc1ce0f27d1ba8260f4cad7772effc0f5b0cc1458ae5f3614dd6f852bdf0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
