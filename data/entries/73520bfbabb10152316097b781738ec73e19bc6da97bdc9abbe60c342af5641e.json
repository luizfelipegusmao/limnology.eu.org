{"title":"Effectiveness of the Integrated Dengue Education and Learning (iDEAL) module in improving the knowledge, attitude, practice, environmental cleanliness index, and dengue index among schoolchildren: A randomised controlled trial protocol","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302736","date":1714485600000,"content":"<p>by Rahmat Dapari, Kalaivani Muniandy, Ahmad Zaid Fattah Azman, Suhaili Abu Bakar, Mohd Nasir Mohd Desa, Lim Chee Hwa, Sukhvinder Singh Sandhu, Nooreen Farzana Mustapha, Norazman Mohd Rosli, Mohd ‘Ammar Ihsan Ahmad Zamzuri, Mohd Rohaizat Hassan, Nazri Che Dom, Syed Sharizman Syed Abdul Rahim, Balvinder Singh Gill, Nurulhusna Ab Hamid</p>\r\nBackground <p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by four distinct, closely related dengue viruses (DENV). Global dengue incidence has markedly increased in the past decades. The World Health Organization reported that cases increased from 505,430 in 2000 to 5.2 million in 2019. Similarly, the total dengue cases in Malaysia increased from 7,103 in 2000 to a peak of 130,101 in 2019. Knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) remain the most effective dengue prevention and control tools. Furthermore, school-based health education is key to enhancing knowledge and raising awareness of the seriousness of dengue among schoolchildren and transferring knowledge and practice from classrooms to homes. Thus, it is necessary to plan an integrated module for the primary prevention of dengue infection, specifically among schoolchildren.</p> Aims <p>The present study intends to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of a theory-based integrated dengue education and learning (iDEAL) module in improving the KAP, environmental cleanliness index, and dengue index among schoolchildren in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.</p> Methods <p>This study is a single-blinded, cluster randomised controlled trial to be conducted from 1 September 2023 to 31 August 2025. The study will involve 20 primary and 20 secondary schools in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. The 1600 participants will be randomly allocated to intervention and control groups based on selected clusters to avoid contamination. A cluster is a comparable school that fulfils the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The intervention group will receive the iDEAL module, while the control group will receive standard education. The iDEAL module will be developed following a systematic procedure and delivered in-person by trained researchers to the participants. The outcome will be measured using validated, self-administered questionnaires at baseline (T<sub>0</sub>), immediately (T<sub>1</sub>), one month (T<sub>2</sub>), and three months (T<sub>3</sub>) post-intervention to measure the intervention module effectiveness. The data will be analysed using IBM Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 28 and descriptive and inferential statistics. Within-group changes over time will be compared using one-way repeated measure analysis of variance for continuous and normally distributed variables. Within-group analysis of categorical data will use Cochran’s Q test. The main effect and interaction between and within the intervention and control groups at T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>3</sub> will be tested using the generalised linear mixed model (GLMM). Hypothetically, the KAP, environmental cleanliness index, and dengue index among the intervention group will be significantly improved compared to the control group. The hypothesis will be tested using a significance level with a p-value of 0.05 and a confidence interval of 95%.</p> Conclusions <p>The study protocol outlines developing and testing an iDEAL module for schoolchildren in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, with no socio-demographic differences expected. The intervention aims to improve KAP, environmental cleanliness index, and dengue index, potentially reducing dengue risk. Results could inform public health policies, emphasizing school-based interventions’ importance in combating diseases like dengue.</p>","author":"Rahmat Dapari","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"73520bfbabb10152316097b781738ec73e19bc6da97bdc9abbe60c342af5641e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
