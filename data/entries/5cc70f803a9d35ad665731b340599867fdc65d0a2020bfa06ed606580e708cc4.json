{"title":"Three-Dimensional Finite Element Analysis of Stress Distribution in Dental Implant Prosthesis and Surrounding Bone Using PEEK Abutments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0080/v1","date":1719885656000,"content":"(1) Background: This study aimed to compare the effect of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and titanium abutments on implant prosthetic systems and supporting bone using three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA); (2) Methods: A three-dimensional finite element analysis was conducted using CATIA and Abaqus software to model mandibular first molar implant systems with titanium and PEEK abutments. Under external loading conditions, finite element analysis was conducted for the stresses in implant components and surrounding bones of each group; (3) Results: The implant fixture of the PEEK model exhibited the highest von Mises stress (VMS). The lowest VMS was observed in the abutment screw of the titanium model. Both implant systems demonstrated similar stress distribution and magnitudes in cortical and cancellous bones; (4) Conclusion: PEEK abutments show similar stress distribution in surrounding bone compared to titanium. However, PEEK absorbs the stresses within the implant system and exhibits the highest VMS values due to its low mechanical and physical properties. Therefore, PEEK abutments need improved mechanical properties for better clinical application.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5cc70f803a9d35ad665731b340599867fdc65d0a2020bfa06ed606580e708cc4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
