{"title":"Investigating Hydrological Drought Characteristics and Different Return Periods in Semi-Arid Regions under CMIP5 Climate Change Scenarios","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0567/v1","date":1723111549000,"content":"This study analyzes future hydrological droughts in LCKW using the SWAT model and data from 2010-2021, evaluating the Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) for 5, 10, 25, and 50-year return periods (RP) for 2029 and 2039 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The model shows high accuracy (R² = 0.82, NSE = 0.78). Under RCP4.5, streamflow may increase by 34.74% and 18.74%, while RCP8.5 predicts significant decreases of 37.06% and 55.84%. Historical data reveal frequent short-term droughts during SDI-3, notably in 2014–2016 and 2020–2021, with SDI-6 indicating less frequent but severe droughts, especially in 2015 and 2020. Future projections under RCP8.5 suggest wors-ening drought conditions in 2029 and 2039, with critical drought periods from January to April and November. Wavelet analysis indicates a high risk of severe hydrological drought in LCKW due to low annual recurrence rates, with the highest drought severity over a 50-year RP. The study high-lights an increasing likelihood of frequent and severe droughts, particularly under high emission scenarios such as RCP8.5, which could result in significant water shortages and ecosystem disrup-tions. It emphasizes the significance of adaptive water resource management strategies in mitigating negative impacts on water security and ecosystem health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"265defa204716d5c7396ac01da46f59b28483e6e8c5d1433a20078957862ef7a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
