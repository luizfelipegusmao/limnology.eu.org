{"title":"Performance analysis of an advanced concentrated solar power system for environmental benefit: energy and exergy analysis","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13762-023-05442-2","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>In this work, the cross-linear system, a recently developed concentrated solar power technology, is investigated for process heat application to mitigate the drawback of cosine loss at higher latitudes in current concentrated solar power technologies. The mathematical model for energy and exergy analysis has been developed and validated using computational analysis and experimental work previously performed. The simulation was conducted under the average direct normal irradiance of 756.47 W/m<sup>2</sup> considered for 8 h (Sunny hours) for April 2017. The primary goal of the thermal investigation is to identify the optimal inlet parameters for the heat transfer fluid (HTF) while considering significant value of HTF outlet temperature, energy, and exergy efficiency of the receiver. The mathematical model is developed and simulated using Engineering Equation Solver software. Following an in-depth examination of the outcome, the optimum inlet HTF temperature and mass flow rate are established with noteworthy energy and exergy efficiency. The analysis demonstrates the utilisation of the cross-linear system for process heat applications at higher latitude locations (&gt; 30°N) to circumvent the weakness of other existing concentrated solar power technologies due to the air’s wide operating temperature range as HTF. The observed results show that this system provides hot air from 180 °C to 200 °C at a thermal efficiency of 45% −50% and exergy efficiency from 25% to 30% for the low inlet temperature of 60 °C to 100 °C. Even at higher latitudes (&gt; 30°N), the cosine effect of 0.9 for 4 h duration is a unique advantage of this system.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"bd5a8bca78533f3a9b2711b0cc39295f067cf3fed56a6be08bef9336de5ba9c7","category":"Environment"}
