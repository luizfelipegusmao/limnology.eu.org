{"title":"Correction of Rectal Prolapse in an Infant through Anterior Ventral Rectopexy Laparoscopic in an Infant: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1753/v1","date":1721711310000,"content":"Background: Rectal prolapse is usually self-limiting in early childhood. Laparoscopic rectopexy has become a safe and effective method for treating children with rectal prolapse recurrence, especially those older than 4 years of age. We present the clinical case of an infant with recurrent rectal prolapse and secondary complications. The infant required surgical intervention with laparoscopic rectopexy after the failure of conservative management. Case presentation: A 2-year- and 7-month-old infant with a 15-month history of rectal prolapse who did not respond to conservative management developed bloody diarrhea, intestinal infection and electrolyte imbalance. Laparoscopic surgical correction was performed via anterior ventral rectopexy, and the results were satisfactory. Conclusion: Infants with recurrent rectal prolapse and associated complications who do not respond to conservative measures may benefit from laparoscopic rectopexy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c51fca7b6206f1480871a4bb8734a945a8794432f52a4f94c5fddb3599880400","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
