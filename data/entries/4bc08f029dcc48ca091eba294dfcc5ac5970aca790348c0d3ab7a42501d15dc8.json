{"title":"Sustainable Mobility in the Century of Metropolises: Case Study of Greater London","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0731/v1","date":1725962769000,"content":"The 20th century, known as the \"metropolitan century,\" saw urban populations exceed half the global populace. By 2035, emerging metropolises, particularly in Asia and Africa, highlight the urgent need for research on urban growth, demographics, and mobility's role in sustainable development. This study explores the multifaceted aspects of mobility essential for sustaining metropolitan regions, examining stakeholders' perspectives through a detailed analysis of interview data. Responses are aligned with convergent subcategories derived from classical urban theories and contemporary metropolitan studies, encompassing territorial aspects, scale, place, urbanization, economy, culture, identity, innovation, networks, climate change, and foresight. The findings highlight the intricate interplay of governance, infrastructure, and socio-spatial dynamics in Greater London, underscoring the imperative for sustainable mobility and inclusive planning that integrates environmental concerns into metropolitan life. This research, through a convergent analysis of interviewees' responses, has identified thirty-one fundamental attributes to enhance our understanding of mobility within metropolitan areas, with a particular focus on the case study of Greater London. Future research directions include extending this framework to other metropolises and a deeper exploration of the attributes identified in London, employing both qualitative and quantitative methods to enrich our understanding of urban sustainability and mobility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4bc08f029dcc48ca091eba294dfcc5ac5970aca790348c0d3ab7a42501d15dc8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
