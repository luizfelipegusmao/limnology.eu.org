{"title":"TheEffect of Different Soil Parameters on the Germination Of New Grass Species Applicable to Urban Environments. Germination of Festuca Taxa Under Greenhouse Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0364/v1","date":1720077231000,"content":"This survey is part of a Hungarian Research OTKA project that examines the vegetation of sandy grasslands along the Danube. During this study, two grass species, Festuca wagneri and Festuca tomanii, were identified as potentially suitable for urban planting and turf establishment based on preliminary research. Our aim was to determine the germination success of seeds from aesthetically selected individuals and to identify the soil types on which they germinate most effectively. This information could be crucial for future cultivation efforts.\nFrom the collected Festuca individuals, were analyzed 30 specimens of each taxon under garden conditions and selected the indi-viduals for germination. The Festuca tomanii individuals were uniform, so we selected only 5 individuals. The Festuca wagneri individuals were categorized into three groups: upright, spreading, and low types. \nIt was assumed that Festuca species seeds would germinate better in sandy soils. To test this, seeds from ten Festuca wagneri and five Festuca tomanii individuals, selected based on aesthetic criteria, were sown in six different substrates: a sand-peat mixture, sand, coconut fiber, peat, a coconut fiber-sand mixture, and native sandy soil. Contrary to expectations, the growth and germination rates of seeds sown in peat and coconut fiber substrates were higher than those in native sandy soil.\nThese results suggest that Festuca seeds germinate better on substrates resembling dead plant debris with a peat-like structure or on the surface of live mosses, rather than on bare sand.\nAmong the examined individuals, the seeds from the spreading Festuca wagneri group exhibited the highest germination rate, making this group particularly suitable for urban environments. Addi-tionally, one of the upright Festuca wagneri individuals showed the highest growth rate and should also be considered for urban planting. In contrast, despite their uniform appearance, the Festuca tomanii individuals did not demonstrate similar germination trends. In fact, the seeds from two clumps did not germinate at all, indicating that further selection is necessary.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d0b276e325c9c7cc07ca43c803cd73d18294939997c46c5a65df81112dbdc20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
