{"title":"Experience-dependent serotonergic signaling in glia regulates targeted synapse elimination","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002822","date":1727791200000,"content":"<p>by Vanessa Kay Miller, Kendal Broadie</p>\r\n\r\nThe optimization of brain circuit connectivity based on initial environmental input occurs during critical periods characterized by sensory experience-dependent, temporally restricted, and transiently reversible synapse elimination. This precise, targeted synaptic pruning mechanism is mediated by glial phagocytosis. Serotonin signaling has prominent, foundational roles in the brain, but functions in glia, or in experience-dependent brain circuit synaptic connectivity remodeling, have been relatively unknown. Here, we discover that serotonergic signaling between glia is essential for olfactory experience-dependent synaptic glomerulus pruning restricted to a well-defined <i>Drosophila</i> critical period. We find that experience-dependent serotonin signaling is restricted to the critical period, with both (1) serotonin production and (2) 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors specifically in glia, but not neurons, absolutely required for targeted synaptic glomerulus pruning. We discover that glial 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor signaling limits the experience-dependent synaptic connectivity pruning in the critical period and that conditional reexpression of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors within adult glia reestablishes “critical period-like” experience-dependent synaptic glomerulus pruning at maturity. These results reveal an essential requirement for glial serotonergic signaling mediated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors for experience-dependent synapse elimination.","author":"Vanessa Kay Miller","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"d1c106640fc3a39792eb2e66823992a36f3a3a7f2e2ebdb45f05c15a953ee9e8","category":"Environment"}
