{"title":"Abiotic drivers of the space use and activity of gray reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos in a dynamic tidal environment","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15825?af=R","date":1717044224000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Predators display rhythms in behavior and habitat use, often with the goal of maximizing foraging success. The underlying mechanisms behind these rhythms are generally linked to abiotic conditions related to diel, lunar, or seasonal cycles. To understand their effects on the space use, activity, and swimming depth of gray reef sharks (<i>Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos</i>), we tagged 38 individuals with depth and accelerometer sensors in a French Polynesian atoll channel exposed to strong tidal flow, and monitored them over a year. <i>C. amblyrhynchos</i> used a larger space during nighttime and were more active at night and during outgoing currents. Shark activity also peaked during the full and new moons. The swimming depth of sharks was mostly influenced by diel cycles, with sharks swimming deeper during the day compared to nighttime. The dynamic energyscape may promote the emergence of discrete behavioral strategies in reef sharks that use the south channel of Fakarava for resting and foraging purposes. Turbulence imposed by outgoing tides induces additional foraging cost on sharks, shifting their hunting areas to the southern part of the channel, where turbulence is less pronounced. Understanding when and where sharks are active and foraging is important for our understanding of predator–prey dynamics and ecosystem dynamics. This study highlights how abiotic rhythms in a highly dynamic environment likely generate spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the distribution of predation pressure.</p>","author":"Anaïs Laurioux, \nCharlie Huveneers, \nYannis Papastamatiou, \nSerge Planes, \nLaurent Ballesta, \nJohann Mourier","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"b8263fc4cf2600867fd7d57bf7f7470e01f4c8cd9b687dc80157dd96b19aa4c4","category":"Environment"}
