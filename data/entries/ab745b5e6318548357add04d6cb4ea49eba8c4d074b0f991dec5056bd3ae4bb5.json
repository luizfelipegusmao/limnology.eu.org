{"title":"Linking crustacean life history to fishery management controls and reference points","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12691?af=R","date":1720969370000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Management of crustacean fisheries is often data-limited, and techniques used in finfish fisheries are often inappropriate for crustaceans due to life-history differences. Limitations in modeling capacity and data availability make it difficult to determine the status of crustacean stocks using model-based biological reference points (BRPs), but BRPs are a key component of successful fisheries management. Using crustacean fishery case studies depicting model-based and empirical management strategies, we synthesized the current state of crustacean fisheries management with respect to data availability and use of management controls. Input and output controls can be successful with supplemental BRPs, but whatever methods are used must explicitly consider species' unique life-history characteristics. In data-limited fisheries, output controls can effectively conserve a species under high levels of exploitation. Implementation of discrete BRPs can improve sustainability of both emerging and data-rich crustacean fisheries, to make these quantitative metrics a valuable tool for crustacean management globally.</p>","author":"Nathaniel Willse, \nClaire Ober, \nHsiao‚ÄêYun Chang, \nHarlisa Harlisa, \nTri Ernawati, \nDuranta D.
