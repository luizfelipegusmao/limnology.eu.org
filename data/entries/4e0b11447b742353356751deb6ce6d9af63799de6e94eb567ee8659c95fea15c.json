{"title":"Whakamana te tangata – ka whai oranga te taiao: Indigenous led approaches for catchment health in Aotearoa-New Zealand","link":"https://journals.plos.org/water/article?id=10.1371/journal.pwat.0000170","date":1703858400000,"content":"<p>by Shaun Awatere, Garth Harmsworth, Nikki Harcourt, Yvonne Taura, Lara Taylor, Mahuru Wilcox, Jade Hyslop</p>\r\n\r\nLarge-scale transformation and modification of landscapes have occurred across most catchments in Aotearoa-New Zealand (A-NZ) in the past 200-years (mainly mid-1800s to mid- 1900s). This has been mainly through large-scale removal of indigenous forest and draining of wetlands to a landscape dominated by urban settlement and highly modified landscapes. The expansive shift to pastoral farming and urban settlement, under a colonial settlement vision has increasingly led to detrimental cumulative impacts on ecological health. Environmental decline has been tightly linked to significant adverse impacts on Māori (the Indigenous people of A-NZ) wellbeing. For Māori, this has been out of balance and step with an indigenous-based vision of A-NZ. To understand how a Māori worldview can help drive transformation in the health of our catchments and their communities, we argue that an Ao Māori (Māori worldview) framing for catchment management is necessary with reference to three catchment case studies (Kaipara, Waikato, and Waiapu). These case studies were chosen because they provide tangible examples of resurgence in the use and understanding of mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) next to co-governance, co-management, and decision-making. In the Kaipara, the collaborative governance model ensured that all parties’ views were understood and factored into decision making and this has led to growing social equity and more sustainable relationships with the whenua. Similarly, in the Waikato, co-governance of the waterways has increased the efficiency and effectiveness of the process. Knowledge sharing and engagement has directly driven positive environmental outcomes. So too for the Waiapu, where increased hapū/iwi capability and capacity has increased social cohesion and implementation of targeted actions to mitigate climate change impacts. We explore how by adopting a holistic approach to environmental stewardship, and having intimate knowledge at place, Māori thinking has the potential to rejuvenate environmental management, emphasising the necessity of partnership-based approaches.","author":"Shaun Awatere","siteTitle":"PLOS Water","siteHash":"76ba47a8597c89f4cf217272433133ba8aa6d0dba9c907d21e63f90c34e21e00","entryHash":"4e0b11447b742353356751deb6ce6d9af63799de6e94eb567ee8659c95fea15c","category":"Environment"}
