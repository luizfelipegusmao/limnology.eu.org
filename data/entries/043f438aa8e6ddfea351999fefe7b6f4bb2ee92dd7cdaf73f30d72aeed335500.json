Current trends prefer autochthonous bacteria as potential probiotic candidates owing to their adaptability and capacity to effectively colonize the host's intestine, which can enhance production performance and bolster disease resistance. The objective of this study was to isolate an autochthonous bacterium as probiotic for hybrid catfish. Initially, an analysis of the intestinal microbiota of hybrid catfish reared in earthen ponds was conducted for subsequent probiotic development. Twenty lactic acid bacteria were isolated from the digesta of overperforming catfish, and most of the candidates demonstrated probiotic traits, including proteolytic and lipolytic abilities; antagonistic inhibition of catfish enteric bacterial pathogens, negative haemolytic activity and antibiotic susceptibility. Subsequent to this screening process, an isolate of <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> (MA5) was deemed the most promising probiotic candidate. In silico analyses were conducted, and several potential probiotic functions were predicted, including essential amino acids and vitamin synthesis. Moreover, genes for three bacteriocins, lactococcin A, enterolysin A and sactipeptide BmbF, were identified. Lastly, various protectant media for lyophilization of MA5 were assessed. These findings suggest that <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> MA5 can be an autochthonous probiotic from hybrid catfish, holding promise to be further tested in feeding trials.</p>","author":"Jing Huang, \nHeather R.
