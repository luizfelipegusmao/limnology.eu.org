Modlesky</p>\r\nObjective <p>To determine if estimates of functional muscle strength from a novel progressive lateral-step-up test (LSUT) are feasible, reliable, and related to physical activity in children with cerebral palsy (CP).</p> Design <p>Cross-sectional; test-retest reliability Subjects/Patients: Children with CP and typically developing control children (n = 45/group).</p> Methods <p>An LSUT with 10, 15, and 20 cm step heights was completed. It was repeated 4 weeks later in 20 children with CP. A composite score of LSUT was calculated based on the step height and number of repetitions completed. Physical activity was assessed using monitors worn on the ankle and hip.</p> Results <p>Only 4 (13%) of the children with CP were unable to complete a lateral step-up repetition without assistance. All children were able to complete at least 1 repetition with assistance, though more than twice as many children with CP required assistance at 15 and 20 cm step heights than at the 10 cm step height (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Children with CP had 59 to 63% lower LSUT performance, 37% lower physical activity assessed at the ankle, and 22% lower physical activity assessed at the hip than controls (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). The intra-class correlation coefficient ranged from 0.91 to 0.96 for LSUT performance at the different step heights and was 0.97 for the composite score. All LSUT performance measures were positively related to ankle physical activity in children with CP (<i>r</i> range = 0.43 to 0.47, all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Only performance at 20 cm and the composite score were positively related to hip physical activity (<i>r</i> = 0.33 and 0.31, respectively, both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The relationship between the LSUT performance and physical activity at both the ankle and hip increased when age and sex were statistically controlled (model <i>r</i> range = 0.55 to 0.60, all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p> Conclusion <p>Estimates of functional muscle strength from a novel progressive LSUT are feasible, reliable, and positively related to physical activity in children with CP.</p>","author":"Trevor Batson","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b61a3f819bbad8452081eab4ac53bd6cd2a21b431e0448f266e2f567c1cad317","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
