{"title":"Evolving HPC Data Centers with Kubernetes, Performance Analysis, and Dynamic Workload Placement Based on ML Scheduling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0074/v1","date":1717636832000,"content":"In the past twenty years, the IT industry has moved away from using physical servers for workload management to workloads consolidated via virtualization and, in the next iteration, further consolidated into containers. In the next step, container workloads based on Docker and Podman as underlying container technologies were orchestrated/automated via Kubernetes or OpenShift. On the other hand, high-performance computing (HPC) environments have been lagging in that process, as there’s still much work to figure out how to apply containerization platforms for HPC in real-life scenarios. Kubernetes and OpenShift have many advantages – generally speaking, container technologies use quite a bit less overhead from the computing perspective while providing many benefits in flexibility, modularity, and maintenance. Therefore, they are ideal for tasks requiring a lot of computing power. There are also some tradeoffs regarding the complexity of these two platforms - they’re just not that user-friendly when used by people without years of experience managing them. In this paper, we propose a different architecture based on seamless hardware integration and user-friendly, dynamic workload placement based on real-time performance analysis and prediction coupled with Machine Learning-based scheduling.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b5a9b979683934cd547749a0b6c7d956a843d16407ffa08969ea040853809dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
