{"title":"Mueller Matrix Polarizing Power","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1399/v1","date":1711182988000,"content":"The transformation of the states of polarization of electromagnetic waves that interact with polarimetrically linear media can be represented by means of the associated Mueller matrix. A global measure of the ability of a linear medium to modify the states of polarization of incident waves, due to any combination of enpolarizing, depolarizing and retarding properties, is introduced as a distance of the Mueller matrix to the identity matrix. This new descriptor, called the polarizing power, is applicable to any Mueller matrix and can be expressed as a function of the degree of polarimetric purity and the trace of the Mueller matrix. The graphical representation of the feasible values of the polarizing power provides a general view of its main peculiarities and features. The values of the polarizing power for several typical devices are analyzed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"65510121917b81eeb88089cf1c3ca6faa13962fc85f031adabe93939c6b563fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
