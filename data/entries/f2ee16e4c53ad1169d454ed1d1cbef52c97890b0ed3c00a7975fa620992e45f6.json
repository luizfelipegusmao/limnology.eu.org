{"title":"New Infinite Classes for Normal Trimagic Squares of Even Orders Using Row-Square Magic Rectangles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0687/v1","date":1710228456000,"content":"As matrix representations of magic labelings of related hypergraphs, magic squares and their various variants have been applied to many domains. Among various subclasses, trimagic squares have been investigated for over a hundred years. The existence problem for trimagic squares with singly even orders and orders 16n has been solved completely. However, very little is known for the existence of trimagic squares with other even orders except for the only three examples and three families. We construct normal trimagic squares by using product constructions, row-square magic rectangles, and trimagic pairs of orthogonal diagonal Latin squares. We give a new product construction: For positive integers p, q, and r having the same parity other than 1, 2, 3, 6, if normal p × q and r × q row-square magic rectangles exist, then a normal trimagic square with order pqr exists. As its application, we construct normal trimagic squares of orders 8q^3 and 8pqr for all odd integers q not less than 7 and p,r ∈ {7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37}. Our construction can easily be extended to construct multimagic squares.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f2ee16e4c53ad1169d454ed1d1cbef52c97890b0ed3c00a7975fa620992e45f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
