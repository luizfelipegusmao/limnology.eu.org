{"title":"Real-Time Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 Variants in Oklahoma Wastewater through Allele-Specific RT-qPCR","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0600/v1","date":1725864154000,"content":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater surveillance was used to monitor community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As new genetic variants emerged, the need for timely identification of these variants in wastewater became an important focus. In response to increased reports of Omicron transmission across the United States, the Oklahoma Wastewater Surveillance team utilized allele-specific RT-qPCR assays to detect and differentiate variants, such as Omicron, from other variants found in wastewater in Oklahoma. The PCR assays showed presence of the Omicron variant in Oklahoma on average two weeks before official reports, which was confirmed through genomic sequencing of selected wastewater samples. Through continued surveillance from November 2021 to January 2022, we also demonstrated the transition from prevalence of the Delta variant to prevalence of the Omicron variant in local communities. We further assessed how this transition correlated with certain demographic factors characterizing each community. Our results highlight RT-qPCR assays as a rapid, simple and cost-effective method for monitoring community spread of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants in wastewater. Additionally, they demonstrate that specific demographic factors such as ethnic composition and household income can correlate with the timing of SARS-CoV-2 variant introduction and spread.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00a68026c74c230cb1c1cdae015eca6c036e3e9badab64d663027254b8379f11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
