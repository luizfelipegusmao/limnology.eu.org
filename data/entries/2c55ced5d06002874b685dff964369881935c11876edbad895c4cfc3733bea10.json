{"title":"Comparing High-Dose PPI Intravenous Infusion and Oral Acid Pump Inhibitors After Endoscopic Therapy for Bleeding Peptic Ulcers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0573/v1","date":1715238954000,"content":"This mini-review explores the comparative efficacy, safety, and clinical outcomes of high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) intravenous infusion versus oral acid pump inhibitor therapy following endoscopic treatment for bleeding peptic ulcers. Recent evidence suggests that intravenous PPIs can significantly reduce the rebleeding rates within the critical first 72 hours post-intervention, with a noted rebleeding rate of 6% compared to 14% in patients receiving oral Vonoprazan (VPZ) therapy. Additionally, the rapid onset of action associated with intravenous administration leads to faster stabilization of vital signs and a reduced need for subsequent blood transfusions. Safety profiles for both intravenous and oral VPZ were favourable, with minimal adverse effects, the most common being transient headaches.However, the findings from our single-centre study with a moderate sample size prompt consideration of more extensive, multicentre trials to enhance the generalizability of the results. Current limitations include potential biases, short-term focus, missing data issues, and a need for long-term outcome data, necessitating further research. Future studies should also explore the cost-effectiveness of intravenous versus oral VPZ and the impact on patient quality of life and long-term mortality rates.This review underscores the importance of tailored PPI therapy in managing bleeding peptic ulcers post-endoscopy. It suggests a potentially pivotal role for intravenous PPIs in high-risk patient groups, advocating for a shift towards more aggressive and immediate care protocols in specific clinical settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c55ced5d06002874b685dff964369881935c11876edbad895c4cfc3733bea10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
