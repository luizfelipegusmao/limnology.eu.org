{"title":"Clinical Outcomes and Prognostic Factors in Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitors Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0339/v1","date":1720007956000,"content":"We conducted a retrospective evaluation of the clinical outcomes and prognostic factors in patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) treated with first-line androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) in real-world clinical practice in Japan. Between 2012 and 2023, a total of 127 consecutive patients with nmCRPC received ARSI treatment. Overall survival (OS), metastatic-free survival (MFS), and prostate-specific antigen progression–free survival (PSA-PFS) from ARSI initiation were assessed using Kaplan–Meier methodology. Clinical factors associated with OS in nmCRPC were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Among the patients, 72, 26, 12, and 17 received enzalutamide (ENZ), abiraterone (ABI), apalutamide (APA), and darolutamide (DARO) as first-line therapy. The median OS and MFS for all patients were 79.0 and 42.0 months, respectively. Median PSA-PFS was 27.0, 20.0, 10.0, and 14.0 months for patients treated with ENZ, ABI, APA, and DARO, respectively (p = 0.33). Multivariate analysis revealed that a baseline PSA level ≥3.67 ng/ml at ARSI initiation was significantly associated with poorer OS (p = 0.002). ARSI demonstrated favorable efficacy in nmCRPC patients. There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes among different types of ARSI therapy for nmCRP. Elevated baseline PSA at ARSI initiation was significantly associated with poorer OS.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d958c22f01469ed22250dd51f1b95bc038c61f8ccbf83d7468f4efbd8a8d4df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
