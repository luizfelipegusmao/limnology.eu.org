{"title":"Technical Fouls Effect on Momentum Change: Does the Season (Regular vs. Playoffs) Matter?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0941/v1","date":1726193748000,"content":"In a follow-up to Tenenbaum et al.â€™s (2024) study we explored differences in momentum shift between regular season and playoff matchups, considering home vs. away games and score at the time of the technical foul call (leading or trailing). Analyzing 4,196 cases of technical fouls (TFs) against coaches from 2000-2021 (3,950 in the regular season, 246 in playoffs), logistic regression revealed a significant (p &lt; .03) season by location interaction showing that in the regular season, home games TFs resulted in a 44%-win rate versus 28% in away games. In the playoffs, this changed to 50% at home and 23% away. The findings provide insights and practical considerations for the TF-momentum shift phenomenon.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"54b826fb3e9c3954a4856a1da50dcb78e0a6c110a511a70dc22b9c4cbd7a30a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
