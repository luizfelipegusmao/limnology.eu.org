Microplastics may cause chronic inflammation in relation to their permanent structures, especially through oxidative stress and cytotoxic cellular damage, which could increase the risk of cancer development. The accumulation of microplastics in the liver is a major concern, and therefore, the identification of the mechanisms of their hepatotoxic effects is of great importance. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is a widely used thermoplastic. It has been determined that PMMA disrupts lipid metabolism in the liver in various aquatic organisms and causes reproductive and developmental toxicity. PMMA-induced hepatotoxic effects in humans have not yet been clarified. In our study, the toxic effects of PMMA (in the range of 3–10 μm) on the human liver were investigated using the HepG2/THP-1 macrophage co-culture model, which is a sensitive immune-mediated liver injury model. Cellular uptake of micro-sized PMMA in the cells was done by transmission electron microscopy. Determination of its effects on cell viability and inflammatory response, oxidative stress, along with gene and protein expression levels that play a role in the mechanism pathways underlying the effects were investigated. The results concluded that inflammation, oxidative stress, and disruptions in lipid metabolism should be the focus of attention as important underlying causes of PMMA-induced hepatotoxicity. Our study, which points out the potential adverse effects of microplastics on human health, supports the literature information on the subject.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"41a836fc9029edea3b327b9c94515421779a19f344e059e0203dd2a439934dd9","category":"Environment"}
