{"title":"Entanglement Swapping Schemes on Intraparticle Entangled States","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1512/v1","date":1716460149000,"content":"Entanglement is one of the most striking features in quantum systems. Today, quantum entanglement plays a vital role in quantum technology, the non-classical correlation of quantum entanglement is an important resource for quantum communication and quantum computing. Entanglement can be divided into two categories: between multi-particle systems and between various degrees of freedom in a single-particle system (intraparticle entangled states). This work first analogized the distinctions and connections between two kinds of entangled states. Then it designed three types of entanglement-swapping methods based on Bell state joint measurement, cross-Kerr medium, and linear optical elements for intraparticle entangled states by analogizing the entanglement swapping between multiple particles. Intraparticle entanglement swapping can be applied in super quantum dense encoding, quantum information transmission, and quantum teleportation. This work is beneficial for promoting the development of quantum information technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4780b620c69d83cce6f97a3227b2072f8892078a33e197df0e9e1a1d5a2a7019","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
