A case study of Irish Sea plaice Pleuronectes platessa Linnaeus, 1758","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15912?af=R","date":1724477320000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Adult plaice in the Irish Sea have distinct traits that reflect the spawning locations that could suggest a number of different populations. However, do connectivity pathways support this concept? Different tools are directed at measuring exchange or connectivity between different life-history stages, and the challenge is to integrate the signals to obtain full life-cycle estimates. Collectively, the different methods reveal stable connectivity between known spawning and nursery grounds, with sufficient exchange to maintain a single population with weak genetic structure.</p>","author":"Audrey J.
