{"title":"The Effectiveness of Generic Piperacillin/Tazobactam in Managing Gram-Negative Bacillary Bacteremia in Adult Patients at a Tertiary Care Hospital","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0045/v1","date":1717398007000,"content":"Background: Gram-negative bacteremia, especially from Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, poses a significant public health threat due to multidrug resistance and high mortality rates. Cost-effective treatments are essential in low-middle income countries as Colombia. Methods: This descriptive, phase IV study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Colombia. Adult patients with Gram-negative bacteremia treated with generic piperacillin/tazobactam (PenibactamÂ®) were evaluated. Clinical and microbiological responses were assessed over 12 months. Results: The study included 30 critically ill patients with an average APACHE II score of 22.12. The clinical response at day 7 was 66% (n = 20), and the microbiological response was 56.7% (n = 17). By the end of follow-up, clinical improvement was observed in 63.3% (n = 19), with a mortality rate of 23% (n = 7). The cardiovascular system was the most common infection site. Conclusions: Generic piperacillin/tazobactam demonstrated effectiveness and safety comparable to existing literature in treating Gram-negative bacteremia, offering a viable, cost-effective alternative for critically ill patients in real-world settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd84facd8a8185b445587dbd4e876a82ffcbf010493f8c3214aa38cfd58c8574","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
