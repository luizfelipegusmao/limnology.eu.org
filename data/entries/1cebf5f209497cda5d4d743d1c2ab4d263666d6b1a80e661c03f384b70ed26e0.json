{"title":"Epithelia of the Penile Urethra","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0042/v1","date":1727771876000,"content":"Objectives: The male urethra is a complex structure that plays a critical role in genitourinary health and function. Despite its importance, histological descriptions of the penile urethra, par-ticularly its epithelial components, remain incomplete. This study offers a comprehensive his-tological analysis of the penile urethra, focusing on the epithelium across distinct anatomical regions, including the glans, distal and proximal fossa navicularis, and spongy urethra. Meth-ods: Utilizing four human penile specimens, we employed various staining techniques to eluci-date the structural characteristics of these epithelial tissues. Results: Our findings reveal notable variations in epithelial composition, such as the presence of glycogen-rich cells in the distal fos-sa navicularis and the presence of mucous glands in the spongy urethra and proximal fossa na-vicularis. Additionally, we identified a previously underreported valvule-like structure in the distal fossa navicularis in two of the specimens. Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the histological organization of the penile urethra, offering critical reference data that can enhance our understanding of urethral pathologies and improve the outcomes of surgical inter-ventions, particularly in the context of tissue engineering and reconstructive surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1cebf5f209497cda5d4d743d1c2ab4d263666d6b1a80e661c03f384b70ed26e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
