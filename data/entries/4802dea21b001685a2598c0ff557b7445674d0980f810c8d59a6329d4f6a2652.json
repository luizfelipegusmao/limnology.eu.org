{"title":"Workersâ€™ Exposure to Chemical Risk in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: Assessment Methodology and Field Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0704/v1","date":1720504719000,"content":"This study aimed to develop a state-of-the-art method for assessing chemical risks. The method combined desk research findings and the authors' practical knowledge to identify the major shortcomings in performing risk assessments at the workplace. Data were collected from nine SMEs across three sectors: agriculture, laboratory research, and conservation and restoration laboratories. The results of the discussions with the workers and on-site observations were used to develop the method to assess chemical risks. The method uses numerical factors to account for the level of conformity and the duration of exposure to support an estimation of the probability of an incident. The developed method was designed to enhance risk assessment practices and tackle common issues encountered by enterprises, including SMEs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4802dea21b001685a2598c0ff557b7445674d0980f810c8d59a6329d4f6a2652","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
