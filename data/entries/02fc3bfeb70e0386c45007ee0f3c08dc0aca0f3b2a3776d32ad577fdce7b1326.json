{"title":"Clinician’s perspectives on gene therapy for Alzheimer’s disease: A qualitative study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307567","date":1721311200000,"content":"<p>by Lilly Kelemen, Ishika Gupta, Zollie Yavarow, Samantha I. Smith, Kim G. Johnson, Nathan A. Boucher</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>We aimed to understand clinician views regarding gene therapy as a future treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and potential barriers and facilitators to its use.</p> Methods <p>We interviewed ten clinicians who treat patients with AD. Clinicians helped design a semi-structured interview including the following domains: establishing understanding, cost/access, quality of life, and religion/spirituality. Transcripts were analyzed by a coding team using descriptive content analysis with inductive approach.</p> Results <p>Clinicians identified three main areas of concern: 1) potential clinician and patient understanding of gene therapy and Alzheimer’s disease 2) consideration of inequity (i.e., care access, disease awareness along with education level, family support, trust in care systems); and 3) considerations in decision-making (i.e., religious/spiritual beliefs and method of treatment delivery as a decision-making tools).</p> Discussion and conclusion <p>Findings highlight areas for knowledge-building for patients and clinicians alike. Clinicians must be aware of patient/family educational needs and gaps in their own clinical knowledge before engaging patients/families with new technology. Allowing time for questions is crucial to building rapport and trust.</p>","author":"Lilly Kelemen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"02fc3bfeb70e0386c45007ee0f3c08dc0aca0f3b2a3776d32ad577fdce7b1326","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
