{"title":"Non‐volatile and volatile compound changes in blueberry juice inoculated with different lactic acid bacteria strains","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13142?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Lactic acid bacteria (LABs) are widely present in foods and affect the flavour of fermented cultures. This study investigates the effects of fermentation with <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i> JYLA-16 (<i>La</i>), <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> JYLP-375 (<i>Lp</i>), and <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> JYLR-005 (<i>Lr</i>) on the flavour profile of blueberry juice.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>This study showed that all LABs strains preferentially used glucose rather than fructose as the carbon source during fermentation. Lactic acid was the main fermentation product, reaching 7.76 g L<sup>−1</sup> in <i>La</i>-fermented blueberry juice, 5.86 g L<sup>−1</sup> in <i>Lp</i>-fermented blueberry juice, and 6.41 g L<sup>−1</sup> in <i>Lr</i>-fermented blueberry juice. These strains extensively metabolized quinic acid, whereas oxalic acid metabolism was almost unaffected. Sixty-four volatile compounds were identified using gas chromatography–ion mobility spectrometry (GC–IMS). All fermented blueberry juices exhibited decreased aldehyde levels. Furthermore, fermentation with <i>La</i> was dominated by alcohols, <i>Lp</i> was dominated by esters, and <i>Lr</i> was dominated by ketones. Linear discriminant analysis of the electronic nose and principal component analysis of the GC–IMS data effectively differentiated between unfermented and fermented blueberry juices.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study informs LABs selection for producing desirable flavours in fermented blueberry juice and provides a theoretical framework for flavour detection. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jun Wang, \nBo‐Cheng Wei, \nYan‐Rong Zhai, \nKe‐Xin Li, \nChu‐Yan Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"c801c595bbceda28ad09bed0385f5aac3a35843df57d08d25790ead532b2ad11","category":"Environment"}
