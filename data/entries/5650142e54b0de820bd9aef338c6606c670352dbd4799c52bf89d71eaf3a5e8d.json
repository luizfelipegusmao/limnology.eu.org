{"title":"Perioperative Buprenorphine Management and Post-Operative Pain Outcomes: A Retrospective Study with Literature Review and Recommendations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1346/v1","date":1716262400000,"content":"The prevalence of patients on buprenorphine therapy presenting for elective surgery has increased. Buprenorphine is a widely used medication for management of patients with chronic pain. It is also used for maintenance therapy for patients with a history of opioid use disorder (OUD). Due to lack of standardized protocol for managing patients on buprenorphine peri-operatively, we performed a retrospective analysis to compare pain score outcomes and post-operative opiate requirements between patients who continued versus discontinued buprenorphine. We identified 35 patients, 11 continued buprenorphine and 24 discontinued buprenorphine. The average Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) pain score was 7.54 for those who discontinued pre-operative buprenorphine and 5.59 for those who continued (P value 0.0339). The average post-operative Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) use was 86.13 for those who continued pre-operative buprenorphine and was 107.70 for those who discontinued buprenorphine (P value 0.6439). The results from our study correlate with several previous studies which showed lower PACU pain scores in patients who continued buprenorphine. There is a benefit of decreased pain post-operatively when pre-operative buprenorphine is continued and having a decrease in relapse in those with a history of OUD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5650142e54b0de820bd9aef338c6606c670352dbd4799c52bf89d71eaf3a5e8d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
