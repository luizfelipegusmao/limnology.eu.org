{"title":"Education in focus: Significant improvements in student learning and satisfaction with ophthalmology teaching delivered using a blended learning approach","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305755","date":1719842400000,"content":"<p>by Andrea J. Doyle, Conor C. Murphy, Fiona Boland, Teresa Pawlikowska, Joan Ní Gabhann-Dromgoole</p>\r\nPurpose <p>This study aimed to measure student satisfaction with a revised ophthalmology delivery format, which due to the pandemic had previously relied on a remote online flipped classroom (OFC) format compared to a blended learning format. This educational strategy combined online learning with in-person seminars and practical patient centred sessions. Our previous investigations demonstrated a significant lack of student satisfaction with a curriculum solely reliant on a remote OFC, as such we hypothesised that a blended learning approach would result in improved levels of student satisfaction and knowledge gain.</p> Methods <p>Non-randomised intervention study of two groups; group 1 = OFC group and group 2 = BL group, compared perspectives of 4th year ophthalmology students using a validated course evaluation questionnaire (CEQ).</p> Results <p>A total of 59 students from the BL group (n = 257; response rate = 23.0%) and 28 from the OFC group agreed to participate in the study (n = 114; response rate = 24.6%). Participants in the BL group felt it was easier to determine the standard of work that was expected (77.42% v 60.71%) and demonstrated significantly increased satisfaction with staff motivation of students (95.16% v 64.29%, p &lt;0.001) and provision of feedback (74.19% v 46.43%, p = 0.004), compared to the OFC group. Furthermore, students in the BL group also felt the course significantly improved their analytical skills (64.52% v 42.85%, p = 0.023) and ability to work as part of team (69.36% v 25%, p &lt;0.001) as well as reporting reduced dissatisfaction with the level of choice afforded in terms of how they would learn (33.88% v 60.71%, p = 0.31) and the how they were assessed (59.68% v 89.28%, p = 0.004). No evidence of a statistical difference in exam score was observed.</p> Conclusions <p>The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated an unavoidable pivot to online and distance learning, to meet the challenges presented by government mandates and social distancing requirements. Since many of these directives have been reversed, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness and learner perceptions’ of the online and distance learning interventions. In this study we demonstrated a significant student preference for BL compared to the OFC approach, with comparable student performances determined by MCQ examinations. Our findings suggest a preference for reintroducing in-person and patient engagement activities in post-pandemic health professions education.</p>","author":"Andrea J.
