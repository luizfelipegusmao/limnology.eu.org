{"title":"A Fast Calibrated CFD Model for Timber-Concrete Composite Ventilated Fa&ccedil;ades","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2006/v1","date":1714489827000,"content":"Timber-concrete composite (TCC) systems join the positive aspects of engineered wood products (good seismic behaviour, low thermal conductivity, environmental sustainability, good behaviour under fire if appropriately designed) with those of concrete (high thermal inertia, durability, excellent fire resistance). TCC facades are typically composed by an internal insulated timber-frame wall and an external concrete slab, separated by a ventilated air cavity. However, there is very limited knowledge concerning the performance of TCC facades, especially for what concerns their thermal behaviour. The present paper deals with the development and optimisation of a 2D CFD model for the analysis of TCC ventilated fa√ßades thermal behaviour. The model is calibrated and validated against the experimental data collected during the annual monitoring of a real TCC ventilated envelope in the north of Italy. Also, a new solver algorithm is developed to significantly speed up the simulation. The final model can be used for the time-efficient analysis and optimisation of the thermal performance of TCC ventilated facades, as well as other ventilated facades with external massive cladding, avoiding the expensive and time-consuming construction of mock-ups, or the use of comparably slow (conventional) CFD solvers that are less suitable for optimization studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70f1f2dc0ba0e67e5fcc185438c484b39a67758775f443c325a6e8fc16aa67fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
