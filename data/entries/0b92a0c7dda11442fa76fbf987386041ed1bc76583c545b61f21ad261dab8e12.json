Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) prevent thromboembolic events, but information about the quality of life (QoL) and patient satisfaction, related to both anticoagulants, is limited. \nMethods\nREGUEIFA is an observational and multicentre study that included patients with AF diagnosis treated by cardiologist. Those on OAC, VKA, and DOACs were selected. The EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire evaluated QoL, and the ACTS (Anti-Clot Treatment Scale) questionnaire investigated patient satisfaction with OAC.\nResults\nFrom a total of 1007 patients, 904 patients were on OAC, 532 on VKA and 372 on DOACs. In total, 846 patients completed the EQ-5D questionnaire, with results significantly worse in patients on VKA than on DOACs: (1) mobility limitations (37.6% vs. 24.2%, p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b92a0c7dda11442fa76fbf987386041ed1bc76583c545b61f21ad261dab8e12","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
