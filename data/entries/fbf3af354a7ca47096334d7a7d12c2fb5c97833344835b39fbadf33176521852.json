{"title":"Molecular-scale liquid density fluctuations and cavity thermodynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1466/v1","date":1718962246000,"content":"Molecular-scale density fluctuations at equilibrium produce cavities in a liquid and can be analyzed to shed light on the statistics of the number of molecules occupying observation volumes of increasing radius. An information theory approach led to the conclusion that these probabilities should follow a Gaussian distribution function. This prediction has been confirmed by computer simulations in different liquid models if the size of the observation volume is not large. The reversible work of cavity creation is exactly linked to the probability of finding zero molecules in a given observation volume. The Gaussian formula for the latter probability is scrutinized to arrive at the enthalpy and entropy changes associated with cavity creation. The reversible work of cavity creation has a purely entropic origin due to the solvent-excluded volume effect produced by the inaccessibility of a given region of the configurational space. The consequent structural reorganization of liquid molecules leads to exactly compensating enthalpy and entropy changes. These results are in line with those obtained in a direct statistical mechanical study by Lee.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fbf3af354a7ca47096334d7a7d12c2fb5c97833344835b39fbadf33176521852","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
