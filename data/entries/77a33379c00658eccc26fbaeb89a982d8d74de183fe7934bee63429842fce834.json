{"title":"Semantic Visual SLAM Algorithm Based on Improved DeepLabV3+Model and LK Optical Flow","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1212/v1","date":1718700746000,"content":"Aiming at the problem that dynamic targets in indoor environments lead to low accuracy and large errors in the localization and position estimation of visual SLAM systems and the inability to build maps containing semantic information, a semantic visual SLAM algorithm based on the semantic segmentation network DeepLabV3+ and LK optical flow is proposed based on ORB-SLAM2 system. First, the dynamic target feature points are detected and rejected based on the lightweight semantic segmentation network DeepLabV3+ and LK optical flow method. second, the static environment occluded by the dynamic target is repaired using the time-weighted multi-frame fusion background repair technique. Lastly, the filtered static feature points are used for feature matching and position calculation. Meanwhile, the semantic labeling information of static objects obtained based on the lightweight semantic segmentation network DeepLabV3+ is fused with the static environment information after background repair to generate dense point cloud maps containing semantic information, and the semantic dense point cloud maps are transformed into semantic octree maps using the octree spatial segmentation data structure. The localization accuracy of the visual SLAM system and the construction of the semantic maps are verified using the TUM RGB-D widely used dataset and real scene data, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed semantic visual SLAM algorithm can effectively reduce the influence of dynamic targets on the system, has a higher localization accuracy, and compared with other advanced algorithms, such as DynaSLAM, has the highest performance in indoor dynamic environments while considering both localization accuracy and real-time performance. In addition, semantic maps can be constructed so that the robot can better understand and adapt to the indoor dynamic environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"77a33379c00658eccc26fbaeb89a982d8d74de183fe7934bee63429842fce834","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
