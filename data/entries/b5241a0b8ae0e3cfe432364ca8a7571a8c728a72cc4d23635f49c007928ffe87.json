{"title":"Long-Term Effect of Tillage Systems on the Planosol Physical Properties, CO2 Emissions and Spring Barley Productivity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0910/v1","date":1718268933000,"content":"Soil tillage intensity influences the distribution of nutrients, and soil’s physical and me-chanical properties, as well as gas flows. The impact of reduced tillage on these indices in spring barley cultivation is still insufficient and requires more analysis on a global scale. This study was carried out at Vytautas Magnus University, Agriculture Academy (Lithu-ania) in 2022–2023. The aim of the investigation was to determine the effect of the tillage systems on the soil temperature, moisture content, CO2 respiration and concentration in spring barley cultivation limited by the semi-humid subarctic climate. Based on a long-term tillage experiment, five tillage systems were tested: deep and shallow mold-board ploughing, deep cultivation-chiselling, shallow cultivation-chiselling, and no-tillage.\nShallow ploughing technology was found to be better at conserving soil moisture and maintaining a higher temperature. Deep cultivation had a lower moisture content and lower soil temperature. Shallow cultivation fields in most cases increased CO2 emissions and CO2 concentration. The results show that in direct sowing fields, most cases had a positive effect on crop density. Direct sowing fields resulted in significantly lower grain yields of spring barley in the years studied.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5241a0b8ae0e3cfe432364ca8a7571a8c728a72cc4d23635f49c007928ffe87","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
