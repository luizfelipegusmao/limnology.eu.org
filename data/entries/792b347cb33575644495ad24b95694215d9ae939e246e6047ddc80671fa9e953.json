{"title":"Limits of Stability during a Therapeutic Exercise Intervention for Instability: Progression, Responders&rsquo; and Non-Responders&rsquo; Analysis and Predictors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2009/v1","date":1721884513000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Instability is one of the main symptoms in patients with vestibular and neurological disorders and therapeutic exercise interventions are increasing its popularity as a way of treatment for those. Additionally, the limits of stability measurement are known to be a good tool for balance evaluation and monitoring of this interventions. The aim of this work is to understand better how a specific protocol provokes changes on this variable and study the characteristics of those who respond and non-respond to it. Methods: A retrospective study was developed with the data of 40 patients treated in the Otorhinolaryngology department in Cl√≠nica Universidad de Navarra (Madrid, Spain). Those had an initial reduction in limits of stability, completed the protocol proposed with home-based and hospital-based exercises with frequent limits of stability remeasurement, and assist to the follow-up retest after 1-2 months. Results: A progressive improvement in limits of stability measure was developed through the intervention and partially retained at follow-up visit. Differences were found between responders and non-responders patients. More specifically an initial measure of the limits of stability was able to differentiate those groups with a cut-off data of 56cm2. Conclusions: The protocol proposed was able to induce motor learning in patients included in this study with good retention after 1-2 months. Besides, there is some variability in how patients respond to the treatment. Age and diagnostic should be considered, and an interesting cut-off data for clinal decision making was found.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"792b347cb33575644495ad24b95694215d9ae939e246e6047ddc80671fa9e953","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
