{"title":"In-resin CLEM of Epon-embedded Cells and Tissues: An Approach for Volume CLEM","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.480/7720078?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>In-resin CLEM (correlative light and electron microscopy) is a method for accurately correlating fluorescence microscopy with electron microscopy [<a href=\"#ozae044.480-B1\">1</a>]. This technique provides higher positional accuracy than standard CLEM techniques. In standard CLEM, fluorescent signals are typically detected in cells prior to embedding samples in epoxy or other types of polymer resins. Cells are then chemically fixed with a mixture of paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, stained with osmium tetroxide, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol, and finally embedded in resins. After preparing ultrathin sections (50∼100 nm) of resin-embedded samples, electron microscopic images are taken. It is important to note that chemical and physical distortions may occur during the preparation process, which may reduce the correlation between fluorescence and electron microscopic images. In addition, there is a discrepancy in Z-axis resolution between fluorescence (typically a few µm thick) and electron microscopy images (typically 50∼100 nm thick). To overcome the limitations of standard CLEM, the technique of in-resin CLEM has been developed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bffc485e2f229ac784095b07d9459daddaae9e9673b5e902bfcc5665c9d9b5dc","category":"Environment"}
