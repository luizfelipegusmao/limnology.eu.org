{"title":"Surfactant-Assisted Binder-Free NiCo2S4 with Enhanced Electrochemical Performance in Aqueous Supercapacitor Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1720/v1","date":1724403190000,"content":"Until now, crystalline NiCo2S4 and its composites have demonstrated improve performances in supercapacitor applications, compared to their oxide analogous, due to their relatively higher electrical conductivity, and multifaceted redox reaction. However, amorphous phase materials have recently shown promise in electrochemical energy storage systems. In this work, urea-assisted amorphous NiCo2S4 on nickel foam (referred to as aNCS) with high nitrogen atom% content, was obtained via hydrothermal method. In comparison to the crystalline NiCo2S4 (referred to as cNCS), aNCS exhibited superior electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of ~3506 F g-1 which is higher than cNCS specific capacitance of ~2185 F g-1 at 2 A g-1. Additionally, aNCS in two-electrode asymmetry supercapacitor exhibited specific capacitance and energy density of ~196 F g-1 and 56 Wh kg-1, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67482c01e083105fb1621399d87379c46cbb892d42e9631c7059a3880d591c8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
