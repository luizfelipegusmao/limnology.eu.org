{"title":"Experimental Demonstration of Energy Harvesting by Maxwell's Demon Device","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1698/v1","date":1711628233000,"content":"A selective permeable membrane between two different solutions can generate osmotic pressure, Donnan potential, and ion/pH gradients based on various factors such as membrane type, solute concentration and temperature. In this study, we introduce a novel method for extracting energy from ion gradients through an innovative cycle, presenting intriguing experimental findings. Additionally, by leveraging Raoult’s Law, which describes the relationship between vapor pressure and solute presence, in conjunction with osmosis within a closed system, we successfully engineer the simplest iteration of Maxwell’s demon device. This pioneering approach to sustainable energy generation harnesses ambient temperature marking a significant advancement in energy research. Finally this renewable energy source is available all the time and everywhere.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"497cf9fd192e3f15b328cc33cf7acb1ce547371b04c60e752c4309a5aa30cbfb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
