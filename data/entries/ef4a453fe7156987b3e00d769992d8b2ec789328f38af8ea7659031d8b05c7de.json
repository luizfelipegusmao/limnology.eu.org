We retrieved five years of data from an electronic database and analysed 493 full blood counts and 643 biochemical data from different individuals. In this study, we focused on data from individuals with no known underlying health condition who visited the clinical diagnostic laboratory for routine medical examinations or assessments.Our study found a positive association between seasonality (wet season as the reference) and Hb (HB: 0.014(0.015), P&lt;0.05), White blood cells (WBC) (WBC: 0.243(0.163), p = 0.0014), and neutrophils (neutrophils: 0.271(0.131), P&lt;0.05) with exception to red blood cells (RBC) (RBC: - 0.184(0.061), P&lt; 0.003) that showed negative association. Despite the association, the seasonal effects on our derived reference intervals for haematological indices and biochemical measurements from wet season to dry season were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05). In addition, we observed in our heatmap result that some laboratory parameters, including HB, RBC, haematocrit (HCT), urea, liver enzymes, and potassium, showed seasonal variation patterns throughout the year, with median levels being normal to slightly low during the dry season and normal to high during the wet season. We also found no significant difference (P&gt;0.05) among the median values for all parameters from 2018 to 2022. Additionally, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) parameters showed a consistent declining trend from 2018 to 2022. Our study found no seasonal effects on the derived reference intervals of haematological indices and biochemical measurements. However, we observed changes in patterns for certain parameters particularly HB, RBC, liver enzymes, and potassium based on seasonality.","author":"Mustapha Dibbasey","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"ef4a453fe7156987b3e00d769992d8b2ec789328f38af8ea7659031d8b05c7de","category":"Environment"}
