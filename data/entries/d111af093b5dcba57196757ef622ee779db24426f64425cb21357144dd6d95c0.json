{"title":"Structure-based virtual screening identifies small-molecule inhibitors of O-fucosyltransferase SPINDLY in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/3/497/7485597?rss=1","date":1703030400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Protein O-glycosylation is a nutrient signaling mechanism that plays an essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis across different species. In plants, SPINDLY (SPY) and SECRET AGENT (SEC) posttranslationally modify hundreds of intracellular proteins with O-fucose and O-linked N-acetylglucosamine, respectively. SPY and SEC play overlapping roles in cellular regulation, and loss of both <span>SPY</span> and <span>SEC</span> causes embryo lethality in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). Using structure-based virtual screening of chemical libraries followed by in vitro and in planta assays, we identified a SPY O-fucosyltransferase inhibitor (SOFTI). Computational analyses predicted that SOFTI binds to the GDP-fucoseâ€“binding pocket of SPY and competitively inhibits GDP-fucose binding. In vitro assays confirmed that SOFTI interacts with SPY and inhibits its O-fucosyltransferase activity. Docking analysis identified additional SOFTI analogs that showed stronger inhibitory activities. SOFTI treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings decreased protein O-fucosylation and elicited phenotypes similar to the <span>spy</span> mutants, including early seed germination, increased root hair density, and defective sugar-dependent growth. In contrast, SOFTI did not visibly affect the <span>spy</span> mutant. Similarly, SOFTI inhibited the sugar-dependent growth of tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>) seedlings. These results demonstrate that SOFTI is a specific SPY O-fucosyltransferase inhibitor that can be used as a chemical tool for functional studies of O-fucosylation and potentially for agricultural management.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"d111af093b5dcba57196757ef622ee779db24426f64425cb21357144dd6d95c0","category":"Environment"}
