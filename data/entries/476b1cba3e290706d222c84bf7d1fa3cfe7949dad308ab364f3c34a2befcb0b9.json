The gold standard assessment technique in emergency medicine is eyeballing. A new tool is now available on pocket ultrasound devices (PUD): automatic LVEF. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the concordance between LVEF values estimated by automatic LVEF with PUD and by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p> Materials <p>This was a prospective, monocentric, and observational study. All adult patients with an indication for cardiac MRI underwent a point-of-care ultrasound. Blinded to the MRI results, the emergency physician assessed LVEF using the automatic PUD tool and by visual evaluation.</p> Results <p>Sixty patients were included and analyzed. Visual estimation of LVEF was feasible for all patients and automatic evaluation for 52 (87%) patients. Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient between automatic ejection fraction with PUD and by cardiac MRI was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.03–0.40).</p> Conclusion <p>Concordance between LVEF estimated by the automatic ejection fraction with PUD and LVEF estimated by MRI was non-existent.</p>","author":"Lucie Berger","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"476b1cba3e290706d222c84bf7d1fa3cfe7949dad308ab364f3c34a2befcb0b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
