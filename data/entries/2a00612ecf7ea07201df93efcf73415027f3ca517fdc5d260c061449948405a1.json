{"title":"EU regulations for maximum containment labs—Response | Science","link":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn6100","date":1710421260000,"content":"Brechot et al. argue that the European Union has sufficient regulations to ensure the safety of maximum containment laboratories and the infrastructure to serve as an international model. We all agree that maximum containment laboratories are essential to scientific advancement, and I acknowledge that some countries have precautionary measures in place. However, as my Editorial explains, the proliferation of laboratories requires that all—not just some—countries with relevant facilities take steps to prevent accidental and deliberate harm.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"2a00612ecf7ea07201df93efcf73415027f3ca517fdc5d260c061449948405a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
