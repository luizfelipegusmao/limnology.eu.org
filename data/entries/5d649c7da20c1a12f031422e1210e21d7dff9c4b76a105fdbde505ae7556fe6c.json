We propose a passive lunar biorepository for long-term storage of prioritized taxa of live cryopreserved samples to safeguard Earth's biodiversity and to support future space exploration and planet terraforming. Our initial focus will be on cryopreserving animal skin samples with fibroblast cells. An exemplar system has been developed using cryopreserved fish fins from the Starry Goby, <span>Asterropteryx semipunctata</span>. Samples will be expanded into fibroblast cells, recryopreserved, and then tested in an Earth-based laboratory for robust packaging and sensitivity to radiation. Two key factors for this biorepository are the needs to reduce damage from radiation and to maintain the samples near –196° Celsius. Certain lunar sites near the poles may meet these criteria. If possible, further testing would occur on the International Space Station prior to storage on the Moon. To secure a positive shared future, this is an open call to participate in this decades-long program.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"BioScience Current Issue","siteHash":"b284d132cf96f029686596d0a1781780964c795fe639c624cd504e01b404d8ff","entryHash":"5d649c7da20c1a12f031422e1210e21d7dff9c4b76a105fdbde505ae7556fe6c","category":"Environment"}
