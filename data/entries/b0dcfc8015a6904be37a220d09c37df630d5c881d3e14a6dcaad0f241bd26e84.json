{"title":"Solution of the Capacitated Lot-Sizing Problem with Remanufacturing (CLSPR) in a General Way with the Help of Simulation and Relaxation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202304.0242/v4","date":1722309652000,"content":"The capacitated lot-sizing problem with product recovery (CLSP-RM) holds significant importance in reverse logistics but is notoriously complex (NP-hard). In this study, two techniques are introduced to confront this challenge. The first technique entails devising a linear optimization task that eliminates capacity limitations across a wide problem spectrum, yielding a remarkably accurate approximation of the optimal solution. This adaptable approach presents a potent alternative and holds potential for extension to diverse problem categories owing to its versatile nature. The second technique employs a simulation methodology utilizing Halton’s uniform random numbers to address the issue. This randomized production search method sidesteps considerations of production costs, inventory expenditures, and production order when determining production batches. The research’s novelty lies in its application of these techniques to the problem. The suggested methods undergo evaluation via a benchmark dataset of approximately 4200 instances, with comparison against solutions derived through the Gurobi solver. The results underscore the efficacy and resilience of the introduced methodology in tackling the CLSP-RM predicament.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0dcfc8015a6904be37a220d09c37df630d5c881d3e14a6dcaad0f241bd26e84","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
