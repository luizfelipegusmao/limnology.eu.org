{"title":"Evaluation of serum MIP-1β and MCP-2 levels in major depressive disorder: A case-control study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305734","date":1718719200000,"content":"<p>by Mariya Akter, A. S. M. Roknuzzaman, Mohammad Shahriar, Sardar Mohammad Ashraful Islam, Mohiuddin Ahmed Bhuiyan, M. M. A. Shalahuddin Qusar, Eva Rahman Kabir, Rabiul Islam</p>\r\nBackground <p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating mental illness characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in daily activities. The objective of this study was to investigate whether levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β) and macrophage chemoattractant protein-2 (MCP-2) in the blood were associated with the pathophysiology and development of MDD compared to healthy controls (HCs).</p> Methods <p>This case-control study was conducted involving 50 MDD patients and 38 HCs. We performed a comprehensive assessment to match age, sex, BMI, and socio-demographic profile between the groups. The study excluded participants with chronic infection, inflammatory diseases, coexisting psychiatric disorder, history of liver and kidney diseases, and individuals who are under antipsychotic medications. A professional psychiatrist diagnosed MDD patients and evaluated HCs based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) criteria. The severity of depression was assessed using the Hamilton Depression (Ham-D) rating scale. Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were used to quantify the serum MIP-1β and MCP-2 levels.</p> Results <p>The results indicated elevated serum MIP-1β levels (207.73±24.24 pg/ml) in MDD patients compared to HCs (58.77±9.14 pg/ml). This difference in concentration is positively correlated with severity of disease symptoms (r = 0.451; p&lt;0.001). Similarly, the levels of MCP-2 were found to be elevated in patients compared to controls (143.61±19.92 vs. 56.84±4.02 pg/ml; p = 0.003), with a positive correlation with the Ham-D scores (r = 0.373; p = 0.004).</p> Conclusion <p>According to this study, elevated levels of MIP-1β and MCP-2 may be associated with the pathophysiology and development of MDD. These increased serum MIP-1β and MCP-2 levels could be used as risk assessment tools for MDD. The present findings urge further research and the development of therapeutic and diagnostic approaches for depression.</p>","author":"Mariya Akter","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1efd20416444ff6c4f2c5bd916ae6f05a998d789907f76a894ed568230ccacb2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
