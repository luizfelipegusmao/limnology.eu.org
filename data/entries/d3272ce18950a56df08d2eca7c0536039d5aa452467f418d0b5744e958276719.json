Alternative ion species such as He, Ne and Xe, have been recently explored in effort to eliminate or reduce the complication inherent to using Ga ions for those applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.242-B1\">1-3</a>]. While there are studies on ion implantation and defects caused by various ion penetration in silicon substrate, the range (or extension) of the damage distribution due to different ion sources is not fully understood. This information is critical to determine the relative distance to the active device at which the ion beam can be applied during circuit edit to minimally impact device performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d3272ce18950a56df08d2eca7c0536039d5aa452467f418d0b5744e958276719","category":"Environment"}
