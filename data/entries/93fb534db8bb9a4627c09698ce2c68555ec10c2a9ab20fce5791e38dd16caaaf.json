This study sought to reveal the distinctive gut bacteriome composition and diversity within the anadromous fish species <i>Tenualosa ilisha</i> (hilsa), which holds the status of being the national fish of Bangladesh. We conducted an analysis on 15 gut samples obtained from 15 individual hilsa fishes collected from three primary habitats (e.g., freshwater = 5, brackish water = 5 and marine water = 5) in Bangladesh. The analysis utilized metagenomics based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing targeting the V3-V4 regions. Our comprehensive identification revealed a total of 258 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The observed OTUs were represented by six phyla, nine classes, 19 orders, 26 families and 40 genera of bacteria. Our analysis unveiled considerable taxonomic differences among the habitats (freshwater, brackish water, and marine water) of hilsa fishes, as denoted by a higher level of shared microbiota (<i>p</i> = 0.007, Kruskal-Wallis test). Among the identified genera in the gut of hilsa fishes, including <i>Vagococcus</i>, <i>Morganella</i>, <i>Enterobacter</i>, <i>Plesiomonas</i>, <i>Shigella</i>, <i>Clostridium</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>, <i>Serratia</i>, <i>Aeromonas</i>, <i>Macrococcus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Proteus</i>, and <i>Hafnia</i>, several are recognized as fish probiotics. Importantly, some bacterial genera such as <i>Sinobaca</i>, <i>Synechococcus</i>, <i>Gemmata</i>, <i>Serinicoccus</i>, <i>Saccharopolyspora</i>, and <i>Paulinella</i> identified in the gut of hilsa identified in this study have not been reported in any aquatic or marine fish species. Significantly, we observed that 67.50% (27/40) of bacterial genera were found to be common among hilsa fishes across all three habitats. Our findings offer compelling evidence for the presence of both exclusive and communal bacteriomes within the gut of hilsa fishes, exhibiting potential probiotic properties. These observations could be crucial for guiding future microbiome investigations in this economically significant fish species.","author":"A. Q. M.
