{"title":"Arterio-venous Anastomoses of the Sucquet–Hoyer Type: Complexity and Distribution in the Human Dermis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/2/334/7619459?rss=1","date":1709596800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Our study aims at providing detailed information on numbers, form, and spatial distribution of arterio-venous anastomoses of the Sucquet–Hoyer type in the dermis of the nail bed, nail fold corner, thumb pad, arm, nose, glabella, lip, and ear. It further aims at providing a system, which relies on objective morphologic criteria for classifying Sucquet–Hoyer canals (SHCs). Using high-resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM), digital volume data of eight samples of each skin region were produced. Virtual three-dimensional (3D) models of the dermally located SHCs were created, and their 3D tortuosity (<span>τ</span>) values were determined. Dermal SHCs were identified in all 24 finger samples and in 1 lip sample. Beneath a field of 2 × 2 mm<sup>2</sup>, an average of four were located in the nail bed, three in the dermis of the thumb pad, and one in the dermis of the nail fold corner. Only a single dermal SHC was found in one lip sample. No SHCs were observed in the dermis of the other samples. The <span>τ</span> values of the SHCs ranged from 1.11 to 10. Building on these values, a classification system was designed, which distinguishes four SHC classes. The dermal distribution of the SHCs of different classes was similar in all specimens.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"98294bfb1d973f469cef8eacd4ee2ae5275a9cdf5e428a68b7218055b1f2b4da","category":"Environment"}
