{"title":"A Guide to the Multidimensional Nature of Biological Information: Of Maxwell&rsquo;s and Other Demons","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0876/v1","date":1728637356000,"content":"The intricate orchestration of molecular events that constitutes life, as we know it, is oftentimes ascribed to an intelligent design motive. It is portrayed as if a paranormal watch maker has engineered the assemblage of parts and events that eventually manifests as the clockwork precision with which ontogeny and evolution operate within the boundary conditions imposed by what we know as life. The debate between those who advocate evolution versus intelligent design as the shaping force for modern life forms persists. However, that is not the motive for this essay.  Though there has been several studies and scholarly articles that aspire to decipher and present the complexity of the molecular events that constitutes life in an insular fashion, there is a paucity of resources for undergraduates that summarizes the complexity cogently, as parts of a whole, for appreciating the enormity of the multidimensional nature of biological information and the inherent contradictions that are embedded therein. The fluidity inherent in the way information flows through signalling networks, the way biomolecular architectures maintain homeostasis in the ying-yang of life and the way multicellular complexity evolves through precise cell-cycle control is inherent in the evolution, maintenance and reproduction of biological systems.  The matrix of events that encode information at the sequential and structural level across different macromolecules is a fascinating jungle of information. Combining these with how small-molecule metabolites interact with macromolecules in a spatially and temporally coordinated manner to evolve signal over random noise generates a staggering picture of informational organization and relays that, most often, defies human comprehension. This perspective is an attempt to array the various sources of information and put them together in context to appreciate the nuances of how information is stored and relayed within the biological systems. Further, it speculates on how these multitiered organization of biological information could be adapted to guide synthetic biology approaches and the future of information storage and organization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8788a8ee4b3237f4272efa1f5b1bdfc7d5d65e0a23d5cd7c1406f1a0866f4fc1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
