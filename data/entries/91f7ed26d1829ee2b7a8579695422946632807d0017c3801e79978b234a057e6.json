Readers interested in advances in policies for improving environmental health are, however, expecting to be informed about health effects resulting from, or more explicitly caused by, environmental exposures. The quantification of health impacts resulting from the removal of environmental exposures involves causal statements. Therefore, when possible, causal inference frameworks should be considered for analyzing the effects of environmental exposures on health outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 40, 2019</p>","author":"Marie-Ab√®le Bind","siteTitle":"Annual Review of Public Health","siteHash":"7a16e40f33727f64c92405053603e83c5cbbe960f1756170cbd1d528ffe78607","entryHash":"91f7ed26d1829ee2b7a8579695422946632807d0017c3801e79978b234a057e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
