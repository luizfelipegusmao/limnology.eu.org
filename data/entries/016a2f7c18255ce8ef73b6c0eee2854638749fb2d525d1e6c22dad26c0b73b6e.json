{"title":"Advanced Laser Plasma Diagnostics for a Modular High-Repetition Rate Plasma Electron Accelerator","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1057/v1","date":1715780336000,"content":"We present a laser-plasma electron accelerator module designed to be driven by high repetition rate lasers for industrial applications of laser-driven electron beams. It consists of a single vacuum chamber containing all the necessary components for producing, optimizing, and monitoring electron beams generated via laser wakefield acceleration in a gas jet. The core methods involve comprehensive metrological assessments, including rigorous temporal laser pulse characterization and contrast measurements, supplemented by detailed spatio-temporal distribution analyses of the laser system. Results demonstrate the good stability and reproducibility of the laser system, confirming its suitability for advanced scientific and industrial applications. We demonstrate the full functionality of the laser-plasma accelerator module and perform target density and laser-plasma characterizations. Our work is a first step towards the wide dissemination of fully integrated laser-plasma accelerator technology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"016a2f7c18255ce8ef73b6c0eee2854638749fb2d525d1e6c22dad26c0b73b6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
