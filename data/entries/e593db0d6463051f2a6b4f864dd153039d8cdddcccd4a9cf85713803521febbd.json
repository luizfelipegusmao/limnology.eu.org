{"title":"Rapid and efficient generation of mature retinal organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells via optimized pharmacological modulation of Sonic hedgehog, activin A, and retinoic acid signal transduction","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308743","date":1723212000000,"content":"<p>by Tokiyoshi Matsushita, Akishi Onishi, Takahiro Matsuyama, Tomohiro Masuda, Yoko Ogino, Masaaki Kageyama, Masayo Takahashi, Fumiaki Uchiumi</p>\r\n\r\nHuman retinal organoids have become indispensable tools for retinal disease modeling and drug screening. Despite its versatile applications, the long timeframe for their differentiation and maturation limits the throughput of such research. Here, we successfully shortened this timeframe by accelerating human retinal organoid development using unique pharmacological approaches. Our method comprised three key steps: 1) a modified self-formed ectodermal autonomous multizone (SEAM) method, including dual SMAD inhibition and bone morphogenetic protein 4 treatment, for initial neural retinal induction; 2) the concurrent use of a Sonic hedgehog agonist SAG, activin A, and all-<i>trans</i> retinoic acid for rapid retinal cell specification; and 3) switching to SAG treatment alone for robust retinal maturation and lamination. The generated retinal organoids preserved typical morphological features of mature retinal organoids, including hair-like surface structures and well-organized outer layers. These features were substantiated by the spatial immunostaining patterns of several retinal cell markers, including rhodopsin and L/M opsin expression in the outermost layer, which was accompanied by reduced ectopic cone photoreceptor generation. Importantly, our method required only 90 days for retinal organoid maturation, which is approximately two-thirds the time necessary for other conventional methods. These results indicate that thoroughly optimized pharmacological interventions play a pivotal role in rapid and precise photoreceptor development during human retinal organoid differentiation and maturation. Thus, our present method may expedite human retinal organoid research, eventually contributing to the development of better treatment options for various degenerative retinal diseases.","author":"Tokiyoshi Matsushita","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e593db0d6463051f2a6b4f864dd153039d8cdddcccd4a9cf85713803521febbd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
