{"title":"Albuterol as an adjuvant in acute anticholinesterase pesticide poisoning: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae048/7636847?rss=1","date":1711584000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Acute anticholinesterase pesticide poisoning is a serious clinical problem, particularly in developing countries. Atropine is the most acceptable treatment for acute anticholinesterase poisoning. However, it only stops fluid production. Albuterol is a beta-2 receptor agonist that can increase fluid removal and speed the return of effective oxygen exchange. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nebulized albuterol as an adjuvant therapy in patients with acute anticholinesterase poisoning. This stratified block randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted between November 2020 and October 2021. It enrolled 80 patients with acute anticholinesterase pesticide poisoning who were admitted to Tanta University Poison Control Center. Patients were allocated into two groups (40 patients each). The strata were based on the severity of poisoning (moderate and severe). Patients in group I received 10 mg of nebulized albuterol. Group II received an equivalent volume of nebulized normal saline. Additionally, standard treatment was provided to both groups. Outcomes included oxygenation, mortality, need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, hospital stay duration, time to atropinization, and total doses of atropine and oxime. We found insignificant differences in sociodemographics, exposure characteristics, clinical manifestations, or routine laboratory tests between the studied groups. The median values of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry were 99% in the albuterol moderate toxicity group and 98% in the control moderate toxicity group. Albuterol significantly improved oxygen saturation in moderate intoxicated patients (P = 0.039). Therefore, nebulized albuterol is a safe drug. Moreover, it may improve oxygenation in acute anticholinesterase pesticide poisoning.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"a843f4f6e662194101e60011eb80d9fb7fd9ecb7786154cb091ed8c8217dc452","category":"Environment"}
