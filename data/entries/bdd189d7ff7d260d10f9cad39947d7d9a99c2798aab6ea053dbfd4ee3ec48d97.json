{"title":"Role of canonical and non-canonical cAMP sources in CRHR2α-dependent signaling","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310699","date":1727877600000,"content":"<p>by Natalia G. Armando, Paula A. dos Santos Claro, Mariana Fuertes, Eduardo Arzt, Susana Silberstein</p>\r\n\r\nHippocampal neurons exhibit activation of both the conventional transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs) and the non-canonical soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) as sources of cyclic AMP (cAMP). These two cAMP sources play crucial roles in mediating signaling pathways downstream of CRHR1 in neuronal and neuroendocrine contexts. In this study, we investigate the involvement of both cAMP sources in the molecular mechanisms triggered by CRHR2α. Here we provide evidence demonstrating that UCN1 and UCN3 exert a neuritogenic effect on HT22-CRHR2α cells, which is solely dependent on the cAMP pool generated by sAC and PKA activity but independent of ERK1/2 activation. Through the characterization of the effectors implicated in neurite elongation, we found that CREB phosphorylation and c-Fos induction rely on PKA activity and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, underscoring the critical role of signaling pathway regulation. These findings strengthen the concept that localized cAMP microdomains actively participate in the regulation of these signaling processes.","author":"Natalia G.
