This method relies on the principle that chemical bonds, characterized by dynamic dipole moments, resonate at specific frequencies within the IR spectrum (4,000-400 cm^-1). The stretching and bending motions of bonds in molecules, particularly those with varying electronegativities like O-H or C=O, result in distinct absorption patterns. These patterns act as unique identifiers for chemical groups, enabling the detection and analysis of chemical processes within a sample over time or under different conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3a3d964b6077b2212dd83539fe0652245f90c84d9ad31232534a115e9ff23f72","category":"Environment"}
