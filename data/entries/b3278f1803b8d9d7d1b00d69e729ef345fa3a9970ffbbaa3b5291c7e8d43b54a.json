{"title":"Deconvoluting and derisking QRS complex widening to improve cardiac safety profile of novel plasmepsin X antimalarials","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/201/2/321/7709417?rss=1","date":1720396800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Quinoline-related antimalarial drugs have been associated with cardiotoxicity risk, in particular QT prolongation and QRS complex widening. In collaboration with Medicines for Malaria Venture, we discovered novel plasmepsin X (PMX) inhibitors for malaria treatment. The first lead compounds tested in anesthetized guinea pigs (GPs) induced profound QRS widening, although exhibiting weak inhibition of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5-mediated currents in standard patch clamp assays. To understand the mechanism(s) underlying QRS widening to identify further compounds devoid of such liability, we established a set of in vitro models including Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 rate-dependence, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 patch clamp assays, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM), and Langendorff-perfused isolated GP hearts. Six compounds were tested in all models including anesthetized GP, and 8 additional compounds were tested in vitro only. All compounds tested in anesthetized GP and isolated hearts showed a similar cardiovascular profile, consisting of QRS widening, bradycardia, negative inotropy, hypotension, and for some, QT prolongation. However, a left shift of the concentrationâ€“response curves was noted from in vitro to in vivo GP data. When comparing in vitro models, there was a good consistency between decrease in sodium spike amplitude in hiPSC-CM and QRS widening in isolated hearts. Patch clamp assay results showed that the QRS widening observed with PMX inhibitors is likely multifactorial, primarily due to Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 rate-dependent sodium blockade and/or calcium channel-mediated mechanisms. In conclusion, early de-risking of QRS widening using a set of different in vitro assays allowed to identify novel PMX inhibitors with improved cardiac safety profile.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"b3278f1803b8d9d7d1b00d69e729ef345fa3a9970ffbbaa3b5291c7e8d43b54a","category":"Environment"}
