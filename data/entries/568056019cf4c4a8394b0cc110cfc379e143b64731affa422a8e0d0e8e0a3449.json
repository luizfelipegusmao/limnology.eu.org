{"title":"Design and Simulation of an Experimental Flying Cutting Plant for the Implementation of Control Strategies in an Academic Environment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0471/v1","date":1728296625000,"content":"Test plants or laboratory prototypes are essential for the development of training activities in engineering. In the area of automation and control, in particular, equipment that model to a high degree those generally found in industrial processes is required, allowing engineers in training to be in permanent contact with the challenges of the context in which they work. This paper presents the design and simulation of a fly cutting plant for use in academic environments. In the design, a 3D model was built in SketchUp, considering features present in industrial plants. The simulation of the system was developed in MATLAB through a mathematical modeling of the plant. The main contribution of the work carried out was the design of a low-cost and small-dimension industrial prototype, which includes a conveyor belt and a continuous cutting mechanism through which large-scale industrial processes can be known and operated. As results, performance tests were performed in tools such as MATLAB, Simulink, and Code Composer Studio. After the operation, the operation and cutting tests were implemented using a classical control technique. Additionally, all the design features of a flying cutting plant, which can be easily implemented for the development of process control-oriented activities, are presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"568056019cf4c4a8394b0cc110cfc379e143b64731affa422a8e0d0e8e0a3449","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
