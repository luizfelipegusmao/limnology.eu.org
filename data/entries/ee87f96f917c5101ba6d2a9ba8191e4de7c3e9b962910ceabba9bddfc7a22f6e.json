At present, however, the transient stages of oxidation – from nucleation of the metal oxide to formation of the thermodynamically stable oxide – represent a scientifically challenging and technologically important terra incognito. These issues can only be understood through a detailed study of microscopic processes in situ at the nanoscale and below. Hence, we are studying the initial stages of oxidation of a model metal system, Cu, and extending the current study to Cu-Ni alloy by in situ environmental high-resolution TEM (ETEM) to determine the role of surfaces and surface defects on metal oxidation behavior at the atomic scale through a correlated experimental-theoretical effort complemented with machine learning.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ee87f96f917c5101ba6d2a9ba8191e4de7c3e9b962910ceabba9bddfc7a22f6e","category":"Environment"}
