{"title":"Insights into the Preparation and Evaluation of the Bactericidal Effects of Phage-Based Hydrogels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2265/v1","date":1722324611000,"content":"The rise of antibiotic-resistant strains demands new alternatives in antibacterial treatments. Bacteriophages, with their precise host specificity and ability to target and eliminate bacteria safely, present a valuable option. Meanwhile, hydrogels, known for their excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility, serve as ideal carriers for bacteriophages. The combination of bacteriophages and hydrogels ensures heightened phage activity, concentration, controlled release, and strong antibacterial properties, making it a promising avenue for antibacterial treatment. This article provides a comprehensive review of different cross-linking methods for phage hydrogels and focuses on their application in treating infections caused by various drug-resistant bacteria.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eb101de534e26344f3dcd18485bc47c7120f00c038bae90cace835de5e05581c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
