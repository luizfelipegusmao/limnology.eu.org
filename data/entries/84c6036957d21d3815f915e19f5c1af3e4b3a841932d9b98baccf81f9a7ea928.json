{"title":"Designing Dual-State and Aggregation-Induced Emissive Luminogens from Lignocellulosic Biosourced Molecules","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0318/v1","date":1717592253000,"content":"Utilizing lignocellulosic biosourced platforms, we synthesized novel cyanostilbene (CS) deriva-tives featuring the 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl moiety. These derivatives were investigated for their emission properties in both solution and solid states. The two simple CS derivatives exhibit very weak luminescence in solution but significant luminescence in the solid state, indicating distinct Aggregation-Induced Emission (AIE) characteristic. Furthermore, combining these two CS units, without conjugation and with quasi perpendicular orientation, results in Dual-State Emission (DSE) fluorophore showing luminescence both in solution and solid states. X-ray crys-tallography studies on the solid-state compounds reveal a structure-emission relationship, demonstrating that the colour emission correlates with the conformations adopted by the mol-ecules in the solid state, which influence the type of stacking.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84c6036957d21d3815f915e19f5c1af3e4b3a841932d9b98baccf81f9a7ea928","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
