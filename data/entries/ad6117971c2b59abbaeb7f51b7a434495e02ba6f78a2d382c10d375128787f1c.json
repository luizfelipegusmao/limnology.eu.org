These approaches are accelerating biomedical research from basic research, drug design and systems level cell biology. CryoEM studies are becoming more routine in the structural sciences leading to the adoption and installation of new cryoEM equipment in research institutions. Therefore, there is a growing need to establish best practices within the field and lower barriers to access to the latest cryoEM technology. To address these demands, the NIH Common Fund established the Transformative High Resolution Cryo-Electron Microscopy program [<a href=\"#ozae044.443-B1\">1</a>]. As part of this program, the National Center for CryoEM Access and Training (NCCAT) is an NIH-sponsored service center housed at the New York Structural Biology Center (NYSBC) that offers nationwide access to cryoEM instrumentation, screening, and training at no cost at the point of access.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ad6117971c2b59abbaeb7f51b7a434495e02ba6f78a2d382c10d375128787f1c","category":"Environment"}
