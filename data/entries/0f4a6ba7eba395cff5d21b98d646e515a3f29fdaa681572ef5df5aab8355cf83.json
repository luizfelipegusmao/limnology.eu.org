The correlation between smoking, smoking cessation and serum α-klotho levels remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between smoking, smoking cessation and serum α-klotho levels. This cross-sectional study finally included 4877 participants, aged 40–79 years, who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey studies from 2013 to 2016. Of these, 2312 (47.4%) were men and 894 (18.3%) were current smokers, and the mean age of the participants was 57.8±10.7 years. Multivariate linear regression modeling was used to assess the association between smoking, smoking cessation and serum α-klotho levels. After adjustment for multiple confounders, this study observed that smoking was negatively associated with serum α-klotho levels (β: -58.3; 95% confidence interval CI: -82.0 to -34.6; p&lt;0.001), whereas smoking cessation was positively associated with serum α-klotho levels (β: 52.3; 95% CI: 24.1 to 80.6; p&lt;0.001). In subgroup and interaction analyses, <i>p</i>-value for the interaction between smoking and race on serum klotho levels was found to be less than 0.001. The correlation between smoking, smoking cessation and serum α-klotho levels remained stable after propensity score matching (β: -54.1; 95% CI: -81.5 to -26.7; <i>p</i>&lt;0.001, β: 54.8; 95% CI: 24.2 to 85.4; <i>p</i>&lt;0.001). In a large sample population, the present study found that smoking, smoking cessation and serum α-klotho levels were associated in opposite directions.","author":"Ting Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0f4a6ba7eba395cff5d21b98d646e515a3f29fdaa681572ef5df5aab8355cf83","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
