{"title":"CJE-PCHF: Chinese Joint Entity and Relation Extraction Model based on Progressive Contrastive Learning and Heterogeneous Feature Fusion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2384/v1","date":1722310008000,"content":"The joint extraction of entities and relations is a critical task in information extraction, and its performance directly affects the performance of downstream tasks. However, existing joint extraction models based on deep learning exhibit weak processing capabilities for the phenomenon of multiple pronunciations of one character and multiple characters of one pronunciation when processing Chinese texts, resulting in performance loss. To address these issues, this paper introduces part-of-speech (POS) and pinyin features to aid the model in learning semantic features that are more contextually appropriate. A Chinese Joint Entity and Relation Extraction Model based on Progressive Contrastive Learning and Heterogeneous Feature Fusion is proposed (CJE-PCHF). During model training, an interactive fusion network based on progressive contrastive learning is employed to learn the dependencies between pinyin, POS, and semantic features. This guides the model in heterogeneous feature fusion, capturing higher-order semantic associations between heterogeneous features. On the commonly used DuIE evaluation dataset for joint extraction, this model achieved a significant improvement, with the F1 score increasing by 5.4% compared to the benchmark model CasRel.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e233d5900725abab6c05ca4c66c48a3f24cee622dfabf9db29918464bdb98b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
