{"title":"3D FEM Modeling of Polish Apple &lsquo;Chopin&rsquo;: Elastic vs. Elastoplastic Behavior Across Maturity Stages","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0987/v1","date":1726125788000,"content":"The paper presents two procedures for creating 3D discrete models of apple using the finite element method (FEM). The study focused on a new Polish apple variety, Chopin at development, ripening, and senescence maturity stages. The analysis of the results allowed for the determination that, depending on the desired outcomes, the parenchymal tissue can be considered as a material with either elastic or elastoplastic properties. Model validation was performed using displacement-force relationships and changes in contact area as a function of loading force obtained from compression tests. Elastoplastic models reflect empirical studies much better. The fit of the elastic models, based on force vs. displacement curves, ranged from 79% to 83%, while the fit of the elastoplastic models to empirical data ranged from 91% to 96%. Elastic models, on the other hand, are well-suited to the modified force vs. displacement curves, which reflect the elastic behavior of apples under compression test. Contour plots of pressures for elastoplastic models align much better with the test results than those for elastic models. 4.           Similarly, in the case of contact area values, the elastoplastic models outperformed the elastic models, achieving a fit between 92% and 96%, while the elastic models reached only 82% to 83% compliance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dafb09173dd7e9241f9a01f701c3680318d4e5235719f4bdfcd951ae120d7413","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
