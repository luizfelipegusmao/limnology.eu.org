Transgender individuals can be treated with gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). A robust method for monitoring breast volume changes is critical to be able to study the effects of feminizing GAHT. The primary aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of three 3D devices (Vectra XT, Artec LEO and iPhone XR) for measuring modest breast volume differences using a mannequin. The secondary aim of this study was to evaluate these methods in several performance domains. We used reference prostheses of increasing volumes and compared the volumes using GOM-inspect software. For Vectra XT 3D images, manufacturer-provided software was used to calculate volumes as well. The scanning methods were ranked based on their performance in a total of five categories: volume estimations, costs, user-friendliness, test subject-friendliness and technical aspects. The 3D models analyzed with GOM-inspect showed relative mean estimate differences from the actual volumes of 9.1% for the Vectra XT, 7.3% for the Artec LEO and 14% for the iPhone XR. For the Vectra XT models analyzed with the built-in software this was 6.2%. Root mean squared errors (RMSE) calculated based on the GOM-inspect volume analyses showed mean RMSEs of 2.27, 2.54 and 8.93 for the Vectra XT, Artec LEO and iPhone XR, respectively. The Vectra software had a mean RMSE of 3.00. In the combined performance ranking, the Vectra XT had the most favorable ranking, followed by the Artec LEO and the iPhone XR. The Vectra XT and Artec LEO are the preferred scanners to monitor breast development due to the combination of higher accuracy and overall performance. The current study shows that 3D techniques can be used to adequately measure modest breast volume differences and therefore will be useful to study for example breast changes in transgender individuals using feminizing GAHT. These observations may also be relevant in other fields of 3D imaging research.","author":"Benthe A. M.
