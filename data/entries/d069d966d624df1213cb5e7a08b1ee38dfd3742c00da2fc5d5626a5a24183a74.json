{"title":"Effects of religion, politics and distance to providers on HPV vaccine attitudes and intentions of parents in rural Utah","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312549","date":1729692000000,"content":"<p>by Abigail A.

Poole</p>\r\nPurpose <p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes an estimated 300,000 high grade cervical dysplasias and 36,000 preventable cancers each year in the United States alone. Despite having a safe, effective and long lasting vaccine since 2006, the rate of uptake has been suboptimal, particularly in rural areas. In 2020, Utah ranked near last in teenage HPV vaccination rates with rural areas trailing urban areas by about 18 percent. In this study, we identified factors that affect the intent of rural Utah parents to vaccinate their children against HPV.</p> Methods <p>A survey was distributed electronically to Utah residents in rural areas. Recruitment was carried out through targeted advertising, community organizations, and professional survey panels. The survey was open from Nov. 15, 2022 to April 15, 2023. A total of 410 respondents were used for analysis. Survey results were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling.</p> Findings <p>Distance to care was shown to negatively influence direct intent to vaccinate, while trust in government, general vaccine attitudes, and HPV knowledge positively influence intent to vaccinate. It was found that religious practice decreased vaccine hesitancy while cautious sexual attitudes, distance to care, and general negative vaccine attitudes increased vaccine hesitancy. Conservative political identity and high income were both shown to decrease vaccine hesitancy as covariates.</p>","author":"Abigail A.
