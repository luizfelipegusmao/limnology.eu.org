{"title":"Precious Cargo: The Role of Polymeric Nanoparticles in the Delivery of Covalent Drugs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0530/v1","date":1725621683000,"content":"Covalent drugs can offer significant advantages over noncovalent drugs, in terms of pharmacodynamics (i.e. target-binding properties). However, the development of covalent drugs is sometimes hampered by pharmacokinetic limitations (e.g. low bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and toxicity due to off-target binding). Polymeric nanoparticles offer a potential solution to these limitations. Delivering covalent drugs via polymeric nanoparticles provides myriad benefits in terms of drug solubility; permeability; lifetime; selectivity; controlled release; and the opportunity for synergistic administration alongside other drugs. In this short review, we examine each of these benefits in turn, illustrated through multiple case-studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a393d0a0f611b4302b9fec4cb79223fbb7a9558dc3e967ba67fb2e6a9addb754","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
