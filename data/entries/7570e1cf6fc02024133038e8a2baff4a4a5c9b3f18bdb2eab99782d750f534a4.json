{"title":"How Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Affects Hypertension: Pathophysiology and Prevention","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0653/v1","date":1728532290000,"content":"More than 5% of the global population suffers from disabling hearing loss, primarily sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). SNHL is often caused by factors such as vascular disorders, viral infections, ototoxic drugs, systemic inflammation, age-related labyrinthine membrane degeneration, and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). NIHL, in particular, leads to changes in blood-labyrinth-barrier (BLB) physiology, increased permeability, and various cardiovascular health issues, including hypertension, diabetes, neurological disorders, and adverse reproductive outcomes: Research has connected an elevated risk of hypertension with loud noise. The endocrine and autonomic nervous systems are also linked to arousal following an acute exposure to loud sounds. As a preventive option for both NIHL and hypertension as sequela of noise trauma, we present the transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS). taVNS may be appropriate to prevent NIHL-associated hypertension, as it typically reduces blood pressure and improves heart rate variability. On the other hand, normalizing cerebral blood flow preserves cochlear homeostasis, which is maintained by the BLB.The paper provides a comprehensive overview of NIHL pathophysiology and the impact of noise on auditory structures and function. Our research focuses on the auditory structures and functions affected by noise, such as the strial BLB, as well as the autonomic changes caused by NIHL, specifically the emergence of NIHL-associated hypertension as a primary comorbidity. We describe the clear link between taVNS use and increased HRV and slower progression of chronic hypertension, and we propose it as a cutting-edge preventive option for both conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7570e1cf6fc02024133038e8a2baff4a4a5c9b3f18bdb2eab99782d750f534a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
