Christina Nilavu, T. Leelasree, Himanshu Aggarwal, N. Rajesh<br />Increased energy consumption from continued economic expansion generates environmental challenges and health hazards from burning fuel containing sulfur compounds. We explore the effectiveness of a cobalt-based MOF, BITSH-1, as an adsorbent to remove thiophene from model fuel.<br />To cite this article before page numbers are assigned, use the DOI form of citation above.<br />The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"RSC - Sustainable Energy Fuels latest articles","siteHash":"9be9f536dce043fccd3d0947c04e723c9e53cf87a00631cd30d4859e37580993","entryHash":"54799c1ec36bfebb21204e3270a8d681458194ed5f0b24c6509cdb255094e4ed","category":"Environment"}
