{"title":"Validation of Greulich and Pyle Atlas for Radiological Bone Age Assessment in Pediatric Population from the Canary Islands","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0071/v1","date":1725266988000,"content":"Accurate assessment of bone age (BA) is crucial for pediatric clinical practice. This study validated the Radiological Reference Atlas for Bone Age in the Canary Islands Population with a total of 203 anteroposterior left hand and wrist radiographs from healthy children (91 females, 112 males) across preschool, school-age, and adolescent stages. Intra-observer agreement, assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (BAA1: ICC = 1.000, BAA2: ICC = 0.995, BAA3: ICC = 0.943), showed differing levels of precision among assessors. Inter-observer agreement was high (Pearsonâ€™s r = 0.905 - 0.951), suggesting consistent evaluations across different expertise levels. Accuracy analysis revealed significant BA underestimation compared to chronological age (CA) in preschool (MD = -17.036 months, p &lt; 0.001) and school-age (MD = -8.165 months, p &lt; 0.001) groups, but closer agreement in teenagers (MD = -0.33 months, p = 0.550). Furthermore, a relevant underestimation in the teenage stage for girls compared to boys was also noted. These findings underscore the atlas's precision; however, its accuracy for BA assessment in younger children and adolescent girls needs to be approached with caution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"683ff92f88053c9d075e055fe211c945309c21c2f48aec619e9645f4c88551cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
