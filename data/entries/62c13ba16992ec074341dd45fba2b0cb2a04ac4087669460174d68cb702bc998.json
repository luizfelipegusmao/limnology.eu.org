However, electronic devices may experience a large temperature range during their service life, which introduces mechanical stresses into these solder joints due to misfits in thermal expansion coefficients (CTE) between the various parts in the multi-material device [<a href=\"#ozae044.106-B1\">1–3</a>]. When a device is thermally cycled, these stresses cause fatigue in the solder, which ultimately leads to fatigue cracking of the solder in the vicinity of the chip- and PCB-interfaces [<a href=\"#ozae044.106-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.106-B4\">4</a>], impairing the solder’s electrical and thermal conductivity [<a href=\"#ozae044.106-B4\">4</a>] and ultimately resulting in failure of the device. In recent years, efforts have been made to improve the fatigue resistance of Sn – 3.0 wt.% Ag – 0.5 wt.% Cu (SAC305) solder alloys, which are commonly used in micro- and power-electronics. The predominant fatigue mechanism in SAC305 solders is intergranular fatigue cracking [<a href=\"#ozae044.106-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.106-B3\">3</a>]. One approach to enhance fatigue strength in SAC305 is adding Bi to the alloy, which acts as a solid solution strengthener (Bi content ≤ 2.5 wt.% [<a href=\"#ozae044.106-B5\">5</a>]), increasing its yield strength and hence delaying recrystallisation and subsequent intergranular cracking [<a href=\"#ozae044.106-B6\">6</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"62c13ba16992ec074341dd45fba2b0cb2a04ac4087669460174d68cb702bc998","category":"Environment"}
