Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many peer support stroke programs in Canada have been delivered virtually. Compassion must be consistently applied to build meaningful interactions, but the shift to virtual services may have changed the quality of interaction and compassion in virtual services. While compassion is recommended in health and social services to improve outcomes, satisfaction, and service quality, compassion in virtual peer support stroke programs remains understudied. We aimed to describe compassionate support in virtual peer support stroke programs from peer support providers’ and recipients’ perspectives.</p> Methods <p>This qualitative descriptive study was guided by Sinclair &amp; colleagues’ model of compassion. Peer support recipients or peer support providers participated in interviews transcribed and analyzed using a hybrid thematic analysis.</p> Results <p>Sixteen were peer support recipients, six were peer support providers, and two were both peer support providers and recipients. Participants agreed that compassion was essential in these programs. Participants perceived compassion to be a result of the virtues of compassionate facilitators (i.e., genuineness, passion, and empathy), relational space, and communication within the virtual peer support stroke program (e.g., sense of awareness or intuition of compassion, aspects of engaged peer support provision), virtuous response (e.g., knowing the person and actions that made the peer support recipient feel like a priority). Compassion was facilitated by listening and understanding peer support recipients’ needs as they relate to stroke (i.e., seeking to understand peer support recipients and their needs), attending to peer support recipients’ needs (e.g., timely actions to address their needs), and achieving compassion-related program outcomes (e.g., alleviating challenges and enhancing wellbeing). The absence of these components (e.g., lacking genuineness, passion and empathy) was a barrier to compassion in virtual peer support stroke programs.</p> Conclusions <p>Study findings describe facilitators and barriers to perceived compassion in virtual peer support stroke programs and provide practical recommendations that can be adapted into programs to improve program quality.</p>","author":"Hardeep Singh","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d762b88b665344b0c6a0cdfc3937ef2f09d079a556a6585baaca773ef20255f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
