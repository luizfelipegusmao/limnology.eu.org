{"title":"Degnala in Buffaloes: A Review on a Neglected Disease?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1328/v1","date":1721125964000,"content":"Degnala is one of the main mycotoxicoses that affects buffaloes, and the fungus Fusarium spp. is the main causative agent. This disease is strongly related to the supply of rice straw to buffaloes and is considered endemic to regions where this crop is cultivated. Cases of the disease are concentrated in the winter, when conditions favour fungal growth in inadequately stored rice straw. Degnala is characterized by necrosis and gangrene of the extremities, including the tail, lower limbs, ears, tongue, muzzle and teats. The pelvic limbs are more affected than the thoracic limbs. A tortuous appearance of the tail is very common, and cracks or corneal loss of the hooves may occur, with exposure of the blades and even the bones. There is no diagnostic method for identifying the disease in animals other than the clinical and epidemiological criteria associated with fungal culture of rice straw samples. There is no treatment that neutralizes the effects of the toxins, and the treatment currently used is a palliative and supportive method consisting of pentasulfate solution, anti-Degnala liquid, 2% nitroglycerin ointment and broad-spectrum antibiotics for secondary infections. In addition, the management of drying straw and proper storage are essential for controlling this disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9a8fa93c59a11dcff8faea24aed80dfbceed79680089b1c92043522ab0bd51d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
