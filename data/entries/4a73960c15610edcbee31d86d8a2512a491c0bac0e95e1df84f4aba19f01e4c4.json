{"title":"In Vitro Investigation Using a New Biomechanical Force-Torque Analysis System: Comparison of Conventional and CAD/CAM Fixed Orthodontic Retainers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0924/v1","date":1726065702000,"content":"(1) Background: To further investigate the link between inadvertent tooth movements (ITMs) and mechanical properties of different retainers, the response upon vertical loading was compared in three different retainers (two stainless steel and one nickel-titanium). The influence of different reference teeth was also considered. (2) Methods: Three retainers (R1, R2, R3) were tested in a newly developed biomechanical analysis system (FRANS). They were bonded to 3D-printed models of the lower anterior jaw and vertically displaced up to 0.3mm. Developing forces and moments were recorded at the center of force. (3) Results: The vertical displacement caused vertical forces (Fz) and labiolingual moments (My) to arise. These were highest in the lateral incisors (up to 2.35±0.59N and 9.27±5.86Nmm for R1; 1.69±1.06N and 7.42±2.65Nmm for R2; 3.28±1.73N and 15.91±9.71Nmm for R3) for all analyzed retainers, and with the R3 retainer for all analyzed reference teeth, while the lowest Fz and My values were recorded with the R1 retainer. (4) Conclusions: Displacements of 0.2mm and larger provided forces and moments which could be sufficient to cause unwanted torque movements, such as ITMs in all analyzed retainers. Clinicians must be mindful of these risks and perform posttreatment checkups on patients with retainers of all materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a73960c15610edcbee31d86d8a2512a491c0bac0e95e1df84f4aba19f01e4c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
