{"title":"Effect of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei K56 with galactooligosaccharide synbiotics on obese individuals: an in vitro fermentation model","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13359?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The use of synbiotics is emerging as a promising intervention strategy for regulating the gut microbiota and for preventing or reducing obesity, in comparison with the use of probiotics or prebiotics alone. A previous <i>in vivo</i> study revealed that <i>Lacticaseibacillus paracasei</i> K56 (<i>L. paracasei</i> K56) could alleviate obesity induced in high-fat-diet mice; however, the effect of the synbiotic combination of <i>L. paracasei</i> K56 and prebiotics in obese individuals has not been explored fully.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The effect of prebiotics on the proliferation of <i>L. paracasei</i> K56 was determined by spectrophotometry. The results showed that polydextrose (PG), xylooligosaccharide (XOS), and galactooligosaccharide (GOS) had a greater potential to be used as substrates for <i>L. paracase</i>i K56 than three other prebiotics (melitose, stachyose, and mannan-oligosaccharide). An <i>in vitro</i> fermentation model based on the feces of ten obese female volunteers was then established. The results revealed that K56_GOS showed a significant increase in GOS degradation rate and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content, and a decrease in gas levels, compared with PG, XOS, GOS, K56_PG, and K56_XOS. Changes in these microbial biomarkers, including a significant increase in Bacteroidota<i>, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium</i>, and <i>Blautia</i> and a decrease in the Firmicutes<i>/</i>Bacteroidota ratio and <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i> in the K56_GOS group, were associated with increased SCFA content and decreased gas levels.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study demonstrates the effect of the synbiotic combination of <i>L. paracasei</i> K56 and GOS on obese individuals and indicates its potential therapeutic role in obesity treatment. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Qi Zhang, \nWen Zhao, \nJingjing He, \nJian He, \nShaoqi Shi, \nMeiwen Sun, \nXiaokang Niu, \nZhaozhong Zeng, \nYuyang Zhao, \nYongxiang Zhang, \nPengjie Wang, \nYixuan Li, \nChao Zhang, \nSufang Duan, \nWei‐lian Hung, \nRan Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"d533b4b2b5302035ba86f392ba575beef715300c5a3d4c03d901f535f8606630","category":"Environment"}
