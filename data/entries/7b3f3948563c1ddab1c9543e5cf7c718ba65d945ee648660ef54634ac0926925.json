{"title":"Solid Lipid Nanoparticles, an Alternative for the Treatment of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1829/v1","date":1721745734000,"content":"Within the field of nanomedicine, which is revolutionizing cancer treatment, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have shown advantages over conventional chemotherapy when tested on cancer cells in preclinical studies. SLNs have proven to be an innovative strategy for the treatment of tri-ple-negative breast cancer cells, providing greater efficiency than existing treatments in various studies. The encapsulation of antineoplastic drugs in SLNs has facilitated a sustained, controlled, and targeted release, which enhances therapeutic efficiency and reduces adverse effects. Moreover, the surface of SLNs can be modified to increase efficiency. For instance, the coating of these particles with polyethylene glycol (PEG) decreases their opsonization, resulting in a longer life in the circulatory system. The creation of positively charged cationic SLNs (cSLNs), achieved by the utilization of surfactants or ionic lipids with positively charged structural groups, increases their affinity for cell membranes and plasma proteins. Hyaluronic acid has been added to SLNs, so that the distinct pH of tumor cells, would stimulate the release of the drug and/or genetic materi-al. The current revision summarizes the recent research on SLNs, focusing on the encapsulation and transport of therapeutic agents with a cytotoxic effect on triple-negative breast cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b3f3948563c1ddab1c9543e5cf7c718ba65d945ee648660ef54634ac0926925","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
