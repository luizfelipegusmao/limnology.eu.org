{"title":"Association of Inflammasome Gene Expression Levels with Pathogenesis of Familial Mediterranean Fever in Armenians","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0130/v1","date":1727920946000,"content":"Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a genetically determined autoinflammatory disease transmitted by an autosomal recessive mechanism. The cause of the nosology is point mutations of the MEFV (Mediterranean FeVer) gene coding for pyrin protein. Inflammasomes are molecular platforms altered in autoinflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of inflammasome genes (p65, Casp-1, MEFV-d2, MEFV-I, NLRP3) in patients with FMF compared to controls to understand the changes that may play a key role in disease development. We found altered expression levels of the full-length MEFV isoform as well as Casp1 and p65 in FMF patients versus controls. This, once again highlighted the significance of inflammasome genes in terms of FMF.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cb7c05f3ba4b473b872da818c9666e1c139212cf5b4d8a99b50dee42ac0c2c62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
