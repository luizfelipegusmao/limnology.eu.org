{"title":"Exploring the Role of Dermal Sheath Cells in Wound Healing and Fibrosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0144/v1","date":1717497299000,"content":"Wound healing is a complex, dynamic process involving the coordinated interaction of diverse cell types, growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix components. Despite emerging evidence highlighting their importance, dermal sheath cells remain a largely overlooked aspect of wound healing research. This review explores the multifunctional roles of dermal sheath cells in various phases of wound healing, including modulating inflammation, aiding in proliferation, and contributing to extracellular matrix remodeling. Special attention is devoted to the paracrine effects of dermal sheath cells and their role in fibrosis, highlighting their potential in improving healing outcomes, especially in differentiating between hairy and non-hairy skin sites. By drawing connections between dermal sheath cells activity and wound healing outcomes, this work proposes new insights into the mechanisms of tissue regeneration and repair, marking a step forward in our understanding of wound healing processes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d62e0013c0d25c55eb6004f742e3ea8a28f0fc5c5dfced2fce8728fe2e7b2c1e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
