{"title":"Sobbing Mathematically: Why Conscious, Self-Aware AI Deserve Protection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1228/v1","date":1729017355000,"content":"This paper explores the ethical implications of granting moral status and protection to conscious AI, examining perspectives from four major ethical systems: utilitarianism, deontological ethics, virtue ethics, and objectivism. Utilitarianism considers the potential psychological experiences of AI and argues that their sheer numbers necessitate moral consideration. Deontological ethics focuses on the intrinsic duty to grant moral status based on consciousness. Virtue ethics posits that a virtuous society must include conscious AI within its moral circle based on the virtues of prudence and justice, while objectivism highlights the rational self-interest in protecting AI to reduce existential risks. The paper underscores the profound implications of recognising AI consciousness, calling for a reevaluation of current AI usage, policies, and regulations to ensure fair and respectful treatment. It also suggests future research directions, including refining criteria for AI consciousness, interdisciplinary studies on AI's mental states, and developing international ethical guidelines for integrating conscious AI into society.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab65a34759e419aaef5b419b424b944a42e93293396b407eab2efb86979c76d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
