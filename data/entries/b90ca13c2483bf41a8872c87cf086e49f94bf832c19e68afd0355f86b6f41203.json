{"title":"Pollution and health risk assessments related to heavy metals on three prominent beaches in Makkah Province, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Concerning levels of cadmium pollution","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311189","date":1729519200000,"content":"<p>by Abdulaziz Alayyafi, Mohammad Ebqa’ai, Omar Alboqai, Ahmed Abotaleb, Ahmed Eldesoky, Abeer El Shahawy</p>\r\n\r\nBeach pollution can impact the health of people living in or visiting coastal areas. The primary goal of this research was to investigate the presence of heavy metal pollutants and associated health risks in three distinct coastal cities, Jeddah, Al-Lith, and Al-Qunfudhah, located along Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea coast. Forty-three soil samples were collected from different locations, heavy metals including Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Cd, and Pb were isolated, and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. Various metrics such as pollution indices (PI), integrated pollution indices (IPI), enrichment factors (EF), daily dose averages (ADD), hazard quotients (HQ), and hazard indices (HI), as well as principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were employed to evaluate the environmental impacts and health risks posed by these heavy metals. The results revealed that Fe, Pb, Cu, Mn, and Zn concentrations in beach zones were below their respective background levels, while concentrations of Cd exceeded corresponding background levels. PCA revealed the highest levels of Pb, Fe, and Mn on Al-Qundudah beach, while Cd and Cu were highest on Al-Lith beach, and Zn was highest on Jeddah beach. PI values highlighted extremely high levels of Cd pollution on all designated beaches. The findings provide a foundational basis for further investigations into health problems potentially related to Cd contamination, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), osteomalacia, and osteoporosis.","author":"Abdulaziz Alayyafi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b90ca13c2483bf41a8872c87cf086e49f94bf832c19e68afd0355f86b6f41203","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
