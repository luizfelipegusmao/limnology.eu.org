{"title":"Milestone Description of Indonesian Development Tasks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1337/v1","date":1724116415000,"content":"Developmental tasks are formed from an analysis of the culture and social demands in which the individual lives and interacts. Developmental psychology defines Milestones as substantial progress in a developmental task. When a person is able to complete developmental tasks at his stage, that person will be happy and consider his development according to his stage. So far, the current developmental tasks are different from the situation and social demands in Indonesia. Thus, the overview of development tasks has yet to be depicted in the psychological development of Indonesians. The aim of the study was to formulate developmental tasks according to the social environment. This research method was carried out through a survey that was distributed online in all regions of Indonesia. The development task screening questionnaire was prepared according to Havighurst's developmental tasks, including a description of open input at each stage. Respondents involved in the study were 345 participants, with a ratio of 78 men and 287 women. The age range of the respondents was 17 years to 63 years. Respondents came from 19 provinces, which means 50 percent of the total number of new provinces in Indonesia. Based on the number of major islands in Indonesia, the respondents represented 4 out of 5 islands or 80%. Hence, the research results can be used to describe Indonesian people. The results show that each stage of development has task contradictions, loss of developmental tasks, addition of developmental tasks and mutual substitution at the previous and subsequent stages. The details at each stage are possible to be elaborated in further studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f57f2526c96192df5ebf55d6b423010e9b6a48313284487359e97ba0d8b8942","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
