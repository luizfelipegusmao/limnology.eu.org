{"title":"Electrolyte Imbalance in Acute Traumatic Brain Injury: Insights from the First 24 Hours","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0941/v1","date":1723552781000,"content":"Electrolyte disturbances are common in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly affecting sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium levels. This study aims to provide insights into these disturbances within the first 24 hours post-injury. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 50 TBI patients, excluding those with conditions affecting electrolyte balance. Electrolyte levels were measured, and correlations with demographic data, trauma mechanisms, imaging findings, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores were analyzed. Results indicated that chloride levels inversely correlated with GCS scores (œÅ = -0.515; p = 0.002), suggesting that elevated chloride may indicate severe neurological impairment. Potassium levels were significantly associated with subdural hematoma (p = 0.032) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (p = 0.043), highlighting their potential as markers for severe brain injuries. No significant associations were found between sodium or calcium levels and the studied variables. These findings underscore the importance of early monitoring of chloride and potassium levels in TBI patients to improve management and outcomes. Future research should focus on larger, multi-center studies to validate these findings and develop comprehensive guidelines for managing electrolyte imbalances in TBI patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6cf1beae9643b94f4897e92f5d009cbd5b5fc89a2db13d75eaf673307deb124c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
