{"title":"Optical Color Image Encryption Algorithm Based on Two‚ÄêDimensional Quantum Walking (OCT)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0577/v1","date":1712579842000,"content":"The Double Random Phase Encoding (DRPE) image encryption method has garnered significant attention in color image processing and optical encryption, thanks to its parallel encryption of R, G, B. However, DRPE-based color image encryption faces two challenges. Firstly, it disregards the correlation of R, G, and B, compromising the encrypted image's robustness. Secondly, DRPE schemes relying on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform (DFRFT) are vulnerable to linear attacks, such as Known Plaintext Attack (KPA) and Chosen Plaintext Attack (CPA). Quantum walk stands out as a remarkable tool for designing modern cryptographic mechanisms, offering resistance to potential attacks from both classical and quantum computers.Therefore, this study presents an optical color image encryption algorithm that combines two-dimensional quantum walk with 24-bit plane permutation, dubbed OCT. This approach employs pseudo-random numbers generated by Two-Dimensional Quantum Walking (TDQW) for phase modulation in DRPE and scrambles the encrypted image's real and imaginary parts using the Generalized Arnold Transform. The 24-bit plane permutation helps reduce correlation of the R, G, B, while the Generalized Arnold Transform bolsters DRPE's resistance to linear attacks. By incorporating TDQW, the key space is significantly expanded. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and security of proposed method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b3078d88627f044b224625619595c2df4d85d9976dbe2ae0acea73eca56f4b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
