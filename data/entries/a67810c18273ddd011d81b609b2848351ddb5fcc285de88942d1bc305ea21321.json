{"title":"Leveraging Digitized Heritage Technologies for Smart Management: Heritage Safeguarding and Interpretation Framework","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0718/v1","date":1728537230000,"content":"Digitized heritage is regarded as an emerging field, with existing studies primarily focusing on one case study or technological aspect. Thus, there remains a notable gap in the literature regarding the understanding of how these technologies can be utilized in smart heritage management. Approaches that harness technological advancements to enhance smart management and aid the decision-making process regarding the use of appropriate technology at various heritage sites remain insufficiently explored. To address this gap, this study conducted a cross-case analysis to survey the use of heritage technologies across selected cases to find underlying trends and correlations related to the scale and technology used. The findings of this study provide insights into the nexus of technology integration into heritage management, highlighting the role of tangible heritage documentation technologies. The present study concludes that smart management framework necessitates an ongoing process involving the integration of cultural heritage data, documentation, and the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT facilitates the connectivity of physical items to the internet, thereby supporting the safeguarding and interpretation of cultural heritage knowledge. Such framework operates through a collaboration platform that engages experts, local communities, and tourists to ensure a meaningful and interactive interconnection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a67810c18273ddd011d81b609b2848351ddb5fcc285de88942d1bc305ea21321","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
