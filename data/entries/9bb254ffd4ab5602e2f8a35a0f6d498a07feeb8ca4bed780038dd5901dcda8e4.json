As a type of cis-regulatory element, enhancers increase the transcription initiation rate when bound by specific transcription factors (TFs). Despite their importance, work on identifying enhancers and characterizing their roles in coordinating the activity of TFs in plants lags significantly behind research in animals. With notable advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, this presents an exciting opportunity to delve into the study of cis-elements in plants. In this issue, <strong>Tobias Jores, Jackson Tonnies, and colleagues (</strong><a href=\"#koae121-B2\">Jores et al. 2024</a><strong>)</strong> have provided an in-depth understanding of how 3 light-responsive enhancers function, both cooperatively and additively.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"9bb254ffd4ab5602e2f8a35a0f6d498a07feeb8ca4bed780038dd5901dcda8e4","category":"Environment"}
