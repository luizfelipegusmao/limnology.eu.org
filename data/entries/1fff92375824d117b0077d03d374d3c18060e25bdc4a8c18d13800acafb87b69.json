{"title":"Variation in the Health Status of the Mediterranean Gorgonian Forests: The Synergistic Effect of Marine Heat Waves and Fishing Activity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1460/v1","date":1718889939000,"content":"Over the past thirty years, the red gorgonian Paramuricea clavata in the Mediterranean Sea has faced increasing threats, including heat waves and human activities such as fishing and diving. Epibiosis on damaged gorgonian colonies is generally used as an indirect indication of stressed conditions. The density and height of P. clavata and the percentage of colonies affected by epibiosis and entangled in lost fishing gear were studied to investigate the phenomenon and its trend over time in the Ligurian Sea. Analyses were based on transects collected during ROV campaigns between 2015 and 2022 at depths of 33-90 meters. A strong correlation was observed between fishing effort in the study area and the level of epibiosis. Maximal percentages of colonies affected by epibiosis and entanglement were recorded at depths of 50-70 meters. Temporally, marine heat waves before 2019 were identified as the primary cause of damage to P. clavata. The decrease in epibiosis percentages after 2019, despite the 2022 heat wave, may be due to a quick recovery ability of the populations and a reduction in fishing activities during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Long-term monitoring programs are essential to understand the changes in marine benthic communities exposed to different stressors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1fff92375824d117b0077d03d374d3c18060e25bdc4a8c18d13800acafb87b69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
