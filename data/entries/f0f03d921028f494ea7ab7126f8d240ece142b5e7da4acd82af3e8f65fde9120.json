{"title":"Questioning the Lorentz Factor in Special Relativity Based on the Value of the Maximum Anisotropy of Light Speed in the Michelson-Morley Experiment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2433/v1","date":1727702720000,"content":"Newton's classical dynamics accurately describes the motion of objects moving at speeds much less than the speed of light and has been extensively validated under these conditions. Any new dynamics formula must reduce to Newton's equations at low velocities. Einstein's theory of special relativity, which utilizes the Lorentz factor, provides a revised view of space-time and also conforms to Newton's equations for low speeds. However, the Lorentz factor assumes that the maximum anisotropy of the speed of light is zero, a condition not fully supported by experimental evidence. The Michelson-Morley Experiment, conducted at a speed far less than that of light, suggests that while the measured anisotropy is very small, it is not zero. This small value could imply the existence of undiscovered physical laws. To address this, we propose the Yuyunrui factor, which includes two hyperparameters, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), encompassing various possible models. In this framework, the Lorentz factor represents a special case with \\((\\alpha=0, \\beta=1)\\) and zero anisotropy. We categorize the \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) combinations into four broad types based on their scaling effects and describe these in detail. Future experiments at higher speeds will be essential to accurately determine the true value of the maximum anisotropy of the speed of light and to refine the proposed factor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0f03d921028f494ea7ab7126f8d240ece142b5e7da4acd82af3e8f65fde9120","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
