{"title":"Cosmic Theory of Structure (CTS): A Validated Universal Model Integrating Gravity and Quantum Physics (CTS v2)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1233/v5","date":1719405815000,"content":"The Cosmic Theory of Structure (CTS) model presents a comprehensive framework that integrates gravitational waves, neutrinos, dark matter, and quantum field interactions. This model aims to provide a unified understanding of the universe's formation and evolution. The CTS model has undergone rigorous validation using the latest datasets, demonstrating its robustness and predictive power. Key updates include detailed mathematical formulations, refined theoretical frameworks, and enhanced descriptions of fundamental cosmic phenomena. This manuscript presents the final validated version of the CTS model, highlighting its alignment with observational data and its implications for future research in cosmology and quantum physics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"87216641e0c79209ca71180c2dd1d854e68d10ad8fccedf83efec3956d4b52a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
