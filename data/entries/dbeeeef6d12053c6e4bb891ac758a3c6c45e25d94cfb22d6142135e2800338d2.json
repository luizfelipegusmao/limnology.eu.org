This report presents the synthesis of a butanamide derived from linking 5-chloro-2-aminobenzoxazole and 2-aminobenzothiazole via 4-chlorobutanoyl chloride. The corresponding compound N-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-4-((5-chlorobenzoxazol-2-yl)aminobutanamide was obtained 76 % yield global using accessible starting materials and methodology in two reaction steps. Furthermore, we made docking studies of this compound on 3-TOP protein to explore its potential as an antidiabetic agent.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbeeeef6d12053c6e4bb891ac758a3c6c45e25d94cfb22d6142135e2800338d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
