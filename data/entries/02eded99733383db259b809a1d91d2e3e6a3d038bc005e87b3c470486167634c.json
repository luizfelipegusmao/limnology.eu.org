Ayanore, Elijah Bisung</p>\r\n\r\nVaccine hesitancy is considered one of the ten threats to global health. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitancy may undermine efforts toward controlling or preventing the disease. Nevertheless, limited research has examined vaccine hesitance, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It is thus imperative to examine how institutional trust and conspiracy belief in tandem influence the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. Using data (n = 2059) from a cross-sectional study in Ghana, this study examines the association between institutional trust, conspiracy beliefs, and vaccine uptake among adults in Ghana using logistics regression. The regression model (model 3) adjusted for variables such as marital status, age, gender, employment, income, and political affiliations. The results show that individuals were significantly less likely to be vaccinated if they did not trust institutions (OR = .421, CI = .232–.531). Similarly, we found that individuals who believed in conspiracy theories surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine were less likely to be vaccinated (OR = .734, CI = .436–.867). We also found that not having a COVID-19-related symptom is associated with vaccine refusal (OR = .069, CI = .008–.618). Similarly, compared to those with a vaccine history, those without a vaccine history are less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine (OR = .286, CI = .108–.756). In conclusion, our results demonstrate the need for enhanced education to tackle conspiracy beliefs about the disease and enhance vaccine uptake. Given the role of trust in effecting attitudinal change, building trust and credibility among the institutions responsible for vaccinations ought to be prioritized.","author":"Meshack Achore","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"02eded99733383db259b809a1d91d2e3e6a3d038bc005e87b3c470486167634c","category":"Environment"}
