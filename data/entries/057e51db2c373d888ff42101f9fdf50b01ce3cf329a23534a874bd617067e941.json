{"title":"Cultural values and digital gap: Overview of behavioral patterns","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311390","date":1727791200000,"content":"<p>by Maral Jamalova</p>\r\n\r\nThe study uses different statistical techniques to understand the relationship between variables explaining the digital divide and classification based on The Inglehart-Welzel Cultural Map for 2023. To achieve this purpose variables focusing on Digital Penetration (the percentage of internet and social media users and mobile cellular connections), Operating Systems share (iOS and Android), Device Traffic (laptop/mobile phone-based web traffic) as well as Mobile Commerce variables (bills and payments using mobile internet) were included in the analysis. To minimize any effects arithmetic means of data was calculated.: The results from one-way ANOVA tests indicate significant differences among groups classified by cultural values for almost all measured variables of digitalization. The mean squares and F-values across variables like cellular mobile connections, internet users, and active social media users are significant indicating a shift towards more secular and self-expressive cultural values. The results of the GLM procedure show that significant portions of the total variance in digitalization variables are associated with membership in groups based on the cultural map. This suggests that cultural classifications can explain substantial differences in digital behavior and preferences across populations. Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficients showed strong positive correlations between Traditional/Secular values and several digitalization metrics, such as the use of mobile phones or the internet for payments, and negative correlations with others like share of web traffic by device type (mobile vs. laptop/computer). These correlations suggest that cultural values play a substantial role in influencing digital habits and accessibility.","author":"Maral Jamalova","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"057e51db2c373d888ff42101f9fdf50b01ce3cf329a23534a874bd617067e941","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
