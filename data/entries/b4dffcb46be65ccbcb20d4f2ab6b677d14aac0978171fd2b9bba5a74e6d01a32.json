{"title":"“Using the right tools and addressing the right issue”: A qualitative exploration to support better care for intimate partner violence, brain injury, and mental health","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311852","date":1728655200000,"content":"<p>by Danielle Toccalino, Halina (Lin) Haag, Emily Nalder, Vincy Chan, Amy Moore, Christine M. Wickens, Angela Colantonio</p>\r\nBackground <p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global public health crisis. Often repetitive and occurring over prolonged periods of time, IPV puts survivors at high risk of brain injury (BI). Mental health concerns are highly prevalent both among individuals who have experienced IPV and those who have experienced BI, yet the interrelatedness and complexity of these three challenges when experienced together is poorly understood. This qualitative study explored care provision for IPV survivors with BI (IPV-BI) and mental health concerns from the perspectives of both survivors and providers.</p> Methods <p>This qualitative interpretive description study was part of a broader research project exploring employment, mental health, and COVID-19 implications for survivors of IPV-BI. Participants (N = 24), including survivors and service providers, participated in semi-structured group and individual interviews between October 2020 and February 2021. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed.</p> Findings <p>Four themes were developed from interview findings: 1) identifying BI and mental health as contributing components to survivors’ experiences is critical to getting appropriate care; 2) supporting survivors involves a “toolbox full of strategies” and a flexible approach; 3) connecting and collaborating across sectors is key; and 4) underfunding and systemic barriers hinder access to care. Finally, we share recommendations from participants to better support IPV survivors.</p> Conclusions <p>Identifying both BI and mental health concerns among IPV survivors is critical to providing appropriate supports. Survivors of IPV experiencing BI and mental health concerns benefit from a flexible and collaborative approach to care; health and social care systems should be set up to support these collaborative approaches.</p>","author":"Danielle Toccalino","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b4dffcb46be65ccbcb20d4f2ab6b677d14aac0978171fd2b9bba5a74e6d01a32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
