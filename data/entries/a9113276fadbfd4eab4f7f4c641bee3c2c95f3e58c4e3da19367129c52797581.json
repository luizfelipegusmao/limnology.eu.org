{"title":"Assessment from Multilevel Mixed-Effects Structural Equation Modelling into Urban Resilience","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0051/v1","date":1725260542000,"content":"The resilience of towns and cities refers to their ability to adapt and recover when confronted with pressures or challenges. This study employs ten variables as indicators to assess the resilience of urban areas by analyzing official data and constructing a multilevel mixed-effects structural equation model. The empirical findings demonstrate that enhancing resilience significantly influ-ences urban service functions, such as strengthening healthcare systems, stabilizing the real estate market, and addressing socio-economic challenges. Specifically, factors such as healthcare re-sources, housing demand, population structure, and social security exhibit varying levels of resil-ience, which profoundly impact the spatial distribution of these factors and socio-economic de-velopment. Disparities in healthcare resource allocation, demographic aging trends, and shifts in the housing market closely correlate with resilience levels in different regions. Additionally, the study emphasizes that improving resilience not only boosts the reliability and security of urban services but also ensures that communities receive necessary support and protection during times of adversity. Consequently, policymakers should recognize the pivotal role of urban resilience in resource allocation and social equity, devising corresponding strategies to enhance the resilience of these areas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a9113276fadbfd4eab4f7f4c641bee3c2c95f3e58c4e3da19367129c52797581","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
