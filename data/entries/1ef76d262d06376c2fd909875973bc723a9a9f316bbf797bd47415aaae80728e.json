As a result, the detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of DEDs is far superior to conventional CCDs and even photographic film [<a href=\"#ozae044.1020-B3\">3</a>]. Bammes et al. [<a href=\"#ozae044.1020-B4\">4</a>] showed that single particle 3D reconstruction can be pushed to about 4/5 of the Nyquist frequency, which demonstrates that the achievable resolution of these detectors is limited by their pixel size. This limitation can be pushed even further in “counting mode”, a low dose mode wherein every primary electron that impinges on the detector is located, and both the read-out noise and stochastic distribution of energy deposited in traditional scintillator-based systems are eliminated as sources of noise. This allows an effective doubling of the detectable information beyond the traditional Nyquist frequency limit [<a href=\"#ozae044.1020-B5\">5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1ef76d262d06376c2fd909875973bc723a9a9f316bbf797bd47415aaae80728e","category":"Environment"}
