{"title":"Transcription factors WOX11 and LBD16 function with histone demethylase JMJ706 to control crown root development in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1777/7512907?rss=1","date":1704672000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Crown roots are the main components of root systems in cereals. Elucidating the mechanisms of crown root formation is instrumental for improving nutrient absorption, stress tolerance, and yield in cereal crops. Several members of the WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) and lateral organ boundaries domain (LBD) transcription factor families play essential roles in controlling crown root development in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>). However, the functional relationships among these transcription factors in regulating genes involved in crown root development remain unclear. Here, we identified <span>LBD16</span> as an additional regulator of rice crown root development. We showed that <span>LBD16</span> is a direct downstream target of WOX11, a key crown root development regulator in rice. Our results indicated that WOX11 enhances <span>LBD16</span> transcription by binding to its promoter and recruiting its interaction partner JMJ706, a demethylase that removes histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) from the <span>LBD16</span> locus. In addition, we established that LBD16 interacts with WOX11, thereby impairing JMJ706â€“WOX11 complex formation and repressing its own transcriptional activity. Together, our results reveal a feedback system regulating genes that orchestrate crown root development in rice, in which LBD16 acts as a molecular rheostat.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"d9bde05d15a20bd9623b75c233c052a182d4038e44b8bd599b112d5ad2102081","category":"Environment"}
