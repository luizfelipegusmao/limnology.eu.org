{"title":"Analysis of the Use of Satellite Data and Drones for Land Monitoring in Kazakhstan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1229/v1","date":1728995881000,"content":"The article discusses the use of satellite data and drones for land monitoring in Kazakhstan, emphasising their importance in the context of population growth and increasing agricultural demand. Satellite technologies, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat, provide essential data for analysing land resources, including soil erosion and the condition of agricultural lands. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) complement satellite data by offering detailed low-altitude imagery, enabling the detection of local issues such as irrigation system failures and soil compaction.The study demonstrates that integrating drone and satellite data allows for more efficient land resource management. For example, 35% of agricultural land in southern Kazakhstan is affected by soil degradation, while overgrazing issues were identified in the northern regions. These innovative monitoring methods enable early detection of threats, allowing timely measures to be taken to improve land management practices.The conclusion highlights that the use of these technologies requires not only infrastructure but also skilled professionals. The integration of satellites and drones creates opportunities for more precise and timely monitoring, which is essential for sustainable land resource management in Kazakhstan.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba4bd72f5987008f24a724710b48995a00b899da2f23362027af7e77b1aeb4a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
