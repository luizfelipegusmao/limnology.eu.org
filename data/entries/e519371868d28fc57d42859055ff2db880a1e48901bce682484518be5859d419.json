One demographic parameter that is expected to substantially shape spatial and social relationships is population density. Specifically, high population densities may favor group living by constraining opportunities to live alone. In contrast, low densities may allow individuals to spread out within the habitat, leading to a reduction in the prevalence or size of social groups. Abrupt changes in density following natural catastrophic events provide important opportunities to evaluate the effects of population density on patterns of spatial and social organization. As part of long-term studies of the behavioral ecology of a population of highland tuco-tucos (<i>Ctenomys opimus</i>) at Monumento Natural Laguna de los Pozuelos, Jujuy Province, Argentina, we monitored the demographic and behavioral consequences of a flood that inundated our study site during December 2012. Unlike most species of <i>Ctenomys</i> studied to date, highland tuco-tucos are group living, meaning that multiple adults share burrow systems and nest sites. Despite a post-flood reduction in population density of ~75%, animals present on the study site during the 2013 breeding season continued to live in multi-adult social units (groups). No differences between pre- and post-flood home range sizes were detected and although between-unit spatial overlap was reduced in 2013, overlap within social units did not differ from that in pre-flood years. Animals assigned to the same social unit in 2013 had not lived together during 2012, indicating that post-flood groups were not simply the remnants of those present prior to the flood. Collectively, these findings indicate that group living in highland tuco-tucos is not driven by the density of conspecifics in the habitat. In addition to enhancing understanding of the adaptive bases for group living in <i>Ctenomys</i>, our analyses underscore the power of catastrophic events to generate insights into fundamental aspects of social behavior.","author":"Eileen A.
