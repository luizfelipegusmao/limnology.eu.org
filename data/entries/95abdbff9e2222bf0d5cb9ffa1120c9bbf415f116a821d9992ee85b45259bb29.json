Agricultural management practices, especially the use of nitrogen (N) fertilizers and irrigation, increase soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. As a vital sector of global agriculture, specialty crop systems usually require intensive input and management. However, soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from global specialty crop systems have not been comprehensively evaluated. Here, we synthesized 1137 observations from 114 published studies, conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of agricultural management and environmental factors on soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, and estimated global soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from specialty crop systems. The estimated global N<sub>2</sub>O emission from specialty crop soils was 1.5 Tg N<sub>2</sub>O-N year<sup>−1</sup>, ranging from 0.5 to 4.5 Tg N<sub>2</sub>O-N year<sup>−1</sup>. Globally, soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions exponentially increased with N fertilizer rates. The effect size of N fertilizer on soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions generally increased with mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and soil organic carbon concentration but decreased with soil pH. Global climate change will further intensify the effect of N fertilizer on soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Drip irrigation, fertigation, and reduced tillage can be used as essential strategies to reduce soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions and increase crop yields. Deficit irrigation and non-legume cover crop can reduce soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions but may also lower crop yields. Biochar may have a relatively limited effect on reducing soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions but be effective in increasing crop yields. Our study points toward effective management strategies that have substantial potential for reducing N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from global agricultural soils.</p>","author":"Lidong Li, \nMu Hong, \nYao Zhang, \nKeith Paustian","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"95abdbff9e2222bf0d5cb9ffa1120c9bbf415f116a821d9992ee85b45259bb29","category":"Environment"}
