{"title":"Influence of Single- and Double-Aging Treatments on the Mechanical and Corrosion Resistance of Alloy 625","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1244/v1","date":1711002194000,"content":"The nickel-chromium-molybdenum alloy 625 exhibits an excellent combination of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. However, the high temperature plastic deformation process and the heat treatment represent critical aspects and the adoption of non-optimal parameters can result in excessive grain coarsening and loss in mechanical strength. This detrimental behavior is worsened by the presence of a narrow region of temperatures and strain rates for complete recrystallization and the absence of phase transformation temperatures. In this alloy, the presence of sufficient amounts of niobium, titanium and aluminum permits slow age-hardening response upon single-aging treatments. Therefore, when the soft- or solution-annealed condition is associated with insufficient mechanical properties, this potentiality can be exploited to improve the mechanical strength and prevent waste of material and resources. Since the precipitation kinetic of the hardening γ^'' phase can be accelerated by prior nucleation treatment, different time-temperature combinations of double aging at 732 °C and 621 °C are investigated to reduce the overall heat treatment time. However, the simultaneous formation of Cr-rich carbides can dramatically affect the intergranular corrosion resistance. For this reason, a performance map is developed to compare all the tested conditions and identify the best compromise in terms of mechanical strength and corrosion rate.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7366581c16d10a8cb5eb8e5cee6c3378c2e0ff65d078a2175d1557138d49d80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
