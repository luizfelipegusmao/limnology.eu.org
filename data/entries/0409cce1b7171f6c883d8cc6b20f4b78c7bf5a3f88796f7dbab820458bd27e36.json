{"title":"Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of Infection into Macrophages Validates the Importance of HERV-K102 Particle Production for Pandemic Preparedness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202312.0185/v2","date":1724123226000,"content":"Historically, macrophages have been long implicated in the control of the severity of infectious diseases. This has been based on the observations of a higher risk of severe disease and death upon rechallenge with viral variants due to antibody dependent enhance-ment (ADE) of infection into macrophages. The question remains as to what can account for this potent heterologous protection in macrophages? Here it is argued that the elusive defense mechanism of M1-like pro-inflammatory macrophages may pertain to a novel virus anti-virus response. This system initiates with high replication of human endogenous retrovirus K102 (HERV-K102), a non-pathogenic, protector foamy retrovirus of humans which generates M1-like pro-inflammatory foamy macrophages, glycolysis, and epigenetic changes, all characteristic of trained immunity. This virus-anti-virus system kills virally infected cells by several mechanisms, amplifies the innate interferon response via ‘viral mimicry’, has many unique components that interfere with exoge-nous virus replication, and may be especially adept at neutralizing enveloped exogenous pandemic viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1. The goal of this treatise is to introduce the multifaceted HERV-K102 protector system, to illustrate how SARS-CoV-2 may target the HERV-K102 protector system by ADE, and to explore how this innate defense system may be exploited for pandemic preparedness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0409cce1b7171f6c883d8cc6b20f4b78c7bf5a3f88796f7dbab820458bd27e36","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
