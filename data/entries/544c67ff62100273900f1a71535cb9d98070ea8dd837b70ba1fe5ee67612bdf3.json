However, the promotion and application of this material has been limited by a lack of understanding of its action mechanism in environmental restoration. The objective of this study is to innovatively propose a water‒soil-air‒plant mutual feedback mechanism based on this material. Therefore, water‒soil-air‒plant mutual feedback tests were conducted in this study under 3 initial water contents and 10 red bed composite polymers ratios. Key parameters, namely, water content, soil conductivity, pH, temperature, O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> contents, pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) germination number and plant height were monitored and analyzed. As the results, a mutual feedback mechanism driving water retention, soil consolidation, air retention, and plant rooting was revealed under the application of red bed composite polymers. And, suitable environments and optimal compositions for this material are proposed. The study results provide a theoretical basis for the large-scale application of red bed composite polymers.","author":"Tianpeng Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"544c67ff62100273900f1a71535cb9d98070ea8dd837b70ba1fe5ee67612bdf3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
