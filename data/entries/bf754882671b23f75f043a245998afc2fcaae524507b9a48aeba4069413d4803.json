{"title":"First Data on Anthropic Debris Contamination in the Gastrointestinal Tract of Juvenile Scalloped Hammerhead Shark (Sphyrna lewini) in the Gulf of California","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0522/v1","date":1718087665000,"content":"According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, the scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) is a critically endangered species, primarily due to intense fishing and other anthropogenic effects such as pollution. Nowadays, plastic debris contamination is a subject of concern due to its extensive presence in the sea and the digestive tracts of many fish species. The possible effects of plastic debris as a vector of other pollutants are still unknown. We analyzed the digestive tract of hammerhead sharks to investigate the correlation between plastic and other anthropic debris contamination and feeding habits in the eastern region of the Gulf of California. A total of 58 specimens were analyzed from the coastal area, revealing a plastic occurrence frequency of 79.3%. Of these, 91.4% corresponded to fibers, and 8.6% to fragments. The composition of the polymers was primarily cellulose (64.4%). According to their diet, these organisms exhibit benthopelagic habits, feeding both in the water column and on the seabed. These results indicate a high level of contamination of anthropogenic cellulosic microfibers in the area. This changed according to the year, indicating that the anthropic debris ingestion is related to the discharges of human activities and their seasonality rather than to a selection process by the sharks.  Although cellulosic microfibers are recognized as a biomaterial, they can harm marine species, posing an additional threat to this iconic shark.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf754882671b23f75f043a245998afc2fcaae524507b9a48aeba4069413d4803","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
