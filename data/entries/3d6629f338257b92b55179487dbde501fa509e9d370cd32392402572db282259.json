{"title":"Quaternion Spin: From Bell to Baryogenesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1914/v1","date":1729766409000,"content":"Changing the symmetry of spin from SU(2) to the quaternion group, Q8, introduces Q-spin which has a number of ramifications. We first summarize the properties of Q-spin and then discuss some of those resulting changes. Many are counter to well-established ideas which change our view of the microscopic. Dirac’s matter-antimatter pair is challenged, being replaced by a 2D structured spin. His negative energy issue and the baryon asymmetry problem are resolved; parity is not violated in beta decay, and the existence of neutrinos is questioned. Bell’s theorem is disproven by counter example, restoring Local Realism to Nature. The singlet state is an approximation; teleportation is not feasible, quantum computing must change to remove teleportation and focus on the qubit form of Q-spin which gives deterministic outcomes of ±1. This impinges on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, and we discuss the reasons for the failure of Bell’s theorem; the use of Hidden Variables, wave function collapse and explain the violation of Bell’s Inequalities by showing Q-spin is a boson of odd parity in free flight, and a fermion of even parity in a polarizing field. The violation of Bell’s Inequalities is due to an anyon transition between a boson and a fermion, formulating wave-particle duality. These changes are a result of compexifying the Dirac field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d6629f338257b92b55179487dbde501fa509e9d370cd32392402572db282259","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
