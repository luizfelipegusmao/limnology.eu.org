Based on public databases cannot accurately represent Chinese population. To identify molecular characteristics associated with clinical outcomes of lower-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) in the Chinese population, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 16 LGG and 35 GBM tumor tissues. <i>TP53</i> (36/51), <i>TERT</i> (31/51), <i>ATRX</i> (16/51), <i>EFGLAM</i> (14/51), and <i>IDH1</i> (13/51) were the most common genes harboring mutations. <i>IDH1</i> mutation (c.G395A; p.R132H) was significantly enriched in LGG, whereas <i>PCDHGA10</i> mutation (c.A265G; p.I89V) in GBM. <i>IDH1</i>-wildtype and <i>PCDHGA10</i> mutation were significantly related to poor prognosis. <i>IDH1</i> is an important biomarker in gliomas, whereas <i>PCDHGA10</i> mutation has not been reported to correlate with gliomas. Different copy number variations (CNVs) and oncogenic signaling pathways were identified between LGG and GBM. Differential genomic landscapes between LGG and GBM were revealed in the Chinese population, and <i>PCDHGA10</i>, for the first time, was identified as the prognostic factor of gliomas. Our results might provide a basis for molecular classification and identification of diagnostic biomarkers and even potential therapeutic targets for gliomas.","author":"Xinxin Sun","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"113f09f3183a256e2a1de90ac31f85970eaa6db95a633e25f4b0a786c22aaea9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
