Here, we present two high-quality haplotypes of a female mule duck (haplotype 1 (H1):1.28 Gb, haplotype 2 (H2): 1.40 Gb). The continuity (H1: contig N50 = 14.90 Mb, H2: contig N50 = 15.70 Mb) and completeness (BUSCO: H1 = 96.9%, H2 = 97.3%) are substantially better than those of other duck genomes. We detected the structural variations (SVs) in H1 and H2. We observed a positive correlation between autosome length and the number of SVs. Z chromosome was some deficient in deletions and insertions, but W chromosome was some excessive. A total of 1,451 genes were haplotype specific expression (HSEs). Among them, 737 specifically expressed in H1, and 714 specifically expressed in H2. We found that H1 and H2 HSEs tended to be involved in similar biological processes, such as myometrial relaxation and contraction pathways, muscle structure development and phosphorylation. Our haplotype-resolved genome assembly provides a powerful platform for future functional genomics, molecular breeding, and genome editing in mule duck.","author":"Tiandong Che","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d78a09eb09787988b9080a501c185ff73612ba00c7bf08e431fdc692aa7a6892","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
