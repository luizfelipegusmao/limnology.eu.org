{"title":"Effects of Fermented Navel Orange Pulp on Growth Perfor-mance, Carcass Characteristics, Meat Quality, Meat Nutrition, and Serum Biochemical Indicators of Finishing Tibetan Pigs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0257/v1","date":1714976356000,"content":"In order to cope with the limited supply of feed for global animal production, there is a pressing need to explore alternative feed resources. Orange pulp, a by-product of agriculture and industry, has shown potential to positively or neutrally impact pig productive performance when included in their diet. However, there is a lack of research on the effects of fermented navel orange pulp (FNOP) on pig growth and productive performance. This study aimed to investigate the effects of FNOP as a dry matter substitute on pigâ€™s growth performance, carcass characteristics, meat quality, meat nutrition, and serum biochemical indicators. The experiment involved 128 finishing Tibetan pigs, divided into four feed treatment groups, with varying levels (0%, 5%, 10% and 15%) of FNOP replacing dry matter in the basal diet. The results indicated that substituting 5% to 15% FNOP had no adverse effects on pig growth performance. However, at a 15% substitution rate, there was a decrease in serum growth hormone and IGF-1 levels, along with an increase in feed-to-gain ratio. A 10% FNOP replacement notably increased the eye muscle area of pigs. Additionally, 5% and 10% FNOP substitutions reduced the drip loss of pork. The study also found that substituting 5% to 15% FNOP increased unsaturated fatty acids and umami nucleotide contents in pork, as well as raised serum total protein and uric acid (nucleotide metabolism related-product) levels. These findings suggest that moderate FNOP substitution might enhance meat quality and maintain growth and productive performance in Tibetan pigs by improving protein synthesis and nucleotide metabolism, while also reducing feed costs. The optimal substitution ratio identified was 10%.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbc7bb11be2b691772de6e2b569b2bdb0e4426a5b0f982da434d84d7f1fced98","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
