A very similar technique can be used on digitized electron images of specimens, with the added bonus that Fourier phase information (not available in optical darkfield images) can be incorporated directly into the images using “complex color”. This information can provide quantitative data on picometer-scale spacing variations, and vector strain, in periodic structures [<a href=\"#ozae044.198-B1\">1</a>]. In off-line analysis, the latter has been referred to as strain mapping, but computer support for microscopes today can make this viscerally available to microscope operators in real time. In this paper, we discuss (i) on-line implementation of this digital darkfield functionality, (ii) how to interpret the color images, and (iii) web based simulators which allow you to get a feel for its use in a variety of applications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c798c295a9ef17f63ebe3f77555794440aaab527b4278af1138daa33f082c119","category":"Environment"}
