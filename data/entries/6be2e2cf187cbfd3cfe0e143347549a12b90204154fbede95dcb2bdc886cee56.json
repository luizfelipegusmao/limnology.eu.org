{"title":"Study for the Improvement of Disintegration Efficiency and Antibacterial Properties of Disposable Toilet Seat Cover Sheet Made of Cellulose Fibers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2612/v1","date":1722437092000,"content":"The growing prevalence of disposable toilet seat covers in public restrooms stems from concerns about personal hygiene, given the direct contact between the seat and various users' skin. To enable flushing these disposable cover sheets down the toilet instead of discarding them in the trash, they must possess specific properties. These include rapid water absorption for quick disintegration, strength to endure user movement or moisture on the toilet seat surface, and a comfortable texture. To address these challenges, the study investigated the disintegration characteristics of flushable cover sheets prepared under different refining conditions. Alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) was also employed to enhance water resistance, while an organic antibacterial agent was used to impart antimicrobial properties. The findings revealed that adding 0.2% AKD and 1% organic antibacterial agent to pulp stock with a freeness of about 650 mL CSF was suitable for manufacturing disposable cover sheets with disintegration characteristics like toilet tissue paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6be2e2cf187cbfd3cfe0e143347549a12b90204154fbede95dcb2bdc886cee56","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
