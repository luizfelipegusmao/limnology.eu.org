{"title":"Research on the Evolution of Urban Spatial Structure in Xi&#039;an Based on Historical Maps and GIS Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1684/v1","date":1727086677000,"content":"Historical maps possess significant theoretical and practical value in fields such as historical geography and urban planning, making them essential tools for studying urban spatial structure. This study explores the evolution of Xi'an's urban spatial structure from the Five Dynasties (909 CE) to the late PRC period (1949 CE), using historical maps and Historical GIS (HGIS) methodologies. By integrating Space Syntax and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) with data from The Historical Atlas of Xi'an, this research identifies key trends in the city's spatial transformation. Two distinct phases of development were observed: the simpler, centralized structure during the Five Dynasties, Northern Song, and Yuan periods, and a more complex, decentralized structure during the Ming, Qing, and PRC periods. These changes were influenced by a dynamic interplay of political, economic, cultural, and environmental factors, as well as the city's need to adapt to external military threats and internal socio-economic shifts. The study emphasizes the value of HGIS in analyzing urban historical geography and the potential it offers for both understanding past urban dynamics and informing contemporary urban planning and cultural heritage preservation efforts. The findings demonstrate how Xi'an's spatial evolution reflects broader trends in Chinese history and provides insights for future sustainable development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24c116afe65f9c9be6ae1c2cca412050c3d3a2621887d90fe278a03d398b70b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
