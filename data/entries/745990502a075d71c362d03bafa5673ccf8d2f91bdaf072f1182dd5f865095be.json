{"title":"The Modified RoPE Score is Associated with Patent Foramen Ovale in Patients with Ischemic Stroke: A Nationwide US Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1437/v1","date":1718888941000,"content":"Background: The Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score was developed to identify stroke-related patent foramen ovale (PFO) in patients with cryptogenic stroke. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the 2016 to 2020 National Inpatient Sample to determine the performance of modified RoPE score for PFO presence in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Results: A total of 3,338,805 hospital admissions for AIS were analysed and 3.0% had PFO. Patients with PFO were younger compared to those without PFO (median 63 years vs. 71 years, p&amp;lt;0.001) and fewer were female (46.1% vs. 49.7%, p&amp;lt;0.001). The patients with PFO had greater mean modified RoPE score (4.0 vs. 3.3, p&amp;lt;0.001). The area under the curve for the RoPE score in predicting PFO was 0.625 (95%CI 0.620-0.629). The best diagnostic power of the RoPE score was achieved with a cut point of ≥4 where the sensitivity was 55% and the specificity was 64.2%. A cut point of ≥5 increased specificity (83.1%) at the expense of sensitivity (35.8%). The strongest predictor of PFO was deep vein thrombosis (OR 3.97, 95%CI 3.76-4.20). Conclusions: The modified RoPE score had modest predictive value in identifying patients with PFO among patients admitted with AIS.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"745990502a075d71c362d03bafa5673ccf8d2f91bdaf072f1182dd5f865095be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
