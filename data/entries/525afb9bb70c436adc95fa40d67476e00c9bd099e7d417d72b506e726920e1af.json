{"title":"Using Phase Contrast 4D-STEM to solve 3D Inorganic and Biological Nanostructures","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.883/7720186?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has been used in many scientific studies to image nanostructures with both 2D imaging and 3D tomographic reconstructions [<a href=\"#ozae044.883-B1\">1</a>]. To date, most of these STEM studies have relied on annular dark field (ADF) imaging, which provides approximately linear and incoherent contrast. This makes 2D imaging simple and interpretable, and the 3D tomographic reconstructions using ADF straightforward to implement. Atomic electron tomography (AET) of nanostructures performed using ADF STEM can both resolve the 3D positions of every atom and estimate the species of each atomic site [<a href=\"#ozae044.883-B2\">2</a>]. However, ADF-STEM is relatively dose-inefficient, and cannot be used to image beam sensitive materials or resolve light elements such as carbon or oxygen. These limitations prevent AET from being applied to materials such as polymers, lithium-containing battery materials, and biological samples. ADF imaging can also struggle to distinguish similar atomic numbers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"525afb9bb70c436adc95fa40d67476e00c9bd099e7d417d72b506e726920e1af","category":"Environment"}
