{"title":"Survey Data Processing for Modelling through Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1008/v1","date":1715754619000,"content":"Nowadays, inquiries are one of the most important tasks to be executed in order to get valued information. When an inquiry is done to gather information about a human behavior there are some problems inherent to it. One of the main problems is how the information about many different persons can be processed to give good information about their environment. Most of the information gathered by these inquiries is used to analyze the behavior of the respondents. It can be used to estimate the success of a certain product on the market or just to validate the satisfaction of current costumers. The veracity of this information can be critical to model environments with some acceptable level of precision. Modelling environments through Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is highly common because ANN’s are excellent to model predictable environments using a set of data. ANN’s are good in deal with sets of data with some noise, but they are fundamentally surjective mathematical functions and they aren’t able to give different results for the same input. So if an ANN is trained using data where the same input has different images which can be the case of survey data, this can be a problem for the success of modelling the environment. Therefore is necessary to process the data in order to adjust and eliminate invalid data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f137caf274800fa408649a9f2cd855dcf57334b4ef981fa7c0bad5bac4174d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
