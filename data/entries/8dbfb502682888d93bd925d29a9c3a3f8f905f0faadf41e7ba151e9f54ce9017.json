{"title":"Marine biodegradation of natural potential carrier substrates for seagrass restoration","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maec.12813?af=R","date":1729613399000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Seagrass meadows provide essential ecosystem services but have been strongly declining over the past. Due to their incapability to recover effectively naturally, assisted restoration is used. This study aimed to test textile fabrics from natural derivatives to serve as carrier substrates for seagrass transplantation. The use of biotextile fabrics should enable seagrasses to better withstand hydrodynamic forces, especially in high-energy areas and during autumn and winter storms in the initial phase of restoration, thereby increasing restoration success. Here, the biodegradation behavior of three natural textiles was assessed in different configurations. Coir, sisal, and jute meshes were fixed on the top and bottom of a coir nonwoven mat, forming a so-called “sandwich structure.” Specimens were buried in the Ria Formosa Lagoon, Portugal, and retrieved weekly within the first months of burial and subsequently monthly over a total period of 3 months. Weight, tensile strength, and oxygen consumption rate were used as descriptors for biodegradation and tested after each retrieval. The results obtained in this study were discussed in the context of the application of the tested materials on <i>Zostera marina</i> transplants. Due to experimental errors, these results are solely used for discussion purposes in a conservative manner. Based on the three descriptors, coir mesh was the least degraded by the end of the experiment. Yet, it is vital to analyze the microbiome in a study site to understand the biodegradation process and based on that select a textile material. Coir fibers appear to be a good choice in highly biologically active areas to prolong the degradation process, whereas in areas with less activity sisal could be sufficient and even beneficial through the release of compounds that foster vegetations induced by degradation.</p>","author":"Sarah A.
