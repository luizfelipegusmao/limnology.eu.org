{"title":"Rethinking Climate Justice: Insights from Environmental Sociology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2286/v1","date":1727600674000,"content":"This paper reexamines climate justice through the framework of environmental sociology, offering fresh perspectives on the intersection of social and ecological systems in the face of escalating global climate crises. It emphasizes that inequality lies at the heart of global climate politics, often obstructing pathways toward achieving true climate justice. Drawing from established traditions within environmental sociology—such as the new ecological paradigm, the post-growth society, and the environmental justice paradigm—the paper advocates for profound systemic and structural reforms in political and economic systems to tackle entrenched inequalities. By integrating these frameworks, the paper proposes a comprehensive model of climate justice, encompassing material, procedural, compensatory, and transformative justice. This holistic approach not only addresses environmental sustainability but also prioritizes social equity, ensuring that marginalized communities are included in the global response to climate change. The paper thus positions climate justice as a critical component of broader environmental and social transformation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d38c3a196552fd293d043c8aa8960be3c20acf9cbdff2465402e34a49cc1196","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
