{"title":"The evolutionary features and internal logic of the one-vote veto system: A Nvivo analysis based on the policy texts of the three provinces in the east, middle and west","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306535","date":1720188000000,"content":"<p>by Jiancheng Li</p>\r\n\r\nAnalyzing the evolutionary features and internal logic of the one-vote veto system in China over the past two decades is highly significant when considering reform and standardization. In order to conduct this analysis, the Nvivo 12 software was used to examine policy texts related to the one-vote veto issued by Fujian, Hubei, and Gansu provinces. Through a comparative analysis of keyword frequency statistics, policy text form, and content characteristics across the three provinces, it was discovered that governmental departments have experienced fundamental changes in their utilization of the one-vote veto system after 20 years of development. These changes are primarily seen in the refinement of the description of the one-vote veto in policy texts, the gradual reduction in the withdrawal mechanism of the one-vote veto, and an expanded application field for the one-vote veto.","author":"Jiancheng Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"12c552c35359563db8d90226898df34389dd364ba461c387e41e533ee4df5911","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
