{"title":"The Role of Gene Expression Profiling in Management of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Cancer: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1686/v1","date":1727143554000,"content":"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common form of skin cancer, with an increasing global incidence. While most cases are successfully treated with surgical excision, a subset can metastasize, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Current staging systems based on clinical and histopathological features have shown limitations in accurately predicting metastatic risk. This review examines the role of gene expression profiling (GEP), particularly the 40-gene expression profile (40-GEP) test, in improving risk stratification and management of cSCC. We assess the prognostic value of the 40-GEP test, its integration with current staging systems, and its impact on clinical decision-making. Recent studies suggest that incorporating GEP results with traditional staging methods can enhance the identification of high-risk patients, potentially leading to more personalized treatment strategies. The review also explores the challenges of implementing GEP in routine clinical practice, including cost-effectiveness considerations and the need for standardization. Finally, we discuss the implications for future cSCC management and highlight areas for further research. As molecular profiling techniques continue to evolve, GEP represents a promising approach to optimizing care for cSCC patients, aligning with the growing emphasis on personalized medicine in oncology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b88336a2f625d690d2165624afcb12ade296034090ab145f046149896ed27499","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
