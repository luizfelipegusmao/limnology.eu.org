{"title":"Internal Damping Ratio of Normal and High Strength Concrete considering Mechanical Damage Evolution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0773/v1","date":1720562902000,"content":"There are few results about the internal damping ratio of normal and high strength concretes. Hence, this paper presents the expansion of the investigation about internal damping ratio under undamaged and damaged conditions, for usual concretes (NSC) and high strength concretes (HSC). In this way, the study cover a strength range of 42 to 83 MPa. Cyclic load was employed by a servo-controlled hydraulic testing machine and for each cyclic step the dynamic elastic modulus (Ed) and internal damping ratio (ξ) were determinate by acoustic tests. Normal strength concretes (fc = 42MPa) presented undamaged internal damping ratio ξ = 0.5% and achieved the maximum value of ξ = 2.5 for a damage index equal to 0.8. High strength concretes mixtures (fc = 83MPa) presented an undamaged internal damping of ξ=0.29% and maximum internal damping equal to ξ=0.93% (under damage index of 0.32). Porosity and the transition zones were the responsible to the initial internal damping values and how the material behavior under each cyclic load. The progressive damage generates the increase of coulomb damping. There are few studies allowing the quantification and comprehension of internal damping ratio under damage cyclic loading and this approach will lead to improve the understanding of NSC and HSC under dynamical excitation subject to damage evolution, mainly in impact situations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32347c5e80abdd5406b6b08d8fbb52e967cce950b6334dc388555e872c2e40b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
