Dwarf fruit trees facilitate fruit picking, minimize pruning cost, and reduce crop waste (<a href=\"#kiae035-B1\">Atkinson and Else 2014</a>). To generate dwarf fruit trees, grafting is a common strategy. The roots of dwarf varieties can be used as the rootstocks for grafting to induce dwarfism of the shoots (<a href=\"#kiae035-B1\">Atkinson and Else 2014</a>). Breeding could be an alternative to grafting for generating dwarf fruit trees. However, dwarf fruit tree varieties are limited in some species. In addition, the mechanism behind dwarfism has remained unclear in many fruit tree plants. Pear is one of the fruit species that have limited dwarf varieties and unclear dwarfism mechanisms.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"fd99cae026dc5b1acfde111c1114c3e5a773356cbe5c25f3e2b540839dea942c","category":"Environment"}
