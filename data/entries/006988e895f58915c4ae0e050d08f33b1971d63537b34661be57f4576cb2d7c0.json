However, the significant time complexity for measuring pairwise distances between continuous coordinates coupled with the large size of SMLM datasets makes such analysis untenable due to prohibitively long runtimes. To address this, we developed a computationally efficient adaptation of point pattern analysis, called Spatial Pattern Analysis using Closest Events (SPACE), which gains efficiency by operating on discrete data like digital images, instead of continuous Euclidean coordinates [<a href=\"#ozae044.175-B1\">1</a>]. However, this solution would necessitate the rigorous and meaningful discretization of SMLM data. Additionally, SMLM often produces multiple localizations per fluorophore molecule, which leads to overcounting artefacts that confound analysis of nearest neighbor distances between individual localizations. Cluster analysis can address this by grouping adjacent localizations, however, most cluster analyses are prone to biases through their use of hyperparameters whose specific, used-defined values can impact clustering results. Here, we propose a solution to both problems, SMLM discretization and overcounting artefacts, using a hyperparameter-free Voronoi tessellation-based cluster analysis, which can produce the discrete inputs needed for SPACE as digital image masks labeling localization clusters [<a href=\"#ozae044.175-B2\">2</a>]. We refer to this pipeline as Spatial Pattern Analysis in Continuous space Enabled by Voronoi Tessellation-based Cluster Segmentation (SPACE-VorTeCS).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"006988e895f58915c4ae0e050d08f33b1971d63537b34661be57f4576cb2d7c0","category":"Environment"}
