However, existing evidence shows that utilization of condoms still remains low, especially among youth and adolescents. We aimed to determine the prevalence of condom use and associated factors among the students of Gulu university in Uganda. \nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate students of Gulu University between June and December 2023. The students were accessed from their respective faculties and chosen using a simple random sampling method. Data were collected using a pretested self-administered structured questionnaire. Condom use was defined as use of either male or female condom in the last sexual encounter in the previous six months.\nResults: A total of 404 participants, with a median age of 23 years (interquartile range (21.5-24) years) were enrolled in the study, 54.2%(n=219) of whom were male. Overall, 81.4%(n=329) of the participants were in senior classes (year 2,3,4, and 5) and 18.6%(n=75) were in their first year of study. The prevalence of condom use was 53.7%(n=217). Prevalence of condom use was 50.2%(n=109) among male and 49.8%(n=108) among female students. Year of study (senior class)(aPR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.59, 3.54), having a sexual partner (aPR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.89, 2.94), having a sexual partner within campus (aPR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.69, 2.45), experience of condom bursting (aPR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.08, 1.61), having sex in absence of condoms (aPR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.44, 0.70), alcohol use (aPR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.45) were independently associated with condom use.\nConclusion: Just over half of undergraduate students of Gulu university used condoms during sexual encounters. There should be heighten campaigns on condom use to prevent unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9531b88ce230eb22f175161ee868d545982c7e06145e4d8510aed2196bf32594","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
