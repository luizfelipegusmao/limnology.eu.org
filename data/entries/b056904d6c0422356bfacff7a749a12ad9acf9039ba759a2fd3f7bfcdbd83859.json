{"title":"Impulsive Buying Tendencies and Personality: Cognitive and Affective Aspects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2097/v1","date":1727345938000,"content":"Impulsive buying is a growing problem of modern society with significant financial and psychological consequences, and it is necessary to examine the mechanisms underlying it. Understanding the mechanisms driving this behaviour is crucial. Impulsive buying consists of two key aspects: a cognitive aspect, characterised by a lack of planning and reflection, and an affective aspect, involving emotional responses that can occur before, during, or after a purchase. This study aimed to explore the relationship between personality traits, as measured by the HEXACO model, and tendencies toward impulsive buying. Specifically, it examined how the HEXACO traits differentially predict the cognitive and affective components of impulsive buying tendencies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b056904d6c0422356bfacff7a749a12ad9acf9039ba759a2fd3f7bfcdbd83859","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
