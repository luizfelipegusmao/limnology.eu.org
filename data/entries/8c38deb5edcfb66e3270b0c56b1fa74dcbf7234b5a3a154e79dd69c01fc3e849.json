{"title":"Hermit crabs of the genera Calcinus and Clibanarius show no evidence of competitive exclusion at a geographic scale","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05501-w","date":1722470400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The fundamental ecological niche is determined by individuals’ ability to cope with abiotic conditions; however, biotic interactions (e.g., competition) can also influence species’ distribution ranges, reducing the fundamental niche to the realized niche. Several species of the genera <em>Clibanarius</em> and <em>Calcinus</em> overlap in their distributions. The agonistically dominant <em>Calcinus</em> species inhabits mostly lower intertidal levels, while <em>Clibanarius</em> is more abundant in the abiotically demanding upper strata. Additionally, evidence of microhabitat competitive exclusion shows that the superior competitor, <em>Ca</em>. <em>californiensis</em>, causes the vertical displacement of <em>Cl</em>. <em>albidigitus</em>. However, it is unknown whether competitive exclusion between species of these genera has influenced their distributions at the macroecological scale. We used ecological niche models to compare the distribution and the habitat suitability of species of these genera. We used databases of species occurrences and bioclimatic and geophysical variables to model and map the species’ niches. Species of the two hermit crab genera showed strong overlap in their habitat suitability. <em>Calcinus</em> and <em>Clibanarius</em> species occur in broad sympatry at the regional scale without regions of partial overlap that would indicate competitive exclusion. Therefore, competitive exclusion among species of these genera seems to act only on a microhabitat scale in the most dynamic shoreline areas.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"8c38deb5edcfb66e3270b0c56b1fa74dcbf7234b5a3a154e79dd69c01fc3e849","category":"Environment"}
