{"title":"Prognostic Value of Fibrosis 4 (FIB-4) Index in Sepsis Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1373/v1","date":1713796232000,"content":".Bacground: Sepsis remains a major health challenge worldwide, characterized by a dysre-gulated host response to infection, leading to high mortality and morbidity in intensive care units (ICUs). The Fibrosis 4 (FIB-4) index, originally developed to assess liver fibrosis in hepatitis C patients, has recently been explored for its potential prognostic value in sepsis patients. Method: This study retrospectively analyzed 309 sepsis patients admitted to the Internal Me-dicine and Anaesthesia ICUs between December 12, 2021, and December 15, 2023, to inves-tigate the relationship between FIB-4 levels, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)  and clinical outcomes. Results: The study found that higher FIB-4 measurements were statistically significantly asso-ciated with increased 28-day mortality, with a cut-off value of 4.9 providing a sensitivity of 54.92% and specificity of 74.25%. Logistic regression analysis indicated that elevated Conclusion:FIB-4 levels were a significant predictor of early mortality, suggesting that the FIB-4 index could serve as a valuable prognostic tool in assessing the severity and prognosis of sepsis patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1ee32fcfb654e741a8d2353fba54d75159db10b067281a3cacae0bbd6bd98f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
