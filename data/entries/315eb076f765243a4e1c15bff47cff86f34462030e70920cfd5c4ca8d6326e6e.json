{"title":"Estimating catchment‐scale sediment storage in a large River Basin, Colorado River, USA","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4300?af=R","date":1725594812000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Catchment-scale sediment storage is conceptualized as increasing in magnitude downstream, although reach-scale controls may override this trend. We use empirical data from a literature review and two numerical models to quantitatively estimate sediment storage across the Colorado River Basin, USA. We use assumed alluvial thickness with floodplains delineated in the GFPLAIN model from 30 m digital elevation models. We use the SWAT+ model based on model-estimated (i) groundwater storage and (ii) sediment storage. Existing studies indicate that sediment stored in floodplains and on low terraces is ~0.3–6 m thick. A first-order approximation of volumetric storage capacity for natural floodplains is ~10<sup>5</sup> m<sup>3</sup> per km. Sediment storage volumes of floodplains are ~10<sup>8</sup>–10<sup>11</sup> m<sup>3</sup> over river lengths of 10<sup>1</sup>–10<sup>3</sup> m. For the modeling estimates, we evaluated sediment storage by stream order and by elevation band within the Upper and Lower Colorado River Basins. Comparisons among the outputs cause us to place more confidence in the GFPLAIN and SWAT+ aquifer volume estimates. Each method includes substantial uncertainty and constitutes a first-order approximation. Results suggest using 21 and 130 billion cubic meters as approximate lower and upper bounds for total sediment storage in the Upper Basin and 314 and 482 billion cubic meters as approximate lower and upper bounds for the Lower Basin. The largest proportion of sediment is stored in the montane and steppe zones in the Upper Basin and in the Sonoran zone in the Lower Basin.</p>","author":"John T.
