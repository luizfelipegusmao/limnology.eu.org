{"title":"Investigating the Impact of Nutrition and Oxidative Stress on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1990/v1","date":1721859549000,"content":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty maintaining attention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Although the cause of this disorder is still unclear, recent studies state that heredity is important in the development of ADHD. This is linked to a few comorbidities: depression, criminal behavior and anxiety. Although genetic factors play a major role in the pathogenesis of ADHD, there are also non-genetic factors, one of which would be oxidative stress (OS) that are associated with ADHD. OS is implicated in the pathogenesis of ADHD, through lower levels of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as a lower total antioxidant status (TOS) compared to control groups. Moreover, there is a close bidirectional connection between the nervous system and the intestinal microbiota, and the communication between the two systems is carried out through the gut-brain axis (GBA). A thorough review of diet, OS implications, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and drug-drug interactions are reviewed here, with a special focus on treatment in adults with comorbid conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"842a6431cd98a948926dc775af0bdc6474c72fc37959a3cf6ae79bd83f9e9e58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
