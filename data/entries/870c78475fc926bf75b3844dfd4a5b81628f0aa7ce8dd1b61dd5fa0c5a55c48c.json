PCB 126 is associated with steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and other hepatic injuries. These disorders can be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of miRNAs in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease associated with exposure to PCB 126. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to PCB 126 (5 μmol/kg of body weight) for 10 weeks. The PCB group showed lipid accumulation in the liver in the presence of macro- and microvesicular steatosis and fibrosis with increased inflammatory and profibrotic gene expression, consistent with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). PCB exposure also upregulated miR-155 and miR-34a, which induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and inflammation in the liver and reduce the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, which, in turn, impairs lipid oxidation and hepatic steatosis. Therefore, the present study showed that PCB 126 induced NASH via potential mechanisms involving miR-155 and miR-34a, which may contribute to the development of new diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies.","author":"Fernanda Torres Quitete","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"870c78475fc926bf75b3844dfd4a5b81628f0aa7ce8dd1b61dd5fa0c5a55c48c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
