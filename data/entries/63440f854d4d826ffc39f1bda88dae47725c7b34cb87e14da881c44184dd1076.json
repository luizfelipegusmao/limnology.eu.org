{"title":"Performance Evaluation of Hydrological Models Using GR4J Rainfall-Runoff Model for Developed Watersheds in Java Island","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0844/v1","date":1726045498000,"content":"Abstract: GR4J (Genie Rural a 4 parame`tres Journalier) is a rainfall-runoff model widely used to modelling rainfall into discharge. In this model, the input data used are daily rainfall and evapotranspiration data, calibrated using daily observed discharge data. This model seeks the optimum parameter value that produces the minimum deviation or error. The Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient and Relative Volume Error (RVE) are used to estimate the errors that occur. One of the modelling parameters, namely X4 (peak time), has a value that does not match the observed hydrograph peak time (Tp). For this reason, it is necessary to adjust the modelling equation so that the unit hydrograph of the model appropriately in terms of value and shape with observed unit hydrograph. This study examines ten watersheds in Java Island so that it is expected to represent catchment conditions in tropical areas and developing countries. A relationship was obtained between the difference peak time from modelling (X4) and observed Tp. Adjustments Formula can be made to the general GR4J modelling equation for unit hydrograph in Java Island watersheds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63440f854d4d826ffc39f1bda88dae47725c7b34cb87e14da881c44184dd1076","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
