{"title":"A module involving HIGH LEAF TEMPERATURE1 controls instantaneous water use efficiency","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1579/7718460?rss=1","date":1721692800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Drought stress inhibits plant growth and agricultural production. Improving plant instantaneous water use efficiency (iWUE), which is strictly regulated by stomata, is an effective way to cope with drought stress. However, the mechanisms of iWUE regulation are poorly understood. Through genetic screening for suppressors of <span>mpk12-4</span>, an <span>Arabidopsis</span> (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) mutant with a major iWUE quantitative trait locus gene <span>MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE12</span> deleted, we identified <span>HIGH LEAF TEMPERATURE1</span> (<span>HT1</span>). Genetic interaction and physiological analyses showed that MPK12 controls iWUE through multiple modules in a high CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal closing pathway that regulate SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED1 (SLAC1) activity. HT1 acts downstream of MPK12, whereas OPEN STOMATA1 (OST1) and GUARD CELL HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-RESISTANT1 (GHR1) function downstream of HT1 by activating SLAC1 in iWUE. Photosynthetic-CO<sub>2</sub> response curves and biomass analyses under different water-supply conditions showed that HT1 dysfunction improved iWUE and also increased plant growth capacity, and products of <span>HT1</span> putative orthologs from <span>Brassica</span> (<span>Brassica napus</span>) and rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) exhibited functions similar to that of <span>Arabidopsis</span> HT1 in iWUE and the CO<sub>2</sub>-signaling pathway. Our study revealed the mechanism of MPK12-mediated iWUE regulation in <span>Arabidopsis</span> and provided insight into the internal relationship between iWUE and CO<sub>2</sub> signaling in guard cells and a potential target for improving crop iWUE and drought tolerance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"e3ae496c59158d833a0f58c44d31e391ed77976aa3d453db02b4c4fb5cbce5c9","category":"Environment"}
