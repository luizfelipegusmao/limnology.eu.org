Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), as confined quasi-one-dimensional structures, offer tunable bandgaps [<a href=\"#ozae044.778-B1\">1</a>]. Their electronic properties are influenced by their width, chirality, and edge structure. Zigzag edges exhibit metallic behavior with magnetic ordering, while armchair edges have a width-dependent bandgap [<a href=\"#ozae044.778-B2\">2</a>]. Doping and edge modifications enhance the functionality of GNRs. Metal atoms on GNR edges can also modulate their electronic and magnetic properties [<a href=\"#ozae044.778-B2\">2</a>]. While single metal atoms have been observed on graphene edges, the formation of longer chains remains elusive [<a href=\"#ozae044.778-B2\">2</a>]. Since metal atoms attached to the edges of GNRs modify their electronic and catalytic properties, we experimentally create linear chains of indium (In) atoms along GNR edges.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5aada96e72cd408c69705ca78ba5776d4a34826776e4e003b5a5398dae90af5a","category":"Environment"}
