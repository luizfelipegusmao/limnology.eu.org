{"title":"Odontogenic Infections, Opportunistic Prevotella, and Metronidazole","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1001/v1","date":1728985341000,"content":"Treating odontogenic infections of the head, neck and oral cavity requires the understanding of surgical and pharmacotherapeutic interventions as they apply to single and multispace infections.  Three clinical cases are presented where Prevotella species were significant opportunistic pathogens. Since Prevotella can become virulent under conditions including post-extraction wound healing of an extraction site adjacent to an intact dentition, excessive plaque and calculus, nearby gingivitis or periodontitis, or an immunocompromised host, Metronidazole administration was deemed necessary in the cases described here. This intervention mitigated or resolved these odontogenic infections that were refractory to conservative surgical therapy that included source control. The involvement of Prevotella in odontogenic infections and pericoronitis, and the antibiotics used to treat common oral and maxillofacial infections with this bacterium are reviewed. Prevotella is susceptible to Metronidazole (Flagyl), and the antibiotic is effective in mitigating the disease process when basic principles of the treatment of odontogenic infections are employed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7ccfd708659ecdeca1f174efded82b950490094852e68f8a2090e6f93ada116","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
