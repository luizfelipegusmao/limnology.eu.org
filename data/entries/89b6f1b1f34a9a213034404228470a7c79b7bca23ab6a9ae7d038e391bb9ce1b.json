{"title":"Problem of Heliostat Field Efficiency Calculation Based on Innovative Monte Carlo Simulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1544/v1","date":1711431078000,"content":"This paper concentrates on computing the efficiency of heliostat field systems. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of the mathematical model for optical efficiency, we have effectively simplified the complex three-dimensional illumination problem of heliostat fields into a two-dimensional issue. Our work primarily investigates the calculation methods for the average optical efficiency and output power of heliostat. Traditionally, calculating shadow and blocking efficiency, key factors affecting the optical performance of mirror fields, has posed a significant technical challenge. Through innovative improvements to the Monte Carlo simulation technique, this study has successfully reduced the spatial dimensionality of the problem. We employed a series of novel coordinate transformations to simulate light tracing on a two-dimensional plane, thereby efficiently calculating the efficiency of shadows and obstructions. Not only have we solved the computational challenges of shadow and obstruction efficiency, but our unique algorithm design also allows us to precisely obtain the overall average optical efficiency of the heliostat field while enhancing computational efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"89b6f1b1f34a9a213034404228470a7c79b7bca23ab6a9ae7d038e391bb9ce1b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
