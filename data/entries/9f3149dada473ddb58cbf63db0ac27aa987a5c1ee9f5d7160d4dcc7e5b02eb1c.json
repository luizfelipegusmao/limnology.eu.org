{"title":"A Density Management Diagram for Pitch Pine to Illustrate Tradeoffs between Carbon and Wildfire Risk","link":"https://academic.oup.com/forestscience/article/70/2/152/7612195?rss=1","date":1708473600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pitch pine (<span>Pinus rigida</span> Mill.) can be found across a broad range in eastern North America but assumes local dominance only on poor soils in the northeastern United States. Contemporary management goals in the Northeast for areas dominated by pitch pine are focused on noncommercial benefits of forests, such as carbon density, reduced wildfire risk, habitat for rare species, and water provisioning. We present a density management diagram that empirically articulates the size-density limits of even-aged pitch pine stands. Included in the diagram are wildfire risk and carbon density, which are inversely related for most stand sizes. Maximum possible aboveground live tree carbon begins to decline at a quadratic mean diameter greater than 9 in., while crown fire risk remains high along the size-density limit until a quadratic mean diameter above 12 in. is achieved.Study Implications: Modern silvicultural tools that illustrate forest stand conditions have not been developed for pitch pine, but this species occurs in a region with much public attention on forests. We develop and present a density management diagram to show the interplay of different social goals for the forest and how they relate to the maximum size-density relationship. Pitch pine stands with high levels of aboveground live carbon are at high risk of crown fire, particularly in the smaller size classes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Forest Science Current Issue","siteHash":"05e2fee9ae6a27cd288c89ae75adf607539d339849a171c4fab1eaa2f11b4162","entryHash":"9f3149dada473ddb58cbf63db0ac27aa987a5c1ee9f5d7160d4dcc7e5b02eb1c","category":"Environment"}
