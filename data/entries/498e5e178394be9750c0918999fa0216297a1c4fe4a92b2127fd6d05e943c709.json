Bordenstein</p>\r\n\r\nThe rising interest and success in deploying inherited microorganisms and cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) for vector control strategies necessitate an explanation of the CI mechanism. <i>Wolbachia</i>-induced CI manifests in the form of embryonic lethality when sperm from <i>Wolbachia</i>-bearing testes fertilize eggs from uninfected females. Embryos from infected females however survive to sustain the maternally inherited symbiont. Previously in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> flies, we demonstrated that CI modifies chromatin integrity in developing sperm to bestow the embryonic lethality. Here, we validate these findings using <i>w</i>Mel-transinfected <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes released to control vector-borne diseases. Once again, the prophage WO CI proteins CifA and CifB target male gametic nuclei to modify chromatin integrity via an aberrant histone-to-protamine transition. Cifs are not detected in the embryo, and thus elicit CI via the nucleoprotein modifications established pre-fertilization. The rescue protein CifA in oogenesis localizes to stem cell, nurse cell, and oocyte nuclei, as well as embryonic DNA during embryogenesis. Discovery of the nuclear targeting Cifs and altered histone-to-protamine transition in both <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes and <i>D</i>. <i>melanogaster</i> flies affirms the Host Modification Model of CI is conserved across these host species. The study also newly uncovers the cell biology of Cif proteins in the ovaries, CifA localization in the embryos, and an impaired histone-to-protamine transition during spermiogenesis of any mosquito species. Overall, these sperm modification findings may enable future optimization of CI efficacy in vectors or pests that are refractory to <i>Wolbachia</i> transinfections.","author":"Rupinder Kaur","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"498e5e178394be9750c0918999fa0216297a1c4fe4a92b2127fd6d05e943c709","category":"Environment"}
