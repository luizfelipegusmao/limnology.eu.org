{"title":"Assessment of Land Stability and Erosion Equilibrium on Mined Landforms Using Streamflow Fine Suspended Sediment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0401/v1","date":1725517259000,"content":"Where mining activities cause disturbance in catchments, streams are often impacted by heavy loads of fine eroded material. Since geomorphological processes are very slow, it is expected that during rehabilitation typically hundreds of years are required for a mine landform to return back to stability. A sensitive approach to analyzing post-mining landform stability in tropical regions is to assess the quantity of fine suspended sediments (FSS = silt + clay (0.45 µm &lt; diameter &lt; 63 µm)) leaving the catchment where the mine resides and entering the receiving streams in response to storm events. Continuous stream discharge and FSS quantities upstream and downstream of the catchment where the mine resides were modeled using HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engineering Centre-Hydrologic Modeling System). Once calibrated, the model was run for a thousand years to predict continuous stream discharge and FSS quantities for various predicted rainfall scenarios. Short-term erosion and deposition across the mine catchment were also evaluated using a cali-brated landform evolution model, CAESAR-Lisflood. This paper reviews watershed soil erosion measurements and modeling research. It compares the previous research to approach above that assesses mine landform erosion and stability in terms of fine-suspended sediments. This approach can be used to determine mine landform erosion dynamics, predict achieving stability equilib-rium, and as a post-mining rehabilitation assessment tool.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f15c7a670551b908078ce76207f6cab381c4254101fed431fccb5ea1ef5d194c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
