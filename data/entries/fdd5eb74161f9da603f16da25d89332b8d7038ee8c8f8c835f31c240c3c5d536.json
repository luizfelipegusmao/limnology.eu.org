Assessed variables included: body mass index (BMI), varices and ascites present on imaging (VPI and API), albumin, total bilirubin (Tbili), international normalized ratio (INR), creatinine, MELD score, as well as history of paracentesis (PH), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and variceal bleed (VBH). These variables were compared to PSM skeletal muscle index (SMI), PSM signal fat fractions (sFF), and PSM contrast enhancement fraction (CEFR) calculated on arterial (CEFR-ART), portal venous (CEFR-PV), and delayed (CEFR-DEL) phases collected on MRI.</p> Results <p>Patients with MELD&gt;17, PH, and VPI had lower PSM CEFR-ART (0.06vs. 0.11, p = 0.01; 0.07vs. 0.11, p = 0.01; and 0.09vs. 0.13, p = 0.03, respectively). PSM CEFR-ART correlated negatively with MELD. Patients with MELD&gt;17 and PH had lower PSM CEFR-PV (0.16vs. 0.23, p = 0.02; 0.18 vs. 0.23, p = 0.01, respectively). PSM CEFR-PV correlated positively with albumin and negatively with Tbili, INR, and MELD. PSM CEFR-DEL correlated negatively with Tbili and MELD. Patients with API, PH, and VBH had lower PSM SMI (4.68vs. 5.59, p&lt;0.001; 4.37vs. 5.48, p&lt;0.001; 4.78vs. 5.35, p = 0.04, respectively). PSM SMI correlated negatively with Tbili and positively with BMI. PSM sFF correlated positively with BMI, PSM CEFR-PV, and PSM CEFR-DEL.</p> Conclusion <p>PSM CEFR is significantly reduced on MRI in patients with clinical manifestations of severe liver cirrhosis. Further investigation into PSM CEFR’s usefulness as an imaging biomarker for evaluating liver disease severity is warranted.</p>","author":"Johannes L. du Pisanie","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fdd5eb74161f9da603f16da25d89332b8d7038ee8c8f8c835f31c240c3c5d536","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
