{"title":"Exploring the formation mechanism of ferulic acid/hydroxypropyl‐β‐cyclodextrin inclusion complex: spectral analyses and computer simulation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13482?af=R","date":1711268967000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The biological functions of ferulic acid (FA) have garnered significant interest, but its limited solubility and stability have led to low bioavailability. Hydroxypropyl-<i>β</i>-cyclodextrin (HP-<i>β</i>-CD), with its distinctive hollow structure, offers the potential for encapsulating hydrophobic molecules. Therefore, the formation of an inclusion complex between FA and HP-<i>β</i>-CD may serve as a viable approach to address the inherent limitations of FA. To investigate the underlying mechanism of FA/HP-<i>β</i>-CD inclusion complex formation, a combination of spectral analyses and computer simulation was employed.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The disappearance of the characteristic peaks of FA in FT-IR and XRD provided confirmation of the formation of an inclusion complex between FA and HP-<i>β</i>-CD. Furthermore, the TG-DTG studies demonstrated that the thermal stability of FA was enhanced due to the encapsulation of FA within HP-<i>β</i>-CD. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulation provided evidence that FA successfully penetrated the HP-<i>β</i>-CD cavity, primarily driven by van der Waals interactions. The formation of the complex resulted in more compact HP-<i>β</i>-CD structures. Furthermore, the bioavailability of FA was strengthened through the formation of inclusion complexes with HP-<i>β</i>-CD.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>The findings of this study have contributed to a deeper understanding of the interactions between FA and HP-<i>β</i>-CD, potentially aiding in the advancement of a delivery system for FA and enhancing the bioavailability of insoluble active components.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
