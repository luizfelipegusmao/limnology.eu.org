{"title":"Role of Community Infrastructure in Improving Nutrition in Under-Five Children for Better Implementation of Integrated Child Development Services","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1577/v3","date":1714377037000,"content":"Background- In India, 26 million children are born every year. These Children (0-6 years) comprise 13% of the country's population. Undernutrition is fallout of malnutrition, malabsorption, and nutritional imbalance which causes problem of underweight in children. It can affect child’s brain development and other developmental milestones. Methods- We used anonymized, publicly available secondary data from the India National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5). Descriptive statistical analysis, correlation coefficient analysis, and regression analysis of the data have been done.  Results- Multiple linear regression for independent variables, operational AWCs (%) and women with Internet access (%), and dependent variable underweight children per state (%) developed the model, Underweight children (%) = 37.1607 + 0.5659. operational AWCs (%) – 0.2907. women with Internet Access (%). It shows Ꞵ0= 37.1607, Ꞵ1= 0.5659, and Ꞵ2= -0.2907 as well as R squared value as 0.5709. This shows independent variables have a significant influence on the number of underweight children in the state.  Results of the Pearson correlation indicated that there is a significant large positive relationship between operational AWCs (%) and the percentage of underweight children in the state, (r(34) = .58, p &lt; .001). Whereas there is a significant large negative relationship between Internet access to women (%) and the percentage of underweight children in the state, (r(34) = .733/-0.733, p &lt; .001). Conclusion- The study clearly shows that when compared, community daycare centers (AWCs) have a limited role in the child's nutrition, but Internet access to the mothers can be a determinant of the child's nutrition. The internet access to women can help to reduce the number of underweight children under five years and improve overall maternal and child health as well as public health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c83f8ac9993260e35909f46bea099a893cca4a664b4d2aae08f4d757cfa1df09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
