{"title":"Chromosome-Level Genome Assembly and Annotation of the Crested Gecko, Correlophus ciliatus, a Lizard Incapable of Tail Regeneration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2389/v1","date":1727687097000,"content":"The vast majority of gecko species are capable of tail regeneration, but singular geckos of Correlophus, Uroplatus, and Nephrurus genera are unable to regrow lost tails. Of these non-regenerative geckos, the crested gecko (Correlophus ciliatus) is distinguished by ready availability, ease of care, high productivity, and hybridization potential. These features make C. ciliatus particularly suited as a model for studying the genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms underlying loss of tail regeneration capabilities. We report a contiguous genome of C. ciliatus with a total size of 1.65 Gb, a total of 152 scaffolds, L50 of 6, and N50 of 109 Mb. Repetitive content consists of 40.41% of the genome, and a total of 30,780 genes were annotated. Assembly of the crested gecko genome provides a valuable resource for future comparative genomic studies between non-regenerative and regenerative geckos and other squamate reptiles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"71cd0935bc3acc1ce0243a7b0682b75e36e58da399653dc7b9e45b2a79a66977","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
