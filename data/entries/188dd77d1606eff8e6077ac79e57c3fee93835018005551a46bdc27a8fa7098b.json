Thus, the straying of hatchery fish may negatively impact wild populations, depending on the number of wild salmon returning and hatchery strays. We investigated the straying status of hatchery-origin pink salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus gorbuscha</i>), which have a higher straying rate than other salmonids, in an unstocked river at the Shiretoko World Natural Heritage Site, Japan. The hatchery strays accounted for 40.0% and 19.0% of the total samples in 2021 and 2022, respectively. These results indicate that hatchery pink salmon have invaded unstocked rivers and potentially genetically affect wild populations.</p>","author":"Taihei Yamada, \nTakahiro Nobetsu, \nHirokazu Urabe, \nFutoshi Nakamura","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"188dd77d1606eff8e6077ac79e57c3fee93835018005551a46bdc27a8fa7098b","category":"Environment"}
