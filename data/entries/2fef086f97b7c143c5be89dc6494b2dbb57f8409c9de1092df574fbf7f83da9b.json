When the literature is examined, there are many GSR estimation models developed with different algorithms in different regions of the world. Although some of these models are seen to perform acceptable all over the world, the performance of some models differs according to their location. The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that maximizes the winning potential while minimizing the probability of losing. In this study, a new Angstorm model was developed for GSR with minimax algorithm. The most important aspect of this article in terms of originality is that the GSR estimation model is being developed with the minimax algorithm for the first time. The MATLAB program was used while developing the prediction model with the minimax algorithm. Different statistical error tests were used to evaluate the performance of the results. When these test results are evaluated in general, it is seen that the minimax algorithm gives acceptable results in GSR estimation.</p>","author":"Yusuf Alper Kaplan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"2fef086f97b7c143c5be89dc6494b2dbb57f8409c9de1092df574fbf7f83da9b","category":"Environment"}
