{"title":"High-throughput quantification of quasistatic, dynamic and spall strength of materials across 10 orders of strain rates","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae148/7641488?rss=1","date":1712275200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The response of metals and their microstructures under extreme dynamic conditions can be markedly different from that under quasistatic conditions. Traditionally, high strain rates and shock stresses are achieved using cumbersome and expensive methods such as the Kolsky bar or large spall experiments. These methods are low throughput and do not facilitate high-fidelity microstructureâ€“property linkages. In this work, we combine two powerful small-scale testing methods, custom nanoindentation, and laser-driven microflyer (LDMF) shock, to measure the dynamic and spall strength of metals. The nanoindentation system is configured to test samples from quasistatic to dynamic strain-rate regimes. The LDMF shock system can test samples through impact loading, triggering spall failure. The model material used for testing is magnesium alloys, which are lightweight, possess high-specific strengths, and have historically been challenging to design and strengthen due to their mechanical anisotropy. We adopt two distinct microstructures, solutionized (no precipitates) and peak-aged (with precipitates) to demonstrate interesting upticks in strain-rate sensitivity and evolution of dynamic strength. At high shock-loading rates, we unravel an interesting paradigm where the spall strength vs. strain rate of these materials converges, but the failure mechanisms are markedly different. Peak aging, considered to be a standard method to strengthen metallic alloys, causes catastrophic failure, faring much worse than solutionized alloys. Our high-throughput testing framework not only quantifies strength but also teases out unexplored failure mechanisms at extreme strain rates, providing valuable insights for the rapid design and improvement of materials for extreme environments.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"cc6a6d62190163bc9dbd5bd34dd481dea929b17bb63108e573cc2d71cd851d5b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
