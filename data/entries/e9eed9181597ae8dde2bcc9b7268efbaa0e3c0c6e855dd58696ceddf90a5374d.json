{"title":"Relationship between soil and species diversity in typical forest stands in Xianrendong, Liaoning Province based on plant-soil feedback","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306568","date":1720188000000,"content":"<p>by Weixin Du, Hua Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nExploring the relationship between soil properties and species diversity in typical forest stands in Liaoning Xianrendong National Nature Reserve will help maintain the stability of forest communities in the transition zone between flora in Changbai and North China. Based on the plant-soil feedback theory, community sample data from nine typical forest stands in the study area and experimental test data from 54 soil samples, we selected indexes of soil physical and chemical properties based on the minimum data set (temperature, compactness, capillary pore space, bulk weight, capillary water holding capacity, drainage capacity, soil water storage, conductivity, pH, organic matter, Ca, Fe, K, N and P). We adopt the research method of classical statistical analysis. The soil properties of nine typical stands in Xianrendong National Nature Reserve of Liaoning Province were systematically analyzed. The relationship between soil properties and forest stands’ species diversity was quantified using correlation and redundancy analyses. The Pearson correlation analysis results showed significant positive correlations between the Gleason abundance index (arbors) with conductivity, pH, organic matter, Ca, N and P; Pielou’s evenness index (arbors) with bulk weight and Fe. Significant negative correlations between the Gleason abundance index (arbors) with capillary pore space, bulk weight, drainage capacity, soil water storage and capillary water holding capacity; Simpson dominance index and Shannon–Wiener diversity index with capillary water holding capacity, drainage capacity and soil water storage; Pielou’s evenness index (arbors) with Ca and N. The natural moisture content and clay particles are neutral feedback. The results showed that the feedback mechanism of soil physicochemical properties on stand species diversity was complex, which was conducive to species coexistence and community stability.","author":"Weixin Du","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e9eed9181597ae8dde2bcc9b7268efbaa0e3c0c6e855dd58696ceddf90a5374d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
