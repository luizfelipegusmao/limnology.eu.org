{"title":"Exploring the Multifaceted Biological Activities of Anthocyanins Isolated from Two Andean Berries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1606/v1","date":1721383167000,"content":"This study evaluates the comprehensive biological activities of anthocyanins isolated from Andean blueberry (Vaccinium floribundum Kunth) and Andean blackberry (Rubus glaucus Benth), focusing on their antimicrobial, antioxidant, antitumoral, anti-inflammatory, and hemolytic properties. Chemical characterization revealed significant anthocyanin content with complex mass spectrometric profiles indicating diverse glycosylation patterns, which might influence their bioactivity. The antimicrobial assays demonstrated that the extracts were particularly effective against Gram-positive bacteria, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) as low as 1 mg/mL for Rubus glaucus, indicating strong potential for therapeutic use. The berries' antioxidant capacity was assessed and found to be substantial, though slightly lower than that of ascorbic acid. Furthermore, the extracts exhibited notable antitumoral activities in various cancer cell lines, showing promise as adjunctive or preventative treatments against cancer. The anti-inflammatory effects were confirmed by inhibiting nitric oxide production in macrophage cells, highlighting their potential in managing inflammatory diseases. Regarding hemolytic activity, Rubus glaucus displayed dose-dependent hemolytic activity due to anthocyanins and phenolics, while Vaccinium floribundum showed no significant hemolytic activity, confirming its safety. These findings suggest that anthocyanins from Andean berries possess potent biological activities that could be harnessed for multiple health benefits in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications. Further studies are warranted to isolate specific bioactive compounds and explore their synergistic effects in clinical and real-world scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d638f495a1b615d1fb62b2e9b8aeff5c789efc1267d412c731c358761743ad18","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
