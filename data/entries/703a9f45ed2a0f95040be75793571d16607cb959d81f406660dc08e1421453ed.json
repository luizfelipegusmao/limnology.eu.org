{"title":"394 Cover crops for efficient grazing systems","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/189/7757195?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Grazing of cool-season cover crops provides a sustainable solution for extending the grazing season while potentially reducing the environmental impact of conventional row-crop farming practices. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate how different mixtures of cover crops affect stocker performance when grazed. The study was conducted across 18 paddocks that were sown with grass [‘Coker’ oat (<span>Avena sativa</span>)], grass + legume [‘Dixie’ crimson clover (<span>Trifolium incarnatum</span>)], or grass + legume + brassica [‘Turnip’ brassica (<span>Brassica rapa subsp</span>.; rapa)] at the Wiregrass Research and Extension Center in Headland, AL. These paddocks were randomly assigned to either grazed or un-grazed conditions (n = 3). In this study, yearling beef steers with an average body weight (BW) of 266 ± 44 kg were grazed in paddocks using the put and take method to maintain a forage allowance of 1 kg dry matter per kilogram of BW. Forage samples were collected biweekly to analyze biomass, botanical composition, and forage nutritive value. Grazing occurred from January 17 to March 22, 2023 (65 d). Steer BW were recorded at the beginning and end of the grazing season to calculate average daily gain. The data were subjected to analysis as a two-way ANOVA using Glimmix in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), harvest date was considered a repeated measure. No treatment × grazing interaction was observed on forage yield performance [average (AVG) forage yield kg DM/ha; <span>P</span> = 0.460]. In addition, no difference was observed among the different cover crop mixtures (AVG forage yield kg DM/ha; <span>P</span> = 0.670). Grazed paddocks had a greater crude protein when compared with ungrazed paddocks (Grazed vs. Ungrazed %; <span>P</span> = 0. 017). However, there was no effect of cover crop mixture on crude protein (CP) concentration (AVG CP %; <span>P</span> = 0.670 for treatment effect). These results indicate that cool-season annual cover crops can provide sufficient forage yield and quality to support sufficient animal gains, even during the relatively short grazing season. Incorporating cover crops not only improves agricultural sustainability but can also enhance the resilience and long-term health of the agroecosystem.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"703a9f45ed2a0f95040be75793571d16607cb959d81f406660dc08e1421453ed","category":"Environment"}
