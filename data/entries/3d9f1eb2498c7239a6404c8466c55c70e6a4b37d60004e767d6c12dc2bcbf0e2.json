{"title":"Harnessing Quorum Sensing for Advanced Biotechnological Applications: Intra- and Inter-Species Communication for Synthetic Biology and Disease Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1752/v1","date":1727080321000,"content":"Quorum sensing (QS) is a sophisticated bacterial cell-to-cell communication mechanism that allows bacteria to sense population density through the secretion and detection of diffusible small molecular signals. This process leads to the coordinated expression of specific genes at the transcriptional level. Over time, continuous research has elucidated the genetic elements and regulatory principles of QS. Recently, synthetic biology has leveraged these insights to construct genetic circuits incorporating QS components, enabling both intra-species and inter-species artificial communication. These QS-based genetic circuits hold significant potential for applications in biotechnology and biomedicine. This paper reviews several well-characterized microbial QS systems and their functional roles, while also introducing the application of QS-based genetic circuits in cellular communication across species. The paper further discusses the role of QS in the development of biological computing tools, population density regulation, and metabolic flux control, offering a forward-looking perspective on future advancements. For intra-species communication, the focus is on the use of QS systems in constructing biological computing tools, including toggle switches, biosensors, and logic gates in synthetic biology. These tools, designed on the QS mechanism, can more precisely coordinate cellular behavior by integrating biological control circuits to achieve spatial, temporal, and population-level regulation. In the context of inter-species communication, the introduction of QS systems plays a pivotal role in population density control and metabolic flow regulation. By recombining metabolic networks, QS enables the redistribution of metabolic flux in desired pathways, facilitating the regulation of population density and the co-culture of mixed strains. Moreover, combining QS with oscillator models has shown great potential in synchronizing microbial communities. In summary, in-depth research into QS mechanisms and their applications not only lays a solid foundation for understanding microbial ecological competition and dynamic balance, but also offers promising avenues for regulating pathogenic bacteria and developing innovative disease control strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d9f1eb2498c7239a6404c8466c55c70e6a4b37d60004e767d6c12dc2bcbf0e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
