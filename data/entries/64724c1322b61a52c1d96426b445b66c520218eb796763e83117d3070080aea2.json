{"title":"Transcriptomic response to nitrogen availability reveals signatures of adaptive plasticity during tetraploid wheat domestication","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3809/7721302?rss=1","date":1721952000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The domestication of crops, coupled with agroecosystem development, is associated with major environmental changes and provides an ideal model of phenotypic plasticity. Here, we examined 32 genotypes of three tetraploid wheat (<span>Triticum turgidum</span> L.) subspecies, wild emmer, emmer, and durum wheat, which are representative of the key stages in the domestication of tetraploid wheat. We developed a pipeline that integrates RNA-Seq data and population genomics to assess gene expression plasticity and identify selection signatures under diverse nitrogen availability conditions. Our analysis revealed differing gene expression responses to nitrogen availability across primary (wild emmer to emmer) and secondary (emmer to durum wheat) domestication. Notably, nitrogen triggered the expression of twice as many genes in durum wheat compared to that in emmer and wild emmer. Unique selection signatures were identified at each stage: primary domestication mainly influenced genes related to biotic interactions, whereas secondary domestication affected genes related to amino acid metabolism, in particular lysine. Selection signatures were found in differentially expressed genes (DEGs), notably those associated with nitrogen metabolism, such as the gene encoding glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Overall, our study highlights the pivotal role of nitrogen availability in the domestication and adaptive responses of a major food crop, with varying effects across different traits and growth conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"64724c1322b61a52c1d96426b445b66c520218eb796763e83117d3070080aea2","category":"Environment"}
