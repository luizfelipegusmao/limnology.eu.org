{"title":"Maternal Immunity Transfer of Zebrafish (Danio rerio) following Vaccination with a Live‐Attenuated Vibrio harveyi Vaccine","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/7063186?af=R","date":1684911600000,"content":"<p>Vibriosis causes a major setback in the marine aquaculture industry. In controlling vibriosis, vaccination of the broodstock could help in transferring the initial immunity to the fry and perhaps giving immunity to them during the culture period. This study determines the efficacy of three live-attenuated <i>Vibrio harvey</i>i vaccine (LAVh) derivatives on zebrafish broodstock in providing immunological protection to their offspring against pathogenic <i>Vibrio</i> spp. Zebrafish were vaccinated intraperitoneally with full effective dose (ED<sub>80</sub>) and monitored for 14 weeks. On week 6, the specimens were intraperitoneally (i.p.) challenged with pathogenic 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml of <i>Vibrio</i> spp., and subsequently another batch was left to spawn. Thereafter, the antibody level of larvae was monitored for 4 weeks post-hatching. Groups of juvenile zebrafish were given booster vaccination via immersion (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mL) with vaccines similar to their predecessor. The fish were sampled weekly for four weeks to determine their antibody profile and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Finally, at week 3, the juvenile fish were challenged with pathogenic strains of <i>Vibrio</i> spp. Results of antibody profiling in the adult zebrafish model indicated that freeze-dried and stale LAVh delivers a longer immunological protective duration, while the FKVh vaccination group failed to provide immunological protection against <i>V. alginolyticus</i>. However, the gene expression of pro-inflammatory interleukin 1<i>β</i> (IL-1<i>β</i>) in the FKVh vaccinated group was elevated longer than that in the freeze-dried LAVh vaccinated group. Nevertheless, the relative percent survival (RPS) of both vaccination groups against pathogenic <i>Vibrio</i> spp. displayed 100% immunity. Overall, the freeze-dried LAVh vaccine was found to confer maternal immune protection for its offspring, provide a long duration of immunological protection and cross-protection coverage against pathogenic <i>Vibrio</i> spp<i>.</i>, and have a longer shelf life. It is proposed to be commercially available for farmers to protect against <i>Vibrio</i> spp. infection.</p>","author":"Mohd Hafiz Ngoo Muhamad-Sofie, \nAslah Mohamad, \nMohamad Azzam-Sayuti, \nJing Yie Lee, \nWan Haifa Haryani Wan Omar, \nYong Kit Chin, \nMohammad Noor Azmai Amal, \nSalleh Annas, \nMohd Zamri-Saad, \nMd Yasin Ina-Salwany, \nMohamed Abdelsalam","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"8e2c84f8ef882f11f9a4ba1b6f4702c537a21ac4f1eb3eccdc245f3a4580e354","category":"Environment"}
