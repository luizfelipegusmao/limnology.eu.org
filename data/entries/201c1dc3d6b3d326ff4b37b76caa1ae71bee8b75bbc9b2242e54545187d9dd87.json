{"title":"Study of Diagnostic Image Legend Quality in the Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Published Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2091/v1","date":1721961830000,"content":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of legends associated with diagnostic images in the published oral and maxillofacial radiology literature using a novel rating scale.  Images and their corresponding legends were randomly selected from published manuscripts over the last ten years in the Oral Radiology journals, namely Dentomaxillofacial Radiology, Imaging Science in Dentistry, Oral Radiology, and Oral Surgery Oral Medicine Oral Pathology Oral Radiology.  An Image Quality Rating Scale (IQRS) was introduced to assess the quality of the legends associated with images.  A program was developed for the rating scale form using Google Apps Script API to gather and analyze the data.  The rating scale ranged from 1 to 5, with 5 as the highest rating.  The highest average IQRS rating for one journal was 3.04.  The overall IQRS rating average across all four journals was 2.87, which is 2.13 rating scores lower than the ideal score of 5.  There is room for improvement in the legends that accompany diagnostic images and figures in the oral and maxillofacial radiology literature.  A proper legend provides an excellent diagnostic teaching opportunity for the reader and enhances the quality of a publication.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"201c1dc3d6b3d326ff4b37b76caa1ae71bee8b75bbc9b2242e54545187d9dd87","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
