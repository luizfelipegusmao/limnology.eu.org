One such family that has been studied extensively due to their unique properties is the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). With properties such as strong light-matter interactions, spin-orbit coupling, and valley-selective circular dichroism, TMDs have many potential applications being used as transiters, sensing devices, or photodetectors [<a href=\"#ozae044.672-B1\">1</a>]. The characterization of these 2D materials has proved to be imperative in determining the quality of crystals (number of defects, etc) and understanding the impact these have on the underlying physics.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f37064925333417b350ddbde4bfbacf82a7b00d043b39bbe802c75543cc699e1","category":"Environment"}
