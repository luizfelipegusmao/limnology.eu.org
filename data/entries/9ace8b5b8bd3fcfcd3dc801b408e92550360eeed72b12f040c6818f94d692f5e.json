{"title":"Robotics in Physical Rehabilitation - Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2007/v1","date":1719547742000,"content":"As the global population faces an increasing prevalence of physical disabilities, the challenge of motor rehabilitation has become increasingly urgent. Considering that approximately 15% of the global population lives with some form of disability, with a significant number having motor disa-bilities that greatly impact their quality of life, the integration of robotic technologies into rehabili-tation processes offers an opportunity for significant improvement in functional recovery and pa-tient autonomy. This analysis aims to evaluate the progress and challenges encountered in imple-menting robotic technology for the rehabilitation of patients with physical disabilities, highlighting the potential of emerging technologies such as exoskeletons, assisted training devices, and brain-computer interface systems in facilitating motor recovery. By examining relevant clinical studies, the analysis demonstrates the varied effectiveness of robotic therapies compared to traditional re-habilitation methods, while also highlighting the need for ongoing research to optimize care prac-tices and address challenges related to cost, accessibility, and treatment personalization. In con-clusion, robotic technologies represent a promising direction in motor rehabilitation, with the po-tential to revolutionize the care of patients with physical disabilities, significantly improving quali-ty of life and social integration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ace8b5b8bd3fcfcd3dc801b408e92550360eeed72b12f040c6818f94d692f5e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
