To date, students who wish to pursue Cryo-EM as a field of study have access to many online courses such as <a href=\"CryoEM101.com\">CryoEM101.com</a>, Caltech, ThermoFischer, and training offered by national labs such as PNCC, NCCAT, and S2C2. Unfortunately, the costs associated with acquiring instrumentation, along with their maintenance, can prohibit universities from designing hands-on undergraduate courses in the workflow. This presents an opportunity to design a classroom that can introduce students to the Cryo-EM workflow in a cost-effective and hands-on manner.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b678ac5e024bf5c6b64de8d87d16a09531f8d34f2a36beeda0426d06cbb317ce","category":"Environment"}
