{"title":"B chromosome and its non-Mendelian inheritance in <i>Atractylodes lancea</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308881","date":1726063200000,"content":"<p>by Kazuya Hara, Shinji Kikuchi, Misaki Inoue, Takahiro Tsusaka, Miki Sakurai, Hideyuki Tanabe, Kenta Shirasawa, Sachiko Isobe</p>\r\n\r\nSupernumerary B chromosomes contribute to intraspecific karyotypic variation. B chromosomes have been detected in more than 2000 organisms; they possess unique and diverse features, including non-Mendelian inheritance. Here, we report one or more B chromosomes in the gynodioecious plant <i>Atractylodes lancea</i>. Among 54 <i>A</i>. <i>lancea</i> lines, 0–2 B chromosomes were detected in both hermaphroditic and female plants, with the B chromosomes appearing as DAPI-bright regions within the nuclei. Genomic <i>in situ</i> hybridization revealed that the B chromosomes had no conserved A chromosome DNA sequences, confirmed by fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization probed with independently dissected B chromosomes. In male meiosis, the B chromosome did not pair with an A chromosome and was therefore eliminated; accordingly, only 20.1% and 18.6% of these univalent B chromosomes remained at the end of meiosis for the 1B lines of KY17-148 and KY17-118, respectively. However, we also found that B chromosomes were transmitted from male parents in 40.8%–44.2% and 47.2% of the next generation; although these transmission rates from male parents were not essentially different from Mendelian inheritance (0.5), the transmission of gametes carrying B chromosomes increased through fertilization or seed development. B chromosomes were transmitted from three of four 1B female parents to 64.3%–92.6% of the next generation, suggesting B chromosome accumulation. We propose that the B chromosome of <i>A</i>. <i>lancea</i> has a specific sequence and persists via non-Mendelian inheritance from female parents. Overall, <i>A</i>. <i>lancea</i>, with its unique characteristics, is a promising model for understanding the structure, evolution, and mechanism of non-Mendelian inheritance of B chromosomes.","author":"Kazuya Hara","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5cca8330da625b3df7d7506d909c64d06e6ed9fd53118a3fe8b8306b13e71381","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
