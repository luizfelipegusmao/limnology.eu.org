{"title":"Climate Change and the Single Cell","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1690/v1","date":1716784686000,"content":"The power of movement in plants” by Charles Darwin  details many examples of oscillatory growth exemplified more recently  at the single cell level by pollen tube tip oscillations and associated ion fluxes, particularly Ca2+and H+.  That implies an underlying growth oscillator based on the recent discovery that classical AGPs bind Ca2+ at the cell surface. The juxtaposition of AGPs with three other components embedded in the plasma membrane is evidence of a Ca2+ cycle that generates cytosolic Ca2+. It involves Ca2+ channels, auxin efflux “PIN” proteins and an auxin-activated proton pump that dissociates AGP-Ca2+ on demand. While the apparent simplicity of this system satisfies Occam’s Razor its hypothetical role as a global growth oscillator demands rigorous experimental appraisal. The wide ramifications extend from pollen tubes to stomatal guard cells. Stomata act as crucial components of a water hypercycle that contributes to homeostasis of a warming planet by regulating evaporative cooling, reflective cloud cover generated by vast forests and the high albedo of snow-capped mountains including polar ice-caps . The Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis is a brilliant metaphor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a42856e590a41bb9e9afcc4f9812c7885e8befe0bb69095ea15a489dc43de7f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
