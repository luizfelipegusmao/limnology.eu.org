{"title":"The brassinosteroid receptor StBRI1 promotes tuber development by enhancing plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity in potato","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3498/7685854?rss=1","date":1717113600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The brassinosteroid (BR) receptor BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) plays a critical role in plant growth and development. Although much is known about how BR signaling regulates growth and development in many crop species, the role of StBRI1 in regulating potato (<span>Solanum tuberosum</span>) tuber development is not well understood. To address this question, a series of comprehensive genetic and biochemical methods were applied in this investigation. It was determined that StBRI1 and <span>Solanum tuberosum</span> PLASMA MEMBRANE (PM) PROTON ATPASE2 (PHA2), a PM-localized proton ATPase, play important roles in potato tuber development. The individual overexpression of <span>StBRI1</span> and <span>PHA2</span> led to a 22% and 25% increase in tuber yield per plant, respectively. Consistent with the genetic evidence, in vivo interaction analysis using double transgenic lines and PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity assays indicated that StBRI1 interacts with the C-terminus of PHA2, which restrains the intramolecular interaction of the PHA2 C-terminus with the PHA2 central loop to attenuate autoinhibition of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity, resulting in increased PHA2 activity. Furthermore, the extent of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase autoinhibition involving phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms corresponds to phosphorylation of the penultimate Thr residue (Thr-951) in PHA2. These results suggest that StBRI1 phosphorylates PHA2 and enhances its activity, which subsequently promotes tuber development. Altogether, our results uncover a BR–StBRI1–PHA2 module that regulates tuber development and suggest a prospective strategy for improving tuberous crop growth and increasing yield via the cell surface-based BR signaling pathway.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"a4ab1808adc20c78175008048d276dfc54b82ab13023955a16122711e7fc0a10","category":"Environment"}
