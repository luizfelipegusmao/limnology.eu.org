{"title":"LncRNA HILPDA promotes contrast-induced acute kidney injury by recruiting eIF4B to upregulate XPO1 expression","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae096/7701765?rss=1","date":1719792000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a serious and common complication following the use of iodinated contrast media, with a 20% fatality rate. The function of long non-coding RNA HILPDA (lnc-HILPDA) in CI-AKI development was investigated in this study.<div>Methods</div>CI-AKI models were constructed by iopromide treatment. Kidney pathological changes were analyzed by HE staining. TUNEL labeling and flow cytometry were used to examine cell apoptosis. CCK-8 assay was used to determine cell viability. The interactions between lnc-HILPDA, eIF4B, and XPO1 were verified by RIP or Co-IP assay.<div>Results</div>Lnc-HILPDA was upregulated in CI-AKI, and its knockdown decreased contrast-trigged oxidative stress and apoptosis in HK-2 cells. Mechanically, lnc-HILPDA activated the NF-κB pathway by upregulating XPO1 through interacting with eIF4B. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of lnc-HILPDA downregulation on contrast-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in HK-2 cells was weakened by XPO1 overexpression.<div>Conclusion</div>Lnc-HILPDA accelerated CI-AKI progression by elevating XPO1 expression through eIF4B to activate NF-κB pathway.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"667570f6b896222cde54ce4bb2809431ce6fc2534611daaf09f75a08f6fd5cc6","category":"Environment"}
