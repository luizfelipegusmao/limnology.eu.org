{"title":"The demand for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in the Volta Region of Ghana","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308321","date":1725544800000,"content":"<p>by Livingstone Asem, Abdul-Gafaru Abdulia, Patrick Opoku Assuming, Gordon Abeka-Nkrumah</p>\r\nBackground <p>Malaria in pregnancy (MiP) is a preventable condition leading to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Invariably, with all the knowledge about the serious consequences of MiP for the woman, the unborn child, and the neonate, the uptake of Intermittent Preventive Treatment of Malaria in pregnancy using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) is low in most malaria-endemic countries, including Ghana. This study sought to examine the uptake and service user predictors of the implementation of IPTp-SP after the policy upgrade in 2014.</p> Methods <p>This cross-sectional survey was carried out in two selected districts in the Volta Region. The study participants were randomly selected from communities within Nkwanta North and North Tongu District. A total of 438 mothers who have delivered in the past 24 months were selected for the study. The women were interviewed on their background, knowledge, and attitude toward the use of IPTp-SP using a structured questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression was done to determine the factors that influence the demand for IPTp-SP. The results were presented in the form of tables.</p> Results <p>The mean number of antenatal care (ANC) attendance was 5 (SD:2.6) visits per client, with 262 (59.82%) of them getting the 3+ doses of IPTp-SP. Also, a significant 44 (10.1%) of the mothers did not receive any dose of IPTp-SP. Respondents who attended antenatal clinics 4–7 times had 7 (CI:3.9–12.3) times higher uptake of 3+ doses of IPTp-SP as compared to others who attended less than 4 visits. Similarly, women who had 8 or more visits had a 16.1 (CI: 5.9–43.6) times higher chance of getting more than 2 doses of IPTp-SP compared with others who had fewer than 4 attendances.</p> Conclusion <p>The uptake of 3+ doses of IPTp-SP is still lower than the global target of 80%. Thus, the need for innovative interventions aimed at improving antenatal attendance and early booking for IPTp-SP are recommended.</p>","author":"Livingstone Asem","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"43d39fc86e851803ddda6d84167c31617e945f64ec1766da2a304d8fe9457639","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
