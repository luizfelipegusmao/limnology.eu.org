{"title":"Street Tree Designs for Particulate Matter Reduction in Glasgow: A Supportive Approach for Urban Planning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1898/v1","date":1714378662000,"content":"Urban air pollution is a significant threat to both the environment and public health. Primarily originating from traffic emissions, particulate matter is identified as the most prevalent and toxic pollutant in cities. In recent years, street vegetation has emerged as a nature-based solution to improve urban air quality. However, to achieve this goal, proper placement of vegetation is crucial. This study critically investigates how different street tree placement strategies affect the local air quality, based on a model calibrated using existing air quality measurements from one of the most polluted streets in Glasgow. We then test the local air quality effects of tree orientation, spacing, shape, porosity, size, species, and wind directions. The findings suggest that trees effectively enhance air quality, particularly when implemented on the leeward side of the street. To achieve optimal effectiveness, the spacing of trees require careful alignment with the aspect ratio, as haphazard planting could lead to unfavorable results. The insights on improving air quality in Glasgow's street canyons, complements the objectives of the ‘Glasgow Avenues Programme’ and can be included in its Low Emission Zones to co-benefit the environment and the wellbeing of the local community.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fdccda392b8610197684ae864e61a1e8fd30922dfc1f02d870926b5967d4646d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
