{"title":"Saving High-Risk Patients from COVID-19 Severity and Death Mainly with Plant-Based Diets and Supplements","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0887/v1","date":1713166418000,"content":"Our report presents the findings from a treatment program that involved plant-based diets (PBDs) and supplements for 1,750 elderly cardiology patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between April 2020 and June 2023. At the start of the program, there was no published data supporting the use of PBDs for COVID-19 patients. However, after 18 months, studies were released that indicated the effectiveness of PBDs in decreasing the incidence and severity of COVID-19. Our treatment protocol differed from these studies in several ways. We carefully controlled the quality, quantity, and processing method of the foods we provided, opting for raw instead of cooked vegetables. Additionally, we incorporated supplementation that complemented the nutrients lacking in a PBD and enhanced the anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antithrombotic, and immunomodulatory properties of a PBD. Our patients recovered faster (12±1.4 days vs. 20.9±4.3 days), with lower severity (2% vs. 10-20%), hospitalizations (0 vs. 5-10%), and deaths (0 vs. 15-17%) compared to the general population. These favorable outcomes are particularly noteworthy given Indonesia's high COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates, among the highest in Asia. The findings of this report provide valuable insights for practitioners in managing high-risk elderly COVID-19 patients, particularly in avoiding severity and mortality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ced03b24cf6e3eca916ca3aeabe4e60e3fde95a1303305891fa4e19029a94c5e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
