{"title":"Overcoming Therapy Resistance in Colorectal Cancer: Targeting Rac1 Signaling Pathway as a Potential Therapeutic Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1939/v1","date":1724769811000,"content":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed type of cancer worldwide and is responsible for numerous deaths. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is an effective chemotherapy drug commonly used in the treatment of CRC, either as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs. However, half of CRC cases are resistant to 5-FU-based therapies. To contribute to the understanding the mechanisms underlying CRC resistance or recurrence after 5-FU-based therapies, we performed a comprehensive study integrating in silico, in vitro and in vivo approaches. We identified differentially expressed genes and enrichment of pathways associated with recurrence after 5-FU-based therapies. Using these bioinformatic data as a starting point, we selected a group of drugs that restored 5-FU sensitivity to 5-FU resistant cells. Interestingly, treatment with the novel Rac1 inhibitor, 1A-116, reversed morphological changes associated with 5-FU resistance back to a control-like status. Moreover, our in vivo studies have shown that 1A-116 affected tumor growth and the development of metastasis. All our data allowed us to postulate that targeting Rac1 represents a promising avenue for the development of new therapies for patients with CRC resistant to 5-FU-based therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b2fa4c927ad2a453d5e73a213ccace2727ae8575c923d9fe2b90fb1466ce9af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
