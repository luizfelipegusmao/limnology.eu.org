{"title":"Assessing N2 fixation flux and its controlling factors in the (sub)tropical western North Pacific through high‐resolution observations","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10404?af=R","date":1714728669000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The (sub)tropical western North Pacific is potentially an area of intense nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) fixation in the global ocean, despite limited understanding of the flux and controlling factors. We conducted high-resolution observations from 2016 to 2021 in this region and used machine learning algorithms to simulate N<sub>2</sub> fixation flux. Models estimated an N<sub>2</sub> fixation flux from 5.72 to 6.45 Tg N yr<sup>−1</sup>, with strong seasonal variation and peak rates in summer. The western North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and the Kuroshio Current contributed more to N<sub>2</sub> fixation flux than did the adjacent areas. Models suggested that sea surface temperature, photosynthetically available radiation, and nutrient supply were most strongly correlated with seasonal and spatial variations in N<sub>2</sub> fixation. This study provides an improved estimation of N<sub>2</sub> fixation in the western North Pacific and advances our understanding of its role in ocean productivity.</p>","author":"Xinran Yu, \nZuozhu Wen, \nRuotong Jiang, \nJin‐Yu Terence Yang, \nZhimian Cao, \nHaizheng Hong, \nYuntao Zhou, \nDalin Shi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Letters: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e3d6bd1d0a248694da65f62e7591c05124a8fbc5456d1cafb66209dfd7ae6238","entryHash":"e68f1faa9f9c0fcf493720f864d0c6d6619017040c5ddea59e22779d56acca4d","category":"Environment"}
