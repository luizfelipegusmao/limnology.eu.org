{"title":"Performance Enhancement of MRAC via Generalized Dynamic Inversion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1513/v1","date":1721314056000,"content":"Whilst Model Reference Adaptive Control theory provides mathematical techniques for achieving the performance of the system without undue dependence upon dynamic systems models, its applicability may not be suitable for systems that are crucial to safety due to suboptimal transient and error convergence performance. In this article, our approach enhances the performance of MRAC by utilizing a Generalized Dynamic Inversion (GDI). Two control actions are permitted under the GDI control law. One control is the particular part that is responsible for enforcing the reference system-constrained behaviors. Another control action is carried out by the control lawâ€™s auxiliary component and is incorporated into the standard MRAC control law. This augmented part is referred to as a null control vector, and it is used to enhance the performance of MRAC. The classic MRAC control law, when supplemented with a null vector term consisting of an adaptive gain that changes in response to tracking errors, forces the dynamical system to behave similarly to the reference model. This null vector, in particular, restricts the oscillation intensity of the tracking errors, which is employed to generate the adaptive parameters. It is demonstrated that this critical element of our approach enhances transient performance and ensures that error dynamics vanish asymptotically. Extensive simulations have been conducted to prove the efficacy of the proposed method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d48a4e8d61c7c5082cd3cefc562e3d3c3b9522a47e0401680ad37b05263aa617","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
