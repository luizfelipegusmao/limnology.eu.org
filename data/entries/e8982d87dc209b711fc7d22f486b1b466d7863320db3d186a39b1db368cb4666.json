{"title":"Service-Learning as a pedagogical practice for the promotion of generic competencies: A systematic review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0593/v1","date":1718084841000,"content":"Service-Learning (SL) is a methodology that links students directly with reality. It strengthens the development of different competencies in students as they participate in activities associated with community service. The objective of this work is to analyze the SL methodology as an effective pedagogical practice to promote the development of generic competencies in university students. This research is a systematic review. The articles were selected according to the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and the eligibility criteria proposed by the PICOS strategy (population, interventions, comparators, outcomes and study design) based on 71 records of scientifically identified articles in the Web of Science (WoS) Journal Citation Report databases. Publications between 1999 and 2022 were considered. The literature review allowed the selection of seven articles showing the results of qualitative, quantitative and mixed research. The results reveal that the application of SL enhances the learning of professional and transversal competencies such as teamwork, appreciation and respect for diversity and multiculturalism, ethical commitment, critical and self-critical capacity, social responsibility, among others. It is concluded that this pedagogical practice effectively consolidates the development of these competencies, and that the success of its application depends on the commitment of teachers, students and community partners.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8982d87dc209b711fc7d22f486b1b466d7863320db3d186a39b1db368cb4666","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
