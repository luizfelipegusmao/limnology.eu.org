Atomic resolution SE images of the beam entrance surface have been demonstrated [<a href=\"#ozae044.731-B1\">1-3</a>], including images of monolayer samples [<a href=\"#ozae044.731-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.731-B5\">5</a>]. In this work we introduce a Nion HERMES aberration corrected (AC) STEM with identical SE detectors below and above the specimen., opening the possibility of imaging the entrance and exit surfaces of transmissive samples simultaneously with other STEM data channels.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4a772d5a4283f39ab9bb751f6ebc70dfca869c5bacf2ea6e40ed526efbb01cf2","category":"Environment"}
