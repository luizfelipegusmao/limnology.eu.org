Appropriate trace mineral status was guaranteed by providing all cows with free choice access to an organic trace mineral supplement (7 gּ animal<sup>-1</sup>ּ d<sup>-1</sup>Availa 4, Zinpro Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN) 60 d prior to breeding. Cows were grouped in different pastures (n = 7). In each of the pasture groups, during CIDR placement, individually identified cows were randomized to either receive no drench (CON) or 30 mL of a supplemental trace mineral drench (PROFUSION, Zinpro Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN). Cows were initially bred by AI using one of two fixed-time AI protocols per group (FTAI; 7&amp;7 Synch, n = 1 and 7-d Co-Synch+CIDR, n = 6). One week following FTAI, bulls were turned out with the cows for approximately 45 d. Pregnancy was determined by a licensed veterinarian via trans-rectal ultrasonography. The data were analyzed using R Statistical Software with cow as the experimental unit, blocking by pasture. There was no difference in overall pregnancy rate (90%; <span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) between PROFUSION and CON cows at the end of the breeding period. However, PROFUSION cows had a statistically significant increase in AI pregnancy rates compared with CON cows (<span>P</span> = 0.05; 58.1% vs 53.2%, respectively). Supplementing an organic trace mineral drench prior to FTAI resulted in a positive improvement in AI pregnancy rates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"cceab7d731466ac21642f85eb7d14a2d3203b41f8a5af04fd37ece1d6498abe4","category":"Environment"}
