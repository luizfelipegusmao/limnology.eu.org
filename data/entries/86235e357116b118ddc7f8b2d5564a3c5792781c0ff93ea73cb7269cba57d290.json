{"title":"Qualitative Insights into Cultural Heritage Protection in Serbia: Evaluating Legal and Institutional Gaps","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1291/v1","date":1726628273000,"content":"This research is dedicated to a comprehensive examination of the strengths and weaknesses inherent in the legal and institutional measures designed to protect cultural heritage in the Republic of Serbia from the adverse effects of natural disasters, including earthquakes, landslides, rockfalls, floods, torrents, storms, hail, and forest fires. The study aims to identify the primary challenges and shortcomings within the existing legal and institutional framework, while also pinpointing and analyzing best practices and potential improvements for the protection system. This research posits a preliminary hypothesis suggesting that challenges may exist within the legal and institutional framework for the protection of cultural heritage in the Republic of Serbia, potentially limiting effective response and recovery following natural disasters. This hypothesis will be further developed and adapted based on the analysis of available data. Data collection for this research was conducted through semi-structured interviews with experts and an in-depth analysis of existing documentation. By conducting interviews with experts in the field, the research seeks to gather critical data and insights that will enhance the understanding of these issues and contribute to formulating viable solutions. The analysis and processing of data were carried out using ATLAS.ti software, which facilitated a comprehensive and systematic examination of the collected qualitative information. Furthermore, an assessment of the current capacity of institutions to respond rapidly and effectively to natural disasters that pose a threat to cultural heritage is a key component of the study. The ultimate goal is to develop recommendations that will fortify the legal and institutional framework, thereby bolstering the resilience of cultural heritage sites in Serbia against future natural disasters. The results of the research, highlight significant deficiencies in the legal framework, inadequate institutional capacities and resources, as well as a lack of proper training for crisis response. The need for improved inter-institutional cooperation and the development of technical-logistical resources is emphasized. This paper represents a significant contribution to the understanding and enhancement of the cultural heritage protection system, providing a foundation for further research and strategy development in this area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"86235e357116b118ddc7f8b2d5564a3c5792781c0ff93ea73cb7269cba57d290","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
