{"title":"RNA splicing modulates the postharvest physiological deterioration of cassava storage root","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/461/7651144?rss=1","date":1713398400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Rapid postharvest physiological deterioration (PPD) of cassava (<span>Manihot esculenta</span> Crantz) storage roots is a major constraint that limits the potential of this plant as a food and industrial crop. Extensive studies have been performed to explore the regulatory mechanisms underlying the PPD processes in cassava to understand their molecular and physiological responses. However, the exceptional functional versatility of alternative splicing (AS) remains to be explored during the PPD process in cassava. Here, we identified several aberrantly spliced genes during the early PPD stage. An in-depth analysis of AS revealed that the abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis pathway might serve as an additional molecular layer in attenuating the onset of PPD. Exogenous ABA application alleviated PPD symptoms through maintaining ROS generation and scavenging. Interestingly, the intron retention transcript of <span>MeABA1</span> (ABA DEFICIENT 1) was highly correlated with PPD symptoms in cassava storage roots. RNA yeast 3-hybrid and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays showed that the serine/arginine-rich protein MeSCL33 (SC35-like splicing factor 33) binds to the precursor mRNA of <span>MeABA1</span>. Importantly, overexpressing <span>MeSCL33</span> in cassava conferred improved PPD resistance by manipulating the AS and expression levels of <span>MeABA1</span> and then modulating the endogenous ABA levels in cassava storage roots. Our results uncovered the pivotal role of the ABA biosynthesis pathway and RNA splicing in regulating cassava PPD resistance and proposed the essential roles of <span>MeSCL33</span> for conferring PPD resistance, broadening our understanding of SR proteins in cassava development and stress responses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"30edc32865534b8c079bc5be90dee8d82ff108d6f69a6f4f1a6b298c67794ea8","category":"Environment"}
