{"title":"Chikungunya Infection Increases Osteoclastogenic Genes Ex-pression in Blood and Chronic Arthralgia May Be Related to Enhanced Osteoclast Survival","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0080/v1","date":1722564394000,"content":"Infection with the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) manifests as a febrile illness known as chikungunya fever (CHIKF). CHIKF is characterized by sudden-onset high fever, rash, polyarthritis, and polyarthralgia. Alt-hough the infection typically resolves within two weeks, many patients experience recurrent joint pain and inflammation that can outlast the other symptoms for many months. CHIKF has been previously linked to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) due to similar inflammatory processes. This study aimed to identify molecular markers in the blood of CHIKV-infected individuals associated with joint pain and chronicity of CHIKF. Sequencing of B and T cell receptors (BCR and TCR) revealed that CHIKV infection reduces CDR3 diver-sity. Lower BCR diversity was linked to increased expression of genes involved in osteoclast differentiation and activation through RANK/RANKL signaling. If osteoclast involvement in CHIKF pathogenesis is con-firmed, existing therapeutic approaches could be used as alternative treatments for CHIKF patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f2e6f27ea36894f09aaee9e7f2e690d93a9665e13aa06646c24f72e522fc0e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
