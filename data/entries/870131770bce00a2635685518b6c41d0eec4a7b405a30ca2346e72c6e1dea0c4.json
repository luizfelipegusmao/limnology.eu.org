{"title":"Dynamic Modelling and Simulation of a Prototype Electric Vehicle Powered by Photovoltaic Energy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0781/v1","date":1720601808000,"content":"The study involves the creation of a solar-powered car that can travel up to 70 km with a maximum speed of 35.7 km/h, the vehicle mass is 300 kg. It stores some energy, which is then converted into electric energy that can be consumed by other electrical appliances, making it an electrical energy generator. The two back wheels are equipped with 3,000 W electric motors to enable movement.  When the vehicle moves, power dissipates due to resistances that must be overcome to move it. Auxiliary components and the battery powering the system also require energy, resulting in not all power being transmitted to the electric vehicle's wheels. This article aims to create a prototype of the electric vehicle model. A model of the photovoltaic system, considering the geographic coordinates and solar parameters of the location, as well as the BLDC motor and vehicle dynamics, is required to examine the component behavior based on the observable parameters. These pa-rameters consist of the resistive torque, angular speed, and resistance values that need to be overcome to evaluate the electric vehicle's performance. Once the lost power has been determined, the remaining power will be allocated to power other electrical devices. The variations in the parameters considered are crucial for the performance of an electric vehicle equipped with a photovoltaic and mechanical power supply system, as one of the sources of our prototype is mechanical and provides 400 W of power.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"870131770bce00a2635685518b6c41d0eec4a7b405a30ca2346e72c6e1dea0c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
