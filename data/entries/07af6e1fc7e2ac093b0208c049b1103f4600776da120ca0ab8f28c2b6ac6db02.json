{"title":"The Impact of the Mining Facility on the Environment on the Example of the Křov&iacute; Quarry (Czech Republic)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1222/v1","date":1721048614000,"content":"The aim of the study was to assess the intensity of the impact of the Křoví mining facility on the environment. The impact of the exploitation of rock deposits in Křoví on the atmosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and anthroposphere was presented. Vulnerability to natural hazards was also assessed. The multi-criteria Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and the Leopold matrix were used to assess the impact. The assessment of the impact of raw material extraction in the quarry was carried out by competent experts. It has been found that the lithosphere and biosphere are under the greatest pressure due to land use and surface transformation (including deforestation). The increased susceptibility of the area to natural hazards was noted due to vibrations caused by increased truck traffic (transportation of excavated material). The total value of the matrix indicates the average intensity of the mining facility's impact on the environment. The location of the deposit above the water table of the Bílý potok river means that the extraction of the mineral has a minor impact on the water conditions in the area. Changes in topography and vegetation, and soil degradation are temporary and reversible. Once the mining operations have ceased, the site should be reclaimed and the program of reforestation and habitat restoration implemented to help mitigate adverse impacts on the biosphere.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07af6e1fc7e2ac093b0208c049b1103f4600776da120ca0ab8f28c2b6ac6db02","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
