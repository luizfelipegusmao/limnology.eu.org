{"title":"Unraveling the Complexity of the Ne/Nc Ratio for Conservation of Large and Widespread Pelagic Fish Species: Current Status and Challenges","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.70020?af=R","date":1728544773000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Estimating and understanding the ratio between effective population size (<i>N</i>\n<sub>e</sub>) and census population size (<i>N</i>\n<sub>c</sub>) are pivotal in the conservation of large marine pelagic fish species, including bony fish such as tunas and cartilaginous fish such as sharks, given the challenges associated with obtaining accurate estimates of their abundance. The difficulties inherent in capturing and monitoring these species in vast and dynamic marine environments often make direct estimation of their population size challenging. By focusing on <i>N</i>\n<sub>e</sub>, it is conceivable in certain cases to approximate census size once the <i>N</i>\n<sub>e</sub>/<i>N</i>\n<sub>c</sub> ratio is known, although this ratio can vary and does not always increase linearly, as it is influenced by various ecological and evolutionary factors. Thus, this ratio presents challenges and complexities in the context of pelagic species conservation. To delve deeper into these challenges, firstly, we recall the diverse types of effective population sizes, including contemporary and historical sizes, and their implications in conservation biology. Secondly, we outline current knowledge about the influence of life history traits on the <i>N</i>\n<sub>e</sub>/<i>N</i>\n<sub>c</sub> ratio in the light of examples drawn from large and abundant pelagic fish species. Despite efforts to document an increasing number of marine species using recent technologies and statistical methods, establishing general rules to predict <i>N</i>\n<sub>e</sub>/<i>N</i>\n<sub>c</sub> remains elusive, necessitating further research and investment. Finally, we recall statistical challenges in relating <i>N</i>\n<sub>e</sub> and <i>N</i>\n<sub>c</sub> emphasizing the necessity of aligning temporal and spatial scales. This last part discusses the roles of generation and reproductive cycle effective population sizes to predict genetic erosion and guiding management strategies. Collectively, these sections underscore the multifaceted nature of effective population size estimation, crucial for preserving genetic diversity and ensuring the long-term viability of populations. By navigating statistical and theoretical complexities, and addressing methodological challenges, scientists should be able to advance our understanding of the <i>N</i>\n<sub>e</sub>/<i>N</i>\n<sub>c</sub> ratio.</p>","author":"Chrystelle Delord, \nSophie Arnaud‚ÄêHaond, \nAgostino Leone, \nJonathan Rolland, \nNatacha Nikolic","siteTitle":"Wiley: Evolutionary Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"df2df3df25f90ba55fdf535f13dd2e89e7355c6f34118f20800f9e7201897f76","entryHash":"a945a119281df354f4afdb2cebacc08ab1adc10d77be38a73cf1343e383e7ab9","category":"Environment"}
