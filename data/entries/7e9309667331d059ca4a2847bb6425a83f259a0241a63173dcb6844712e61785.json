{"title":"Glycosphingolipids in Cardiovascular Disease: Insights from Molecular Mechanisms and Heart Failure Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0649/v1","date":1725873975000,"content":"This review explores the crucial role of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) in the context of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), focusing on their biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, and implications for clinical outcomes. GSLs are pivotal in regulating a myriad of cellular functions that are essential for heart health and disease progression. Highlighting findings from both human cohorts and animal models, this review emphasizes the potential of GSLs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We advocate for more detailed mechanistic studies to deepen our understanding of GSL functions in cardiovascular health, which could lead to innovative strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and personalized medicine in cardiovascular care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e9309667331d059ca4a2847bb6425a83f259a0241a63173dcb6844712e61785","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
