{"title":"Enhancement of orthodontic tooth movement by local administration of biofunctional molecules: a comprehensive systematic review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0173/v1","date":1719906344000,"content":"Enhancement of orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) through local administration of biofunctional molecules has become increasingly significant, particularly for adult patients seeking aesthetic and functional improvements. This comprehensive systematic review analyzes the efficacy of various biofunctional molecules in modulating OTM, focusing on the method of administration and its feasibility, especially considering the potential for topical application. A search across multiple databases yielded 36 original articles of experimental human and animal OTM models, which examined biofunctional molecules capable of interfering with the biochemical reactions that cause tooth movement during orthodontic therapy, accelerating the OTM rate through their influence on the bone metabolism (Calcitriol, Prostaglandins, Recombinant human Relaxin, RANKL and RANKL expression plasmid, growth factors, PTH, osteocalcin, vitamin C and E, biocompatible reduced graphene oxide, exogenous thyroxine, sclerostin protein, a specific EP4 agonist (ONO-AE1-329), carrageenan and herbal extracts). The results indicated a variable efficacy in accelerating OTM, with Calcitriol, Prostaglandins (PGE1 and PGE2), RANKL, growth factors and PTH, among others, showing promising outcomes. PGE1, PGE2 and Calcitriol experiments had statistically significant outcomes in both human and animal studies, and, while other molecules underwent only animal testing, they could be validated in the future for human use. Notably, only one of the animal studies explored topical administration, which also suggests a future research direction. This review concluded that while certain biofunctional molecules demonstrated potential for OTM enhancement, the evidence is not definitive. The development of suitable topical formulations for human use could offer a patient-friendly alternative to injections, emphasizing comfort and cost-effectiveness. Future research should focus on overcoming current methodological limitations and advancing translational research to confirm these biomolecules' efficacy and safety in clinical orthodontic practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"328bbcbf28ea0a4e8c140a993904e3ee607b3a469c67a47435192478eb0822b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
