{"title":"Hold the door! Stomatal defense also protects against mites","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2491/7643764?rss=1","date":1712707200000,"content":"<span>With the exception of a few passionate acarologists, mites are probably not among anyone's favorite bugs. They colonize our skin (causing diseases), our beds (causing allergies), our pets (feeding on their blood), and even cute little honeybees (contributing to the colony collapse disorder responsible for tremendous bee losses worldwide). Nobody has asked (on the record) plants about their opinion on mites, but if someone would have, they would probably share the same lack of fondness toward these little bugs, as mites also parasitize plants. In fact, phytophagous (i.e. plant-feeding) mites pose serious threats to many plant species, including many economically important crops. One of the most ubiquitous and problematic phytophagous mites is the two-spotted spider mite, <span>Tetranychus urticae</span>, that infects more than 1500 different plant species (<a href=\"#kiae212-B5\">Migeon and Dorkeld 2024</a>). <span>T. urticae</span> pierces and feeds on individual leaf parenchyma cells, causing chlorosis and cell death. Its fully sequenced genome, the first from an arachnid, together with its ability to feed on <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span> have made <span>T. urticae</span> a model species for the study of plant–herbivore interactions (<a href=\"#kiae212-B2\">Grbić et al. 2011</a>). Nevertheless, phytophagous mite infectious strategies and plant defense mechanisms against them are much less studied and characterized than those of more canonical pathogens such as bacteria or fungi.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"8b185481b5febcf34a2d95aa5676f11af0f68f4a5b3bb2562639b4650454a4de","category":"Environment"}
