{"title":"Emission Factors of Non-exhaust Pollutants Emitted by Light Road Vehicles in Real Driving. A New Challenge for Clean Road Transport for Improving Urban Air Quality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1469/v1","date":1711361425000,"content":"Non-exhaust road transport emissions in cities contribute to poor air quality and create health impacts. This paper presents a new study of the emitted particles due to the tyres-road wear ‘TRWP’ in real driving and gives their emission factors EF. The most frequently observed particles were &amp;lt;1 µm; followed by particles size between [1µm, 4µm] for urban, suburban and highway areas. These particle sizes are well-known to have a higher degree of toxicity. An overall analysis of all the measured pollutants gave EF equal to 30 10+12 #/km and 35 10+12 #/km, respectively for urban and sub-urban areas; and 5 10+12 #/km on highway. The analysis of the 19 most emitted pollutants, taken individually, showed that their EFs ranged from 0.003 to 18.142 10+12#/km. The obtained EF are above the value of the Euro standard for vehicles, but are below the values for vehicles unequipped with a particle filter. Significant test analysis confirmed that inertia of chemical pollutants is homogeneous. EF assessment of the PM10 and PM2.5 emitted is equal to 1.45 mg/km and 0.35 mg/km respectively. These results should contribute to the emergence of future regulations of non-exhaust emissions and should help to analyse the exposure-impact relationship to TRWP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84fadfeb637f21119d89d14ba6fb515cee6fee9c0277aab6fef644a93ab18cf3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
