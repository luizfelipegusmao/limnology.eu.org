{"title":"Access, Readiness, and Willingness to Engage in Allied Health Telerehabilitation Services for Adults: Does Cultural and Linguistic Diversity Make a Difference?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0416/v1","date":1712292956000,"content":"Telerehabilitation is an appealing service delivery option for optimising recovering. Internationally, the equity of telerehabilitation services for people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds has been questioned. Using a 31-item survey, our study explored the access, readiness, and willingness of 260 patients to use allied health telerehabilitation services for adults receiving interventions from a large tertiary health service located in Sydney, Australia.  Overall, 72% patients reported having access to technology, 38% met our readiness criteria, and 53% reported willingness to engage in telerehabilitation. There were no difference in access, readiness and willingness to engage in telerehabilitation between patients from CALD and non-CALD backgrounds. Age was the only factor that influenced access, readiness and willingness to engage in telerehabilitation. Past experience of telerehabilitation was related to willingness, but not access or readiness. Findings highlight the importance of ensuring positive patient experiences to promote ongoing willingness to use telerehabilitation. Efforts are needed to improve patientsâ€™ digital health literacy, especially patients from older age groups, to ensure equitable access to telerehabilitation services.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8edd6027c47c9653ee1dd85496bf0bb32edc2564a583cf8139752eddaed8559","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
