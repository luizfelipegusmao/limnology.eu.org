{"title":"Plants and river morphodynamics: The emergence of fluvial biogeomorphology","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4271?af=R","date":1712289525000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In this article, we track the evolution of fluvial biogeomorphology from the middle of the 20th century to the present. We consider the emergence of fluvial biogeomorphology as an interdisciplinary research area that integrates knowledge drawn primarily from fluvial geomorphology and plant ecology, but with inputs from hydrology and landscape ecology. We start by assembling evidence for the emergence of the field of fluvial biogeomorphology with a keyword search of the Web of Science and a detailed analysis of papers published in two scientific journals: a geomorphology journal—Earth Surface Processes and Landforms; a multidisciplinary river science journal—River Research and Applications. Based on this evidence, we identify three distinct time periods in the development of fluvial biogeomorphology: the ‘early years’ before 1990; the transitional decade of the 1990s; and the period of rapid expansion and diversification in themes, methods and investigation scales since 2000. Because the literature is vast, we can only summarize developments in each of these time periods, but we refer to recent in-depth reviews and conceptual perspectives on relevant topics. Thus, rather than a full and deep review, we present an annotated bibliographic overview of the development of fluvial biogeomorphology, whereby the text describes broad trends but is supported by tables of citations that can deliver greater detail. We end with a brief consideration of likely future developments.</p>","author":"A. M. Gurnell, \nW.
