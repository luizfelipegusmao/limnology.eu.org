{"title":"An estimate of fitness reduction from mutation accumulation in a mammal allows assessment of the consequences of relaxed selection","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002795","date":1727359200000,"content":"<p>by Jobran Chebib, Anika Jonas, Eugenio López-Cortegano, Sven Künzel, Diethard Tautz, Peter D. Keightley</p>\r\n\r\nEach generation, spontaneous mutations introduce heritable changes that tend to reduce fitness in populations of highly adapted living organisms. This erosion of fitness is countered by natural selection, which keeps deleterious mutations at low frequencies and ultimately removes most of them from the population. The classical way of studying the impact of spontaneous mutations is via mutation accumulation (MA) experiments, where lines of small effective population size are bred for many generations in conditions where natural selection is largely removed. Such experiments in microbes, invertebrates, and plants have generally demonstrated that fitness decays as a result of MA. However, the phenotypic consequences of MA in vertebrates are largely unknown, because no replicated MA experiment has previously been carried out. This gap in our knowledge is relevant for human populations, where societal changes have reduced the strength of natural selection, potentially allowing deleterious mutations to accumulate. Here, we study the impact of spontaneous MA on the mean and genetic variation for quantitative and fitness-related traits in the house mouse using the MA experimental design, with a cryopreserved control to account for environmental influences. We show that variation for morphological and life history traits accumulates at a sufficiently high rate to maintain genetic variation and selection response. Weight and tail length measures decrease significantly between 0.04% and 0.3% per generation with narrow confidence intervals. Fitness proxy measures (litter size and surviving offspring) decrease on average by about 0.2% per generation, but with confidence intervals overlapping zero. When extrapolated to humans, our results imply that the rate of fitness loss should not be of concern in the foreseeable future.","author":"Jobran Chebib","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"dbd1b27e2370d33a4f4dc8221a096ade7800737113d9a1f74ebd1779d1fd8986","category":"Environment"}
