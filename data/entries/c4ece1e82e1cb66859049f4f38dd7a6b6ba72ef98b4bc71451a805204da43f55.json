{"title":"Bromelain: Unveiling Its Potential as a Natural Anti-inflammatory Agent through Effective Binding to Apoptosis-Associated Speck-Like Containing CARD (ASC)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0132/v1","date":1725353944000,"content":"This theoretical study presents a novel perspective on the potential anti-inflammatory properties of Bromelain, a natural agent extracted from pineapple stems. The investigation explores the binding capabilities of Bromelain to Apoptosis-associated speck-like containing CARD (ASC), a crucial adapter molecule known for its involvement in inflammatory processes and inflammasome formation. For the first time, these findings suggest that Bromelain exhibits a notable affinity for ASC, indicating its promising role as a natural anti-inflammatory agent. This study sheds light on the molecular interactions that may contribute to Bromelain's therapeutic potential in modulating inflammatory responses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4ece1e82e1cb66859049f4f38dd7a6b6ba72ef98b4bc71451a805204da43f55","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
