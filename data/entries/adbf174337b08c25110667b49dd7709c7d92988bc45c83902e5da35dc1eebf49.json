{"title":"Assessment of Salt, Potassium and Iodine Intake in Croatian Adult Population Using 24-Hour Urinary Collection: EH-UH 2 Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0169/v1","date":1719906242000,"content":"Cardiovascular diseases, which are the leading cause of death in Croatia, are linked to the high prevalence of hypertension. Both are associated with high salt intake which was determined almost two decades ago when Croatian Action on Salt and Health (CRASH) was launched. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate salt, potassium, and iodine intake using 24-hour urine samples in a random sample of adult Croatian population, and to analyse trends in salt consumption after the CRASH has intensively started. Methods: In this national population-based EH-UH 2 study performed in 2018-2021 (participation rate 72 %) in which we analysed a single 24-hour urine sample, 1067 adult participants (mean age 57.12 (SD 13.9), men 35%) were included. Results: Mean salt and potassium intakes were 8.6 g/day (IQR 6.2-11.2) and 2.8 g/day (IQR 2.1-3.5), respectively, with sodium-to-potassium ratio of 2.6 (IQR 1.8-3.3). We detected a decrease of 17.6% (2 g/day less) in salt consumption compared to our previous salt-mapping study. However, only 13.7%, and 8.9 % met the WHO salt and potassium recommended target of 5 g/day, and 3.5 g/day, respectively. Salt intake was higher, and potassium ingestion was lower in rural vs. urban regions, and in continental vs. Mediterranean parts of Croatia. Moderate to severe iodine insufficiency was determined in only 3% adult participants. Conclusion: In the last fifteen years, salt consumption has been significantly reduced in Croatian adult population because of intensive and broad CRASH program led by the Croatian Society of Hypertension and the Croatian Hypertension League. However, salt intake is still too high, and potassium ingestion is too low. With expected more active engagement and help of the government, obtained results could be significantly improved. Salt reduction programs are most cost-effective methods of cardiovascular disease prevention and should be considered more seriously by the government and health policy makers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"adbf174337b08c25110667b49dd7709c7d92988bc45c83902e5da35dc1eebf49","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
