{"title":"Isolation of Bacterial L‐Glutaminase as Anticancer Agent from Different Soil Environments in Egypt Using 16S rRNA Homology Technique","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0641/v1","date":1723181148000,"content":"Background:\nBreast cancer and other neoplasms, such as acute lymphocytic leukaemia, are a\nsevere hazard to public health globally. L-glutamine-degrading enzymes are required\nfor the treatment of malignancies such as acute lymphocytic leukemia and breast\ncancer. L-glutaminase, an amidohydrolase, has been shown to be an effective\nchemotherapeutic tool for treating a variety of malignancies. The aim of the study:\nMolecular characterization is used in the study and production of bacterial L- glutaminase as an anticancer agent from a variety of Egyptian soil locales. The type of the study:\nScreening experimental study. Methodology:\nIn the current study, many bacterial isolates were tested on mineral L-glutamine\nagar selective medium (MGA) to evaluate if they generated L-glutaminase. The most\neffective positive bacterial isolates that produce L-glutaminase, however, were\ndiscovered by morphological and biochemical analysis. The primary positive isolate\nproducing L-glutaminase was also identified utilizing molecular detection by 16S\nrRNA sequencing homology technique. The properties of bacteria-produced L- glutaminase were investigated. The anticancer activity was assessed with an MTT\nassay. Results:\nSole bacterial isolates that only needed L-glutamine for metabolic nitrogen grew well\non MGA. The optimal conditions for producing positive bacterial isolates were pH 7.4\nand 37 ̊C. The morphological and biochemical investigations of soil samples from\ndiverse soil conditions in Egypt revealed that Bacillus subtilis subsp. niger (ATCC 9372)\nwas the primary positive bacterial isolate producing L-glutaminase. At a pH of 7.4\nand a temperature of 37 °C, the activators KCL, ZnSO4, FeSO4, K2HPO4, and MgSO4\noffered ideal conditions for defining L-glutaminase production. L-glutaminase from\nBacillus subtilis was detected to be a highly bioavailable and efficient anticancer\ntreatment. The original yield [productivity] from MGA was 6.3 U/ml, but invitro coupled\ntranscription and translation production raised it to 89± 1 U/ml. L-glutaminase had a\nmolecular mass of approximately 36 kDa. The purification of L-glutaminase resulted\ntotal activity of 21,883 ± 15.67 (U), specific activity of 379.14 ± 7.35 (U/mg of\nprotein), and purification fold of 1.82 ± 3.06. The enzymatic activators Ni2+ and Mg\n2+\nincreased L-glutaminase activity by 20%, 27%, respectively. The compound showed significant anticancer activity (IC50 = 38.72, 8.6, 6.41, 19.02, 49.83, and 9.45 μg/ml) against cancer cell lines from the liver (HepG-2), colon (HCT- 116), breast (MCF-7), lung (A-549), lymphocytic (CCL-120), and cervical (Hela). The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were 15.2^ 10\n-3 M and 119.86 μmol/ml/min,\nindicating a higher affinity for the substrate. The enzyme demonstrated high efficacy at pH 6.5 and temperature 35. The enzyme\nwas thermostable at 58 ̊C for 1 hour.\nConclusion:\nAcute lymphocytic leukemia and breast cancer are two instances of auxotrophic\nmalignancies for which L-glutamine is the sole metabolic source, and Bacillus subtilis- derived L-glutaminase was a suitable enzyme in their treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a849357a1332eb6cebb797ac0968b6d5bd1b4d47b11b4d5a4e5b468f9a60d74","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
