A large specimen was caught off the coast of Skjerjehamn, western Norway (total length = 410 mm; weight = 1274 g). The age of the specimen was determined to be 34 years old based on the analysis of its opercula bones. This specimen establishes a new maximum age for ballan wrasse, 5 years older than the previously observed maximum age.</p>","author":"Calum J. Pritchard, \nMarthe M. R.
