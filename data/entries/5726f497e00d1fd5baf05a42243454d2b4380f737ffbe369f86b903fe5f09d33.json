{"title":"High-resolution STEM Image Acquisition Method for Tilted Specimen Using a New Type of Aberration Corrector","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.147/7719558?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>When acquiring scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) images, it is necessary to align the crystalline zone axis of a specimen tilt with a goniometer and a holder. Since the backlash and drift cannot be avoided in such operations, it is necessary to wait for the drift to settle after aligning crystalline zone axis for a high-quality image acquisition. Therefore, it is desirable to operate a goniometer or a holder mechanically as less as possible. Meanwhile, advances in aberration correction technology have been remarkable and three-hexapole type STEM corrector, Large Aperture STEM Corrector (LASCOR), was recently developed by CEOS GmbH [<a href=\"#ozae044.147-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.147-B2\">2</a>]. It is capable of correcting aberrations up to sixth-order three-lobe aberration which had been a limiting factor in the ASCOR corrector. With the LASCOR, the Ronchigram flat area has now been extended to 80 mrad in semi-angle at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Thanks to this large flat area, one can align crystalline zone axis using only optical elements (beam tilt and projector shift) of a microscope without any mechanical operation. In this study, we demonstrate a high-resolution STEM image acquisition using this technique.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5726f497e00d1fd5baf05a42243454d2b4380f737ffbe369f86b903fe5f09d33","category":"Environment"}
