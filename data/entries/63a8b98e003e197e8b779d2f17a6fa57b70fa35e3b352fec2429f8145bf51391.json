{"title":"Managing Nigerian Education System: A Blueprint for Economic Diversification and Emancipation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0802/v1","date":1718177823000,"content":"It is axiomatic to underscore that a well-managed education system is deemed globally as one of the crucial prerequisites for not only the growth and development of every society or geopolitical space but also one of the veritable hallmarks of a diversified and functional economy that will, in the long run, culminate in economic emancipation of the people. The education industry faces enormous challenges in several countries in Africa, and Nigeria is not an exception. Even though education remains the bedrock or superstructure on which other societal structures such as politics, culture, religion, economics, etc. are laid; it is quite disheartening that education in Nigeria is not effectively and efficiently managed for economic diversification and emancipation of the recipients of such education. Indeed, the industry faces innumerable challenges, especially in contemporary times than in the pre-colonial era when the education system was essentially functional. The hydra-headed nature of the challenges with Nigeriaâ€™s educational system has inevitably resulted in different dimensions of economic quagmires entangling the country and making most of its citizens find it extremely difficult to eke out and or survive. The level of dysfunctionalities in various sections of the education system has made it seemingly intractable to palliate the economic predicaments that have been confronting the country let alone emancipate it from the monoculture of its overdependence on oil. The author of this treatise is diagnostic in his approach to understanding the intricacies of the challenges that frontally battle the Nigerian education system and deprive it of being a veritable tool for a functional economy as well catalyst for the economic emancipation of its people. The paper, through the analyses of relevant literature, amplifies the conceptual and operational dimensions of the identified challenges, offers probable suggestions on the ways by which the challenges can be tackled and finally draws a conclusion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63a8b98e003e197e8b779d2f17a6fa57b70fa35e3b352fec2429f8145bf51391","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
