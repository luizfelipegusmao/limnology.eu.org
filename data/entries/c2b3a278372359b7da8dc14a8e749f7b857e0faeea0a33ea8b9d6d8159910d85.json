{"title":"Bridging the gap between recommendation and reality: Improving dietary adherence of heart failure populations a cross-sectional study in Ethiopia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311663","date":1728568800000,"content":"<p>by Takla Tamir, Jemberu Nigussie, Migbaru Endawoke</p>\r\nBackground <p>Heart failure (HF), a complex condition arising from impaired ventricular function, necessitates strict adherence to dietary recommendations for optimal patient management. However, information regarding adherence and its influencing factors remains limited.</p> Aim <p>This study aimed to assess dietary recommendation adherence and its associated factors among HF patients at Southern Ethiopia public hospitals.</p> Methods and results <p>A cross-sectional study involving 521 participants employed systematic random sampling. Data collection utilized pre-tested, interviewer-administered questionnaires and medical chart reviews. Data were entered and analyzed using Epi Data 3.1 and SPSS 20.0 software. Descriptive statistics were performed. Variables with p-values &lt; 0.25 in binary logistic regression were included in multivariable logistic regression analyses. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval. Results are presented in text, tables, and figures.With a 97.4% response rate, adherence ranged from 20.3% (vegetables and fruits) to 60.3% (fat-free diet). Only 8.1% achieved good adherence across all parameters, with overall adherence at 33.4% (95% CI: 29–37). Multivariable analysis revealed that patients aged 41–60 years (AOR: 1.7), with a history of admission (AOR: 2.5), free from comorbidities (AOR: 0.58), and possessing a favorable attitude (AOR: 0.45) had statistically significant associations with good adherence.</p> Conclusion <p>Dietary adherence among HF patients remains a challenge. Healthcare providers, particularly those in chronic follow-up settings, should prioritize improving patient attitudes towards proper dietary practices. Tailored education programs targeting younger patients and those free from comorbidities should be implemented. Continuous monitoring, evaluation, and staff recognition for effective client counseling are crucial.</p>","author":"Takla Tamir","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c2b3a278372359b7da8dc14a8e749f7b857e0faeea0a33ea8b9d6d8159910d85","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
