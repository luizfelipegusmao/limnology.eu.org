{"title":"Targeting Cardiovascular Disease Receptors with Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs): Molecular Docking and Dynamics Insights","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0586/v1","date":1725866235000,"content":"Infection-related cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent a significant health challenge, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies targeting key receptors involved in inflammation and infection. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer a promising approach, potentially disrupting pathogenic processes. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of AMPs as therapeutic agents by examining their interactions with critical CVD-related receptors. A comprehensive computational approach was utilized to assess the interactions between AMPs and receptors associated with CVDs. Molecular docking studies were conducted to evaluate AMP binding to target receptors: ACE2, CRP, MMP9, NLRP3, and TLR4. The top-performing AMPs were further analyzed through 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and their binding affinities were quantified using MM/PBSA calculations. The analysis revealed that Tachystatin, Pleurocidin, and Subtilisin A exhibit strong binding affinities to key CVD-related receptors, including ACE2, CRP, and MMP9. These AMPs demonstrated the potential for disrupting receptor-peptide interactions critical to infection and inflammation. MD simulations confirmed the stability of AMP-receptor complexes, with MM/PBSA calculations showing significant binding energies. Future directions include conducting in vitro and in vivo studies to validate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of these AMPs in clinical settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31856c78ba1fa6c39dccf60b571ddcc512704d5a0867e985e9c7538924ab405d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
