{"title":"Advanced IoT Architecture for Energy Optimization and Intelligent Device Management in Smart Environments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2138/v1","date":1717151726000,"content":"The purpose of this article is to present an IoT architecture implemented in an intelligent environment, focusing on the optimization of initial conditions and device management. A general control system was developed using an open-source platform, integrating aWi-Fi network and YAML coding to enable communication and control of the IoT architecture devices. The implementation includes actuators, sensors, and control devices that, through a graphical interface, allow the visualization of the historical record of activities and real-time measurements of connected devices. The design includes specific mechanisms and the analysis of materials through tensile tests on specimens, following the ASTM E8 standard, and deformation test simulations, in which PLA demonstrated better performance compared to materials like ABS and resin. The significance of the implemented IoT system lies in an energy saving of 58% compared to conventional structures. Additionally, the study of response times for network connections showed that using an Ethernet cable resulted in a response time of 1.21 seconds, representing a reduction of 1.65 seconds compared to the second lowest value obtained.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d82722ba312c79059215ab64223646e20051f51e84a42f45e6be81fb58871379","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
