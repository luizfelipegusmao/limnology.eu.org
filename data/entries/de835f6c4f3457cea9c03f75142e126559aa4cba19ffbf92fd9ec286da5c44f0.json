{"title":"Rupture of Mycotic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm as a Result of Incompletely Treated Multiple Peripheral Mycotic Aneurysms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0348/v1","date":1715072526000,"content":"Background A mycotic aortic aneurysm is a rare type of aortic aneurysm that can cause serious and adverse outcomes. Most mycotic aneurysms originate from infectious sources, such as trauma, vegetation in the heart, and adjacent infectious sources. If a mycotic aneurysm is diagnosed, it should be treated simultaneously with the primary source of the infection. \nCase Report A 63-year-old male presented to the emergency room with a fever, the primary source of which had not been confirmed, and had not responded to antibiotic treatment for two weeks. Treatment was initiated for a mycotic aneurysm of the brachial artery that occurred suddenly while undergoing treatment for the fever. Further investigation revealed that a mycotic aneurysm of the brachial artery was the cause of the fever, followed by aneurysms in the abdomen and lower extremities, and even vegetation on the heart that was not initially present. The patient declined to undergo treatment for personal reasons. After five months, a contained rupture of the abdominal aortic aneurysm that was initially considered as normal aorta was diagnosed and was treated successfully.\nConclusions A peripheral mycotic aneurysm may be associated with multiple aneurysms. Appropriate diagnosis and complete management are necessary to prevent fatal consequences.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de835f6c4f3457cea9c03f75142e126559aa4cba19ffbf92fd9ec286da5c44f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
