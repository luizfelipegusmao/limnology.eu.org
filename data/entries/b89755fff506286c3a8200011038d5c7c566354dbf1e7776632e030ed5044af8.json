{"title":"239 Growth performance and gut health indicators of Escherichia coli-challenged weaned pigs fed diets supplemented with Bacillus subtilis or Enterococcus faecium","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/235/7757407?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A study evaluated the effects of adding <span>B. subtilis</span> or <span>E. faecium</span> based probiotics in diets for weaned pigs challenged with <span>E. coli</span> on growth performance and indicators of gut health. Pigs [n = 64; initial body weight (BW) = 6.95 kg] weaned at 22 d of age were obtained in 2 batches of 32 pigs each. The pigs were from sows that were homozygous susceptible to infection by F4 strain of <span>E. coli</span>. Pigs in each batch were housed in 16 pens in 2 rooms: first room with 4 pens and second room with 12 pens. Pigs were fed 3 diets for 14 d. The diets were control or control plus <span>B. subtilis</span> (1×10E6 CFU/kg) or <span>E. faecium</span> (1×10E6 CFU/kg). On d 7 and 8 of the experiment, all pigs in the second room were orally challenged with F4 strain of <span>E. coli</span> (5 mL with ~109 CFUּ mL<sup>-1</sup>ּ d<sup>-1</sup>) to create the following 4 treatments with 4 pensּ traetment<sup>-1</sup>ּ batch<sup>-1</sup>) (8 pens/treatment for the study): unchallenged pigs fed control diet, challenged pigs fed control diet, challenged pigs fed control diet plus <span>E. faecium</span>, and challenged pigs fed control diet plus <span>B. subtilis</span>. Challenging pigs with <span>E. coli</span> F4 reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) average daily gain (ADG) for d 7 to 11 and d 11 to 14 of the study from 81 to -67 g and 460 to 259 g, respectively; increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) plasma haptoglobin concentration (PHC) on d 9 from 1.10 to 1.69 mg/mL and fecal <span>E. coli</span> F4 content (FEC) on d 11 from 4.92 to 7.86 log copies/g; and decreased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration in the cecum and colon on d 14 from 89.5 to 52.3 mmol/kg and 88.1 to 63.9 mmol/kg, respectively. The <span>E. faecium</span> supplementation did not affect ADG for d 0 to 7 of the study but increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) ADG for d 7 to 11 by 161%. The <span>E. faecium</span> supplementation did not affect FEC, PHC, and VFA concentration in the cecum and colon. The <span>B. subtilis</span> supplementation did not affect ADG and ADFI, FEC, PHC, but tended to increase (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.10) VFA concentration in the cecum and colon by 32 and 20%, respectively. In conclusion, challenging weaned pigs with the <span>E. coli</span> F4 reduced growth performance and microbial fermentation in the hindgut and increased fecal <span>E. coli</span> shedding. Supplemental <span>E. faecium</span> probiotic improved ADG of weaned pigs after their challenge with <span>E. coli</span>, implying that it can be included in diets for weaned pigs raised under commercial conditions to improve their performance. The <span>B. subtilis</span> probiotic can be included in diets for weaned pigs to counteract the reducing impact of <span>E. coli</span> infection on microbial fermentation in the hindgut.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"b89755fff506286c3a8200011038d5c7c566354dbf1e7776632e030ed5044af8","category":"Environment"}
