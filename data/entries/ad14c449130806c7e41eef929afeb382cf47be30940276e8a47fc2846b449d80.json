{"title":"Long‐range transport of littoral methane explains the metalimnetic methane peak in a large lake","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12652?af=R","date":1723440632000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In large and stratified lakes, substantial methane stocks are often observed within the metalimnion. The origin of the methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) accumulated in the metalimnion during stratification, which can sustain significant emissions during convective mixing, is still widely debated. While commonly attributed to the transport of methane produced anaerobically ex situ, recent evidence suggests that oxic in situ methane production could also contribute to metalimnetic methane peaks. Here, we assessed the origin, that is, pelagic CH<sub>4</sub> production or transport of sublittoral CH<sub>4</sub> through the interflow, of metalimnetic methane in Lake Geneva, the largest lake in Western Europe. Microbial diversity data do not support the hypothesis of oxic methane production in the metalimnion. In contrast, both spatial and temporal surveys of methane show that maxima occur at depths and sites most affected by the Rhône River inflow. Methane δ<sup>13</sup>C values point to an anaerobic sublittoral methane source, within a biogeochemical hotspot close to the river delta region, and an efficient transport across several kilometers in a vertically well-constrained metalimnion. Our current findings emphasize the indirect role of river interflows for the long-range transport of CH<sub>4</sub> produced in sediment biogeochemical hotspots, even for large lakes where sublittoral habitats represent a fairly limited fraction of the lake volume.</p>","author":"Santona Khatun, \nJasmine S.
