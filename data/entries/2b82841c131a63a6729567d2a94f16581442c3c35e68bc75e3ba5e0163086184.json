{"title":"Physicochemical Characterization and Antioxidant Activity of Jara Honey Produced in Western Georgia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1862/v1","date":1719398732000,"content":"The purpose of this research article was to study the physicochemical characteristics of semi-wild Jhar honey grown in Western Georgia. Jara honey is produced in the alpine and sub-alpine forest zone of high mountain Adjara,Â  which is distinguished by the variety of honey plants [1]. The physicochemical characteristics were examined concerning the Alimemtarius Code and EU regulations: moisture content, total carbohydrate, free acidity, pH , electrical conductivity, microelements (Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca), color, total phenols, total phenolic acids, total flavonoids, proline, diastase activity, protein and microscopic study of pollens. Using the UPLC-MSB method, grayanotoxin-III was identified in the semi-wild Jara honey samples. The findings demonstrated that honey has significant concentrations of phenols, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. A directly proportional relationship was established between the quantitative content of phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity of honey. This article is the first study of the characteristics of Jara honey produced in Western Georgia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b82841c131a63a6729567d2a94f16581442c3c35e68bc75e3ba5e0163086184","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
