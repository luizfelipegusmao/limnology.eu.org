{"title":"Family Functioning and Cohesion Scale: Validation of a Short Instrument for the Assessment of Intrafamily Relations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0931/v1","date":1726139528000,"content":"Existing scales assessing family relations are usually quite long. Our aim was to develop and validate the Family Functioning and Cohesion Scale (FFCS), a self-reported short instrument consisting of 14 items. The validation of the FFCS was based on its administration through an online platform to 481 subjects living in 46 different countries around the world. Cronbach's alpha was 0.85 (ranging from 0.83 to 0.86 if any one item was deleted), signifying high internal consistency. The scale can be considered as a sole factor based on its high consistency, while factor analysis produced three factors corresponding to “communication”, “anger/resentment/aggression” and “values and beliefs”. Test-retest reliability correlation coefficient was found to be 0.88 at a 2-week interval. As far as external validity is concerned, the correlation coefficient of the FFCS with the General Functioning subscale of the McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD) was 0.83. The high measures of consistency, reliability, and validity of the FFCS, combined with its short length, make it an invaluable tool for use in research as well as in any professional dealing with families in the clinical fields of psychiatry, psychology, social work or any other relevant specialty.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d09ec6890cbde12037b96cb0fc9ce2427b62a545e9d07355199e3d5b77d61064","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
