For many years, mathematical simulation tools have been the most common approach to reconstructing an estimate of the WDNs hydraulics. However, pure physics-based simulations involve several challenges, for example, partially observable data, high uncertainty, and extensive manual calibration. Thus, data-driven approaches have gained traction to overcome such limitations. In this work, we combine physics-based modeling and graph neural networks (GNN), a data-driven approach, to address the pressure estimation problem. Our work has two main contributions. First, a training strategy that relies on random sensor placement making our GNN-based estimation model robust to unexpected sensor location changes. Second, a realistic evaluation protocol that considers real temporal patterns and noise injection to mimic the uncertainties intrinsic to real-world scenarios. As a result, a new state-of-the-art model, <b>GAT</b> with <b>Res</b>idual Connections, for pressure estimation is available. Our model surpasses the performance of previous studies on several WDNs benchmarks, showing a reduction of absolute error of ≈40% on average.</p>","author":"Huy Truong, \nAndrés Tello, \nAlexander Lazovik, \nVictoria Degeler","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"6ce8efef01d9136376f4ca3c64634b94b3ee4d215dd657ab910bce095d0b21ec","category":"Environment"}
