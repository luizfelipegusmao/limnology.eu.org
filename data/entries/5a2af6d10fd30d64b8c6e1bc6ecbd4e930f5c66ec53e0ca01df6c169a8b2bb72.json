{"title":"Building Up a Human Ovarian Antioxidant ceRNA Network, OvAnOx: A Bioinformatic Perspective for Research on Redox-Related Ovarian Functions and Dysfunctions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0824/v1","date":1723464169000,"content":"The ovary is the major determinant of female reproductive health. Ovarian functions are mainly related to the primordial follicle pool, which is gradually loss with aging. Ovarian aging and reproductive dysfunctions share oxidative stress as common underlying mechanism. ROS signaling is essential for normal ovarian processes yet can contribute to various ovarian disorders when disrupted. Therefore, balance in the redox system is crucial for proper ovarian functions. In the present study, by focusing on mRNAs and ncRNAs described in the ovary and taking into account only validated ncRNA interactions, we built up an ovarian antioxidant ceRNA network, namely OvAnOx ceRNA, composed of 5 mRNAs (SOD1, SOD2, CAT, PRDX3, GR), 10 miRNAs and 5 lncRNAs (XIST, FGD5-AS1, MALAT1, NEAT1, SNHG1). Our bioinformatic analysis indicated that the components of the OvAnOx ceRNA not only contribute to antioxidant defence, but are also involved in other ovarian functions. Indeed, antioxidant enzymes encoded by mRNA of OvAnOx ceRNA operate within a regulatory network that impacts ovarian reserve, follicle dynamics, and oocyte maturation in normal and pathological conditions. The OvAnOx ceRNA represents a promising tool to unravel the complex dialogue between redox potential and ovarian signalling pathways involved in reproductive health, aging and diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a2af6d10fd30d64b8c6e1bc6ecbd4e930f5c66ec53e0ca01df6c169a8b2bb72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
