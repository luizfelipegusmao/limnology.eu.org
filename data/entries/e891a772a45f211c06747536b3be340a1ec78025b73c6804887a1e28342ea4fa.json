{"title":"Integration of PV Systems in the Urban Environment&mdash;A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1855/v2","date":1718350306000,"content":"Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) consists of PV panels that are integrated into the building as part of the construction. This technology has advantages such as the production of electricity without necessary additional land area. This paper provides a literature review about the recent developments in urban building energy modelling, including tools and methods, and how they can be used to predict the effect of PV systems on building outdoor and indoor environments. It is also intended to provide a critical analysis on how PV systems affect the urban environment, both from an energy and a comfort point of view. The microclimate, namelly the urban heat island concept, is introduced and related with the existence of PV systems. It is concluded that urban building energy modelling (UBEM) can be effective to study the performance of PV systems in the urban environment. It allows to simultaneously predict the building energy performance and the microclimate effect. However, there is a need to develop new methodologies to overcome the challenges associated to UBEM, especially in what concerns non-geometric data, which leads to a major source of errors. and to find an effective method to predict the effect of PV systems in the urban environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e891a772a45f211c06747536b3be340a1ec78025b73c6804887a1e28342ea4fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
