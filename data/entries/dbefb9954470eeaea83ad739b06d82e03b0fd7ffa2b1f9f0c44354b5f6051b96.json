{"title":"In the face of climate change, will trees be…shorter?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1279/7420158?rss=1","date":1699920000000,"content":"<span>Current climate change models predict temperature increases anywhere from 2 °C to 5 °C over the next 75 years (<a href=\"#kiad610-B10\">Pörtner et al. 2022</a>), which could have serious impacts on plant performance. Indeed, elevated temperatures alone can lead to decreased yield (<a href=\"#kiad610-B6\">Hatfield and Prueger 2015</a>), increased disease susceptibility (<a href=\"#kiad610-B7\">Huot et al. 2017</a>), and, in the case of trees, early bud burst and leaf out (<a href=\"#kiad610-B9\">Polgar and Primack 2011</a>). Some of these effects could be beneficial; however, it is important to note that changes in one abiotic factor often affect additional abiotic factors, causing plants to experience multiple stressors simultaneously and making it difficult to predict overall plant responses to environmental changes (<a href=\"#kiad610-B5\">Fu et al. 2020</a>; <a href=\"#kiad610-B3\">Didion-Gency et al. 2022</a>; <a href=\"#kiad610-B8\">Petrik et al. 2022</a>; <a href=\"#kiad610-B11\">Vitasse et al. 2022</a>). For example, elevated temperatures often coincide with decreased soil moisture content (<a href=\"#kiad610-B2\">Breshears et al. 2005</a>). While elevated temperature contributes to early leaf emergence in some species (<a href=\"#kiad610-B9\">Polgar and Primack 2011</a>), low soil moisture content can delay leaf emergence (<a href=\"#kiad610-B1\">Bigler and Vitasse 2021</a>). In many cases, the underlying cues leading to abiotic stress responses are unknown, and the combined effects of simultaneous stressors are unstudied.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"dbefb9954470eeaea83ad739b06d82e03b0fd7ffa2b1f9f0c44354b5f6051b96","category":"Environment"}
