{"title":"Genetically Modified Foods: Victoria Islanders&rsquo; Perspectives on the Common Good","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0454/v1","date":1720130530000,"content":"Rationale: Genetically modified (GM) foods have the potential to reduce food insecurity and address economic and environmental issues. Despite these benefits, GM foods continue to face significant criticism and there is limited information on public awareness and understanding of their nutritional and environmental health benefits in Nigeria. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating public knowledge and perceptions of GM foods in Victoria Island, Lagos. Methods: A convenience sampling method was used to recruit 369 respondents from Victoria Island, Lagos. Data were gathered using a structured questionnaire. The target population comprised employed adults either residing or working on Victoria Island. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between sociodemographic factors and awareness of GM foods. Results: The study found that a majority of respondents (62.9%, n=232) were knowledgeable about GM foods and their associated issues. However, many believed that their community was not well-informed on the topic. Awareness of GM foods was significantly associated with sociodemographic factors such as marital status and education (P&lt;0.01). Most respondents were well-informed about the environmental and health benefits of GM foods, with 61.8% believing that GM food production could sustainably reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, fertilizers, and other energy inputs, thus mitigating their ecological impacts. Additionally, most respondents did not feel that purchasing or consuming GM foods conflicted with their beliefs or would affect their food choices. Conclusion: The study concludes that while individual awareness of GM foods is relatively high, there is a perception that community awareness is low. Sociodemographic factors play a significant role in shaping public awareness and perceptions of GM foods. Recommendations: This includes government should actively educate the public on the ecological and health benefits of GM foods and address any safety concerns; Implement strict border controls and food labeling for GM products to protect consumer rights and preferences for organic foods, provide sufficient technical and financial assistance to farmers who participate in organic seed programs to enhance national food security. Significant Statement: This study highlights the importance of public education on GM foods and underscores the need for government intervention to ensure informed consumer choices and support for sustainable agricultural practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"83b8fdd9631c420f3162d4eb7b080050cb4a4077c18dd13f8cd1b0a52225f2de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
