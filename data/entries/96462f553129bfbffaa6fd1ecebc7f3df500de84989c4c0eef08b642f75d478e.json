{"title":"A Review on Transformative Education as a Door toward New Learning Language Opportunities in Societal Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0240/v1","date":1719920207000,"content":"Transformative education significantly advances society's growth as an essential doorway to fresh language learning chances. It equips people to succeed in a complicated world by encouraging critical thinking, inclusivity, social responsibility, lifelong learning, and international collaboration. Adopting transformative education can result in a more inventive, sustainable, and equal society where everyone can realize their potential and advance society's interests as educational systems change. This paper aims to gather literature regarding how transformative education becomes a door toward new learning opportunities in societal development especially language. Transformative education may produce a generation of knowledgeable, sympathetic, and proactive students who can bring about constructive social change by prioritizing holistic development. Hence, educators should work to foster a learning atmosphere where all students feel supported and respected. Through integrating social justice ideals into the educational process, transformative education equips students to act as change agents and advocates for equity both within and outside their communities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"96462f553129bfbffaa6fd1ecebc7f3df500de84989c4c0eef08b642f75d478e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
