{"title":"Laser Processing of Intraocular Lenses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0014/v1","date":1719814305000,"content":"Polymeric Intraocular lenses (IOLs) are vital for restoring vision following cataract surgery and for correcting refractive errors. Despite technological and medical advancements, challenges persist in achieving optimal vision and preventing complications. Surface modifications aim to mitigate the risk of posterior capsule opacification (PCO), while pre-operative measurements aid in selecting suitable IOLs. However, individualized solutions are lacking and there is a clear demand for the development of fully customised IOL surfaces. We employ laser micromachining technology for precise modifications via ablation on PMMA and Acrylic IOLs, using femtosecond (fs), nanosecond (ns), and diode continuous wave (CW) lasers, at wavelengths ranging from near-ultraviolet to infrared. Characterization reveals controlled ablation patterning, achieving feature sizes from as small as 400 nm to several micrometers. Regular and confocal Micro-Raman spectroscopy revealed alterations of the IOL materials' structural integrity for some pattering cases, thus affecting the optical properties, while these can be minimised by proper selection of micromachining conditions. The results suggest the feasibility of accurate IOL patterning, which could offer personalized vision correction solutions, based on relevant corneal wavefront data, thus surpassing standard lenses, marking a significant advancement in cataract surgery outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2acda7277dba5b2e7aae82ea61ce81defcdef87fb5066709c8c126b8206aa7fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
