{"title":"On the cutting edge of development: laser-assisted microdissection of the Arabidopsis gynoecium reveals tissue-specific gene expression patterns","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/256/7584819?rss=1","date":1705795200000,"content":"<span>Multicellular organisms require extensive spatial and temporal control of transcription to generate cell type–specific gene expression patterns. These expression patterns make up the coordinated cellular networks that act in concert to perform functions essential for organogenesis, growth, and fitness. In plants, cell type–specific expression patterns take on another layer of complexity as plant cells are immobile and contain cell–cell communication pores (plasmodesmata). Consequently, cellular fate and function are both deeply informed by the context in which cells differentiate. Fruit development is a prime example of such a coordinated cellular response, as fruits form from mature gynoecia (female reproductive organs) and internally develop seeds and the chambers that house these seeds. Fruit development requires precise spatial coordination and is not induced until a specific temporal cue is given. In <span>Arabidopsis</span> and other dehiscent species, gynoecium development also requires the formation of marginal regions that undergo programmed cell death and separation, allowing for seed dispersal. All of these distinct developmental processes require intricately controlled gene expression patterns, coordinated across macroscopic cellular distances. Gynoecium development has huge agricultural relevance, as farmers seek to maximize their yield and prevent seed loss in their crops.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"a759c03eb6779dcc2dbda73fe5eadbde9f93b173857d6ff8f93b3560e329156f","category":"Environment"}
