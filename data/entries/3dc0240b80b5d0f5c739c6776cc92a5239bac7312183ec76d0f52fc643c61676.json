{"title":"Hydrothermally Doping Valve Metal Nb into Titanate Nanofibers Structure for Potentially Engineering Bone Tissue","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0424/v1","date":1712301732000,"content":"Recent research efforts in bone tissue engineering have been primarily directed towards manufacture-viable synthesis of biomaterials that can significantly enhance the biocompatibilities and osteogenic capabilities on the new biomaterials. This paper presents a straightforward, cost-effective, optimized, and well-controlled hydrothermal synthesis of Nb-doped potassium titanate nanofibers in high-purity. Characterization data revealed that the Nb-doping potassium titanate maintained the crystal structure, showing great promise for applications in bone tissue engineering.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3dc0240b80b5d0f5c739c6776cc92a5239bac7312183ec76d0f52fc643c61676","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
