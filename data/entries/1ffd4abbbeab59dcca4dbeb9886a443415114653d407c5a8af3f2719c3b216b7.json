They encode their genomes in one, large single-stranded, positive-sense RNA. Viruses of the CoV subfamily encode 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) that are responsible for RNA replication and transcription [<a href=\"#ozae044.374-B1\">1</a>]. RNA synthesis is an essential process for the viral life cycle and uses a virally-encoded replication-transcription complex containing nsp12 (the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)) and cofactors nsp7 and nsp8. Unlike the viral structural proteins, nsps are better conserved among the coronaviruses; hence, the findings from one genus can be applied across the coronavirus subfamily.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1ffd4abbbeab59dcca4dbeb9886a443415114653d407c5a8af3f2719c3b216b7","category":"Environment"}
