{"title":"DNA Gene's Basic Structure as a Nonperturbative Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics: Is RNA Polymerase II the Quantum Bus of Transcription?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1016/v1","date":1726277776000,"content":"Previously, we described that Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine nucleobases were superconductors in a quantum superposition of phases on each side of the central Hydrogen bond acting as a Josephson Junction. Genomic DNA has two strands wrapped helically around one another, but during transcription, they are separated by the RNA polymerase II to form a molecular condensate called the transcription bubble. Successive steps involve the bubble translocation along the gene body. This work discusses how quantum information transfer and entanglement can be achieved by modeling DNA as a combination of ? nonperturbative circuits quantum electrodynamics with nine Radio-Frequency- Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) inside. A bus can be coupled capacitively to a single-mode microwave resonator. The cavity mode and the bus can mediate long-range, fast interaction between neighboring and distant DNA SQUID qubits. RNA polymerase II produces decoherence during transcription. This enzyme is a multifunctional biomolecular machine working like an artificially engineered device. Phosphorylation reactions catalyzed by protein kinases constitute the driving force. The coupling between n phosphorylation pulses and any particular SQUID qubit can be obtained selectively via frequency matching.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b5157b3f738bcd2e2a6760b5fc359802c629542896ad31fec473e4a195bae77","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
