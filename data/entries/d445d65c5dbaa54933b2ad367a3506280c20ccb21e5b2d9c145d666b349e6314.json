{"title":"Particulate organic carbon sedimentation triggers lagged methane emissions in a eutrophic reservoir","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10379?af=R","date":1709962800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Reservoirs act as carbon sinks when sedimentation of particulate organic carbon (POC) exceeds CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. Here, we study the poorly explored process where phytoplankton-derived acidic polysaccharides (APs) aggregate into particulate organic matter, promoting carbon export to sediments. This source of POC in sediments can mineralize to CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> over various timescales. Our research, centered on a Mediterranean reservoir, elucidates phenological trends of APs and POC sedimentation and identifies their predominant drivers. Our findings present synchronic sedimentation patterns of POC and APs but identify a 2-week delay between POC sedimentation and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. Despite its eutrophic status, our data demonstrate this reservoir's role as a carbon sink, sequestering 4.33 g C m<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>. This highlights the need to consider various time scales when quantifying carbon budgets in reservoirs.</p>","author":"Andrés Martínez‐García, \nIgnacio Peralta‐Maraver, \nEva Rodríguez‐Velasco, \nGema L.
