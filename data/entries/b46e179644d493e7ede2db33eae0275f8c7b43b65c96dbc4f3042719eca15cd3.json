{"title":"On the Theoretical Intuition of Jungian Archetypes and its Logical Extensions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1869/v1","date":1721831024000,"content":"This article considers the status of psychoanalytical archetypes as attitudinal bodies. It possesses the initiative to consider the prerogative that they are situated on, and to develop that into discussing the conditions for an archetype-like body that is derived from Jungian pretenses.  As this article operates within the boundaries of the conjecture, it serves instead to cover the potentiality for developments outside of the simple basis of the archetype, which therefore means that it covers a form of guidance instead of specific results.  Unlike Jung’s study, which serves in a multitude of sections and draws upon evidential factors of, however generally expressed, ancient civilisations, this article seeks to apply that logic to the purpose of explicating the meaning and potential extensions of the “archetypal dogma”.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b46e179644d493e7ede2db33eae0275f8c7b43b65c96dbc4f3042719eca15cd3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
