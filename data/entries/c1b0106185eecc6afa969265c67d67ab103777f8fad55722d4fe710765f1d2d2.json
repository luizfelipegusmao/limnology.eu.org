The results contribute to obtaining initial information about the morphology of erythrocyte abnormalities classified in 21 categories in 16 fish species in reservoirs with abundant salmonids (the Morávka Reservoir) or with the prevalence of cyprinids (the Kružberk and Šance Reservoirs), not directly exposed to the adverse environmental effects such as industrial, urban, agricultural and intensive farming activities. The different intensities and prevalence of nuclear abnormalities (NA) and cytoplasmic abnormalities (CA) in fish from the same reservoir habitat show that to be able to obtain an objective view of the genotoxic risk of chemicals, it is necessary to respect the different requirements of the fish for the exploitation of the food available in the biotope and to subject all representatives of piscivorous, omnivorous and benthophagous fishes in the reservoir to cytogenetic analysis. The occurrence of certain categories of erythrocyte abnormalities in diseased fish draws attention to the need to know the state of health of the fish and to employ this knowledge to exclude parasitological, viral and other infectious agents. These results are the first report of the frequencies of erythrocyte abnormalities in native fish. They should serve to check which of the categories examined could be of use in assessing the genotoxic risk in other stagnant and running aquatic ecosystems affected by anthropogenic activities.</p>","author":"Jiří Řehulka, \nJaroslav Bradík","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"c1b0106185eecc6afa969265c67d67ab103777f8fad55722d4fe710765f1d2d2","category":"Environment"}
