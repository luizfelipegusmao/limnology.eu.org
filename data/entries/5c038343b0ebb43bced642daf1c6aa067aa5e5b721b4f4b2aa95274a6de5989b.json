{"title":"Current Role of CT Pulmonary Angiography in Pulmonary Embolism: A State-of-the-Art Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0042/v1","date":1722503204000,"content":"In the last decade, the role of Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) in diagnosing and managing pulmonary embolism (PE) has significantly evolved. Once a purely diagnostic tool, CTPA now plays a crucial role in initial emergency department assessments and treatment planning tailored to the patientâ€™s condition. Advances in CTPA technology, including image quality enhancements and artificial intelligence (AI) applications, necessitate a reassessment of its current utility. This narrative review updates on new CTPA tools and techniques and focuses on data extraction challenges in emergency settings. CTPA studies, often conducted with multidetector scanners, provide essential information for risk stratification and treatment planning. The quantification of thrombotic burden using CTPA is vital for predicting mortality and determining appropriate treatments. Classical scoring systems, such as those developed by Qanadli, Mastora, and Ghanima, convert CTPA findings into quantifiable data to assist clinical decision-making. Despite CTPA not being a standard mortality predictor, significant research suggests including CTPA data, especially RV dysfunction indicators, for prognostic purposes. Recent studies highlight automated techniques for quantifying pulmonary perfusion and thrombus composition, enhancing the accuracy of PE severity assessment. The integration of AI in CTPA, particularly through deep learning algorithms, shows promise in automating thrombus load assessment and improving risk stratification. The continuous development of imaging techniques positions CTPA as a potential tool for comprehensive PE management, aiding in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c038343b0ebb43bced642daf1c6aa067aa5e5b721b4f4b2aa95274a6de5989b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
