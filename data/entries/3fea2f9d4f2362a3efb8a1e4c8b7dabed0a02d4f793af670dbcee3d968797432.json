{"title":"The Physiological and Biochemical Response of Ribbed Mussels to Rising Temperatures: Benefits of Salt Marsh Cordgrass","link":"https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/doi/10.1093/iob/obae031/7738383?rss=1","date":1724198400000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>Salt marsh ecosystems are heavily reliant on ribbed mussel (<span>Geukensia demissa</span>) populations to aid in rapid recovery from droughts. The focus of this study was thus to document the effects of rising temperatures on ribbed mussel populations in a Georgia salt marsh. Seven lab and eight field experiments were used to assess the effects of current air temperatures on mussels at two high marsh (HM) sites with short and sparse cordgrass and one mid marsh (MM) site with tall and dense cordgrass. Field results in 2018 and 2019 indicate that ribbed mussels were experiencing extremely high temperatures for prolonged periods of time at the landlocked high marsh (LHM) site. In 2018, the highest temperature (54°C) and longest high temperature events, HTEs (58 days), that is, consecutive days with temperatures ≥40°C, were recorded at this site. When laboratory temperatures were increased from 20 to 36°C, mean heart rates increased by an average of 19 bpm for mussels from both high and MM sites respectively. When field temperatures rose from 20°C in April to 40°C in September 2019, mean heart rates increased by an average of 10 bpm for HM mussels and by 26.3 bpm for MM mussels. Under identical laboratory and field conditions, mean heart rates for mussels from the LHM site with the highest temperatures, increased by &lt;1 bpm and 3.7 bpm respectively. Evidence of the potential role of shade on mussel aggregates was provided by examining whether mussels from the edge of mussel aggregates with little to no cordgrass for shade were more stressed than those living at the center of mussel aggregates. In the absence of shade, mean body temperatures for mussels at the edge of mussel aggregates were up to 8°C higher than for those living in the center underneath a dense tuft of cordgrass. Despite high body temperatures, mean heart rates and Hsp70 gene expression were lower for mussels living at the edges. This agrees with the strategy that during prolong exposure to high temperatures, mussels may reduce their heart rate to conserve energy and enhance survival. Alternatively, heat-stressed mussels at the edges of aggregates may not have the resources to express high levels of Hsp70. Increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of HTEs may stress the physiological and biochemical function of mussel populations to the limit, dictate mussel aggregate size, and threaten the functionality of SE salt marshes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Organismal Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ad96bcf7a80ab7e3a1a88c34298d761f9695964c0badbbef4e1166baa6580fcc","entryHash":"3fea2f9d4f2362a3efb8a1e4c8b7dabed0a02d4f793af670dbcee3d968797432","category":"Environment"}
