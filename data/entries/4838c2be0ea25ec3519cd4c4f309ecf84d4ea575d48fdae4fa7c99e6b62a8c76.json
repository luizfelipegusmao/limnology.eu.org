{"title":"From the &ldquo;One Molecule &ndash; One Target &ndash; One Disease&rdquo; Concept towards Looking for Multi-target Therapeutics for Treating Non-polio Enterovirus (Npev) Infections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1270/v1","date":1721111231000,"content":"Non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs), namely coxsackieviruses (CV), echoviruses (E), enteroviruses (EV), and rhinoviruses (RV), are responsible for a wide variety of illnesses. Some infections can progress to life-threatening complications in children or immunocompromised patients. To date, no treatments have been approved. Several molecules have been evaluated through clinical trials without success. To overcome these failures, the multi-target directed ligand (MTDL) strategy can be applied to tackle enterovirus infections. This work analyzes clinical trials to highlight the best candidates and develops filters to apply to a selection for MTDL synthesis. We explicitly stated the methods used to answer the question: Which solution can fight NPEVs effectively? We note the originality and relevance of this proposal in relation to the state of the art in the enterovirus-inhibitors field. Several combinations are possible to broaden the antiviral spectrum and potency. We discuss data related to the virus and data related to each LEAD compound identified. Overall, this study proposes a perspective on different strategies to overcome issues identified in clinical trials and evaluate the “MTDL” potential to improve the efficiency of drugs synergistically, broaden the targeted, and reduce the adverse effects and drug design cost as well as limit the opportunity of drug-resistant viruses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4838c2be0ea25ec3519cd4c4f309ecf84d4ea575d48fdae4fa7c99e6b62a8c76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
