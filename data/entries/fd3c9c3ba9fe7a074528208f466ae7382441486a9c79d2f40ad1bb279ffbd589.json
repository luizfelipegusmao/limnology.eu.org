Diets were randomly assigned to ten fermenters in a replicated 5 x 5 Latin square with three, 10-d experimental periods consisting of 7 d for adaptation and 3 d for sample collection. Four different levels were tested independently, resulting in 5 treatments: tannin at levels of 0 (negative control), 0.07, 0.14, and 0.21 (% of DM of the total diet) and monensin as positive control at 28 mg/kg DM. The tannin-based product was a specific blend of tannin and saponins, composed of quebracho and chestnut tannin extracts, SilvaFeed-BX). Diets were prepared as concentrate mixes that were combined with sugarcane bagasse, corn grain, dry distillers grain, citrus pulp, peanut meal, and urea. Liquid and solid flow rates were adjusted to 10 and 5.0%/h, respectively. Samples were collected for digestibility, ruminal fermentation, and microbial growth. The basal diet consisted of a typical finishing diet for beef cattle (16:84 roughage:concentrate ratio). All results were assessed for residual normality and variance homogeneity. All variables were fitted through generalized mixed models (GLIMMIX procedure) and compared by using Tukey test (multiple comparison) and polynomial regressions (tannin concentrations, which were analyzed for linear and quadratic responses. Partial data were presented in the table below. Total VFA concentration, molar proportion of butyrate, and total Branched-chain VFA were not affected by treatments (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). Molar proportion of acetate of the tannin-based product at 0.07 % of DM tended to be decreased compared with all other treatments. Molar proportion of propionate increased quadratically (<span>P</span> = 0.05) reaching the peak at the level of 0.07 % of DM, which were greater than monensin treatment. In conclusion, our results indicate that a smaller dose of a tannin-based product (0.07 g/kg of DM) might manipulate ruminal fermentation by increasing molar proportion of propionate in typical feedlot diet fed under tropical conditions. This is important from an energetic standpoint for the animal host, since propionate is the precursor of glucose synthesis in ruminants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"fd3c9c3ba9fe7a074528208f466ae7382441486a9c79d2f40ad1bb279ffbd589","category":"Environment"}
