{"title":"How social media exposure constructs social confidence: An empirical study on impact, mechanisms, and multilateral relationships","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308745","date":1726581600000,"content":"<p>by Yani Liu, Kang Hu</p>\r\n\r\nSocial confidence functions as a vital spiritual force in fostering the positive and healthy evolution of society. This paper explores how social media exposure contributes to the construction of social confidence within the framework of Media-system Dependency Theory. The research unveils the following key findings: (1) Social media exposure positively facilitates social confidence; (2) Group efficacy and group cohesion, perceived as manifestations of cognitive divergence between \"efficacy\" and \"collective\" within collective efficacy, both serve as mediating mechanisms influencing the impact of social media exposure on social confidence. The Channel Testing of Causality confirms that group cohesion plays a significantly more crucial role as a pathway compared to group efficacy; (3) The differentiated impact of social media exposure, encompassing Tencent WeChat and Sina Weibo, materializes in distinct components of social confidence and follows different influence pathways.","author":"Yani Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"834a0947d649732f4a9e06a033fe790ea17c53e3be9f10480d59914264b7e89e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
