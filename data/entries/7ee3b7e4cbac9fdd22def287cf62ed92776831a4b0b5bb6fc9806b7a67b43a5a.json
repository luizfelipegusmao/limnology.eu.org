{"title":"Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis and the Modified Collatz Conjecture Using the Sophy-Peter Mathematical Framework","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0707/v1","date":1715562582000,"content":"In this article, we present solutions for one of the oldest mathematical problems, the Collatz Conjecture, and provide a proof for the Riemann Hypothesis, utilizing a new number theory based on newly discovered number properties, which will also be presented in this paper. This is made possible through the Sophy-Peter mathematical framework, built upon this new number theory. The Collatz Conjecture will be disproven, but as an alternative, the Oscillating Theorem will be introduced, with its correctness proven within this article. Furthermore, we present the general version of the Riemann zeta function, developed based on the new number theory. The correctness of this function is verified by comparing it with existing results of the zeta function. Using this approach and the Sophy-Peter framework, we have successfully proven the Riemann Hypothesis, long considered a millennium problem. Moreover, since the general zeta function is proven, this implies the correctness of the new number theory and the Sophy-Peter framework.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ee3b7e4cbac9fdd22def287cf62ed92776831a4b0b5bb6fc9806b7a67b43a5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
