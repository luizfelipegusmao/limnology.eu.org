{"title":"An Agro-Food Planning System: Democratic, Decentralized, Holistic, and Voluntary Participatory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0911/v1","date":1726133566000,"content":"In both capitalist and socialist economies, agricultural planning has been un-derstood as the allocation of planting areas to certain products, and the exist-ence of farmers, who are the main productive actors, as humans, their pro-duction potential and their ability to act rationally have been neglected. In ad-dition, in both economic structures, the desired results have only been achieved partially by determining prices. These experiences also reveal two important results: Agriculture is not fully planned, but it cannot be continued without planning either. Secondly, in a structure where production is social, it is nec-essary for agricultural products to have an exchange value, but price is a mul-tifunctional phenomenon and how it is determined is important. The current equivalent of the claim that prices are determined through the market mecha-nism is to advocate that prices are determined by capitalist companies that have monopoly power in the markets. The increasingly severe problems and in-creasing fragility of agricultural-food markets, which are already largely under the control of these institutions, already prove that this structure is not a solu-tion. On the other hand, it is no longer possible to provide food security by planning primary agricultural products alone, agri-food production and dis-tribution have acquired different structural characteristics, and it has become necessary to address food security within the framework of agri-food systems. Therefore, effective agricultural planning actually requires the planning of the agricultural food system as a whole. The e-nam system, which is being popu-larized in India and has achieved a certain success, points out that it is possible to organize and manage agricultural food markets after primary production. Moreover, it also shows that technological opportunities offer more effective planning opportunities. In this study, first of all, based on historical and current experiences, the inadequacies of the market mechanism, the fact that agricul-tural production is carried out by using living things to produce living things and depending on uncontrollable factors have been taken into consideration. Then, it has been concluded that a democratic, mix of centralized and decen-tralized planning, aiming to determine both production quantities and prices by utilizing the capacity and conditions of farmers and technological opportunities will meet today's needs. And in accordance with this result, a basic planning proposal has been presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4974004aac6e333381cfe47f683eb34442dc3107a51966b9b7bfbe0628e7c6e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
