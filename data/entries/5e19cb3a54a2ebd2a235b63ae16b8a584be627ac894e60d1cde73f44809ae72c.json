{"title":"Harnessing Fermentation by Bacillus and Lactic Acid Bacteria for Enhanced Texture, Flavor and Nutritional Value in Plant-Based Matrices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0007/v1","date":1719814313000,"content":"This article explores the transformative potential of fermentation in elevating the quality of plant-based matrices to match the desirable attributes of traditional dairy and meat products. As the demand for sustainable products without animal welfare issues increases, fermentation emerges as a key process to enhance the organoleptic properties and nutritional content of plant-based analogs. This study explores the effect of fermentation when applied to legume matrices, focusing on the resulting texture, flavor, and nutritional value. A selection of Bacillus subtilis, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains, and combinations thereof, showed potential for improving the aforementioned organoleptic and nutritional characteristics of fermented plant bases. In four different legume-derived matrices, fermentation improved texture, degraded undesirable plant carbohydrates, and removed off-flavor compounds, while producing desirable dairy-associated compounds. The degradation of the undesirable beany off-flavor-causing compound hexanal appears to be a universal phenomenon, as every tested strain as well as their combinations exhibited the capability to decrease the hexanal content albeit with varying efficiency. Some LAB strains were found to be capable of producing carotenoids and might hence have the potential for tailoring fermented plant-based matrices for specific applications, such as yellow cheese or red meat analogs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e19cb3a54a2ebd2a235b63ae16b8a584be627ac894e60d1cde73f44809ae72c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
