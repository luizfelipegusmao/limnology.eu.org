{"title":"Inactivation Validation of Ebola, Marburg and Lassa Viruses in AVL-Ethanol Treated Viral Cultures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1420/v1","date":1721212723000,"content":"High consequence pathogens such as Ebola, Marburg and Lassa viruses are handled in maximum containment Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories. Genetic material is often isolated from such viruses and subsequently removed from BSL-4 for a multitude of downstream analyses using readily accessible technologies and equipment available at lower biosafety level laboratories. However, it is essential to ensure that these materials are free of viable viruses before removal from BSL-4 to guarantee sample safety. This study details the in-house procedure used for validating the inactivation of Ebola, Marburg and Lassa virus cultures after incubation with AVL lysis buffer (Qiagen) and ethanol. This study’s findings showed no viable virus was detectable when high-titer cultures of Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa viruses were incubated with AVL lysis buffer for 10 minutes, followed by an equal volume of 95% ethanol for 3 minutes, using a method with a sensitivity of ≤0.8 log10 TCID50 as the limit of detection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"264d1f960a75cf8df9ecc40a895432f4fc323e6c52eb2933b4c236f53fcb233f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
