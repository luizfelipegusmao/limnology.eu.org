{"title":"Towards High-throughput Low Dose Observation by OBF STEM","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.925/7720071?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has been widely utilized with annular detectors such as annular dark field (ADF) and annular bright field (ABF). Recently, segmented and pixelated detectors have allowed for the detection of detailed electron scattering intensity in the diffraction plane. Utilizing this richer information, low-dose STEM imaging capabilities have been discussed [<a href=\"#ozae044.925-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.925-B2\">2</a>]. Optimum-bright field (OBF) STEM, a non-iterative imaging technique developed recently, uses a segmented or pixelated detector for low-dose observation [<a href=\"#ozae044.925-B3\">3</a>]. OBF images are reconstructed from multiple images recorded simultaneously with a segmented/pixelated detector (Fig. 1). The reconstruction process ensures that the reconstructed image achieves the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). As the reconstruction process is non-iterative, OBF images can be displayed synchronously with the probe scan. OBF STEM is starting to be used as a dose-efficient imaging technique for beam-sensitive materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5540fff24c3e27131422fb0c05f9696724e7acd010bd810b3c54920ea19680a9","category":"Environment"}
