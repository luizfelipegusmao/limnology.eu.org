The three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a protein dictates its enzymatic activity, overall stability, ligand/protein/nucleic acid binding properties and other interactions. Historically, determining protein structures has been a laborious and time-consuming process, often taking years to complete. However, in recent years, there is a demand for rapid protein structure determination due to numerous applications in fields ranging from drug development to protein engineering, the development of novel protein-based materials like biomaterials or biocatalysts, as well as fundamental research into the mechanisms underlying molecular pathways.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"009a51c0fffb73daf9abaa64ef66b06c139e8b7b9628e24d1e021f1bec44f976","category":"Environment"}
