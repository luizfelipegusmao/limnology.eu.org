{"title":"PW06 suppresses cancer cell metastasis in human pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa‐2 cells via the inhibitions of p‐Akt/mTOR/NF‐κB and MMP2/MMP9 signaling pathways in vitro","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24143?af=R","date":1713272355000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>PW06 [(E)-3-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl) prop-2-en-1-one], a kind of the carbazole derivative containing chalcone moiety, induced cell apoptosis in human pancreatic carcinoma in vitro. There is no investigation to show that PW06 inhibits cancer cell metastasis in human pancreatic carcinoma in vitro. Herein, PW06 (0.1–0.8 μM) significantly exists in the antimetastatic activities of human pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa-2 cells in vitro. Wound healing assay shows PW06 at 0.2 μM suppressed cell mobility by 7.45 and 16.55% at 6 and 24 hours of treatments. PW06 at 0.1 and 0.2 μM reduced cell mobility by 14.72 and 21.8% for 48 hours of treatment. Transwell chamber assay indicated PW06 (0.1–0.2 μM) suppressed the cell migration (decreased 26.67–35.42%) and invasion (decreased 48.51–68.66%). Atomic force microscopy assay shows PW06 (0.2 μM) significantly changed the shape of cell morphology. The gelatin zymography assay indicates PW06 decreased MMP2's and MMP9's activities at 48 hours of treatment. Western blotting assay further confirms PW06 reduced levels of MMP2 and MMP9 and increased protein expressions of EGFR, SOS1, and Ras. PW06 also increased the p-JNK, p-ERK, and p-p38. PW06 increased the expression of PI3K, PTEN, Akt, GSK3α/β, and E-cadherin. Nevertheless, results also show PW06 decreased p-Akt, mTOR, NF-κB, p-GSK3β, β-catenin, Snail, N-cadherin, and vimentin in MIA PaCa-2 cells. The confocal laser microscopy examination shows PW06 increased E-cadherin but decreased vimentin in MIA PaCa-2 cells. Together, our findings strongly suggest that PW06 inhibited the p-Akt/mTOR/NF-κB/MMPs pathways, increased E-cadherin, and decreased N-cadherin/vimentin, suppressing the migration and invasion in MIA PaCa-2 cells in vitro.</p>","author":"Yi‐Ping Huang, \nChun‐An Yeh, \nYi‐Shih Ma, \nPo‐Yuan Chen, \nKuang‐Chi Lai, \nJin‐Cherng Lien, \nWen‐Tsong Hsieh","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"ceedd24f6b564b77de687e9f1696e9893be3cdac193ff9a1efffc672514fa23e","category":"Environment"}
