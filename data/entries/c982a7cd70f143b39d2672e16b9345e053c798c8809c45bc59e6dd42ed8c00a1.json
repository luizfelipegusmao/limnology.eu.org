{"title":"Population structure and abundance of the amphidromous prawn Macrobrachium tenellum (Smith, 1871) (Decapoda: Caridea: Palaemonidae) in the lower basin of Ameca River, western Mexico, before anthropogenic modifications","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jcb/article/doi/10.1093/jcbiol/ruae012/7624886?rss=1","date":1709942400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The population of the freshwater prawn <span>Macrobrachium tenellum</span> (<a href=\"#CIT0081\">Smith, 1871</a>) in four sites in the lower part of the coastal plain of the Ameca River, Mexico is analyzed before drastic anthropogenic modifications of the riverbed occurred. Of the 7,100 individuals of <span>M. tenellum</span> collected between February 2015 and January 2016, 45.7% of which were females (3,250), 4.3% ovigerous females (309), 39.3% males (2,79), and 10.6% undifferentiated (750). Males were significantly larger and heavier than females. In general, the largest individuals were collected at the most distant sites from the coastline (Colomo and San Juan), whereas the smallest ones were captured near the river mouth. The sex ratio (males:females 1:1.3) deviated from the expected 1:1. The length-weight relationship of females, males, and the population in general indicated a negative allometric growth for all three groups. The results of our research may serve as a reference point for future investigations assessing the impact of anthropogenic changes on <span>M. tenellum</span> populations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Crustacean Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"8ca07ea220dbc7082c62912ab6b47a7a5a309f6e19a7257844b27bf0267b5f04","entryHash":"c982a7cd70f143b39d2672e16b9345e053c798c8809c45bc59e6dd42ed8c00a1","category":"Environment"}
