The cascade system was compared with a conventional continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) digester (control) in terms of process performance, stability, and digestate quality. The results showed that the cascade system achieved higher volatile solids removal (VSR) efficiencies (28–48%) than that of the reference (25–41%) when operated at the same solids residence time (SRT) in the range of 11–15 days. When the SRT of the cascade system was reduced to 8 days the VSR (32–36%) was only slightly less than that of the reference digester that was operated at a 15-day SRT (39–43%). Specific hydrolysis rates in the first stage of the cascade system were 66–152% higher than those of the reference. Additionally, the cascade system exhibited relatively stable effluent concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs: 100–120 mg/l), while the corresponding concentrations in the control effluent demonstrated greater fluctuations (100–160 mg/l). The cascade system's effluent pH and VFA/alkalinity ratios were consistently maintained within the optimal range. During a dynamic test when the feed total solids concentration was doubled, total VFA concentrations (85–120 mg/l) in the cascade system were noticeably less than those (100–170 mg/l) of the control, while the pH and VFA/alkalinity levels remained in a stable range. The cascade system achieved higher total solids (TS) content in the dewatered digestate (19.4–26.8%) than the control (17.4–22.1%), and <i>E. coli</i> log reductions (2.0–4.1 log MPN/g TS) were considerably higher (p &lt; 0.05) than those in the control (1.3–2.9 log MPN/g TS). Overall, operating multiple CSTRs in cascade mode at typical SRTs and mixed sludge ratios enhanced the performance, stability digesters, and digestate quality of AD.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nEnhanced digestion of mixed sludge digestion with cascade system.\nIncreased hydrolysis rates in the cascade system compared to a reference CSTR.\nMore stable conditions for methanogen growth at both steady and dynamic states.\nImproved dewaterability and <i>E. coli</i> reduction of digestate from the cascade system.\n</p>","author":"Yancong Zhu, \nDaozhong Yu, \nEddie Koornneef, \nWayne J.
