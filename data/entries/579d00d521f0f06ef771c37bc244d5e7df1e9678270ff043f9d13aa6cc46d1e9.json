Thus, in the collection of images a type of simple random sampling is adopted for the decrease of the bias in different citrus trees alternating and extracting leaves from the plantation also applying image processing techniques for noise reduction and edge smoothing, segmentation for the detection of the target and using machine learning algorithms that aims to perform the classification of the images, a methodology for the detection of the white fly or Aleurothrixus floccosus is achieved. It is necessary to understand that in the development of the article, it was possible to identify three stages of the pest in the plant, these being the presence of yellow areas, leaf rolling, and secretion of melase, likewise in the process it was possible to obtain a sample of 1200 images.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"579d00d521f0f06ef771c37bc244d5e7df1e9678270ff043f9d13aa6cc46d1e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
