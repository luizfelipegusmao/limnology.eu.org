{"title":"Study on Mechanical Properties of Prefabricated Lattice Beam Joint","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1807/v1","date":1729753657000,"content":"The slope protection structure of the prefabricated lattice beam is one of the most widely used and studied systems in slope structure, the core part of which is the connection between the lattice beam joint and the longitudinal and transverse beams. Because the prefabricated structure is weak in its structural integrity, it is necessary to study the influence of prefabricated lattice beam joints and the longitudinal and transverse beams on the overall mechanical properties of the structure. In this paper, one ordinary cast-in-place concrete beam and six prefabricated beams with different joint connection modes are designed, and the influence of different connection modes on the bending capacity of the beams is accordingly explored. Moreover, the flexural capacity, bending stiffness change, ductility and energy absorption capacity of the beams are analyzed through three-point bending test. The test results show that the connection mode at the joints could significantly affect the overall mechanical properties of the structure. By embedding holes in steel sleeves, filling cement mortar in the middle, and using steel plates with a thickness of 16mm for anchoring treatment joints of end plates, the specimen beams are thus obtained with the same flexural capacity, ductility and energy absorption capacity as ordinary cast-in-place concrete beams, which could be used for specimen engineering applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"002af03ccf8b34e3ebeec89619f2428d47c7bc96db4908f1233a6155cdc8f825","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
