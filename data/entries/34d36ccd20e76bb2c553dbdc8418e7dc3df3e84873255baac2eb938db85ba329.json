{"title":"Enhancing Sentiment Analysis with Term Sentiment Entropy: Capturing Nuanced Sentiment in Text Classification","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1364/v1","date":1711114534000,"content":"Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding customer feedback, guiding product development, and informing business decisions. This paper introduces term sentiment entropy (TSE), a novel weighting method that leverages the distribution of sentiment labels associated with words to enhance text classification accuracy. TSE complements traditional TF-IDF techniques by capturing the nuances of sentiment variation across different contexts. Experiments across diverse public datasets demonstrate TSE's potential to improve sentiment analysis performance, especially in capturing subtle sentiment shifts and adapting to specific domains. While computational cost and label quality pose challenges, TSE offers a promising avenue for refining sentiment analysis and opening new research frontiers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"34d36ccd20e76bb2c553dbdc8418e7dc3df3e84873255baac2eb938db85ba329","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
