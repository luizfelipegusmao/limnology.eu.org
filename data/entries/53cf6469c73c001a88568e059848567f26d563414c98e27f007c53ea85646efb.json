{"title":"Enhancing Miconazole Anticancer Activity through Development of Drug in an Olive Oil-Based Nanoemulsion Formulations: A Promising Strategy Supported by Molecular Docking","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0400/v1","date":1722926428000,"content":"We present a novel approach to repurpose the antifungal agent Miconazole as an anticancer therapeutic using olive oil-based nanoemulsion. The nanoemulsion exhibited a mean particle size of 177.76 ± 5.2 nm with a zeta potential of -24 ± 0.94 mV. Remarkably, Miconazole-loaded nanoemulsion displayed an IC50 of 1.4 ± 0.4 µg/ml against MCF-7 cells, while inducing apoptotic cell death by 70.31 ± 2.1%. In HePG2 and HCT 116 cells, IC50 values of 10.7 ± 1.2 and 5.9 ± 0.7 µg/ml were observed, respectively. These results demonstrate the promising anticancer potential of Miconazole-loaded olive oil nanoemulsion, highlighting its potential for repurposing Miconazole agents as effective anticancer therapeutics","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53cf6469c73c001a88568e059848567f26d563414c98e27f007c53ea85646efb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
