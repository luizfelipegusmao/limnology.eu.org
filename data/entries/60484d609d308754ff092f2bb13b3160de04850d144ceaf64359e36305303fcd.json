{"title":"The Global Biogeochemical Cycle of the Rare Earth Elements","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GB008125?af=R","date":1718780400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>To improve our understanding and guide future studies and applications, we review the biogeochemistry of the rare earth elements (REE). The REEs, which form a chemically uniform group due to their nearly identical physicochemical properties, include the lanthanide series elements plus scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y). These elements, in conjunction with the neodymium isotopes, are powerful tools for understanding key oceanic, terrestrial, biological and even anthropogenic processes. Furthermore, their unique properties render them essential for various technological processes and products. Here, we delve into the characteristics of REE biogeochemistry and discuss normalization procedures and REE anomalies. We also examine the aqueous speciation of REEs, contributing to a better understanding of their behavior in aquatic settings, including the role of neodymium isotopes. We then focus on their environmental distribution, fractionation, and controlling processes in different environmental systems across the land-ocean continuum. In addition, we analyze sinks, sources, and the mobility of REEs, providing insights into their behavior in these environments. We further investigate the sources of anthropogenic REEs and their bioavailability, bioaccumulation, and transfer along food webs. We also explore the potential effects of climate change on the cycling, mobility and bioavailability of REEs, underlining the importance of current research in this evolving field. In summary, we provide a comprehensive review of REE behavior in the environment, from their properties and roles to their distribution and anthropogenic impacts, offering valuable insights and pinpointing key knowledge gaps.</p>","author":"V.
