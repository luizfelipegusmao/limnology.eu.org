{"title":"Interleukin-4 (IL-4), Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) or Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-Products (RAGE) in Bronchial Secretions Cannot Predict Pediatric Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0432/v1","date":1720083629000,"content":"Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is among the most common healthcare-associated infections in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs). Because of the lack of a gold-standard diagnostic test, early diagnosis of VAP is challenging. We investigated whether bronchial biomarkers interleukin-4 (IL-4), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) could contribute in early VAP diagnosis through their fluctuation in time in critically ill pediatric patients. Methods: Bronchial secretions were collected from PICU patients with VAP on days 1 and 6. PAI-1, RAGE and IL-4 levels were measured by ELISA. Protein concentrations between high and low VAP suspicion patients were compared using unpaired Student’s t or Mann–Whitney U tests. Results: Twenty PICU patients, with median age 7.75yrs (range 0.5-15.3), mechanically ventilated for ≥48hrs with increased oxygenation requirements and VAP clinical/laboratory signs were enrolled. They were divided in VAP high-suspicion (n=12) or low-suspicion (n=8) groups based on Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (cutoff:6). ΡΑΙ-1 και RAGE levels did not differ between high- or low-VAP suspicion groups the 1st or 6th days (p-value&amp;gt;0.05). IL-4 was not detected in bronchial secretions. Conclusion: Bronchial concentrations of IL-4, PAI-1 and RAGE in critically ill children are not correlated with high- or low-VAP suspicion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a705c80d831d1a6a37befd6ad326dab7a6244bfb69e9fe60371fdf5e7c489b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
