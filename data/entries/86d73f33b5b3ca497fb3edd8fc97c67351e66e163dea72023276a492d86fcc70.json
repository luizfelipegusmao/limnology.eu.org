{"title":"Study protocol for the development and validation of a questionnaire evaluating predisposition to immunosuppressant medication non-adherence of kidney pre-transplant patients. The KATITA project","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305953","date":1719324000000,"content":"<p>by Luana Cristina Lins de Medeiros Oliveira, Rand Randall Martins, Antonio Gouveia Oliveira</p>\r\n\r\nNon-adherence to immunosuppressive medication after kidney transplant is an important cause of graft rejection and loss. Approaches to minimization of non-adherence have focused on the identification of episodes of medication non-adherence, but by then irreparable harm to the graft may already have occurred, and a more effective approach would be to adopt preventive measures in patients who may have difficulty in adhering to medication. The aim of this study protocol is to develop and validate a clinical questionnaire for assessing, in kidney transplant candidate patients in the pre-transplant setting, the predisposition to non-adherence to immunosuppressive medication. In this multicenter, prospective study, a pilot questionnaire in Brazilian Portuguese language, composed of Likert-scaled statements expressing patientsâ€™ beliefs, behaviors and barriers regarding medication taking will be assembled from a literature review, from focus groups, and an expert panel. The pilot questionnaire will be administered to a minimum of 300 patients in kidney transplant waiting lists and exploratory factor analysis will be used for development of the definitive questionnaire. A random subsample of a minimum of 60 patients will have the scale re-administered after one month for evaluation of test-retest reliability. A multicenter, external validation study will include 364 kidney transplant candidates who will be evaluated immediately before surgery and at months 3, 6 and 12 post-transplant for assessment of concurrent validity, by comparison with two scales that assess medication non-adherence, and for determination of predictive validity using a triangulation method for assessment of medication non-adherence. Structural validity will be assessed with confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modeling. Cross-cultural generalizability and validity will be assessed by a multicenter study, in which a translation of the scale to another language will be administered to kidney transplant candidate patients from a different culture, with a subsample being selected for test-retest. This study will be conducted in Spain with a Spanish translation of the scale.","author":"Luana Cristina Lins de Medeiros Oliveira","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"86d73f33b5b3ca497fb3edd8fc97c67351e66e163dea72023276a492d86fcc70","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
