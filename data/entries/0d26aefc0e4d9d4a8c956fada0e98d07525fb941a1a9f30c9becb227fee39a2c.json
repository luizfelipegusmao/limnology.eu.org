Patient education regarding vaccination was developed for cardiac rehabilitation (CR); impact on knowledge and attitudes were evaluated. A single-group pre-post design was applied at a Spanish CR program in early 2022. After baseline assessment, a nurse delivered the 40-minute group education. Knowledge and attitudes were re-assessed. Sixty-one (72%) of the 85 participants were vaccinated for influenza, and 40 (47%) for pneumococcus. Most participants perceived vaccines were important, and that the COVID-19 vaccine specifically was important, with three-quarters not influenced by vaccine myths/misinformation. The education intervention resulted in significant improvements in perceptions of the importance of vaccines (Hakeâ€™s index 69%), understanding of myths (48%), knowledge of the different types of COVID vaccines (92%), and when they should be vaccinated. Vaccination rates are low despite their importance; while further research is needed, education in the CR setting could promote greater uptake.","author":"Andrea Rivera Solera","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"0d26aefc0e4d9d4a8c956fada0e98d07525fb941a1a9f30c9becb227fee39a2c","category":"Environment"}
