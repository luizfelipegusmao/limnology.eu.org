{"title":"Assessment of Breeding Potential of Foxtail Millet Varieties Using a TOPSIS Model Constructed Based on DUS Test Characteristics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1245/v1","date":1718710350000,"content":"Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) is an important cereal crop with rich nutritional value. Distinctness, Uniformity, and Stability (DUS) are the prerequisites for the application of new variety rights for foxtail millet. In this study, we investigated 32 DUS test characteristics of 183 foxtail millet resources, studied their artificial selection trends, and identified varieties that conform to breeding trends. The results indicated significant differences in terms of means, ranges, and coefficients of variation for each characteristic. Correlation analysis was performed to determine the correlations between various DUS characteristics. Principal component analysis was conducted on 31 test characteristics to determine their primary characteristics. By plotting PC1 and PC2, all germplasm resources could be clearly distinguished. Trends in foxtail millet breeding were identified through differential analysis of DUS test characteristics between landrace varieties and cultivated varieties. Based on these breeding trends, optimal solution types for multiple evaluation indicators were determined; weight allocation was calculated, and a specific TOPSIS algorithm was designed to establish a comprehensive multi-criteria decision-making model. Using this model, the breeding potential of foxtail millet germplasm resources was ranked. These findings provided important reference for foxtail millet breeding in future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d933fff2e00e78b95653f0814b8785144ab1d9c51305619c2fa00795b7955f96","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
