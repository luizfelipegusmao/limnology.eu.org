{"title":"Mating system is associated with seed phenotypes upon loss of RNA-directed DNA methylation in Brassicaceae","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2136/7439458?rss=1","date":1700524800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In plants, de novo DNA methylation is guided by 24-nt short interfering (si)RNAs in a process called RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Primarily targeted at transposons, RdDM causes transcriptional silencing and can indirectly influence expression of neighboring genes. During reproduction, a small number of siRNA loci are dramatically upregulated in the maternally derived seed coat, suggesting that RdDM might have a special function during reproduction. However, the developmental consequence of RdDM has been difficult to dissect because disruption of RdDM does not result in overt phenotypes in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), where the pathway has been most thoroughly studied. In contrast, <span>Brassica rapa</span> mutants lacking RdDM have a severe seed production defect, which is determined by the maternal sporophytic genotype. To explore the factors that underlie the different phenotypes of these species, we produced RdDM mutations in 3 additional members of the Brassicaceae family: <span>Camelina sativa</span>, <span>Capsella rubella</span>, and <span>Capsella grandiflora</span>. Among these 3 species, only mutations in the obligate outcrosser, <span>C. grandiflora</span>, displayed a seed production defect similar to <span>Brassica rapa</span> mutants, suggesting that mating system is a key determinant for reproductive phenotypes in RdDM mutants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"43f0f1204e12dfb4fb95037cf0a109f502d69b6bd4b90037c4e22c3fb358b3b6","category":"Environment"}
