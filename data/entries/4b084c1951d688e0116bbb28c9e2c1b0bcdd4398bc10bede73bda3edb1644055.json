{"title":"The Future Directions of CAR-T Cell Therapy: Unlocking the Potential of Immunotherapy in Cancer Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0155/v1","date":1717510378000,"content":"CAR-T cell therapy has emerged as a groundbreaking approach in cancer treatment, leveraging the immune system to target and eliminate cancer cells. While currently focused on hematologic malignancies, the future holds promise for expanding CAR-T cell therapy to diverse cancers, enhancing its efficacy, and improving safety profiles. Recent advances in tumor immunology have propelled CAR-T cell therapy as a game-changer in treating diseases such as relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and multiple myeloma (MM). Six CAR-T cell products have received FDA approval for treating R/R B cell malignancies. However, challenges persist, including complications like cytokine release syndrome (CRS), coagulopathy, and cytopenias. Strategies to mitigate these complications involve targeting distinct antigens with dual- or multi-targeted CAR-T cells and enhancing immunogenicity. Additionally, γδ CAR-T cells show promise in recognizing antigen- negative leukemia cells in an MHC-independent manner while reducing the risk of inducing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). As CAR-T cell therapy continues to evolve through innovation and discovery, it holds the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment, offering new hope to patients and reshaping the landscape of oncology with its precision and efficacy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b084c1951d688e0116bbb28c9e2c1b0bcdd4398bc10bede73bda3edb1644055","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
