{"title":"Plasma Metabolite Profiling in the Search for Early-Stage Biomarkers for Lung Cancer: Some Important Breakthroughs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1401/v1","date":1711346806000,"content":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide. In order to improve its overall survival, early diagnosis is required. Since current screening methods still face some pitfalls, such as high false positive rates for low-dose computed tomography, researchers are still looking for early biomarkers to complement existing screening techniques in order to provide a safe, faster and more accurate diagnosis. Biomarkers are biological molecules found in body fluids, such as plasma, that can be used to diagnose a condition or disease. Metabolomics has already shown to be a powerful tool in the search for cancer biomarkers since cancer cells are characterised by impaired metabolism, resulting in an adapted plasma metabolite profile. The metabolite profile can be determined using nuclear magnetic resonance, or NMR. Although metabolomics and NMR metabolite profiling of blood plasma are still under investigation, there is already evidence for its potential for early-stage lung cancer diagnosis, therapy response, and follow-up monitoring. This review highlights some key breakthroughs in this research field, where the most significant biomarkers will be discussed in relation with their metabolic pathways and in light of the altered cancer metabolism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f2a41f1a17dd7c2336ed9bf2ceac3a6b791ef01e5df43b9ef6de86b772e05d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
