{"title":"Mineralogical and Textural Analysis of Natural Hercynite-Spinel Compounds","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1831/v1","date":1721743316000,"content":"This work reports a characterization of crystallographic phases and chemical composition of hercynite-spinel (FeAl2O4) natural long crystals and their powders using X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Inductively Coupled Plasma mass spectrometry, and mineralographic/petrographic analysis. The samples studied show a high content of hercynite with Neumann bands/Widmanst√§tten patterns, coexisting with other crystallographic phases such as corundum, spinel (MgAl2O4), esseneite, kamacite, hedenbergite, pseudobrookite, and ulvospinel. The diffractograms of two of the samples examined exhibit an extraordinary sharpness of the diffraction peaks that determines a high degree of crystallinity, which is hard to obtain in hercynite synthesized by artificial methods. In addition, the hercynite natural samples are less porous than the artificially synthesized hercynite. The x-ray diffraction pattern of one of the pulverized crystalline samples allowed us to estimate the percentage of the main phases present. The crystallographic existent phases with the highest participation in one of the spinel samples were hercynite (43.4%), corundum (18.7%), spinel (18.4%), esseneite (17.2%), and kamacite with a 2.3 %. These results contribute to the structural characterization of this unique material widely used in many technological applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b08639643dfcfead6aa27f91064ded3e2d650c1ed78c4c9729b63a9682ebd327","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
