{"title":"Understanding Aerosol-Cloud Interactions Through Lidar Techniques: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1495/v1","date":1718956999000,"content":"Aerosol-cloud interactions play a crucial role in shaping Earth’s climate and hydrological 1 cycle. Observing these interactions with high precision and accuracy is of the utmost importance 2 for improving climate models and predicting Earth’s climate. Over the past few decades, lidar 3 techniques have emerged as powerful tools for investigating aerosol-cloud interactions due to their 4 ability to provide detailed vertical profiles of aerosol particles and clouds with high spatial and 5 temporal resolutions. This review paper provides an overview of recent advancements in the study 6 of aerosol-cloud interactions using lidar techniques. The paper begins with a description of the 7 different cloud microphysical processes that are affected by the presence of the aerosol, and with 8 an outline of lidar remote sensing application in characterizing aerosol particles and clouds. The 9 subsequent sections delve into the key findings and insights gained from lidar-based studies of 10 aerosol-cloud interactions. This includes investigations into the role of aerosol particles in cloud 11 formation, evolution, and microphysical properties. Finally, the review concludes with an outlook 12 on future research. By reporting the latest findings and methodologies, this review aims to provide 13 valuable insights for researchers engaged in climate science and atmospheric research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b8aa18039bfcec915f857098a08345b51654dff58f03b401e0578eb2a2d1f9c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
