{"title":"A Meta-Analytical Way of Systematizing the Use of Hyaluronan Gels for the Relief of Osteoarthritis, Compared with New Treatment Alternatives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0178/v1","date":1719924537000,"content":"Hyaluronic acid, in the form of a gel or viscoelastic colloidal solution, is currently used for viscosupplementation of joints affected by osteoarthritis, but its effectiveness is under debate in relation to newer alternatives. Based on meta-analytical arguments, the present article reinforces the opinion that there are still no decisive arguments for its complete replacement, but for its use adapted to the peculiarities of the disease manifestation and of the patients. A “broad” comparison is first made with almost all alternatives studied in the last decade, and then a meta-regression study is performed to compare and predict the effect size induced by viscosupplementation and platelet-rich plasma therapies. If they are computerized, the developed models can represent tools for clinicians in determining the appropriateness of the option or not for viscosupplementation, in a manner adapted to the pain felt by the patients, to their age, or to other clinical circumstances. The models were generated using the latest algorithms for meta-analysis and meta-regression implemented in the R language and assembled in different R packages. All primary data and necessary R scripts are provided in accordance with the philosophy of reproducible research. Finally, HA-based products, currently under circumspection, are still clinically useful.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1dfef35475ce199ee920b3547167a1c215494c302982b09acf4e3766578fd569","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
