{"title":"The Access to Credit in the Context of the ESG Framework at Global Level","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0239/v1","date":1722912531000,"content":"This paper explores the critical role of the banking sector in facilitating the ecological transition through the integration of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors. By analyzing the intersection of ESG considerations and access to credit globally, the study highlights how banks can catalyze sustainable investments while balancing financial risks. Using a systematic literature review and k-Means clustering analysis, we assess the global landscape of credit access, emphasizing the implications of ESG adoption on financial stability and economic growth. The findings suggest that while ESG integration presents challenges, it offers significant opportunities for banks to enhance their competitiveness and foster resilient financial systems. The paper concludes by proposing policy recommendations aimed at improving the incorporation of ESG factors within credit risk management and promoting sustainable finance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a3b77c959a5e1ce383f81ffb033075685ecf1cfaf18ba4c931e1ed91a0f92094","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
