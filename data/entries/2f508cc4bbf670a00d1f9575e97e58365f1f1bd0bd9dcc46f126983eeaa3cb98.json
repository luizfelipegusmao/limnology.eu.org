Utilizing a decadal pigment dataset (2002â€“2015) from China Seas and employing generalized additive mixed models coupled with maximum entropy modeling, we discerned thermal sensitivity differentiations among nine phytoplankton groups, encompassing the full-size spectrum. Our findings revealed that cryptophytes were exceptionally thermally sensitive, with a strong correlation between temperature changes and biomass variance. Characterized by a preference for cooler waters, cryptophytes had a low mean temperature niche and a narrow niche breadth. Notably, they exhibited the lowest temperature tipping point, highlighting their heightened vulnerability to warming trends. These findings underscored the significance of cryptophytes, an often-overlooked group, in understanding ecosystem responses to climate shifts, and emphasized their potential role as key indicators in marine ecological studies under global warming.</p>","author":"Changyun Wang, \nShujie Cai, \nZhuyin Tong, \nJixin Chen, \nLizhen Lin, \nWupeng Xiao, \nXin Liu, \nBangqin Huang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Letters: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e3d6bd1d0a248694da65f62e7591c05124a8fbc5456d1cafb66209dfd7ae6238","entryHash":"2f508cc4bbf670a00d1f9575e97e58365f1f1bd0bd9dcc46f126983eeaa3cb98","category":"Environment"}
