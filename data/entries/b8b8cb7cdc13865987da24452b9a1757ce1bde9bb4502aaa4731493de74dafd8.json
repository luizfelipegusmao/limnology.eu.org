{"title":"Elevating Clinical Social Work Practice: Insights from Longitudinal Studies on Resilience Pathways in Clients Affected by Early Adversity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1806/v1","date":1714284799000,"content":"Longitudinal studies tracing high-risk samples over decades have illuminated powerful pathways of resilient adaptation among individuals who overcome adversities faced early in life. This research demonstrates resilience is a common phenomenon driven by dynamic interactions between individual traits and environmental resources that enable positive adjustment despite adversity exposure. For clinical social workers supporting clients impacted by childhood trauma, abuse, violence and other adversities, understanding these resilience processes is vital for developing strengths-based, trauma -informed interventions that enhance positive adaptation. This paper synthesizes key findings from landmark longitudinal resilience studies and explores specific practice implications for resilience-oriented clinical assessment, intervention planning, prevention efforts, and social worker training. By integrating resilience research insights, social workers can more effectively identify and cultivate clients' innate capacities for resilience, facilitating a journey towards posttraumatic growth.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b8b8cb7cdc13865987da24452b9a1757ce1bde9bb4502aaa4731493de74dafd8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
