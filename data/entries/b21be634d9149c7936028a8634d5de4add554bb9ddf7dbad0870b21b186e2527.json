{"title":"Human-Machine Teams: Advantages Afforded by the Quantum-Likeness of Interdependence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0595/v1","date":1723098599000,"content":"Big data is considered to be the solution to many complex problems, but its application appears to be relegated to the problems that are factorable (e.g., the tensor-like operations which reflect separable elements), not the non-factorable data from teamwork, team intelligence, and possibly not individual consciousness. In contrast, the quantum likeness of interdependence is set apart from the standard science of teams by recognizing a measurement problem between a team and its individual teammates, and between individual beliefs and actions. Teams that concern us are based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems, which we find lacking for two reasons. First, neither AI nor ML models the human's timeless need for debate to solve a problem at the social level when facing uncertainty or complexity, where the debate of proposed actions serves to establish the boundaries of a problem in reality, no matter how complex nor uncertain. Second, at the individual level exists the illusion of a unified reality propagated by a bifurcated brain that we assume is split to determine a context with narrative and bounded spaces. We hypothesize that the quantum-likeness of interdependence applied to autonomous human-machine teams suggests that at the social level, debate models an individual's bifurcated brain, providing advantages for human-machine teams in freer systems over those oppressed by command and control systems (e.g., authoritarian regimes). Human-machine teams are coming, but they are not yet available, forcing us to rely on data from human systems. We close with plans for future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b21be634d9149c7936028a8634d5de4add554bb9ddf7dbad0870b21b186e2527","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
