{"title":"2D Shear Wave Elastography of the Thyroid in Clinically Healthy Dogs of Different Age Groups","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1026/v1","date":1713256959000,"content":"Considering the age of the dogs, it was expected that elderly animals would have stiffer thyroids than adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the thyroid glands of healthy dogs using 2D shear wave elastography in order to establish qualitative and quantitative parameters of tissue stiffness in dogs of different age groups. The B-mode ultrasound and elastography findings were correlated with the weight and sex of the patients, allowing a reference range to be established for different groups of dogs. 31 dogs of different breeds, sexes and sizes were evaluated. Animals with clinical signs or ultrasound findings indicative of endocrine disease or thyroid lesions were not included in the study. Using QelaXtoTM 2D software, shear wave velocity data in m/s and color elastograms were evaluated and calculated. A healthy thyroid has a blue color elastogram, indicative of low stiffness, and there was no distinction between adult and elderly dogs, genders or sizes. The reference range for the shear wave velocity of thyroid tissue assessed by 2D shear wave elastography can be between 1.6 and 2.0 m/s with a variation of Â±0.889 in adult and elderly dogs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b7963853dfca8375f81527de4180ef1cfa7ed255c5a3a1631140111b4a0d46bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
