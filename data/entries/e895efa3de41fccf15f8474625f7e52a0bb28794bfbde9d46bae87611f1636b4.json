{"title":"The Sustainability Journey: Efforts, Challenges, and the Road Ahead for a Global Food Service Giant","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0613/v1","date":1728463700000,"content":"This paper explores Burger King's sustainability efforts in the face of growing environmental and social challenges. It begins by defining sustainability and its importance in corporate operations, then transitions to analyze Burger King's specific practices, particularly its efforts to reduce methane emissions from beef production and tackle deforestation linked to its supply chain. While the company has made some strides in addressing environmental concerns, such as introducing low-emission beef burgers, these initiatives have been deemed inadequate by experts. The paper highlights the gaps in Burger King's approach to sustainability and compares it to industry leaders like McDonald's, emphasizing the need for more robust and transparent measures. The conclusion suggests that Burger King must take more aggressive steps in aligning its operations with sustainable practices to meet the demands of modern consumers and secure its long-term viability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e895efa3de41fccf15f8474625f7e52a0bb28794bfbde9d46bae87611f1636b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
