The Four Color Theorem is just one special case of this theory, with the maximum structure size for a four-color graph being a 4-order structure graph, hence requiring only a maximum of 4 colors for coloring.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1cba464faec0532af8c4bb1cdd1948693cb076ae58eac7731f6496f61aa3de7b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
