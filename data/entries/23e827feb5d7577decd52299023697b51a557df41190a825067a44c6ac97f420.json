{"title":"Advancements in Bioengineering for Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1167/v1","date":1715952589000,"content":"Corneal diseases are the third leading cause of blindness worldwide. There are numerous causes of corneal blindness, and the common treatment for this condition often involves corneal tissue transplantation, such as Descemet's Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK). DMEK has been established as the preferred surgical technique for the treatment of corneal endothelial disorders. The success of DMEK depends largely on the quality of the donor endothelial cells and the trans-plantation procedure. However, the scarcity of suitable donor tissue and the sensitivity of endo-thelial cells pose a major challenge. In recent years, tissue engineering has attracted attention as potential solutions to these problems. This review offers an outline of the current landscape of DMEK in the context of bioengineering, exploring various methodologies, advancements, and fu-ture prospects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"23e827feb5d7577decd52299023697b51a557df41190a825067a44c6ac97f420","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
