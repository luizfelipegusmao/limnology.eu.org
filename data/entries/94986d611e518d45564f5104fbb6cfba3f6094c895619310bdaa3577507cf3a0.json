{"title":"Structural Dynamics of Heteromeric Glycine Receptor Complex","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.357/7720464?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Glycine Receptors (GlyRs) at the inhibitory synapses in the spinal cord and brainstem are key players in regulating motor control and pain processing. GlyRs assemble as either homopentamers of α subunits (α1−α4) or heteropentamers of α subunits in combination with β subunits. Post-synaptic GlyRs are an obligate heteromeric assembly of α and β subunits, and are associated with gephyrin, a synaptic scaffold protein. Using Cryo-EM and single particle analysis, my group has determined structures of α1β GlyR in the presence of various orthosteric and allosteric ligands that evoke agonistic and antagonistic responses. These structures provide a detailed view of ligand-receptor interactions and conformational changes associated with different functional states. Molecular dynamic simulations and functional studies validate the proposed mechanisms. Together, our results show distinct compositional and conformational properties of α1βGlyR and provide a framework for further study of this physiologically important channel [<a href=\"#ozae044.357-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"94986d611e518d45564f5104fbb6cfba3f6094c895619310bdaa3577507cf3a0","category":"Environment"}
