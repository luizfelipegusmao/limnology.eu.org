{"title":"Social Filter Theory&mdash;&mdash;A Sleeping Beauty of Regional Innovation Theories","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1815/v1","date":1729694081000,"content":"As a branch of regional innovation theories, social filter theory fundamentally reveals the reasons for the geography of innovation in different countries and regions. However, compared with some other regional innovation theories, social filter theory has been as silent as a sleeping beauty and hasnâ€™t been fully developed. For enriching and developing social filter theory, this article systematically traces the source and comments on four aspects: the concept of social filter, the construction and measurement of indicators of social filter, the mechanism and empirical re-search of social filter affecting regional innovation and innovation transformation. Until recently regional innovation theories primarily focused on the superficial description of the phenomenon of innovation, but lack of attention to the local social filter condition of innovation generation and innovation transformation, which are the pre-condition of constructing mature innovation system. Therefore, additional efforts are still required to fill the current knowledge gap from the recom-mended directions in the article.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c794efc359bec79e48d954b1706f61b12118a3bdd41280dd9a2bf3a168498afc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
