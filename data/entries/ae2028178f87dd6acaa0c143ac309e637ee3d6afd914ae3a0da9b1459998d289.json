In this study, we evaluated the response of phytoplankton species and species traits along a gradient of urbanization in lowland streams. To do this, we sampled nine streams in three areas classified as densely populated (DP), low populated (LP), and rural areas (RA) during the four seasons (n = 108), considering relevant limnological variables (including metals, herbicides, and inorganic nutrients) and phytoplankton. Phytoplankton was analysed using taxonomic and morpho-functional traits approaches. We used several multivariate analyses to assess phytoplankton species and trait distribution among stream groups (DP, LP, RA) and identify their environmental drivers. We found that phytoplankton responded to the urbanization gradient at both taxonomic and functional levels. However, this response was mediated by the land use (urban vs. rural) rather than its intensity. The main stressors detected were eutrophic conditions and organic matter contamination, which differed among groups (DP-LP and RA). Both approximations indicated eutrophic, organically enriched conditions, but the situation varied among seasons and stream groups. The response of the taxonomic approach was clearer than the traits-based approach, showing differences in density only between stream groups in the summer and the spring. Phytoplankton was responding to the gradient of urbanization in these subtropical lowland streams, but the seasonality, especially temperature and changes in the water column mixing also mediate the effect.</p>","author":"Diego Frau, \nAlfonso Pineda","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"ae2028178f87dd6acaa0c143ac309e637ee3d6afd914ae3a0da9b1459998d289","category":"Environment"}
