{"title":"Advances in Gut Microbiota-Targeted Therapeutics for Metabolic Syndrome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1322/v1","date":1711097775000,"content":"Previous investigations have illuminated the significant association between the gut microbiome and a broad spectrum of health conditions, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and psychiatric disorders. Evidence from certain studies suggests that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may play a role in the etiology of obesity and diabetes. Moreover, it is acknowledged that dietary habits, pharmacological interventions, psychological stress, and other exogenous factors can substantially influence the gut microbial composition. For instance, a diet rich in fiber has been demonstrated to increase the population of beneficial bacteria, whereas the consumption of antibiotics can reduce these advantageous microbial communities. In light of the established correlation between the gut microbiome and various pathologies, strategically altering the gut microbial profile represents an emerging therapeutic approach. This can be accomplished through the administration of probiotics or prebiotics, which aim to refine the gut microbiota and, consequently, mitigate the manifestations of associated diseases. The present manuscript evaluates recent literature on the relationship between gut microbiota and metabolic syndrome published over the past three years and anticipates future directions in this evolving field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1fed4257488e8f8d389d031cbf359b07d7fd7688a053914402ef0291e5578b5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
