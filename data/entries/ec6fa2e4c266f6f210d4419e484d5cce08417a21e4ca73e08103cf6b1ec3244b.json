High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in combination with the analysis of the broadening of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks using the FullProf software are tools that allow for monitoring of these microstructural effects [<a href=\"#ozae044.1054-B2\">2</a>]. To the best of our knowledge no reports of the microstructural effects based on the spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients refinement in combination with TEM images considering CeO<sub>2</sub>-NPs have been published. Then, it is necessary to further monitor the structural features (XRD), morphology, and size (HRTEM) of CeO<sub>2</sub>-NPs as a potential reinforcement material for mechanical applications. The motivation of this work is to synthesize CeO<sub>2</sub>-NPs using the hydrothermal route to monitor these microstructural effects.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ec6fa2e4c266f6f210d4419e484d5cce08417a21e4ca73e08103cf6b1ec3244b","category":"Environment"}
