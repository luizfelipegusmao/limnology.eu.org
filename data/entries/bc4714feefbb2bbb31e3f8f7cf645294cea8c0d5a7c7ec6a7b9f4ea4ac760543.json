{"title":"Structural Characterization and Bioactivity of a Titanium(IV) -Oxo Complex Stabilized by Mandelate Ligands","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1145/v1","date":1710844288000,"content":"Research on titanium oxo complexes (TOCs) are usually focused on their structure and photocatalytic properties. Findings from these investigations spurred our interest in exploring also their potential biological activities. In this study, we focused on the synthesis and structure of a compound with the general formula [Ti8O2(OiPr)20(man)4] (1), which was isolated from the reaction mixture of titanium(IV) isopropoxide with mandelic acid (Hman) in a molar ratio of 4:1. The structure (1) was determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, while spectroscopic studies provided insights into its physicochemical properties. To assess the potential practical applications of (1), its microcrystals were incorporated into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix, yielding composite materials of the type PMMA + (1) (2 wt.%, 5 wt.%, 10 wt.%, and 20 wt.%). The next stage of our research involved the antimicrobial activity evaluation of the obtained materials. Investigations carried out demonstrated antimicrobial activity of pure (1) and its composites (PMMA + (1)) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Furthermore, MTT tests conducted on the L929 murine fibroblast cell line confirmed the lack of cytotoxicity of these composites. Our study identified (1) as a promising antimicrobial agent, also for producing composite coatings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc4714feefbb2bbb31e3f8f7cf645294cea8c0d5a7c7ec6a7b9f4ea4ac760543","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
