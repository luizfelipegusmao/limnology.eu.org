{"title":"Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors: What Is the Best Surgical Option?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0692/v1","date":1712747126000,"content":"Background: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) represents a rare subset of pancreatic cancer. Functional tumors caused hormonal changes and clinical syndromes, while non-functional ones are often diagnosed late. Surgical management need a multidisciplinary planning, involving enucleation, distal pancreatectomy with or without spleen preserving, cen-tral pancreatectomy, pancreaticoduodectomy or total pancreatectomy. Minimally invasive ap-proach increased in the last decade compared to the open technique. The aim of this study is to analyze current diagnostic and surgical trends for pNETs, to identify better interventions and their outcomes.\nMethods: The study adhered to PRISMA guidelines, conducting a systematic review of literature from May 2008 to March 2022 across multiple databases. Several combinations of keywords was used (\"NET\", \"pancreatic\", \"surgery\", \"laparoscopic\", \"minimally invasive\", \"robotic”, “enuclea-tion”,“parenchima sparing”) and relevant article references was manually checked. Manuscript quality was evaluated. \nResults: The study screened 3867 manuscripts, twelve studies were selected, primarily from Ita-ly, the United States, and China. A total of 7767 surgical treated patients was collected from 160 included centers. The mean age was 56,3 y.o. Enucleations (EN) and distal pancreatectomy (DP) was the most common performed surgery and represents 43.4% and 38.6% of the total interven-tions, respectively. Pancreatic fistula, post operative bleeding, re-operation and follow up was recorded and analyzed. \nConclusions:  Enucleation show better postoperative outcomes and lower mortality rates com-pared to pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) or distal pancreatectomy (DP), despite similar risks of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). DP was preferred over enucleation for pancreas body-tail, while laparoscopic enucleation is better for head pNETs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bdc571b7a08aab448d685b0db0bf587bb2062ac62d1f56eca3f72cf9fa07d132","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
