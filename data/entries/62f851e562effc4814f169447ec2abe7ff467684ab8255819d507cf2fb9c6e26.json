{"title":"Devising a Simple Evaluation Method for Assessing Motor Coordination in the Upper and Lower Limbs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2409/v1","date":1722328334000,"content":"Despite copious research, the methods for assessing upper- and lower-limb motor coordination are limited. We devised a simplified evaluation method based on upper- and lower-limb motor coordination jumping and conducted a practical examination of the characteristics of the motion and applicability of the evaluation method. Overall, 88 high-school athletes with comparable competitive abilities were included in this study. The participants were divided into two groups based on their prior experience with motor coordination training (24 in the experienced group; 64 in the inexperienced group). First, a population proportion test was employed to assess the success rate of the four upper- and lower-limb motions in each task. This revealed significant difference between all tasks, except for the fourth motion, indicating that different motions have varying degrees of difficulty and that the combination of motions with differing difficulty coefficients can result in the creation of entirely new tasks with varying degrees of difficulty. Second, the experienced group demonstrated significantly superior performance compared to the inexperienced group by a t-test. These results confirmed that athletes (with the same level of competitive ability) trained in upper and lower limb motor coordination were able to excel in this evaluation method, confirming its validity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62f851e562effc4814f169447ec2abe7ff467684ab8255819d507cf2fb9c6e26","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
