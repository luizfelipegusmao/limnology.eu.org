{"title":"The Role of the Heterogeneous Catalyst to Produce Solketal from Biodiesel Waste: The Key to Achieve Efficiency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1625/v1","date":1711467759000,"content":"The valorization of the large amount of crude glycerol formed from biodiesel industry, is of primordial necessity. One possible direction with high interest to the biorefiniery sector is the production of fuel additives as solketal, though the acetalization of glycerol with acetone. This is a chemical process that conciliates high sustainability and economic interest, since solketal contributes to the fullfilment of a Circular Economy Model through its use in biodiesel blends. The key to guarantee high efficiency and high sustainability for solketal production is the use of a recovery and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst. Some examples are already reported in the literature (first example in 2012), and this review intends to conciliate the information spreaded in this topic and established the most important reacional parameters and the main catalytic characteristics strategies to achieve high solketal production in short reaction time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49c44e3e09659ca9c96d492e6f5d9b6e203546f4fab96a9a6c9ae5ee09d4a84f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
