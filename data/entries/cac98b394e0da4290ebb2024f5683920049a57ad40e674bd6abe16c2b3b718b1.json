{"title":"Noise as an Optimization Tool for Spiking Neural Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0704/v1","date":1723192092000,"content":"Standard ANNs lack flexibility when handling corrupted input due to their fixed structure. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can utilize biological temporal coding features, such as noise-induced stochastic resonance and dynamical synapses to increase a modelâ€™s performance when its parameters are not optimized for a given input. Using the analog XOR task as a simplified Convolutional Neural Network analog, this paper demonstrates two key results: (1) SNNs solve the problem linearly inseparable in ANN with over 10% improvement in the optimal setting, and (2) in SNNs, the synaptic noise and dynamical synapses compensate for non-optimal parameters, achieving near-optimal results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cac98b394e0da4290ebb2024f5683920049a57ad40e674bd6abe16c2b3b718b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
