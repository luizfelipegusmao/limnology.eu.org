{"title":"66 Effect of copper oxide wire particles on parasitism and growth in Katahdin lambs divergently selected for fecal egg count estimated breeding value","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/89/7617968?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Internal parasites are one of the greatest threats to small ruminant production across the United States and parasitic resistance to anthelmintics continues to increase. Genetic selection and copper oxide wire particles (COWP) are two tools that could help reduce effects of parasites in small ruminants. The objective of this project was to determine the effects and interactions of COWP and genetic selection based on fecal egg count (FEC) estimated breeding value (EBV) on gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infection and performance in naturally infected Katahdin lambs. Spring-born Katahdin ram lambs (n = 52) selected for extremely high FEC EBV (HighFEC, PFEC EBV = +100%) or low FEC EBV (LowFEC, PFEC EBV = -81%) were managed on a fescue-based pasture at the Southwest Virginia Agricultural Research and Extension Center (Glade Spring, VA). At weaning (June 29), lambs were dewormed with a three-combination treatment and rested for 21 d. At the start of the project (July 18), a random subset of lambs (HighFEC, n = 11; LowFEC, n = 15) were given a 2 g copper oxide wire particle bolus, while an equal number of remaining lambs were managed as controls without a copper bolus. All lambs were managed as one contemporary group. Fecal egg counts, FAMACHA scores, body weights, and packed cell volume (PCV) were measured bi-weekly for 10 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed using PROC Mixed Procedure of SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and FEC data were log transformed for normality. There were no effects of COWP treatment on FEC (P = 0.18). However, LowFEC-selected lambs had less FEC than HighFEC-selected lambs (230 vs. 565 eggs/g, respectively; P &lt; 0.01). There was no interaction of COWP treatment and FEC genotype (P = 0.37). Copper oxide wire particle treatment had no effect on lamb body weight (P = 0.21), PCV (P = 0.69), FAMACHA score (P = 0.41), or overall ADG (P = 0.12). Lamb FEC genotype did not affect FAMACHA score or overall ADG (P = 0.10 and P = 0.22, respectively). LowFEC-selected lambs had lighter body weights (27.7 vs. 30.6 kg, respectively) and PCV (29.2% vs. 30.4%, respectively) than the HighFEC-selected lambs (P &lt; 0.05). None of the 52 lambs met the requirement for deworming (FAMACHA â‰¥ 3) during the study. These results indicate that lamb FEC genotype may have a greater effect on parasitism than COWP treatment when given once during the post-weaning period. Even so, multiple tools should be considered, in addition to selection, for an integrated parasite management plan.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"f2ef9877c083289a2fa8cbd521527f5b45f85c5f356d078140e21b514ecd635e","category":"Environment"}
