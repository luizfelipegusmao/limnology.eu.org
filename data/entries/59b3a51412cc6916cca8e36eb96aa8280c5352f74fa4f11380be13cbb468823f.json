{"title":"Hatcheries maintain high genetic variation but show shifts in genetic structure of progenies of five endangered riffleshell species (Epioblasma) (Bivalvia: Unionidae) of the eastern United States","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4223?af=R","date":1724742000000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nWe assessed genetic variation at mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA microsatellites for progeny (i.e., juveniles produced at a hatchery) of five endangered <i>Epioblasma</i> species reared at three hatcheries in the eastern United States.\nThe progeny of <i>Epioblasma aureola</i>, <i>Epioblasma brevidens</i>, <i>Epioblasma obliquata</i> and <i>Epioblasma triquetra</i> showed no loss of mtDNA haplotype diversity relative to broodstock (i.e., wild collected gravid females used to produce juveniles) and wildstock (i.e., individuals sampled in the wild to assess baseline genetic diversity), while progeny of <i>Epioblasma capsaeformis</i> showed no loss relative to broodstock but an ~50% loss relative to wildstock.\nAt DNA microsatellites, mean expected heterozygosities (<i>H</i>\n<sub>e</sub>) were maintained in wildstock, broodstock and progeny, with the lowest values observed in <i>E. aureola</i> and <i>E. triquetra</i>. Among progeny, values of <i>H</i>\n<sub>e</sub> and allelic richness (<i>A</i>) at times exceeded those observed in the wildstock and broodstock. Hence, no loss of genetic variation at DNA microsatellites was observed in progeny among species.\nWe documented multiple paternity in progeny of <i>E. aureola</i>, <i>E. capsaeformis</i> and <i>E. obliquata</i> and in part attribute their high <i>H</i>\n<sub>e</sub> and <i>A</i> to fertilization of broodstock females by multiple males in the wild.\nWe observed significant divergence in <i>F</i>\n<sub>ST</sub> and <i>D</i> values between progeny to wildstock and progeny to broodstock. Most pairwise comparisons for <i>E. brevidens</i> and <i>E. capsaeformis</i> were significantly diverged, and for <i>E. obliquata</i>, divergence was low but also significantly different, and only for <i>E. aureola</i> was it low and nonsignificant.\nOur results showed that population genetic structure can develop quickly between progeny and their progenitors in the first generation (F<sub>1</sub>) of offspring produced from a set of parents and that genetic diversity at mtDNA and nuclear DNA microsatellites was generally maintained in progeny of endangered <i>Epioblasma</i> species reared at three mussel hatcheries utilizing current propagation practices.\n</p>","author":"Jess W.
