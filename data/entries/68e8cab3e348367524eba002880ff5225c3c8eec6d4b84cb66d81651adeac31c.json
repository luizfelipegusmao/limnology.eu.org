{"title":"Dipping Tidal Notches (DTN): Exposed vs Sheltered Morphometry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0191/v1","date":1712046374000,"content":"Tidal notches, long regarded as reliable indicators of mean sea level, have been extensively studied along carbonate coasts in the central Mediterranean Sea. Previous studies revealed a correlation between the genesis of tidal notches and tidal range, lithology, cliff foot depth and wave energy. In the 2020 Geoswim campaign at Lampedusa, the southernmost island of the Pelagie archipelago (Italy), 'anomalous' tidal notches were identified. Unlike normal notches observed elsewhere, those in Lampedusa's southern bays exhibited a particular behavior â€”constantly deepening in the inner part of the bays, reaching a maximum depth of approximately 30 cm below sea level and narrowing inwards. Similar phenomena were previously observed by [1] near Marseille (France) and in Gozo Island (Malta). Time-lapse images, alongside measurements of morphometric param-eters, were collected during the survey. Despite the rapid morphological changes of the notches within the bay, the tectonic stability of the studied areas was confirmed by literature and data. Our hypothesis indicates that a combination of marine factors, influenced by local meteomarine conditions driven by the local morphology of the small bays exposed to southern quadrants con-tribute to the formation of these unique landforms. The latter manifest higher lowering erosion rates slightly below mean sea level in sheltered areas, challenging conventional notions about tidal notch formation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68e8cab3e348367524eba002880ff5225c3c8eec6d4b84cb66d81651adeac31c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
