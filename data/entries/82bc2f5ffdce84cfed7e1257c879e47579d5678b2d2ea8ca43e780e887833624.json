{"title":"The Potential of Listed Buildings to Create Living Space","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1315/v1","date":1721116794000,"content":"Stagnating low renovation rates, vacancies and underused town centers, unprecedentedly high levels of land sealing and excessive consumption of resources through the construction of new buildings and infrastructure as well as the effects of climate change were some of the reasons for carrying out the monumentum ad usum research project.Thermodynamic simulations were used to carry out in-depth analyses of specific building parameters such as energy balances and how they are influenced by the effects of climate change. Life cycle analyses under ecological and economic aspects examined the aspects of sustainability and the individual behaviour of predominantly listed existing buildings under standardized conditions.The project results show that sustainable refurbishment can significantly increase the attractiveness of using historic and listed buildings for non-profit building owners. The results and conclusions of the project are as varied as the recommendations derived from them. In practice, old buildings consume significantly less energy than predicted in the structural calculations. Correction factors are to be developed and thermodynamic simulation calculations are to be used instead of energy performance certificates for more realistic forecasts of energy requirements and emission savings potential. The aspects of sustainability in refurbishment are essential for the protection of our architectural heritage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"82bc2f5ffdce84cfed7e1257c879e47579d5678b2d2ea8ca43e780e887833624","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
