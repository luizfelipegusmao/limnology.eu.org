However, the availability of food resources, such as plant nectar, can vary widely in cropping systems, potentially affecting parasitoid fitness and thereby biological control of pests. The egg parasitoid <span>Hadronotus pennsylvanicus</span> (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) is a potential biological control agent of the pistachio pest <span>Leptoglossus zonatus</span> (Dallas) (Heteroptera: Coreidae). While <span>H. pennsylvanicus</span> is known to attack <span>L. zonatus</span> eggs in California, USA, parasitism rates in orchards are highly variable. Floral resource provisioning has the potential to enhance parasitoid longevity and thus improve parasitism rates, leading to reduced pest densities. Here, a combination of field and laboratory studies was used to assess the influence of flowering groundcovers on the reproductive fitness of <span>H. pennsylvanicus</span> and the abundance of <span>L. zonatus</span>. Evaluated groundcovers included oat (<span>Avena sativa</span> L.), cowpea (<span>Vigna unguiculata</span> L.), white mustard (<span>Sinapis alba</span> L.), and buckwheat (<span>Fagopyrum esculentum</span> Moench). Under laboratory conditions, buckwheat and mustard provided the greatest benefit to female <span>H. pennsylvanicus</span> longevity. However, females provided a buckwheat diet produced the greatest number of offspring over the course of their lifetime. In field trials, flowering groundcovers did not influence the abundance of <span>H. pennsylvanicus</span> nor parasitism rates on <span>L. zonatus</span>. While the availability of floral resources can improve the reproductive fitness of <span>H. pennsylvanicus</span>, the use of groundcovers in pistachio did not enhance biological control of <span>L. zonatus</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"9559eb2040a1444fb4a983a9f909ce5b92cd965d210b236400645fc6d5ddbdd1","category":"Environment"}
