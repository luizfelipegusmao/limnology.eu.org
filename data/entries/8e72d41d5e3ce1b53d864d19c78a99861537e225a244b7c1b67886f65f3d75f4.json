{"title":"A Novel Geothermal Wellbore Model Based on the Drift-Flux Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0357/v1","date":1720069332000,"content":"Geothermal energy, being a clean energy source, has immense potential, and accurate wellbore modeling is crucial for optimizing the drilling process and ensuring safety. This paper presents a novel geothermal wellbore model based on the drift-flux approach, tested under three different temperature and pressure well conditions. The proposed model integrates the conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy, incorporating the gas-liquid two-phase flow drift-flux model and heat transfer model. Key features include handling heat transfer between the for-mation and the wellbore, addressing the slip relationship between gas and liquid phases, and accounting for wellbore friction. The nonlinear equations are discretized using the finite differ-ence method, and the highly nonlinear system is solved using the Newton-Raphson method. Numerical simulation, validation, and comparison with existing models demonstrate the en-hanced accuracy of this model. In our tests, the model achieved high accuracy in calculating bottom hole pressure and temperature, with Mean Relative Errors (MRE) significantly lower than those of other models. These results offer valuable insights for optimizing drilling parameters and ensuring drilling safety. Comparisons indicate that this approach significantly outperforms others in capturing the complex dynamics of geothermal wellbores, making it a superior tool for geo-thermal energy development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e72d41d5e3ce1b53d864d19c78a99861537e225a244b7c1b67886f65f3d75f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
