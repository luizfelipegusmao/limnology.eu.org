It has long been thought that wild dogs are limited by dominant competitors like lions, and not by the availability of prey. Using an integrated population model fit to long-term data from monitoring of known individuals, new research shows that the loss of prey due to human activities has begun to limit the survival, reproduction and population dynamics of wild dogs. Article: An integrated population model reveals source-sink dynamics for competitively subordinate African wild dogs linked to anthropogenic prey depletion.
