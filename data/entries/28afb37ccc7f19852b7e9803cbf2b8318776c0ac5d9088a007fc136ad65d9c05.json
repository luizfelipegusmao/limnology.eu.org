{"title":"Fueling the Heart: What Are the Optimal Dietary Strategies in Heart Failure?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0308/v1","date":1722851478000,"content":"Heart failure (HF) is a global health concern with rising incidence and poor prognosis. While the essential role of nutritional and dietary strategies in HF patients is acknowledged in the existing scientific guidelines and clinical practice, there are no comprehensive nutritional recommendations for optimal dietary management of HF. In this review, we discuss results from recent studies on the obesity paradox and the effects of calorie restriction and weight loss, intermittent fasting, the Western diet, the Mediterranean diet, the ketogenic diet, and the DASH diet on HF progression. Many of these strategies remain under clinical and basic investigation for their safety and efficacy, and there is considerable heterogeneity in the observed response, presumably because of heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of different types of HF. In addition, while specific aspects of cardiac metabolism, such as changes in ketone body utilization, might underlie the effects of certain dietary strategies on the heart, there is a critical divide between supplement strategies (i.e. with ketones) and dietary strategies that impact ketogenesis. This review aims to highlight this gap by exploring emerging evidence supporting the importance of personalized dietary strategies to prevent progression and improve outcomes in the context of HF.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"28afb37ccc7f19852b7e9803cbf2b8318776c0ac5d9088a007fc136ad65d9c05","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
