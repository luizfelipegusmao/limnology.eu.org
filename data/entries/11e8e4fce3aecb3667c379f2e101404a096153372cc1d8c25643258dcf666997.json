{"title":"Industrial Environmental Impact Assessment Method Based on Detection of Complex Anomalies in Time Series","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2117/v1","date":1721982202000,"content":"In order to reduce the environmental impact of energy enterprises, it is important to promptly identify cases of possible changes in the quality of wastewater generated at power plants, that is cases of exceeding the maximum permissible concentrations of pollutants in wastewater. The goal of the method for detecting complex anomalies in multidimensional time series obtained from smart energy stationâ€™s sensor channels is to increase the accuracy of detecting pollution levels in industrial wastewater. To achieve this goal, the following tasks were solved: methods for detecting time series anomalies were analyzed, the method for detecting complex anomalies was developed, software implementation of the algorithm was carried out and experiments were conducted. The developed method is proposed to be used in an smart energy monitoring system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"11e8e4fce3aecb3667c379f2e101404a096153372cc1d8c25643258dcf666997","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
