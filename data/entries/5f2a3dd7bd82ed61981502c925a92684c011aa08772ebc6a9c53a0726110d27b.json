{"title":"Personalized Hydration Strategy Improved Fluid Balance and Intermittent Exercise Performance In The Heat","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0142/v1","date":1712042800000,"content":"Sweat rate and electrolyte losses have a large inter-individual variability, a personalized approach to hydration can overcome this issue to meet an individual’s needs. This study aimed to investigate the effects of personalized hydration strategy (PHS) on fluid balance and intermittent exercise performance. Twelve participants conducted 11 laboratory visits including a VO2max test and two 5-day trial arms under normothermic (NOR) or hyperthermic (HYP) environmental conditions. Each arm began with 3-day of familiarization exercise following by two random exercise trials with a either PHS or control (CON). Then, participants crossed-over to the second arm for: NOR+PHS, NOR+CON, HYP+PHS, and HYP+CON. The PHS was prescribed according to participants’ fluid and sweat sodium losses. CON drank ad-libitum of commercially-available electrolyte solution. Exercise trials consisted of two phases: 1) 45min constant workload; 2) high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIT) until exhaustion. PHS had a significantly greater fluid intake compared to CON. HYP+CON produced the lowest sweat sodium concentration. HYP+PHS had a lower thirst perception and a longer HIIT compared to HYP+CON. Thus, PHS reinforces fluid intake and successfully optimizes hydration status, regardless of environmental conditions. PHS may be or is an important factor to preventing negative physiological consequences during high-intensity exercise in the heat.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f2a3dd7bd82ed61981502c925a92684c011aa08772ebc6a9c53a0726110d27b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
