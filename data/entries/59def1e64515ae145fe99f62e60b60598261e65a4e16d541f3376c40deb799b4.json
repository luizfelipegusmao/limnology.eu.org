In marine fishes and invertebrates, reproductive adults and planktonic larvae are generally more sensitive to environmental variability than older, non-reproductive adults. Further, the transport of larvae in ocean currents may also be strongly ENSO dependent. The interactions between the dynamics of larval survivorship and larval transport could lead to population bottlenecks as stronger ENSO events become more common. We tested the predictions of this hypothesis around the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) by constructing a correlation matrix of physical and biological time series variables that spanned 11 years (2007–2017) and multiple ENSO events. Our correlation matrix included four types of variables: i. published ENSO indices, ii. satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll variables, iii. abundance and diversity of larval fishes sampled during the late winter spawning season off Oahu, and iv. abundance and diversity of coral reef fish recruits sampled on the western shore of the Big Island of Hawaii. We found that the abundance and diversity of larval fishes was negatively correlated with the Multivariate El Niño Index (MEI), and that larval variables were positively correlated with measures of fall recruitment (September &amp; November), but not correlated with spring-summer recruitment (May &amp; July). In the MHI, SST variables were not correlated with the MEI, but two successive El Niño events of 2014–15 and 2015–2016 were characterized by SST maxima approaching 30°C. Two large pulses of benthic recruitment occurred in the 2009 and 2014 recruitment seasons, with &gt; 8000 recruits observed by divers over the summer and fall months. Both events were characterized by either neutral or negative MEI indices measured during the preceding winter months. These patterns suggest that La Niña and the neutral phases of the ENSO cycle are generally favorable for adult reproduction and larval development in the spring and summer, while El Niño phases may limit recruitment in the late summer and fall. We hypothesize that episodic recruitment during non-El Niño phases is related to favorable survivorship and transport dynamics that are associated with the formation of pairs of anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies on the leeward sides (western shores) of the Main Hawaiian Islands.","author":"David B.
