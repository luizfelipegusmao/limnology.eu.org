Hence, there is a need to devise sustainable feed additives with nutraceutical value. Marine macroalgae containing natural polysaccharides have drawn attention because of their significant bioactivities. Sulphated polysaccharide is a polysaccharide containing sulphate group in sugar unit, characterized as a potential bioactive component in fish feed. These are non-digestible feed constituents and facilitate the host in multiple ways by rousing the growth and immune responses and developing a defence against harmful microorganisms and physical stressors. In aquaculture practice, marine macroalgae-derived sulphated polysaccharides are considered prebiotic substances that regulate host organisms' growth and health status. This study overviews marine macroalgae-derived sulphated polysaccharides' sources, structure, and modes of action in aquatic animals. Furthermore, the present review underscores the potential applications of marine macroalgae-derived sulphated polysaccharides in aquaculture to improve the knowledge for additional headway in this field of research. Although the effects of sulphated polysaccharides in aquatic animals have been investigated, further exploration of the mechanisms of sulphated polysaccharides on the health status of aquatic animals is required, which may open a new window during sustainable disease and growth management in the aquaculture industry.</p>","author":"Md.
