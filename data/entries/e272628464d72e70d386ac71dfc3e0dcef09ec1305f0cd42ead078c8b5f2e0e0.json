{"title":"3-Dimensional Soft Tissue Analysis (3DSTA) of Subcrestally Placed Implants: Relating Biologic Stability with Morphologic Achievements.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1116/v1","date":1713347428000,"content":"Objectives (Purpose) This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of the Subcrestally Placed Implant (SPI) technique in single molar cases, focusing on biological stability and aesthetics. It proposes a schematic model to elucidate the interplay between the biological stability of soft tissues and bone around the SPI and the morphological requisites that Implant Abutment Prostheses (IAP) must fulfill to effectively replace natural teeth. Materials and methods I examined 20 cases using the SPI technique with Internal Platform Switching (IPS) design implants for single molar replacements to assess their stability. Routine check-ups utilized plain panoramic X-rays to measure changes in crestal bone on the mesial and distal sides. Additionally, 10 cases with CBCT X-rays taken more than one year after the initial surgery underwent a novel 3-dimensional soft tissue analysis (3DSTA). Measurements included placement depths (PD), soft tissue thickness (STT) at central (cPD, cSTT) and peripheral areas (pPD, pSTT), the length of the Transitional Zone (TZ) on mesial, distal, facial, and lingual aspects, and crestal bone thickness (CBT) at buccal and lingual sites. Results Panoramic analyses showed minimal changes in crestal bone (mean changes of pPD were less than 0.1 mm) over an average period of 3.3 years. Average measurements were as follows: cPD was 1.7 mm, pPD was 2.7 mm, cSTT was 0.2 mm, pSTT was 0.6 mm, TZ length was 3.8 mm, buccal CBT was 3.0 mm, and lingual CBT was 3.7 mm. Conclusions CBCT analyses of the topographical relationships between soft tissue and crestal bone with IAP for SPIs demonstrated stable results over an average 3-year period. The consistency in the relationship between crestal bone and surrounding soft tissue can be ascribed to biological structural integrity. The study classified peri-implant soft tissues into subcrestal and supracrestal (transitional zone â€“ TZ) segments, exploring their characteristics through dimensional measurements and assessing mechanical resistance. Further histological study is needed to identify specific features of each segment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e272628464d72e70d386ac71dfc3e0dcef09ec1305f0cd42ead078c8b5f2e0e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
