{"title":"Exploring the causes underlying the latitudinal variation in range sizes: Evidence for Rapoport’s rule in spiny lizards (genus <i>Sceloporus</i>)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306832","date":1720533600000,"content":"<p>by Kevin López-Reyes, Carlos Yáñez-Arenas, Fabricio Villalobos</p>\r\n\r\nSpecies’ range size is a fundamental unit of analysis in biodiversity research, given its association with extinction risk and species richness. One of its most notable patterns is its positive relationship with latitude, which has been considered an ecogeographical rule called Rapoport’s rule. Despite this rule being confirmed for various taxonomic groups, its validity has been widely discussed and several taxa still lack a formal assessment. Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain their potential mechanisms, with those related to temperature and elevational being the most supported thus far. In this study, we employed two level of analyses (cross-species and assemblage) to investigate the validity of Rapoport’s rule in spiny lizards (genus <i>Sceloporus</i>). Additionally, we evaluated four environmental-related hypotheses (minimum temperature, temperature variability, temperature stability since the last glacial maximum, and elevation) posed to explain such pattern, contrasting our results to those patterns expected under a null model of range position. Our results provided support for Rapoport’s rule at both levels of analyses, contrasting with null expectations. Consistently, minimum temperature and elevation were the most relevant variables explaining the spatial variation in range size. At the cross-species level, our null simulations revealed that both variables deviated significantly from random expectations. Conversely, at the assemblage level, none of the variables were statistically different from the expected relationships. We discussed the implication of our findings in relation to the ecology and evolution of spiny lizards.","author":"Kevin López-Reyes","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"64b885e025410f933e1b2c105f3db5a30e3d701a3a03189326a88393e949308e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
