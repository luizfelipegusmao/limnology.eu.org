Epithelial barrier function, homeostasis of luminal fluid, and mucociliary clearance are major components of mucosal defense mechanisms. The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is one of the key players in controlling airway fluid volume and composition, and characteristic cytokines cause ENaC and barrier dysfunctions following pulmonary infections or allergic reactions. Given the limited understanding of the requisite duration and magnitude of cytokines to affect ENaC and barrier function, available treatment options for restoring normal ENaC activity are limited. Previous studies have demonstrated that distinct amino acids can modulate epithelial ion channel activities and barrier function in intestines and airways. Here, we have investigated the time- and concentration-dependent effect of representative cytokines for Th1- (IFN-γ and TNF-α), Th2- (IL-4 and IL-13), and Treg-mediated (TGF-β1) immune responses on ENaC activity and barrier function in human bronchial epithelial cells. When cells were exposed to Th1 and Treg cytokines, ENaC activity decreased gradually while barrier function remained largely unaffected. In contrast, Th2 cytokines had an immediate and profound inhibitory effect on ENaC activity that was subsequently followed by epithelial barrier disruption. These functional changes were associated with decreased membrane protein expression of α-, β-, and γ-ENaC, and decreased mRNA levels of β- and γ-ENaC. A proprietary blend of amino acids was developed based on their ability to prevent Th2 cytokine-induced ENaC dysfunction. Exposure to the select amino acids reversed the inhibitory effect of IL-13 on ENaC activity by increasing mRNA levels of β- and γ-ENaC, and protein expression of γ-ENaC. This study indicates the beneficial effect of select amino acids on ENaC activity in an <i>in vitro</i> setting of Th2-mediated inflammation suggesting these amino acids as a novel therapeutic approach for correcting this condition.","author":"Anusree Sasidharan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0879018c9effa17955d21a6729599112222601f3ff5dcce1e0a28283cc1edddf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
