{"title":"Upgrading Sustainable Pipeline Monitoring with Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0044/v1","date":1725271459000,"content":"This study presents the design and implementation of a piezoelectric power harvesting device to capture vibrational strength from pipelines to autonomous strength IoT devices. The gadget utilizes key components along with the PPA-1001 piezoelectric sensor, STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller, and LTC-3588 energy harvesting strength delivery. Experimental results verified the gadget's performance in harvesting strength within a specific frequency variety of 10 Hz to 50 Hz, with the foremost overall performance at 30 Hz. The device generated the highest voltage of 3.3V, delivering a strength output of 2.18 mW, which is sufficient to power low-strength electronic gadgets. The device maintained solid performance across a temperature range of 20°C to 35°C, underscoring its robustness in various environmental situations. The findings highlight the capacity of this generation to offer a sustainable power source for far-off pipeline tracking, contributing to stronger protection and operational efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d629234f598747d6d7ad93ed0a4104450c154ccb8dc64f42fb204929b13c9d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
