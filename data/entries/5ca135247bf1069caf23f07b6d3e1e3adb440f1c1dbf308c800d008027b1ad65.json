To explore spatiotemporal characteristics of traffic flow in depth, this study proposes the MFSTBiSGAT model. The MFSTBiSGAT model leverages graph attention networks to extract dynamic spatial features from complex road networks, and utilizes bidirectional long short-term memory networks to capture temporal correlations from both past and future time perspectives. Additionally, spatial and temporal information enhancement layers are employed to comprehensively capture traffic flow patterns. The model aims to directly extract original temporal features from traffic flow data, and utilizes the Spearman function to extract hidden spatial matrices of road networks for deeper insights into spatiotemporal characteristics. Historical traffic speed and lane occupancy data are integrated into the prediction model to reduce forecasting errors and enhance robustness. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that MFSTBiSGAT successfully extracts and captures spatiotemporal correlations in traffic networks, significantly improving prediction accuracy.","author":"Deqi Huang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5ca135247bf1069caf23f07b6d3e1e3adb440f1c1dbf308c800d008027b1ad65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
