{"title":"Preventive Functions of Hemp-Derived Biomaterials Against Periodontal Deterioration Caused by Fine Dust","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0752/v1","date":1718138242000,"content":"Although fine dust can cause various disorders, including cardiovascular, neurological, renal, reproductive, motor, systemic, respiratory, and cancerous diseases, there are not enough research for an oral disease. In this study we used various methods, including quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, ELISA, and Alizarin O staining, to reveal the preventive effects of hemp-derived biomaterials in periodontal cells against fine dust. In this study, the two biomaterials (MSE; mature hemp stem extract and IE; induced exosomes derived from gingival cells exposed to MSE) revealed three main biological functions against fine dust. First, two materials suppressed the levels of inflammatory genes and activated anti-inflammatory genes in gingival cells. Second, these materials activated differentiation to osteoblast, periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) and pulp progenitor cells (PPCs) from periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). Third, IE and MSE activated upregulation of LL-37 and down-regulation of MCP-1 in gingival cells and PDLSCs, respectively. Consequently, MSE and IE showed potential as a functional biomaterial in various fields, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and foods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cfbd05eb1412ed06c0999696d9d5771d7312de6e08df23662a6d8f73faab8fb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
