{"title":"Response of Deficit Irrigation and Growth Regulators on Physiological and Biochemical Parameters of Pomegranate (Punica granatum) Grown in Shallow Basaltic Soils","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1280/v1","date":1713519392000,"content":"Plant growth regulators (PGRs) and deficit irrigation (DI) play a crucial strategic role in sustaining agricultural yield and reducing water stress in drought prone areas. The study was carried out in 2021-2022 to assess the impact of various PGRs (SA &amp; NAA) &amp; irrigation levels (60% Epan, 80 % Epan, and 100 % Epan) with DI &amp; partial root drying (PRD) irrigation strategies. PGR application boosted fruit yields and demonstrated its significance in reducing water stress by  lowering canopy temperature, maintaining higher relative water content in the leaves, modifying stomatal opening, and increasing photosynthetic rate. PGRs were used to assess the increased accumulation of total phenols, flavonoids, and improved antioxidant activity. Results indicated that exogenous use of PGRs like SA+NAA in conjunction with 80% irrigation levels increased fruit yield (31.97 and 40.38%) and water productivity (64.92 and 75.39%) for DI and PRD treatments, respectively. Thus standardizing irrigation and crop management practices including PGR application can be recommended to boost pomegranate productivity particularly in water-scarce environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a01bda854a0872c47bd8c2976b2a492c5d89b76db0f399f7a9656afd91f7e07","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
