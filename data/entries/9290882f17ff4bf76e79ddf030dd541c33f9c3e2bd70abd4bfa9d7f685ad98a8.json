{"title":"Superoxide signalling and antioxidant processing in the plant nucleus","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/15/4599/7625012?rss=1","date":1709942400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The superoxide anion radical (O<sub>2</sub>·<sup>−</sup>) is a one-electron reduction product of molecular oxygen. Compared with other forms of reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide has limited reactivity. Nevertheless, superoxide reacts with nitric oxide, ascorbate, and the iron moieties of [Fe–S] cluster-containing proteins. Superoxide has largely been neglected as a signalling molecule in the plant literature in favour of the most stable ROS form, hydrogen peroxide. However, superoxide can accumulate in plant cells, particularly in meristems, where superoxide dismutase activity and ascorbate accumulation are limited (or absent), or when superoxide is generated within the lipid environment of membranes. Moreover, oxidation of the nucleus in response to environmental stresses is a widespread phenomenon. Superoxide is generated in many intracellular compartments including mitochondria, chloroplasts, and on the apoplastic/cell wall face of the plasma membrane. However, nuclear superoxide production and functions remain poorly documented in plants. Accumulating evidence suggests that the nuclear pools of antioxidants such as glutathione are discrete and separate from the cytosolic pools, allowing compartment-specific signalling in the nucleus. We consider the potential mechanisms of superoxide generation and targets in the nucleus, together with the importance of antioxidant processing in regulating superoxide signalling.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"9290882f17ff4bf76e79ddf030dd541c33f9c3e2bd70abd4bfa9d7f685ad98a8","category":"Environment"}
