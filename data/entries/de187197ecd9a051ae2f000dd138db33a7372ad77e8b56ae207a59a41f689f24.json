Identified foulers include macroalgae and tunicates. Photographs of unfouled specimens and preserved juveniles have also been inspected. Macrofouling is not universal in this species; unfouled fish were observed around the strongly tidal British Isles, whereas the worst-fouled topknots were seen in the eutrophic, microtidal northern Adriatic.</p>","author":"John Davenport, \nAgnès Dettaï, \nBruno Chanet","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"de187197ecd9a051ae2f000dd138db33a7372ad77e8b56ae207a59a41f689f24","category":"Environment"}
