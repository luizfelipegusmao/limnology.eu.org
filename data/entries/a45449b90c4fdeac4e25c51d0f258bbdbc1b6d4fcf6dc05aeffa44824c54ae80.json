{"title":"Challenges and Obstacles in the Use of Search and Rescue Dogs During Disaster Operations: A Case Study of the Earthquake in Turkey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1177/v1","date":1721100927000,"content":"Deploying search and rescue (SAR) dogs in disaster situations is crucial for effective rescue missions. This study delves into the challenges and obstacles encountered during the use of SAR dogs, particularly focusing on the earthquake that hit Turkey in February 2023. By employing a case study approach, the research explores various factors that impact the efficiency and safety of SAR dog operations, such as environmental conditions, equipment needs, cultural perceptions, and logistical hurdles. Environmental conditions such as extreme weather, hazardous materials, and unstable structures present significant risks to both the dogs and their handlers. The adequacy of equipment, including protective gear and medical supplies, is critical for ensuring the safety and efficiency of rescue operations. Logistical challenges, including the transportation and care of dogs in disaster zones, further complicate their deployment. Cultural barriers also play a crucial role, as perceptions of dogs vary widely across different communities, potentially affecting the acceptance and integration of canine units in rescue efforts. The case study of the earthquake in Turkey highlights these issues, showcasing the successes and setbacks experienced by international rescue teams. The findings indicate that although SAR dogs are invaluable in locating survivors, they face significant dangers, including hazardous materials, extreme weather, and physical injuries. Additionally, cultural differences and logistical issues complicate their deployment. This paper highlights the necessity for improved training, protective measures, and international standards to ensure SAR dogs' well-being and effectiveness in disaster response efforts. The study's implications suggest that addressing these challenges can markedly enhance the preparedness and resilience of SAR teams, leading to more efficient and safer rescue operations in future disaster scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a45449b90c4fdeac4e25c51d0f258bbdbc1b6d4fcf6dc05aeffa44824c54ae80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
