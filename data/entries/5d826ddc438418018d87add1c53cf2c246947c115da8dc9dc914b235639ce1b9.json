{"title":"Spectral-Based Fault Diagnosis Methodology for Industrial Shot Blast Machinery Leveraging XGBoost and Feature Importance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0942/v1","date":1723547148000,"content":"The optimal functionality and dependability of mechanical systems are important for the sustained productivity and operational reliability of industrial machinery which has direct impact on itâ€™s longevity and profitability. Therefore, failure of a mechanical system or any of it component would be detrimental to production continuity and availability. Consequently,this study proposes a robust diagnostic framework for analyzing the blade conditions of shot blast industrial machinery. The framework involves analyzing the spectral characteristics of the vibration signals generated by Industrial Shot Blast. Additionally, a peak detection algorithms is introduced to identify and extract the unique features present in the peak magnitudes of each signal spectrum. A feature importance algorithm is then deployed as the feature selection tool, and these selected features are fed into 10 machine learning classifier, with Extreme gradient boosting (XGB) as the core classifier. Results show that the XGB classifier achieved the best accuracy of 98.05%, with a cost-efficient computational cost of 0.83 seconds. Other global assessment metrics were also implemented in the study to further validate the model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d826ddc438418018d87add1c53cf2c246947c115da8dc9dc914b235639ce1b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
