{"title":"Association between HTLV-1/2 infection and COVID-19 severity in a migrant Shipibo-Konibo population in Lima, Peru","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003442","date":1720620000000,"content":"<p>by Fátima Avila Dextre, Bryan Morales Álvarez, Paulo Aguirre Castañeda, Isaac Efrain Alva, Giovanni López, Alvaro Schwalb, Eduardo Gotuzzo</p>\r\nObjectives <p>The migrant community of the Shipibo-Konibo indigenous people in Lima, Peru were extremely vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/2) is endemic in this population causing immunosuppression. The aim of the study was to describe the association between HTLV-1/2 infection and the clinical severity of COVID-19.</p> Methods <p>This was a cross-sectional descriptive study involving a survey of adult Shipibo-Konibo indigenous migrants residing in Cantagallo-Rímac who were identified as suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Blood samples were collected for SARS-CoV-2 antibody and HTLV-1/2 ELISA testing. A confirmatory Western Blot test was performed for those with a positive ELISA test.</p> Results <p>A total of 182 individuals were surveyed and sampled. No significant association was found between HTLV-1/2 infection and the clinical severity of COVID-19. The prevalence of HTLV-1/2 was 8.8% (95%CI: 5.0–14.1) with Western Blot. Age was the only statistically significant risk factor for developing a more severe form of COVID-19 (OR: 1.03; 95%CI: 1.00–1.06; p = 0.032).</p> Conclusions <p>There was no association found between HTLV-1/2 infection and the clinical severity of COVID-19. The prevalence of HTLV-1/2 infection in the Shipibo-Konibo population is high and warrants continuous monitoring in the advent of other infectious disease outbreaks and the development of HTLV-associated comorbidities.</p>","author":"Fátima Avila Dextre","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"c0b2492de8a04b5a565c536da5497afb8dc76a0720385485f164ba4b71833b9b","category":"Environment"}
