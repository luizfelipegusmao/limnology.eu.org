Starting at the end of the last century, Angela M. Gurnell has made a major contribution to fluvial geomorphology by considering water flow and sediment transport in combinaton with riparian and later also aquatic vegetation and thus significantly promoting the fluvial biogeomorphological approach from its early days until today. The objective of the present paper is to present a set of studies and results obtained over the last 20 years mainly by the authors and many collaborators, including Angela M. Gurnell, on a panel of French rivers: the Tech, Garonne, Isère and Allier. In particular, feedback mechanisms between fluvial morphodynamics and riparian vegetation dynamics were investigated directly in the field and by using high-resolution remote sensor systems at the scale of individual plants, populations, communities and landscapes as well as during semi-controlled ex-situ experiments at the scale of individual plants. Collectively, the authors' research conducted over the past 20 years has helped to elucidate some key aspects of the feedback dynamics between the lowest and highest levels of the riparian ecosystem organization. This article reviews and discusses those key aspects. The gradually obtained results have contributed to a better understanding and quantification of feedback between river morphodynamics and vegetation at nested spatiotemporal scales, from plant species traits to the riverine landscape. Furthermore, the biogeomorphological approach advocated for more than 20 years now has clearly facilitated the extension of the discipline of geomorphology to ecology in general and evolutionary ecology in particular and thus contributed to a more integrative vision of earth surface processes.</p>","author":"Dov Corenblit, \nJohannes Steiger","siteTitle":"Wiley: River Research and Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"dd8f8dcb48cf1db6f6edba43098839a842d88bad9f088e9d186fa05ae3366ba7","entryHash":"a72527196212a1d9dfbef909a1993c93bd23a7cb7882af843718488950db5dc7","category":"Environment"}
