{"title":"A Joint Limit Theorem for Epstein and Hurwitz Zeta-Functions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0265/v1","date":1717635273000,"content":"In the paper, we prove a joint limit theorem in terms of weak convergence of probability measures on $\\mathbb{C}^2$ defined by means of the Epstein ζ(s;Q) and Hurwitz ζ(s,α) zeta-functions. The limit measure in the theorem is explicitly given. For this, some restrictions on the matrix Q and parameter α are required. The theorem obtained extends and generalizes Bohr-Jessen’s results characterising asymptotic behaviour of the Riemann zeta-function.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d4eeb5107390d87c41b60a2a2138268042624bace498c29b281abad52cc3245","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
