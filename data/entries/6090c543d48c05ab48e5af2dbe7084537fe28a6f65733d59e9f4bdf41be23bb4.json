{"title":"Effects of soy protein isolate interaction with brown rice starch on the multiscale structure of brown rice bread","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13861?af=R","date":1725444628000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Gluten-free bread (GFB) has technical bottlenecks such as hard texture, rough taste and low nutrition in practical production. In order to solve these problems, this study used germinated brown rice starch as the main raw material, and investigated the effects of soybean isolate protein (SPI) on the multiscale structure of germinated brown rice starch and bread quality.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>A gluten-free rice bread process simulation system was established, and the interaction between SPI and starch in the simulation system was characterized. The result shows that the interaction forces between SPI and germinated brown rice starch were mainly represented by hydrogen bonds, and with the addition of SPI, the crystallinity of starch showed a downward trend. At the same time, when the amount of SPI was 3%, the appearance quality was the best and the specific volume of bread was 1.08 mL g<sup>−1</sup>. When the amount of SPI was 6%, the texture quality was the best. Compared with the bread without SPI, the hardness of the bread with 6% SPI was reduced by 0.13 times, the springiness was increased by 0.03 times, the color was the most vibrant, the <i>L*</i> value being 1.02 times the original, and the baking loss was reduced to 0.98 times the original.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>The interaction force between SPI and germinated brown rice starch and its effect on bread quality were clarified, and these results inform choices about providing a theoretical basis for the subsequent development of higher-quality GFB. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yuan‐yuan Wang, \nYang Yang, \nXin Bian, \nChun‐min Ma, \nLi‐kun Ren, \nYu Fu, \nBao‐xiang Liu, \nJia‐ning Fu, \nYan‐guo Shi, \nNa Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"6090c543d48c05ab48e5af2dbe7084537fe28a6f65733d59e9f4bdf41be23bb4","category":"Environment"}
