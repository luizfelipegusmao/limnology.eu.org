{"title":"Advanced Delivery of Curcumin and Nicotinamide: Promising Solutions for Skin Infections and Melanoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1541/v2","date":1727070242000,"content":"Abstract The interest in natural remedies in modern medicine has revealed potent disease-fighting agents, such asCUR(CUR) and nicotinamide (NIC), known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-boosting properties. This study explores the antibacterial and antimelanoma potential of a CUR-NIC combination and its liposomal formulation. The antibacterial efficacy was assessed against skin infection-causing bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, while cytotoxicity and migration assays were conducted on the melanoma B16 cancer cell line. The CUR-NIC combination (1:1) demonstrated an inhibition zone of 18±0.8 mm against S. aureus and a MIC of 31.25 µg/ml, outperforming CUR alone. Whereas Lip-CUR-NIC showed an inhibition zone of 12±0.8 mm against S. aureus and a MIC of 37.5 µg/ml. Notably, the cytotoxicity assay revealed that the CUR-NIC duo synergistically inhibited melanoma cell proliferation (CI&lt;1). Liposomal preparations further enhanced this effect, with Lip-CUR-NIC showing a remarkably low IC50 of 8.5 ± 0.3 µM compared to CUR (IC50= 9.8 ± 2.2 µM) and NIC (IC50=135.95 ± 10.2 µM). These findings highlight the synergistic potential of CUR and NIC, especially in their liposomal form, offering a promising strategy for more effective cancer treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1fe5a7d9c587ab3210d5d4a67cb7a2ba235e2b8619885ca4d307f89961c377c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
