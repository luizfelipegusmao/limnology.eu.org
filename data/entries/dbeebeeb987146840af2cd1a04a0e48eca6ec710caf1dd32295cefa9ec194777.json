{"title":"Cytomegalovirus DNA Loads in Organs of Congenitally Infected Fetus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0010/v1","date":1711958294000,"content":"Abstract: Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection poses significant risks to fetal development, particularly affecting the nervous system. This study reports a fetal autopsy case, examining cCMV infection and focusing on CMV DNA measurements in various fetal organs before formalin fixation, a novel approach for comprehensive CMV DNA evaluations in fetal organs affected by cCMV. A 20-week-old male fetus was diagnosed with cCMV following the detection of CMV DNA in ascites obtained via abdominocentesis in utero. After termination of pregnancy, multiple organs of the fetus, including the cerebrum, thyroid gland, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands, were extracted and examined for CMV DNA loads using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Histopathological examination involved hematoxylin-eosin and CMV-specific immunostaining. A correlation was found between CMV DNA loads and pathology, with higher CMV-infected cell numbers observed in organs positively identified with both staining methods, exhibiting CMV DNA levels of ≥1.0 × 104 copies/mL, compared to those detected solely by CMV-specific immunostaining, where CMV DNA levels ranged from 1.0 x 103 to 1.0 x 104 copies/mL. These results highlight a quantifiable relationship between organ infection extent and CMV DNA concentration, providing insights into cCMV pathogenesis and potentially informing future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for cCMV infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbeebeeb987146840af2cd1a04a0e48eca6ec710caf1dd32295cefa9ec194777","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
