{"title":"CO-EXPRESSED WITH PSI ASSEMBLY1 (CEPA1) is a photosystem I assembly factor in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4179/7612215?rss=1","date":1708473600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Photosystem I (PSI) forms a large macromolecular complex of ∼580 kDa that resides in the thylakoid membrane and mediates photosynthetic electron transfer. PSI is composed of 18 protein subunits and nearly 200 co-factors. The assembly of the complex in thylakoid membranes requires high spatial and temporal coordination, and is critically dependent on a sophisticated assembly machinery. Here, we report and characterize CO-EXPRESSED WITH PSI ASSEMBLY1 (CEPA1), a PSI assembly factor in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). The <span>CEPA1</span> gene was identified bioinformatically as being co-expressed with known PSI assembly factors. Disruption of the <span>CEPA1</span> gene leads to a pale phenotype and retarded plant development but does not entirely abolish photoautotrophy. Biophysical and biochemical analyses revealed that the phenotype is caused by a specific defect in PSI accumulation. We further show that CEPA1 acts at the post-translational level and co-localizes with PSI in nonappressed thylakoid membranes. In native gels, CEPA1 co-migrates with thylakoid protein complexes, including putative PSI assembly intermediates. Finally, protein–protein interaction assays suggest cooperation of CEPA1 with the PSI assembly factor PHOTOSYSTEM I ASSEMBLY3 (PSA3). Together, our data support an important but nonessential role of CEPA1 in PSI assembly.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"778dd5f4c392cf690b9150813da85af6989fed1f022af0b919d04e11d740051f","category":"Environment"}
