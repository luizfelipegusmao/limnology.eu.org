This property has an essential role in soil functions and processes, which includes water flow dynamics, oxygen and gas exchange, redox conditions, and carbon and nutrient cycling. Soil aggregates are three-dimensional structures that form when soil mineral particles are bound to organic material from plants and microorganisms through physicochemical and biological processes. Soil aggregates are the building blocks of soil structure and vary in size ranging from nanosize organo-mineral associations to microaggregates (&lt; 250 µm) and macroaggregates (&gt; 250 µm). They coexist in a hierarchical organization, creating a network of connected pores and dead voids surrounded by minerals and organic matter.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1414533d54fc3329f1364a7549563a3dae8dff767d4d2ef87769893219fba3ee","category":"Environment"}
