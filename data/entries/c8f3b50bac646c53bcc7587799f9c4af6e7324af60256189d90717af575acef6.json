{"title":"IoT and Fuzzy Logic Integration to Prevent Hazards in Tehran&rsquo;s Utilities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1166/v1","date":1724151263000,"content":"It is not plausible to predict disasters; however, still the least that may be done is to get ready for that. In disaster circumstances, nowadays, the existing internet of things (IoT) technology is rather developed and capable of being highly beneficial. For many countries, the early warning system for natural catastrophes is a crucial challenge, especially for high seismic hazard countries. Primary function of an early warning system is to assist individuals and authorities to save lives and reduce secondary damage once a disaster occurs. Even though such systems have been defined for the earthquake on the basis of IoT, the least attention has been focused on the post decisions for substructure monitoring systems which can control the gas and electric lifelines given the critical time. Combination of Fuzzy system with IoT can improve the decision making process after the disasters occur. This program minimizes costs and destruction in cities. Tehran is a high seismic hazard area which contains an expanded network of the gas transmission system. Hence, a major seismic event may cause serious loss directly and indirectly owing to the damage to the gas and electric transmission network. The proposed early warning system contains a grid of strong ground motion stations. Each station contains five sensors to collect accurate data and send the data to the cloud server, then the server executes relevant scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c8f3b50bac646c53bcc7587799f9c4af6e7324af60256189d90717af575acef6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
