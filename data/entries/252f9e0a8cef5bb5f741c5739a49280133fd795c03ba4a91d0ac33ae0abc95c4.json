{"title":"Clinical and Laboratory Parameters Associated with PICU Admission in Children with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2182/v1","date":1725007997000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but severe post-infectious complication of COVID-19, that often requires admission to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). The present study aimed to compare the demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics between children diagnosed with MIS-C who were admitted to the PICU or did not require PICU admission. Methods: Children diagnosed with MIS-C from September 2020 to April 2023 were included in this case-control study. Patient’s demographic, clinical and laboratory data, were collected from medical records. Results: Fifty children with MIS-C were included in the study [median (IQR) age: 7.5 (4.3, 11.4) years, 28/50 (56%) males]. Twenty-two (22/50, 44%) children required admission to the PICU. In the multivariate regression analysis, hepatic (OR:12.89, 95%CI: 1.35-123.41, p-value=0.03) and cardiological involvement (OR:34.55, 95%CI: 2.2-541.91, p-value=0.01) were significantly associated with hospitalization at the PICU. Regarding the laboratory and imaging parameters during the first 48 hours from admission, D-dimer levels higher than 4μg/mL and decreased Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction were associated with an increased risk of PICU admission (OR:7.95, 95%CI:1.48-42.78, p-value=0.02 and OR=1.28, 95%CI:1.07-1.53, p-value=0.01). Children who were admitted to the PICU were more likely to develop complications during their hospitalization (10/22, 45.5% vs. 3/28, 10.7%, p-value=0.005) and were hospitalized for more days, than children in the pediatric wards (median length of stay (IQR): 20 (15,28) days vs. 8.5 (6, 14) days, p-value&amp;lt;0.001). Conclusions: In the present study, cardiovascular, hepatic involvement and increased D-dimer levels in children with MIS-C were associated with admission to the PICU.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"252f9e0a8cef5bb5f741c5739a49280133fd795c03ba4a91d0ac33ae0abc95c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
