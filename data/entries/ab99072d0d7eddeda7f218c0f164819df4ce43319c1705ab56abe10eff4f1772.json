{"title":"Chloroplast ATP synthase: From structure to engineering","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/3974/7628887?rss=1","date":1710374400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>F-type ATP synthases are extensively researched protein complexes because of their widespread and central role in energy metabolism. Progress in structural biology, proteomics, and molecular biology has also greatly advanced our understanding of the catalytic mechanism, post-translational modifications, and biogenesis of chloroplast ATP synthases. Given their critical role in light-driven ATP generation, tailoring the activity of chloroplast ATP synthases and modeling approaches can be applied to modulate photosynthesis. In the future, advances in genetic manipulation and protein design tools will significantly expand the scope for testing new strategies in engineering light-driven nanomotors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"ab99072d0d7eddeda7f218c0f164819df4ce43319c1705ab56abe10eff4f1772","category":"Environment"}
