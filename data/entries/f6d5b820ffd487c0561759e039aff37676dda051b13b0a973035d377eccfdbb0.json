{"title":"The complex consequences of engineering oil leaf production in plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2488/7642907?rss=1","date":1712620800000,"content":"<span>Plant-derived oleochemicals are a promising sustainable substitute for fossil fuelâ€“based feedstocks for lubricants and polymers or as biofuels and food additives (<a href=\"#kiae209-B3\">Hill 2007</a>). However, compared to cellulose, the plant oil content is very low and significant increases in plant oil production are needed to meet the growing global demands. Most plants accumulate relatively high amounts of oil in seeds and fruits. However, this oil accumulation occurs only during the last third of the plant lifecycle. Thus, it has been proposed to engineer the leaves of plants to constantly produce plant oils, which could considerably increase production.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"f6d5b820ffd487c0561759e039aff37676dda051b13b0a973035d377eccfdbb0","category":"Environment"}
