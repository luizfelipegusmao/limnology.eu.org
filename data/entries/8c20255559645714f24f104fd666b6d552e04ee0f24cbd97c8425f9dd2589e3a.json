{"title":"Lymphocyte Subsets and Immunotherapy Responsiveness in Melanoma Patients: The Oncologist&rsquo;s Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1686/v1","date":1721634787000,"content":"Melanoma is the most aggressive and deadly form of skin cancer, and its incidence has been steadily increasing over the past few decades, particularly in the Caucasian population [1]. Current treatment strategies, the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors (BRAF/MEKi) in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), have changed the clinical evolution of this disease [2]. However, a significant percentage of patients do not benefit from these therapies. Therefore, to improve patient selection, it is imperative to look for novel biomarkers. Immune subsets, particularly the quantification of lymphoid populations, could contribute to the identification of ICI responders. The aim of this review is to thoroughly examine significant published data on this topic in melanoma patients and to evaluate the potential role of lymphoid subsets as prognostic and predictive response biomarkers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c20255559645714f24f104fd666b6d552e04ee0f24cbd97c8425f9dd2589e3a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
