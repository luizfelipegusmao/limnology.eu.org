{"title":"Local contribution to the somatosensory evoked potentials in rat’s thalamus","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301713","date":1712671200000,"content":"<p>by Władysław Średniawa, Zuzanna Borzymowska, Kacper Kondrakiewicz, Paweł Jurgielewicz, Bartosz Mindur, Paweł Hottowy, Daniel K. Wójcik, Ewa Kublik</p>\r\n\r\nLocal Field Potential (LFP), despite its name, often reflects remote activity. Depending on the orientation and synchrony of their sources, both oscillations and more complex waves may passively spread in brain tissue over long distances and be falsely interpreted as local activity at such distant recording sites. Here we show that the whisker-evoked potentials in the thalamic nuclei are of local origin up to around 6 ms post stimulus, but the later (7–15 ms) wave is overshadowed by a negative component reaching from cortex. This component can be analytically removed and local thalamic LFP can be recovered reliably using Current Source Density analysis. We used model-based kernel CSD (kCSD) method which allowed us to study the contribution of local and distant currents to LFP from rat thalamic nuclei and barrel cortex recorded with multiple, non-linear and non-regular multichannel probes. Importantly, we verified that concurrent recordings from the cortex are not essential for reliable thalamic CSD estimation. The proposed framework can be used to analyze LFP from other brain areas and has consequences for general LFP interpretation and analysis.","author":"Władysław Średniawa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b01dd2080dae0a10356ecb36d0695d1c63944f625ca214d9e20557f0671f19a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
