{"title":"Effects of the Spatial Distribution of Activities and Gender Issues in Travel Behavior in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0706/v1","date":1725948428000,"content":"Transport systems are essential in the path towards sustainable urbanisation and the transition to more sustainable living. Recently, European cities have undergone substantial changes, owing to which suburbanisation is posing new challenges. Suburban areas are often more affordable in terms of housing, but their neighbourhoods tend to be car-oriented. This leads to higher commuter costs, immobility, transport and time poverty, pollution, and accident rates and a lack of social interaction. To offer sustainable mobility options to citizens, we must comprehensively understand their specific mobility practices, together with their personal characteristics, and the built environment. This study centred on the Barcelona Metropolitan Region, which has a public transport network that covers the entire area. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between travel behaviour, transport mode use, individual characteristics, and place of residence, using detailed information sources. Herein, we used data from the annual travel survey conducted in the Barcelona region from 2018 to 2021, together with land-use and other information sources. Our findings suggest that transport policies have encouraged sustainable mobility practices, particularly in the centre of Barcelona. Despite the positive results, considerable disparities exist between the inner and outer city, with notably decreased sustainable mobility practices in the latter. Our results indicate that promoting sustainable mobility policies requires further changes in transport, city, and land-use planning that consider equity, the socioeconomic profile of citizens, and mixed urban planning..","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad6e87e8303b9727008eeda6ce3f2b1c49246a9b9b7081b8e8e0fca1eee40d10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
