{"title":"Non‐Native Invasive Fish Species (NIFS) in Inland Waters of India: Management Issues, Strategies and Suggestions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12747?af=R","date":1729087164000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>In India, there are 626 non-native invasive fish species (NIFS), with 16 becoming invasive in inland waters, adversely impacting native biodiversity, and fisheries by altering the abundance of NIFS in commercial catches. Scientific findings highlight that the movement of NIFS interacts with agricultural activities and the evolving environment, facilitating their spread and establishment. The scenario of NIFS invasion disrupts biological communities, ecosystem services and fisherfolk livelihoods. Despite the implementation of existed guidelines, issues related to NIFS have persisted and escalated over time scale putting increased pressure on indigenous aquatic biological resources in inland waters. This paper suggests the need of framing a new management plans, guidelines and regulatory policies to control NIFS invasions, protecting riverine fish biodiversity and ecosystem services. Proposed management strategies include functional response (FR) and adaptive response (AR)-based approaches, which are discussed to address NIFS management in inland waters.</p>","author":"Atul K.
