{"title":"Invasive Candida Infections in the NICU. Risk Factors and New Insights in Prevention","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0540/v1","date":1720497984000,"content":"Invasive Candida infections represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), with a particular impact on preterm and low birth weight neonates. In addition to prematurity, several predisposing factors for Candida colonization and dissemination during NICU hospitalization have been identified, including prolonged exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics, central venous catheters, parenteral nutrition, corticosteroids, H2 antagonist administration and poor adherence to infection control measures. According to the literature, the implementation of antifungal prophylaxis, mainly fluconazole, in high-risk populations has proven to be an effective strategy in reducing the incidence of fungal infections. This review aims to provide an overview of risk factors for Candida invasive infections and current perspectives regarding antifungal prophylaxis use. Recognition and reduction of exposure to these modifiable risk factors, in conjunction with the administration of antifungal prophylaxis, has been demonstrated to be an effective method for preventing invasive candidiasis in susceptible neonatal populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2bd2b9bb146a1273ea869a219cef2763d21f3e25612cd469b5af81f370df4b0a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
