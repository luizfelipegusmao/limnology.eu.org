{"title":"Anti-inflammatory Potential of Pygeum africanum Bark Extract: An In Vitro Study of Cytokine Release by Lipopolysaccharide-Stimulated Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0492/v1","date":1717763719000,"content":"Pygeum africanum bark has been shown to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins in the prostate and reduce the production of leukotrienes and other 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) metabolites. It has been suggested that inflammation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In clinical trials, P. africanum improved the symptoms and objective measures of BPH. This in vitro study aimed to assess the anti-inflammatory potential of a proprietary Pygeum bark standardized extract (Prunera®) on cytokine release by lipopolysaccharide-simulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs were obtained from four donors and a bead-based assay (ProcartaPlex™ panel) was used for the detection and quantitation of cytokines. Pygeum africanum bark standardized extract (PABE) showed the following effects: IL-2 was lowered in all donors in absence of a clear dose–response relationship; IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, and IL-13 levels were decreased in most donors; IL-22 levels seemed to be suppressed only for donor 4 at lower and medium concentrations; and IL-27 and levels of TNF-α decreased at all PABE concentrations in all donors. The anti-inflammatory effect of PABE supports the potential use of this natural compound in the management of BPH and other conditions in which pro-inflammatory cytokines are involved in their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57028a59b5333a8f1e4c080cdf8702d019ac5f8e9762cfae3e76bc18b6199dfe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
