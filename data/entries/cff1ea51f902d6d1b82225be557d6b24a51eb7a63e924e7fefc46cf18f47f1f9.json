{"title":"The effect of total suspended solids on the nursery of Penaeus vannamei nauplius based on biofloc technology system","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16110?af=R","date":1667394512000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A 14-day study was carried out to investigate the nursery of the nauplius (N5) <i>Penaeus vannamei</i> in biofloc technology (BFT) system. The whole experiment was divided into three groups: the control group (GC) without bioflocs, T300 and T600 with bioflocs in which total suspended solid (TSS) levels were maintained at 300 and 600 mg/L, respectively. The results revealed that the average total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) levels in GC were significantly higher than those in T300 and T600 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). By contrast, the nitrite of T300 was significantly higher than the other groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Nitrate and total nitrogen (TN) were increased with the increasing TSS, whereas alkalinity and pH decreased. The higher dry weight was detected in T300, and the survival rate under salinity stress was also significantly higher than the T600 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Besides, there was no significant difference in the total Vibrio bacteria (TVB) and body length of the shrimp among all groups (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, BFT with the TSS level &lt;300 mg/L can achieve better performance in <i>P. vannamei</i> of nauplius nursery.</p>","author":"Wenchang Liu, \nYanshuo Guo, \nShuang Li, \nGuozhi Luo, \nHongxin Tan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"cff1ea51f902d6d1b82225be557d6b24a51eb7a63e924e7fefc46cf18f47f1f9","category":"Environment"}
