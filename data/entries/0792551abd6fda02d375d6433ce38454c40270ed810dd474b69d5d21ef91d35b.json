{"title":"Anti-modularization for both high robustness and efficiency including the optimal case","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301269","date":1711634400000,"content":"<p>by Jaeho Kim, Yukio Hayashi</p>\r\n\r\nAlthough robustness of connectivity and modular structures in networks have been attracted much attentions in complex networks, most researches have focused on those two features in Erdos-Renyi random graphs and Scale-Free networks whose degree distributions follow Poisson and power-law, respectively. This paper investigates the effect of modularity on robustness in a modular <i>d</i>-regular graphs. Our results reveal that high modularity reduces the robustness even from the optimal robustness of a random <i>d</i>-regular graph in the pure effect of degree distributions. Moreover, we find that a low modular <i>d</i>-regular graph exhibits small-world property that average path length is <i>O</i>(<i>logN</i>). These results indicate that low modularity on modular structures leads to coexistence of both high robustness and efficiency of paths.","author":"Jaeho Kim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0792551abd6fda02d375d6433ce38454c40270ed810dd474b69d5d21ef91d35b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
