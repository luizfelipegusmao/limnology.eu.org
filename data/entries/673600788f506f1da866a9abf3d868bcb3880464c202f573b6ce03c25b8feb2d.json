{"title":"Size-inclusive advertising in the Asian fashion market: Female consumers’ responses to a plus-size vs. Thin-size model in South Korea","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304989","date":1718632800000,"content":"<p>by Sunwoo Kim, Su Jin Yang</p>\r\n\r\nGlobal fashion brands have embraced size-inclusive advertising featuring plus-size models, yet the responses of Asian consumers to such advertising—where the average body size of women is smaller than in Western markets—have garnered little attention. This study, utilizing the S-O-R model, aimed to investigate whether the relationships among perceived actual and ideal self-congruence, perceived attractiveness and familiarity of a fashion model, and purchase intention vary based on the body size of the fashion model. We tested the hypothesized relationships using ANCOVA, confirmatory factor analysis, and multi-group structural equation modeling, analyzing 623 online survey responses from South Korean female consumers. Actual self-congruence had a greater influence on perceived familiarity in consumers exposed to a thin-sized model compared to those exposed to a plus-sized model. In contrast, ideal self-congruence had a more significant positive impact on the perceived physical attractiveness of the plus-size model than the thin-size model. Furthermore, the plus-size model’s perceived physical attractiveness had a more significant positive effect on purchase intention than that of the thin-size model. This study highlights the importance of crafting advertising images that portray plus-size models as physically attractive to elicit favorable responses from Asian consumers.","author":"Sunwoo Kim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"673600788f506f1da866a9abf3d868bcb3880464c202f573b6ce03c25b8feb2d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
