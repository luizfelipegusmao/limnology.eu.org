It began life in Japan in 1921 when Shozaburo Shimano decided to start making freewheels in a rented corner of a demolished celluloid factory.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to today, and it’s become so successful that Shimano now accounts for at least half of the global bike components industry.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h4>Shimano road groupset ranking</h4>\n<ul><li><strong>Claris R2000:</strong> 8-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Sora R3000:</strong> 9-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Tiagra 4700:</strong> 10-speed</li>\n<li><strong>105 R7000:</strong> 11-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Ultegra Di2 R8100:</strong> 12-speed electronic only</li>\n<li><strong>Dura-Ace Di2 R9200:</strong> 12-speed electronic only</li>\n</ul><h4>Shimano gravel groupset ranking</h4>\n<ul><li><strong>GRX RX400:</strong> 10-speed</li>\n<li><strong>GRX RX600:</strong> 11-speed (apart from 10-speed version of crank)</li>\n<li><strong>GRX RX810:</strong> 11-speed</li>\n<li><strong>GRX RX815:</strong> 11-speed electronic</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h3>Entry-level Shimano groupsets: Claris, Sora and Tiagra</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The latest Claris R2000 may be Shimano’s cheapest road groupset but it still borrows design cues from its more expensive siblings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<h4>Shimano Claris R2000</h4>\n<ul><li><strong>Gearing:</strong> 8-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Shifting:</strong> Mechanical</li>\n<li><strong>Braking:</strong> Rim</li>\n</ul><p>The Shimano component range starts with the budget-priced <strong>Shimano</strong> <strong>Claris</strong>, which is usually found on the most affordable bikes available.</p>\n<p>Claris is an 8-speed system (eight gears at the rear) combined with either a double or triple crankset (two or three gears at the front).

They now use Shimano’s Servo Wave lever ratio for improved modulation, while the calipers offer ten per cent more clearance, making them easier to get running silently, according to Shimano.</p>\n<p>Just as in Ultegra R8100, Shimano has killed off the mechanical shifting option for Dura-Ace R9200 and has only made modest changes to the rim brake version of the groupset, meaning the only guise in which all the latest developments are included is the Di2 Disc option.</p>\n<p>Dura-Ace is more expensive but lighter than Ultegra, and it also offers a bigger 54-40t chainset option to better cater to the faster speeds of pro riders.

This gives you a slightly easier climbing gear while still retaining a big top gear. It is a popular option among competitive amateur riders</li>\n<li>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-a-compact-crank/\">compact crankset</a></strong> is 50/34. It has become very popular thanks to its combination of easy gearing and low weight</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/road/gear/article/super-compact-chainsets-the-next-big-thing-for-road-cyclists-48974/\">Super-compact or sub-compact cranksets</a></strong> offer an even lower gear range on double chainrings, such as 48t/32, 48/31 or 46/30. These are becoming popular with gravel riders and bikepackers who want the low, closely spaced gearing a 2x setup can offer.</li>\n<li>SRAM upset the applecart when it went 12-speed and introduced cassettes with a 10t small cog, rather than 11 teeth. That lets it achieve similar gear ratios with smaller chainrings, saving weight and offering even wider ranges. SRAM’s second-tier Force eTap AXS groupset now includes a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-force-etap-axs-wide-gearing/\">low-range 43/30t option</a>, for example.</li>\n</ul><h4>Triple cranksets</h4>\n<ul><li>The <strong>triple</strong> is an older type of chainset commonly seen on vintage road bikes and touring bikes. It offers a wide range of gears, but at a weight penalty by adding a third chainring. It typically combines a 50t outer ring, a 39t middle ring and an inner ring that has just 30 teeth. It is popular with touring cyclists who value a super-small ‘spinny’ ring when loaded down with panniers.</li>\n</ul><h4>Single cranksets</h4>\n<ul><li>The <strong>single-ring crankset</strong> has only one chainring. To compensate for the loss of the smaller, inner ring, a 1× crankset is often matched to a wider-range cassette. Single ring cranksets use alternating wide and narrow teeth with a higher profile, to aid chain retention.</li>\n</ul><h3>Road bike shifters explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> While the overall shape is similar, the three major brands have their own different methods of shifting.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For the most part, modern road bikes use dual-action shifters that incorporate the gear levers into the brake levers.</p>\n<p>Each brand has its own spin on the concept, so how you shift mechanical gears on a Shimano-equipped bike is slightly different to how you shift on a Campagnolo- or SRAM-equipped bike.</p>\n<p>Electronic shifting still relies on paddles built into the brake levers but uses small servomotors in the derailleurs to make them move.</p>\n<p>Electronic drivetrains offer consistently precise shifting and lower maintenance than a mechanically actuated drivetrain.</p>\n<p>For a full explanation of how the different systems change gear, read our detailed article on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/technique/how-to-change-gear-on-a-bike/\">how to change gear on a road bike</a>.</p>\n<h3>Road bike brakes explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Road brakes come in various forms, but basically, boil down to rim brakes (left) and disc brakes (right).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The complications don’t end with the various shift actions and whether they’re mechanically or electronically actuated. The variety of brakes used on road bikes has also grown more complex in the last few years.</p>\n<p>In the past, cable-operated, caliper rim brakes were the only type used on most road bikes, but recent years have seen road bike braking options expand to take in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/road/gear/article/direct-mount-vs-disc-brakes-52918/\">direct-mount rim calipers</a>, hydraulic rim calipers (these remain exceptionally rare), cable-operated disc brakes and hydraulic disc brakes.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Disc brakes are gradually taking over on road bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith</i></span></div>\n<p>Hydraulic disc brakes are generally considered to be the best all-round option, but which type of brake is best for you is dependent on a number of factors. Understanding how <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road disc brakes</a> work will help you decide.</p>\n<p>All three groupset brands now offer hydraulic disc brake options alongside rim brakes for the majority of their groupsets, and they’re now dominant on new bikes.</p>\n<h3>Road bike derailleurs explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rear derailleur does the important job of shifting gears at the cassette.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The derailleurs are the mechanisms – sometimes mech for short – that move the chain from one gear to the next.</p>\n<p>The front derailleur does the job for the front chainrings, while the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleur</a> does it for the cassette; both are controlled by the shifters.</p>\n<h3>Road bike cassettes explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> With the launch of its AXS groupsets, SRAM added a twelfth cog and started its cassettes with a 10t.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The cassette is the cluster of sprockets mounted on the rear wheel. The more sprockets on a cassette, the more ‘speeds’ the groupset is said to have.</p>\n<p>So, if there are 10 sprockets, you have a 10-speed groupset; 11 sprockets is an 11-speed groupset, and so on.</p>\n<p>(Note: ‘speeds’ only refers to the number of sprockets, not the total number of gears available; for that, you’d need to factor in the number of chainrings on the crankset.)</p>\n<p>Having more sprockets not only provides you with a wider range of gears but also means the jumps between them tend to be smaller.</p>\n<p>Smaller gaps mean it’s easier to maintain an optimal pedalling <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/what-is-cycling-cadence/\">cadence</a> as you shift from one gear to the next, and are therefore preferred by racers.</p>\n<p>For road bikes with a double crankset, 11-28t is probably the most common cassette range, but Shimano, SRAM and Campagnolo all offer a huge range of choices to suit your riding.</p>\n<p>It’s also becoming more common to see wider range cassettes fitted as standard, with ratios such as 11-32t or even 11-34t appearing on some bikes, while SRAM offers a 10-36t 12-speed cassette in its eTap AXS Force and Rival ranges.</p>\n<h3>Road bike chains explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A road bike chain is an often-overlooked component that deserves love and regular cleaning.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The groupset brand and number of gears dictate the type of chain you require (groupsets with a ‘higher’ number of gears require narrower chains).</p>\n<p>More expensive chains also often have smoother, more durable and more corrosion-resistant coatings than their cheaper counterparts.</p>\n<p>Additionally, some more expensive chains have the pins and plates drilled to remove weight.</p>\n<p>Note that a chain is a wear item and should be replaced at regular intervals. There are tools that will tell you <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-know-when-its-time-to-replace-your-bicycle-chain/\">when to replace your bike’s chain</a>.</p>\n<p>Failure to do this will accelerate wear on your cassette and chainrings, but you can extend chain life by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-clean-a-bike-chain/\">cleaning it regularly</a> and only using the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/chain-lubes/\">best chain lubes for your bike</a>.</p>\n<h3>Road bike bottom brackets explained</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A bottom bracket fits into the bike frame and provides the bearings that your cranks spin on.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p>The bottom bracket contains the bearings on which the crankset spins and it fits into your frame.</p>\n<p>Bottom brackets come in many shapes and sizes – we’ve got a complete guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket standards</a> – but as far as road groupsets are concerned, they all fall into one of two categories: press-fit or threaded.</p>\n<p>Threaded bottom brackets screw into your frame on threads. Press-fit bottom brackets, as the name suggests, are pressed into the frame and held in place by friction.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, press-fit bottom brackets are less convenient than threaded ones when it comes to maintenance and compatibility, but many manufacturers favour them for purported weight and stiffness benefits, as well as ease of manufacturing.</p>\n<h2>What do I get with a more expensive road groupset?</h2>\n<p>Does paying more always bring you improved performance? Maybe, but the higher up the range you go, the smaller those performance benefits become, and the increments become less noticeable, while the kit gets a lot more expensive.</p>\n<p>Second-tier groupsets (Shimano Ultegra, Campagnolo Chorus, SRAM Force) are generally as good in functional terms as the pro-level components and considerably cheaper, but they weigh fractionally more and have fewer exotic shiny bits.</p>\n<h3>Weight</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> More money gets you less weight, for the same or better performance (usually).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It was once famously said of bicycle parts: “Strong. Light. Cheap. Pick two.” A lighter bike will always accelerate and climb better than a heavier one, but without giving up strength, something has to be compromised.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re looking at groupsets, wheels or even complete bikes, reduced weight is often the major contributor to increased cost.</p>\n<p>With all the road groupsets, the more you spend, the lighter they get. The amount of weight that you save for your money diminishes dramatically at the upper end, though.</p>\n<p>These weight differences are the result of more expensive materials and refined, or more time-consuming, manufacturing processes.</p>\n<p>In addition to further machining, hole-drilling and high precision, more expensive components often use materials such as carbon fibre, titanium, lightweight aluminium and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/ceramic-bearings/\">ceramic bearings</a> to achieve the pinnacle in low weight and performance.</p>\n<h3>Durability</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Today’s road groupsets can take all sorts of punishment, even off the tarmac.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robert Smith / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you’re spending more money on a groupset, you’d expect it to outlast a cheaper option. Durability does improve with price, but our experience is that durability also plateaus at the second-tier options, and in some ways, actually starts to decline at the most expensive option.</p>\n<p>The more expensive technical components are built with greater precision, refinement and materials that lend themselves to greater longevity. This is apparent in derailleurs and shifters where the cheaper options will develop play and slop over time, while the better parts often remain like new.</p>\n<p>Wear items, such as cassettes and chainrings, however, are often the reverse of this. Cheaper options are made of heavier but more durable steels, while the more expensive versions are sometimes made from lighter but softer aluminium or titanium alloys.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Improved performance is the promise of higher-priced groupsets: smoother, more precise and quicker shifts between gears, stiffer cranks and better braking.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In addition to the benefits of reduced weight, more expensive groupsets find other ways of increasing performance. Most noticeably, higher-priced options provide a smoother, more precise and in some cases quicker shift between gears.</p>\n<p>This includes reduced effort at the lever, something that becomes apparent once you’ve been on the bike for a few hours. It’s an area where electronic gears set the benchmark; ultimate precision at the simple push of a button.</p>\n<p>Another performance example is increased crankset stiffness to provide crisper shifting and more efficient power transfer from the pedals to the rear wheel. This is achieved with more complex designs, and materials that increase strength and stiffness, but don’t add weight.</p>\n<p>Braking raises an entire new list of benefits as prices go up. Simply put, more expensive brakes are stronger, offer better feel and control, and stop you with less hand force required.</p>\n<p>This difference is much more apparent with rim brakes, though. There’s hardly any meaningful performance difference between low- and high-end hydraulic disc brakes.</p>\n<h3>Additional features</h3>\n<p>Besides offering extra gears, the more expensive groupsets usually get new features first.</p>\n<p>Shimano first launched Di2 electronic shifting at the Dura-Ace level, before trickling it down to Ultegra. The same is true of more mundane details – Dura-Ace was the first to get reach adjustment using a built-in screw rather than ugly shims, a feature now found all the way down to Claris level.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Shimano and Campagnolo now offer their higher-end cranksets in a universal size that’s cross-compatible with compact, semi-compact or standard-sized chainrings. This means that if you ever wish to change your chainring sizes, you can do so without needing a new crankset.</p>\n<h2>Groupset compatibility issues</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Watch out for compatibility issues when upgrading individual components.</span></figcaption><span> <i>John Watson / SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>It’s worth being aware that not all groupset components from a given manufacturer are compatible with one another, even in cases where it seems like they should be.</p>\n<p>Manufacturers tend to update their ranges incrementally over time so you can’t always assume, for example, that one 11-speed component will work with another if they’re not from the same year or groupset.</p>\n<p>There are differences in the precise amount of cable pulled by different rim brake levers too, so you may not get optimal performance if you move up the hierarchy when you replace individual parts.</p>\n<p>That said, groupsets of a given brand are generally designed to work with each other, providing they share the same number of gears. (i.e. Shimano 11-speed with Shimano 11-speed, Campagnolo 11-speed with Campagnolo 11-speed.)</p>\n<p>For specific compatibility queries, we’d suggest you ask your local retailer before buying, consult manufacturer technical documents online, or <a href=\"https://forum.bikeradar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">seek advice on our forum</a>.
