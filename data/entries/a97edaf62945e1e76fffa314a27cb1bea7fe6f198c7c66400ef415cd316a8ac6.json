{"title":"A possible thermodynamic definition and equation of state for a model of political election cycles","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300113","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by George-Rafael Domenikos, Alexander V. Mantzaris</p>\r\n\r\nThis work demonstrates how a simulation of political discourse can be formulated using variables of the agentsâ€™ behaviors in a simulation, as thermodynamic variables. With these relations the methodology provides an approach to create a correspondence between the variables of an agent based social system and those of a thermodynamic system. Extended from this observation, diagrams akin to a P-V diagram for gases can be created for this social system. The basic thermodynamic variables of temperature, pressure and volume are defined from a system of agents with political and non-political actions engaged in simulated political discourse. An equation of state is defined for the simulated political phenomenon. Through this equation of state the full thermodynamic map of the system is presented under a P-V diagram with isothermal and isentropic lines, which is able to represent the political situation of the system at each point of time. The classic election cycle that takes place can be represented on this thermodynamic map (corresponding to an Otto cycle). This provides a possibility for researching macroscopic social cycles as a thermodynamic/informational cycle as the traces on the thermodynamic map show similarities to an Otto cycle. Such a formulation reinforces the endeavours of social physics to view social phenomena with physical principles.","author":"George-Rafael Domenikos","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a97edaf62945e1e76fffa314a27cb1bea7fe6f198c7c66400ef415cd316a8ac6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
