{"title":"Force Directed 3D Graph Visualization Algorithm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1504/v1","date":1713854939000,"content":"Graph visualization has evolved significantly over time, offering various methods to effectively represent complex data structures. This study introduces a novel force-directed algorithm for 3D data visualization, specifically tailored for commonly used datasets in linked data visualization. Leveraging the power of graph theory and methods, the algorithm aims to address the challenge of creating visually appealing and easily interpretable visualizations, which often necessitate advanced user interaction. By utilizing 3D space and the Unity Engine, the research successfully visualizes data and develops interactive visualizations, overcoming limitations of basic force-directed implementations. The main contribution of presented research is in the force-directed algorithm with springs and controlled placement as a visualization technique that combines the use of springs and attractive forces to stabilize a graph in a 3D environment. The combination of these two techniques also helps prevent the formation of a single large cluster within the graph, enhancing the overall visualization quality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"28131447769fe1d0c390f77f4c5aafcb5e32c037b342a4aeefbda7d47a90f132","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
