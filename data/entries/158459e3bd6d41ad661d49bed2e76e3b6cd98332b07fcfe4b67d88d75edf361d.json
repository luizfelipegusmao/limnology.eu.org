{"title":"Effects of pork sausage on intestinal microecology and metabolism in mice","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13227?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Processed meat, as an important part of the human diet, has been recognized as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Although numerous epidemiological reports supported the IARC's view, the relevant evidence of a direct association between processed meat and carcinogenicity has been insufficient and the mechanism has been unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of pork sausage (as a representative example of processed meat) intake on gut microbial communities and metabolites of mice. Microbial communities and metabolites from all groups were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and Ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometer (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS), respectively.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The levels of Bacteroidetes, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Alloprevotella</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>_9, <i>Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group</i>, <i>Alistipes</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, <i>Allobaculum</i>, <i>Helicobacter</i>, <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, <i>Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1</i>, <i>Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i> (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) were obviously altered in the mice fed a pork sausage diet. Twenty-seven metabolites from intestinal content samples and fourteen matabolites from whole blood samples were identified as potential biomarkers from multivariate analysis, including Phosphatidic acid (PA), Sphingomyelin (SM), Lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), Diglyceride (DG), <span>D</span>-maltose, <i>N</i>-acylamides and so forth. The significant changes in these biomarkers demonstrate metabonomic variations in pork sausage treated rats, especially carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study provided evidence that a processed meat diet can increase the risk of colorectal cancer and other diseases significantly by altering the microbial community structure and disrupting the body's metabolic pathways. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Hailong Xiao, \nDanhan Yin, \nLidan Du, \nGaotian Li, \nJie Lin, \nChenyu Fang, \nShaolin Shen, \nGongnian Xiao, \nRuosi Fang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"158459e3bd6d41ad661d49bed2e76e3b6cd98332b07fcfe4b67d88d75edf361d","category":"Environment"}
