{"title":"High-speed railway infrastructure leads to species-specific changes and biotic homogenisation in surrounding bird community","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301899","date":1712757600000,"content":"<p>by Lourenço Falcão Rodrigues, Cristina Mata Estacio, Jesús Herranz Barrera, Ana Eugenia Santamaría Figueroa, Juan Esteban Malo Arrázola</p>\r\n\r\nLinear infrastructure networks, including railways, are undergoing rapid development in order to connect distant urban areas. Particularly, High-Speed Railways are increasingly seen as a viable alternative to domestic flights in many countries. However, this development of linear infrastructures is known to affect the surrounding faunal communities due to the changes in the landscape and operation of said linear infrastructures. Both positive and negative effects of linear infrastructures on adjacent faunal communities have been reported. In this study, we determined the influence of the High-Speed Railway infrastructure on the bird community that surrounds it. Birds were surveyed by using both linear transect and direct counting methods, both in the area directly adjacent to the railway infrastructure and 500m away from it in a period of two years of surveys. A total of 16114 individuals belonging to 71 species were recorded. The presence of the High-Speed Railway caused species-specific changes in the bird communities that surround it, causing the attraction of some species and the rejection of others. Furthermore, we show that the presence of the infrastructure altered the natural species turnover as the landscape changes by attracting the same bird species regardless of changes in the landscape, and filtering out others. We propose that further work in mitigation and development plans should focus on species-specific measures to assess the risk bird communities are exposed to.","author":"Lourenço Falcão Rodrigues","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e0231f8aa01695486ba78bea2e2ce2ddf58244af6723efe5528894f2fdb53003","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
