{"title":"Tagging mortality in acoustic telemetry studies: Insights from a multispecies analysis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15790?af=R","date":1715853213000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The widespread adoption of acoustic telemetry has transformed our understanding of marine species' behavior and movement ecology. However, accurately interpreting telemetry data, especially concerning tagging mortality, is essential for drawing valid conclusions. In this study, we scrutinized tagging mortality in 223 individuals across 14 species and evaluated the impact of tagging methodologies, including capture method and size effects. Results reveal high tagging survival rates overall, attributable to the resiliency of the studied species and the rigorous animal welfare protocols followed during tagging procedures. Our results highlight the importance of tailoring array designs to the specific mobility patterns of the studied species for accurate survival assessments. This research contributes to generalizing mortality assessments and clearing the path for more precise and reliable telemetry studies in the future.</p>","author":"Lucas Martínez‐Ramírez, \nLuis Bentes, \nAndré Dias, \nKarim Erzini, \nMiguel Gandra, \nSebastian Kraft, \nAlexander C.
