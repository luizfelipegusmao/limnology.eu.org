{"title":"Moral distress related to paid and unpaid care among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310132","date":1725976800000,"content":"<p>by Julia Smith, Muhammad Haaris Tiwana, Alice Murage, Hasina Samji, Rosemary Morgan, Jorge Andres Delgado-Ron</p>\r\n\r\nWhile there is growing literature on experiences of healthcare workers and those providing unpaid care during COVID-19, little research considers the relationships between paid and unpaid care burdens and contributions. We administered a moral distress survey to healthcare workers in Canada, in 2022, collecting data on both paid and unpaid care. There were no significant differences in the proportion of participants providing unpaid care by gender, with both genders equally affected by certain responsibilities such as reduced contact with family/loved ones. However, men were significantly more distressed about specific unpaid care responsibilities. Unpaid care was not significantly associated with differences in intention to leave work. At work, women were significantly more concerned about patients unable to see family, while men were distressed by others mistreating COVID patients. This study enhances understanding of paid and unpaid care relationships, particularly during crises, and proposes an innovative method for assessing unpaid care burdens.","author":"Julia Smith","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"56a65b731273f9f2d92e8b391379cd8af7ed0431fcbd2640cfb4d342cacda71f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
