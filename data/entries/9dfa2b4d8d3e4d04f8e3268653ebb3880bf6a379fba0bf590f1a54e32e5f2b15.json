Assessing the healthcare workers’ hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccination is pertinent, however, there are limited validated tools to measure their hesitancy on COVID-19 vaccines. This study aims to adapt and validate the first COVID-19 hesitancy scale among healthcare workers in Malaysia.</p> Materials and methods <p>This study adapted and translated the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS) developed by the WHO SAGE Working Group. The scale underwent a sequential validation process, including back-back translation, content, face, and construct validity for Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). The reliability was tested using internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE)).</p> Results <p>The data for EFA and CFA were completed by a separate sample of 125 and 300 HCWs, respectively. The EFA analysis of the C19-VHS-M scale was unidimensional with 10 items. A further CFA analysis revealed a uniform set of nine items with acceptable goodness fit indices (comparative fit index = 0.997, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.995, incremental fit index = 0.997, chi-squared/degree of freedom = 1.352, and root mean square error of approximation = 0.034). The Cronbach’s alpha, CR and AVE results were 0.953, 0.95 and 0.70, respectively.</p> Conclusions <p>The questionnaire was valid and reliable for use in the Malay language.</p>","author":"Siti Nur Aisyah Zaid","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9dfa2b4d8d3e4d04f8e3268653ebb3880bf6a379fba0bf590f1a54e32e5f2b15","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
