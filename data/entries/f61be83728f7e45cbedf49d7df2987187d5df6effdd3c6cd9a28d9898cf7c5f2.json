{"title":"Proof of the Binary Goldbach Conjecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1262/v1","date":1729071913000,"content":"In this paper, a \"local\" algorithm is determined for the construction of two recurrent sequences of positive primes ( ) and ( ), ((  ) dependent of ( )  ), such that for each integer n   their sum is equal to 2n . To form this, a third sequence of primes ( ) is defined for any integer n    by :   = Sup( p ∈  : p ≤ 2n - 3 ) , where  is the infinite set of primes. The Goldbach conjecture has been proved for all even integers 2n   between 4  and  4. In the table of terms of Goldbach sequences given in appendix 10 , values of the order of  2n =  are reached. This \" finite ascent and descent \" method proves the binary Goldbach conjecture ; an analogous proof by recurrence is established and an increase in    by  0.7(  is justified. Moreover, the Lagrange-Lemoine-Levy conjecture and its generalization, the Bezout-Goldbach conjecture, are proven by the same type of procedure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f61be83728f7e45cbedf49d7df2987187d5df6effdd3c6cd9a28d9898cf7c5f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
