{"title":"Codeine and promethazine: Exploratory study on “lean” or “sizzurp” using national survey data and an online forum","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301024","date":1711375200000,"content":"<p>by Orrin D. Ware, Albert Garcia-Romeu, C. Austin Zamarripa, Tamera Hughes, Leeza Wager, Tory Spindle</p>\r\nBackground <p>The concoction known as \"lean\" containing codeine and promethazine, holds a prominent cultural presence and is often referenced in mass media platforms (e.g., music and social media). Surprisingly, there’s a scarcity of national data characterizing the use of lean. Therefore, the current study investigated the use of lean using national survey data and online forum participant input, and focused on identifying concurrent substance use, exploring co-administration with other substances (e.g., alcohol, cannabis), and determining lean-related experiences.</p> Methods <p>We analyzed data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) spanning 2007–2019, identifying persons who used lean (weighted N = 42,275). Additionally, we conducted a Reddit-based study to gather insights about lean consumtion (N = 192).</p> Results <p>The NSDUH data indicated that lean use was most prevalent among teenagers and young adults (ages 13–21), accounting for 66% of the sample. This trend was more pronounced in male respondents (75%) compared to females. Additionally, the use was predominantly observed among Black/African American (29%), Hispanic (28%), and White (33%) populations, with these groups also reporting higher levels of concurrent alcohol and cannabis use. Similarly, findings from Reddit showed that individuals who used lean were predominantly male (67%) and exhibited elevated concurrent rates of alcohol (83%) and cannabis (46%) use in the past 30 days. Moreover, approximately 66% of respondents met criteria for severe lean use disorder, and 37% acknowledged driving under its influence.</p> Conclusion <p>The NSDUH data found that mostly young adult males reported consuming lean in the past twelve months, though the racial/ethnic breakdown of persons who used lean was diverse. The Reddit data found that most individuals in the sample met the criteria for a substance use disorder pertaining to their lean consumption. These findings underscore the clinical significance and necessity for further controlled research on lean.</p>","author":"Orrin D.
