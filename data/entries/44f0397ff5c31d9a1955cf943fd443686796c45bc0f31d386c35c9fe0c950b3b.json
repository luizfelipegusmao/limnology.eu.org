In these studies, a variety of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like R-CNN and UNet have been trained on TEM images annotated by human experts, achieving commendable performance with F1 scores around 0.7 to 0.8. Meanwhile, the field of computer vision has been rapidly progressing, with the creation of advanced machine learning models that exhibit superior performance in segmenting regular photographs. A key question arises that how different machine learning models may impact the performance for identifying defect structures in TEM images.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"44f0397ff5c31d9a1955cf943fd443686796c45bc0f31d386c35c9fe0c950b3b","category":"Environment"}
