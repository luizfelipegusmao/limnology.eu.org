{"title":"Predictors of the Attempt and Failure to Lose Weight among the South African Population","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0007/v1","date":1717462357000,"content":"Background: The increase in the prevalence of obesity in South Africa is a problem and weight management play an important role in the treatment of the high prevalence. For this purpose, a quantitative study was carried out using a structured questionnaire to assess predictors of attempt and failure to lose weight. Methods: One thousand and fifty adults were enrolled in the study and 54% (n=562) were overweight and obese (BMI &amp;gt;/25kg/m2). Descriptive statistics were analysed. Inferential statistical tests (chi-square tests, logistic regression, and Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficients) were used to determine the relationship between variables. Results: The results revealed that age, sex, marital status, educational level, employment status, income level, area of residence, ethnic groups, and self-perceived BMI (normal weight, overweight, and obese) were predictors of attempt and failure to lose weight. There was a positive correlation between self-perceived BMI and the attempt and failure to lose weight. Conclusion: Weight management is important in the realm of public health and can be regarded as an investment in the population, as it leads people toward weight control strategies grounded in empirical evidence. Additionally, the findings can inform public health policies and interventions to improve weight management strategies at the population level.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a71ca51f58a470f4c4b36541e76763d9553ce218ba551eba961be09b0082dc6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
