Because several island endemics are rare and not accessible, obtaining genetic information and reconstructing their biogeographical and evolutionary history becomes increasingly difficult. In the present study, we investigated the endangered freshwater gastropod <i>Paludomus ajanensis</i> (family Paludomidae) endemic to the Seychelles (Mahé and Silhouette) in the western Indian Ocean. By analysing historical DNA of this species, we were able to place this species in the family Paludomidae and to uncover its Asian affinity. The patchy distribution plus the documented recent population decline suggests this species should be considered ‘Critically Endangered’.</p>","author":"Björn Stelbrink, \nChristian Kehlmaier, \nCatharina Clewing, \nThomas Wilke, \nChristian Albrecht","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems: Table of Contents","siteHash":"53f1a0c472ad7591633d0b281e1df2834126145a77ec9c0585f4049ad3e52c8f","entryHash":"44e733ceb447557ecc754245297f9097948885d892a3077e2bddd67c500e2d8b","category":"Environment"}
