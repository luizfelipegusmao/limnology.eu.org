{"title":"Bone Turnover Markers during Growth Hormone Therapy Short Stature Children Born as SGA","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0858/v1","date":1718200845000,"content":"Growth hormone therapy (GHT) can improve growth velocity and final height but can also accelerated the process of bone growth, which is related to structural bone modelling, both in formation and resorption. The study evaluated the capacity of bone turnover markers to predict early growth response to one year GHT in short stature children born as small for gestational age (SGA). 25 prepubertal SGA children were included. We have estimated P1NP (N-terminal procollagen type 1), CTX (C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I), P3NP (N-terminal procollagen type III), NT-pro-CNP (amino-terminal C-type natriuretic peptide) and Ca-P metabolism using standard ECLIA, IRA and ELISA methods. A statistically significant increase in bone resorption markers (Ctx ) was found both at 6  and 12 months. P1NP  bone markers increased at 6 months and after 12 months of therapy. The P3NP  marker of collagen synthesis also increased after 12 months of therapy. We obtained  significant increases in phosphorus  levels at 6 and 12 months  and similarly  ALP. We have found a significant correlation between height (cm) and Ctx after 6 -12 months as well as P1NP / height (SD)  after 12 months. Calcium levels significantly correlated with height (SD) after 12 months.\nWe find a  strong reaction of bone resorption and bone formation markers during growth hormone therapy that may determine their selection as  prediction of  GH treatment outcome in SGA children.\nHowever, the issue requires further research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d7b7ce105561d02194d8faef81f03c44b03b96259d4d96942e845ae5e2510d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
