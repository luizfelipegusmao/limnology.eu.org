{"title":"An integrative approach highlights the discrepancy in the genetic, phenotypic, and presumptive taxonomic structure of Phoxinus (Actinopterygii, Leuciscidae, Phoxininae) in Bulgaria","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15765?af=R","date":1721274433000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The present drainage network of Bulgaria is the result of a complex Neogene and Quaternary evolution. Karst, which has developed on 23% of the territory, further complicates the hydrological pattern. Fresh waters of Bulgaria drain into the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea basins and can be roughly divided into the Danube (Middle and Lower Danube), non-Danube Black Sea, East Aegean, and West Aegean hydrological regions. <i>Phoxinus</i>, a small leuciscid fish, has a mosaic distribution in all four of these regions, inhabiting small mountainous and semi-mountainous streams. Based on morphology, it was identified as three species, <i>Phoxinus phoxinus</i> in the Danube, <i>Phoxinus strandjae</i> in the non-Danube, and <i>Phoxinus strymonicus</i> in West Aegean region. Later, molecular data revealed <i>Phoxinus csikii</i> and <i>Phoxinus lumaireul</i> in the Middle Danube and <i>P. csikii</i> in the Lower Danube. <i>Phoxinus</i> has been the focus of many studies, showing a high molecular and morphological diversity, which is not entirely consistent with previous morphology-only-based taxonomic concepts. In this study, molecular (a mitochondrial marker and a nuclear marker) and morphological data from both historical and recently sampled collections were analysed to assess the applicability of the integrative approach in <i>Phoxinus</i>. The results showed a significant influence of the complex paleo- and recent hydrology on the currently observed genetic structure of the considered populations and species. Furthermore, the study also demonstrated a strong influence of phenotypic plasticity on the morphological analysis of <i>Phoxinus</i> and the lack of a clear differentiation between <i>P. csikii</i> and <i>P. strandjae</i>. A barcoded specimen was designated as neotype to fix the species named <i>P. strandjae</i> in the current taxonomic concept. Finally, a significant discordance between genetically delimited clades and phenotypic groups did not allow a proper delineation of the species distributed in Bulgaria, demonstrating that more molecular markers are needed for further taxonomic study of the <i>Phoxinus</i> complex.</p>","author":"Anja Palandačić, \nOleg A.
