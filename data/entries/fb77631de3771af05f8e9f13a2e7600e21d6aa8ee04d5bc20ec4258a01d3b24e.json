{"title":"The Fourth Law of Thermodynamics (LMEP) and How It Makes the World","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1109/v1","date":1723655868000,"content":"Abstract: Founders of quantum theory have pointed out the irreducibility of living systems to quantum mechanics.  Quantum mechanics is never violated they rightfully argue but works under a set of active macroscopic constraints that selectively order the behavior of the micro components and these constraints are not reducible to the reversible, causally closed formalism of quantum mechanics. The whole of biological evolution is characterized by the production of increasingly more highly-ordered levels of such macroscopic constraints and biological evolutionary theory has no account for this either.  It is assumed outside its theoretical first principles. In fact this generative macroscopic ordering, the production of increasingly more highly differentiated levels of order—more things, more kinds of things, cannot be explained within biological theory because it is generic to the universe itself.  Irreducible to quantum mechanics this begs the question of fundamentality in physics.  Fundamental laws in a universe defined by active macroscopic ordering, level-building, and differentiation must be able to causally cross levels, and more importantly explain why there is any level-building at all to begin with.  The laws of thermodynamics are fundamental laws in this sense, and 4th Law path selection explains the generative universal ordering and differentiation (“complexification”).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb77631de3771af05f8e9f13a2e7600e21d6aa8ee04d5bc20ec4258a01d3b24e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
