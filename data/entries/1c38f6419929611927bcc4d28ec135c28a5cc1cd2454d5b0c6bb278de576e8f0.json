{"title":"Brain homogenate stability for stimulant drugs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/7/514/7700748?rss=1","date":1719446400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Brain can be a useful specimen for toxicology testing as it is a protected and isolated organ with lower metabolic activity than other tissues, but there is currently no published data supporting the stability of stimulant drugs in prepared brain homogenates. Brain homogenates were evaluated to determine the stability of the following stimulant drugs: amphetamine, benzoylecgonine, bupropion, cocaethylene, cocaine, ephedrine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methamphetamine, and phentermine. Four different homogenates were prepared at a 1:4 dilution with deionized water and fortified at 500 ng/mL of: cocaine without sodium fluoride, cocaine with 1% sodium fluoride, stimulant drugs other than cocaine without sodium fluoride, and stimulant drugs other than cocaine with 1% sodium fluoride. The fortified homogenates were aliquoted into 13 × 100-mm screw cap tubes and stored at room temperature (∼20°C), refrigerated (2–8°C), or frozen (&lt;−5°C) and analyzed in triplicate on Days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90. Analytes were considered stable as long as the difference in analyte/internal standard response ratio from Day 0 was less than 20% and the peaks met qualitative acceptance criteria. All analytes were stable for up to 90 days when stored frozen with or without sodium fluoride and had variable stability at all other evaluated conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"1c38f6419929611927bcc4d28ec135c28a5cc1cd2454d5b0c6bb278de576e8f0","category":"Environment"}
