{"title":"Development and characterization of fibrous high moisture extrudates based on pea protein isolate and whey protein","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13866?af=R","date":1725960764000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Construction of meat analogs based on pea protein isolate (PPI) alone by high moisture extrusion (HME) is diffocult as a result of the lack of anisotropic structures. In the present study, 0%–15% of whey protein (WP) was introduced to PPI to make hybrid blends, which were used to construct HME extrudates.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>WP enhanced the hardness, adhesive, cohesiveness and gumminess of the extrudates and facilitated the formation of a distinct anisotropic structure of PPI. The fibrous degrees of the extrudates containing 10% and 15% WP were around 1.50. The addition of WP, which has more -SH groups, increased the disulfide bonds and hydrogen bonding in the extrudates, leading to a denser cross-linked structure. Particle size distribution and Fourier transform infrared analysis showed that WP induced more compact structured aggregates and more β-sheet structures in the extrudates. Furthermore, the higher hydration capacity of WP may also help form a dilute melt and generate a more pronounced plug flow, assisting the formation of fiber structures of PPI.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study demonstrates that WP is a potential modifier, which could be used to improve the structure of PPI-based meat analogs. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jie Zhang, \nJingyi Yuan, \nXunze Han, \nQuanhong Li, \nXiaojun Liao, \nJing Zhao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"850100c41ec13c4e45e671a401d178b02c7bbde672e4ea0c6ebf5f77bffbaf19","category":"Environment"}
