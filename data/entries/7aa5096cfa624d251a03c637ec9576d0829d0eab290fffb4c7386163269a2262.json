{"title":"In vitro embryos of Romosinuano and Tropical Milking cattle during three seasons in Veracruz, Mexico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0398/v1","date":1712290464000,"content":"One of the main factors that influence the fertility of cattle in grazing systems in hot tropical climates is heat stress. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of season, breed, hormonal and physiological condition on the quantity and quality of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) and embryos produced in vitro, from Romosinuano (RM) and Tropical Milking (TM) donors. Three ovum pick-up and in vitro fertilization (OPU-IVF) were performed, one per season; hot dry (HD; 10, 10), hot humid (HH; 9, 9) and fresh dry (FD; 7, 10) in RM and LT donors. Serum levels of cortisol, insulin and glucose were measured, in addition to heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and rectal temperature (RT). Effect of season x genotype interaction (p≤0.05) was observed in all COCs variables and only in cleavage embryos (CLI) (p≤0.05). Body weight (BW) affected all COCs variables (p≤0.01), except unviable (UNV) although affected degenerated embryos (DEG) (p≤0.01) and total blastocysts (BLAST) (p≤0.01). Cow age only affected viable COCs (VIAB) (p ≤ 0.05), code one blastocysts (BC1) and BLAST (p≤0.01). Cortisol affected total COCs (COCsT), VIAB and total matured in vitro (TMIV) (p≤0.01), as well as CLI, BC1 (p≤0.01) and BLAST (p≤0.05). Insulin affected COCsT (p≤0.01), UNV (p≤0.05), denuded oocytes (DE) (p≤0.01), BC1 and code two blastocysts (BC2) (p≤0.01). Glucose affected all COCs variables (p≤0.01), except UNV and all embryo variables except BC2. HR affected COCsT, DE, TMIV (p≤0.01), CLI, BLAST and DEG (p≤0.05). RR affected COCsT, UNV, VIAB, CLI (p≤0.05), BC1, BLAST and DEG (p≤0.01). RT only affected DE, VIAB (p≤0.01) and BLAST (p≤0.05). The seasonal climatic year variation of Veracruz and changes in physiological and hormonal variables have diverse effects on the cumulus-oocyte complexes and embryos produced by RM and TM donors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7aa5096cfa624d251a03c637ec9576d0829d0eab290fffb4c7386163269a2262","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
