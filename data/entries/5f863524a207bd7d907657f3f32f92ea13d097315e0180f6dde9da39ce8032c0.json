{"title":"Follicular Immune Landscaping Reveals a Distinct Profile of FOXP3hi CD4+ T Cells in Treated Compared to Untreated HIV","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1185/v1","date":1721092646000,"content":"Follicular helper CD4+ T cells (TFH) are a major cellular pool for the maintenance of HIV reservoir. Therefore, the delineation of the follicular (F)/germinal center (GC) immune landscape will significantly advance our understanding of HIV pathogenesis. We have applied multiplex confocal imaging, in combination with relevant computational tools, to investigate, F/GC in situ immune dynamics in viremic (vir-HIV), antiretroviral treated (cART HIV) People Living With HIV (PLWH) and compare them to reactive, non-infected controls. Lymph nodes (LNs) from viremic and cART PLWH could be further grouped based on their TFH cell densities in high-TFH and low-TFH subgroups. These subgroups were also characterized by different in situ distribution of PD1hi TFH cells. The significantly accumulated follicular, compared to extrafollicular, FOXP3hi CD4+ T cells found in the low-TFH cART-HIV group were characterized by a less scattered in situ distribution and strongly correlated with the cell density of CD8+ T cells in this group. An inverse correlation between plasma viral load and LN GrzBhiCD8+ T and CD16hiCD15lo cells was found. Our data reveal the complex GC immune landscaping in HIV infection and suggest that follicular FOXP3hi CD4+ T cells could be negative regulators of TFH cell prevalence in cART-HIV.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f863524a207bd7d907657f3f32f92ea13d097315e0180f6dde9da39ce8032c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
