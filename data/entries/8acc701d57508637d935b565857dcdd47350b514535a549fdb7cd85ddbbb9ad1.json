{"title":"Integrating Business Ecosystems and Social Networks: A Case Study on Sustainable Transitions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0233/v1","date":1725379192000,"content":"This paper critically reviews the convergence between Business Ecosystem Theory and Social Network Theory in sustainability studies. While both frameworks view organizations as part of larger, interconnected systems, they can be differentiated by six key dimensions: unit of analysis, focus, decomposability, types of relationships, market segment, and worldview. To better reflect real-world phenomena, this paper argues for a new stream of theoretical convergence that is practical, reliable, generalizable, and reproducible. Specifically, it proposes shifting from interoganizational networks to interfunctional networks, which reduces complexity, enhances stability over time, and provides a clearer theoretical distinction. This is illustrated through a case study of Tesla Inc.’s ecosystem, built from data presented in the company’s 10K form, which also serves as an example of the emergence of a new strategic construct named the Business Ecosystem Footprint. This construct could assist managers in understanding where their organization stands within the network of functions, guiding them in making informed decisions about resource allocation and diversification, specifically aimed at supporting financial goals as well as sustainability and decarbonization objectives. The article concludes by suggesting potential research agendas, such as automating ecosystem mapping, exploring the constraints of the new construct, and testing new hypotheses related to firm performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8acc701d57508637d935b565857dcdd47350b514535a549fdb7cd85ddbbb9ad1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
