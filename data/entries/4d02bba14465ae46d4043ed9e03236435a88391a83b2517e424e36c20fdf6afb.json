{"title":"A Novel Anti-Mouse CXCR1 Monoclonal Antibody, Cx1Mab-8, Demonstrates Very High Affinity in Flow Cytometry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1672/v1","date":1729582088000,"content":"CXC chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) is an important regulator for neutrophil granulocyte activation through binding to the ligand interleukin-8 (IL-8). Upon binding to IL-8, CXCR1 activates downstream signaling, critical for innate and adaptive immune responses. The IL-8-CXCR1 axis also plays an important role in tumor progression, especially in the tumor microenvironment. CXCR1 antagonists or anti-IL-8 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed and evaluated in clinical trials for inflammatory diseases and tumors. In this study, we developed novel mAbs for mouse CXCR1 (mCXCR1) using the N-terminal peptide immunization. Among the established anti-mCXCR1 mAbs, Cx1Mab-8 (rat IgG2b, kappa) recognized mCXCR1-overexpressed Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO/mCXCR1) and mCXCR1-overexpressed LN229 (LN229/mCXCR1) by flow cytometry. The dissociation constant (KD) values of Cx1Mab-8 for CHO/mCXCR1 and LN229/mCXCR1 were determined as 5.1 × 10−10 M and 1.3 × 10−9 M, respectively. These results indicated that Cx1Mab-8 is useful for detecting mCXCR1 by flow cytometry with high affinity and can obtain the proof of concept in preclinical studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d02bba14465ae46d4043ed9e03236435a88391a83b2517e424e36c20fdf6afb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
