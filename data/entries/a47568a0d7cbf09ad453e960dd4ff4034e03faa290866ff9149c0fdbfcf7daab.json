{"title":"Assessing Road Users&rsquo; Preference for Various Travel Demand Management Strategies for Adoption in Accra, Ghana","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1325/v1","date":1716304897000,"content":"The rise in population density, vehicle ownership, and urban development has significantly influenced travel demand and altered travel patterns, leading to traffic congestion in rapidly growing urban centers like Accra, Ghana. The traditional approach of expanding roadways to accommodate rising traffic is no longer environmentally sustainable. Instead, emphasis has shifted towards travel demand management (TDM) strategies as a more sustainable solution. This study aimed to investigate a range of TDM strategies that can be adopted in Accra to improve traffic flow through the lenses of everyday road users. The study employed a questionnaire survey and a stratified sampling technique to gather data from 615 respondents for relative importance index (RII) ranking, and Chi-square statistical analysis. The findings reveal that the topmost preferred strategies were mass transit improvements, walking and cycling improvements, and alternative work schedules. Notably, mass transit improvements emerged as the most preferred strategy. The study also unveiled a statistically significant correlation between variables such as age, education level, marital status, income level, and mode of transportation with all selected TDM preferences. However, no significant relationship was found between gender and car ownership with all selected TDM preferences. The study provides valuable insights regarding road users’ preferences for TDM strategies that can aid in planning future urban mobility systems to proactively manage travel demand, alleviate congestion, and promote sustainable transportation options for the city’s residents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a47568a0d7cbf09ad453e960dd4ff4034e03faa290866ff9149c0fdbfcf7daab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
