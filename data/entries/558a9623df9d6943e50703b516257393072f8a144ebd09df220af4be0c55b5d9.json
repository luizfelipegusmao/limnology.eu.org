{"title":"A Survey of Utilization and Satisfaction of Korean Subfertility Treatment among Korean Women","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0996/v1","date":1720737067000,"content":"Low fertility is a critical social problem worldwide, and infertility has a prevalence of 15%. This cross-sectional study aimed to understand the factors affecting the usage and satisfaction of Korean medicine (KM) in subfertile women. An online survey was conducted from November 3 to November 8, 2021. The survey collected basic information, KM treatment experience, and satisfaction from women who experienced poor pregnancy. The t-test and chi-square test (χ2-test) were used to determine the overall characteristics of the subjects and factors affecting the utilization and satisfaction of KM treatment. Of the total of 29,465 people, 4,922 read the survey email, and 601 responded. After excluding 51 insincere respondents, 550 respondents were included in the final analysis. Of these, 43.1% had experience with conventional treatment, and 15.6% had received KM treatment. Integrative subfertility treatment was significantly more common (24.9%) than KM treatment alone (10.2%) (P=0.00). Women with no childbirth experience (P=0.01) and those with a master’s degree (P=0.01) were more willing to participate in the ‘KM Support Project for Subfertility’. Our findings suggest that subfertile patients prefer integrated medical treatment over KM alone. Further studies are needed to assess the status of integrative medicine treatment, satisfaction with each KM intervention, factors for low satisfaction, and patient requirements.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"558a9623df9d6943e50703b516257393072f8a144ebd09df220af4be0c55b5d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
