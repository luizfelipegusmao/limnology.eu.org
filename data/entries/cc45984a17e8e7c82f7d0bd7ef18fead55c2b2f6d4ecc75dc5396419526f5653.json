{"title":"5 Rumen microbiome and metabolome in dairy cattle performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/201/7664790?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cattle rumen microbiome converts fibrous feed to nutrients that directly influence cattleâ€™s growth and performance. Recent research has revealed the composition and function of rumen microbiome can affect many economically important traits in cattle such as feed efficiency, milk/meat yield and quality, methane emission, metabolic health and so on. In this presentation, the research on the assessment of to what extent the rumen microbiome and its metabolites, as well as host metabolites contribute to milk production and quality traits will be focused and discussed. It has been evident that some dairy cows can produce large amounts of milk under the same nutritional and management conditions. Recent research has revealed that in addition to host genetics and diet, parity and days in milk of dairy cows can affect the rumen microbiota, and both core and pan rumen bacteriome can potentially contribute to variations of milk production traits. Additionally, the analysis of rumen metagenomics and metabolomics of dairy cows with varied milk production yield showed that some key bacterial taxa (for example, <span>Prevotella</span> species), and their functions (such as branched-chain amino acids biosynthesis, methanogenesis), some rumen microbial metabolites (mainly amino acids, carboxylic acids, and fatty acids) significantly differed between high and low production cows. Further integrated analysis with serum metabolomics of the cos revealed the varied contributions of rumen microbial composition, functions, metabolites, and the serum metabolites to the milk protein yield of a dairy cow, a potential new trait that can be used for high-quality milk production, respectively. The fundamental understanding of the role of rumen microbiome and its metabolome contributing to milk yield and protein yield traits can provide novel insights into future manipulation of rumen microbiome to enhance milk production and quality.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"cc45984a17e8e7c82f7d0bd7ef18fead55c2b2f6d4ecc75dc5396419526f5653","category":"Environment"}
