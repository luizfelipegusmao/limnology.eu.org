Plastid ribosomal protein EMB27 is required for maize embryogenesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/259/7613808?rss=1","date":1708732800000,"content":"<span>Plant embryos undergo crucial development to establish themselves for photosynthesis. It begins at the early stages of embryogenesis with the formation of plastids in cells of nascent ground and epidermal tissues (<a href=\"#kiae106-B8\">West and Harada 1993</a>). Genetic screens in Arabidopsis and maize have revealed embryo lethality in numerous chloroplast-defective mutants (<a href=\"#kiae106-B4\">Meinke 2020</a>). However, the observed phenotypic variations across different species and genetic backgrounds complicate our understanding of the relationship between these 2 defects (<a href=\"#kiae106-B5\">Parker et al. 2014</a>). Therefore, how chloroplast biogenesis influences plant embryogenesis remains unclear.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"5a8ee32898222bc835a0fd7b3ed35871e5df0cbc47f4a43cc0a6ea5a6be73d37","category":"Environment"}
