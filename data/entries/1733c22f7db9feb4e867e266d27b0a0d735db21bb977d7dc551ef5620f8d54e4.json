{"title":"Identifying the abiotic factors that determine the inland range limits of a mesic-adapted lizard species","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/64/1/55/7324822?rss=1","date":1697673600000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>For most species, the factors that determine geographical range limits are unknown. In mesic-adapted species, populations occurring near the edge of the species’ distribution provide ideal study systems to investigate what limits distributional ranges. We aimed to identify the abiotic constraints that preclude an east-Australian mesic-adapted lizard (<span>Lampropholis delicata</span>) from occupying arid environments. We performed lizard surveys at sites spanning an elevation/aridity gradient (380–1070 m) and measured the prevalence of habitat features (logs, rocks, leaf litter, bare ground, solar radiation) in addition to hourly temperatures in a variety of microhabitats available to lizards. Species distribution models (SDM) were used to identify the macroclimatic variables limiting the species’ distribution. At its inland range limit, <span>L. delicata</span> is associated with mesic high-elevation forests with complex microhabitat structures, which gradually decline in availability toward lower (and more arid) elevations where the species is absent. Moreover, <span>L. delicata</span> is absent from sites with a shallow leaf litter layer, in which daily temperatures exceed the species’ thermal preference range, which we determined in a laboratory thermal gradient. In regards to macroclimate, SDM revealed that temperature seasonality is the primary variable predicting the species’ distribution, suggesting that <span>L. delicata</span> avoids inland areas owing to their high annual thermal variability. By combining multiple lines of evidence, this research highlights that habitat and microclimate suitability—not solely macroclimate suitability—are important range-limiting factors for mesic ectotherms and should be incorporated in studies addressing range-limiting hypotheses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative and Comparative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"715dd1b0fb4f45600bceadb227e9b7fdf8bd9d1d7a2fd3d5e0399d2c1f410646","entryHash":"1733c22f7db9feb4e867e266d27b0a0d735db21bb977d7dc551ef5620f8d54e4","category":"Environment"}
