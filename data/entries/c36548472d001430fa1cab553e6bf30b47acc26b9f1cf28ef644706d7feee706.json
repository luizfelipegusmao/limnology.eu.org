{"title":"Unveiling Coupled Dark Plasmon Modes in CdO Structures","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.563/7720086?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Cadmium oxide (CdO) is an attractive material for plasmonic applications in the near- to mid-infrared (NIR and MIR, respectively). CdO is capable of sustaining both surface plasmon polariton (SPP) and epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) modes depending on the carrier concentration and sample thickness [<a href=\"#ozae044.563-B1\">1</a>]. SPPs are dispersive with long propagation lengths, while ENZs have low dispersion but high field confinement. Previous work has shown that when CdO layers of different thicknesses and carrier concentrations are grown atop one another, hybrid polaritonic modes start to appear from the coupling of these SPP and ENZ modes [<a href=\"#ozae044.563-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.563-B3\">3</a>]. The coupling conditions for these hybrid modes can be further tuned by changing the sample geometry and size, which effects the modal confinement and distribution.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c36548472d001430fa1cab553e6bf30b47acc26b9f1cf28ef644706d7feee706","category":"Environment"}
