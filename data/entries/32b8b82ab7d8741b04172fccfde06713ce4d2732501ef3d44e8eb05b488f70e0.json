{"title":"Comparison of Three Gas Chromatographic Methods &ndash; Identification of Terpenes and Terpenoids in Cannabis sativa L.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0373/v1","date":1717744848000,"content":"Terpenes and terpenoids content in cannabis plant was already studied in the past with three used methods. Since these works did not compare the content of these substances under the same conditions, we tried to make this comparison exactly.\nThree different gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GS/MS) methods - hexane based liquid extraction (Liq), static head-space extraction (HS), and head-space solid phase microextraction (SPME) â€“ were compared to identify volatile compounds in four different cannabis chemotypes - Green fields, Titan chemotype, Black Domina chemotype, and Neptune chemotype.\nThe main compounds focused on were monoterpenes/monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenes/sesquiterpenoids. Extraction with hexane gave comparable results, however the other two methods allowed for the identification of more substances.\nFor the final evaluation of the comparison of the three methods of analysis, extraction with hexane gives comparable results (which is advantageous for quantitative analysis), although the other two methods allowed for the identification of more substances. This means that the same method should be used everywhere for the quantitative evaluation of constituents in cannabis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32b8b82ab7d8741b04172fccfde06713ce4d2732501ef3d44e8eb05b488f70e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
