{"title":"Barriers to Insulin Initiation for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Cross-Sectional Study in Thi-Qar Province, Southern Iraq","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1955/v1","date":1721814518000,"content":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poses a significant economic and clinical burden. Clinical inertia is defined as the failure of healthcare providers to modify therapy in the presence of clear indications. This study aimed to identify patient opinions on insulin to understand the barriers preventing type 2 diabetes patients from initiating insulin treatment when recommended by their physician. This cross-sectional observational study included 671 individuals with poorly controlled T2DM and HbA1c levels exceeding 10%. These patients required either the initiation or escalation of their existing insulin therapy. The participants were referred to Thi-Qar Specialized Diabetes Endocrine and Metabolism Center (TDEMC) for consultation between January 2022 and July 2022.Results: During discussions between the researcher (clinician) and the inadequately controlled T2DM patients, the primary reasons for refusing insulin therapy were identified. These reasons included fear of injections, the belief that insulin induces dependence and is a last resort, concerns about hypoglycemia and complications, cost, difficulty in computing doses, social stigma, inconvenience and disruption to life and work, storage challenges, fear of weight gain, dependence on others, and lack of confidence.The study concludes that the clinical barriers faced by individuals who refuse the initiation of insulin therapy are diverse. The most common belief among the patients was that insulin leads to dependence (38%), while the smallest percentage cited a lack of confidence in insulin as an effective treatment for lowering hyperglycemia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f48ec35f26f17d9fb4ee926e0abbcb2093947a82c49613159f7c0242b6ecf25","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
