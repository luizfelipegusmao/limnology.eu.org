{"title":"The Genetic Analysis and Clinical Therapy in Lung Cancer: Current Advances and Future Directions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2564/v1","date":1722428981000,"content":"Lung cancer, including both non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer, remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide representing 18% of the total cancer deaths in 2020. Many patients are identified already at an advanced stage with metastatic disease and have a worsening prognosis. Recent advances in the genetic understanding of lung cancer have opened new avenues for personalized treatments and targeted therapies. This review examines the latest discoveries in the genetics of lung cancer, discusses key biomarkers, and analyzes current clinical therapies based on this genetic information. It will conclude with a discussion of future prospects and potential research directions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b21b3387aa65ccd6a0e8c4c43eccc3f0247720f9e2941af04703b418997a024","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
