In a longitudinal non-randomized controlled study, participants of WABC (<em>n</em> = 35) are compared with participants of the control group (<em>n</em> = 37), who received regular employment support. Participants were followed for 1 year and filled out questionnaires on individual characteristics and health at baseline, after 6 and 12 months. This information was enriched with monthly register data on employment status from 2015 until 2020. Difference-in-differences analyses were performed to investigate changes in employment participation among participants of WABC and the control group. A generalized linear mixed-effects model was used to compare changes in mental health (measured on 0–100 scale) between the two groups.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Results</h3>\n                      <p>Before WABC, employment participation was 22.0%points lower among participants of WABC compared to the control group. After starting WABC, employment participation increased with 15.3%points per year among participants of WABC, compared to 5.6%points in the control group. Among all participants of WABC, no change in mental health was found (<em>β</em> 1.0, 95% CI − 3.4; 5.5). Only female participants of WABC showed a significant change in mental health (<em>β</em> 8.0, 95% CI 2.6; 13.4).</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n                      <p>To enhance employment participation of persons with severe mental disorders, an interdisciplinary ‘work-first’ approach in which professionals of employment services and mental health services work in close collaboration, is of paramount importance.</p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"b159482d40104e0b5476dd492b9168421351410f183abd300707bcf20ce2dfd3","category":"Environment"}
