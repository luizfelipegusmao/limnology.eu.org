(2) Methods: In the single-center prospective observational study, 42 patients hospitalized for AHF in the post-emergency polyvalent medicine department of CHU Grenoble were successively included between May 2021 and July 2022. Clinical examination, LUS and electrolyte panel results were collected daily. Vital status was assessed 30 days after the last LUS. The primary endpoint was the evolution of the number of B-lines according to the dose of diuretic administered ; (3) Results: We performed 188 LUS. Our patients were elderly (85.8 [SD 8.1]) and comorbid. The median number of B-lines decreased from 17 at admission to 7 in the middle of the hospital stay, then stagnated until discharge. Simultaneously, the median dose of diuretics, initially stable at a maximum of 40 mg/d IV, decreased to 20mg/d IV by the end of hospital stay. Patients with CKD had a higher mean number of B-lines at entry (24.2 [SD 11.6]) compared to those without CKD (8.2 [SD 8.8]). However, the evolution of B-lines number was independent of creatinine levels. 30-day all-causes mortality was significantly related to the number of B-lines at discharge (15.2 [SD 10.1] in deceased patients versus 3.9 [SD 5.4] in living patients, p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8781daad8ac7c52446d6fe998d89ec2714232bab416a7cc7ce355a3d2bc13cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
