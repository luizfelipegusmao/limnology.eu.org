{"title":"Positive Childhood Experiences and Adult Mental, Relational and Physical Health in an Australian Sample: Associations Across Adverse Childhood Experiences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1731/v1","date":1721662114000,"content":"(1) Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and positive childhood experiences (PCEs) have potential to impact long-term health outcomes. Understanding these interrelationships can inform the development of interventions to promote societal health (2) Methods: D/PMH was defined as a diagnosis of depression and/or more than 14 days of poor mental health in the previous month. Those reporting poor physical health for more than 14 days in the previous month or categorising their physical health as ‘fair’ or ‘poor’ were deemed to have PG/PPH. Seven categorical questions based on subscales in the Child and Youth Resilience Measure-28 were used to define PCEs.(3) Results: Increased ACEs exposure use significantly associated with increased odds of D/PHM (p&amp;lt;0.001), increased odds of PG/PHH (p=0.010) and decreased odds of AR-SES (p&amp;lt;0.001). Increased exposure to PCEs was significantly associated with decreased odds of D/PHM (p&amp;lt;0.001), increased odds of PG/PHH (p&amp;lt;0.001) and decreased odds of AR-SES (p&amp;lt; 0.001). For all outcomes, exposure to PCEs reduced the strength of the association between ACEs and outcomes. (4) Conclusions: A positive dose response between the number of ACEs and adult D/PMH, PG/PPH and lower AR-SES exists within the Australian population. PCEs weaken this association, demonstrating their mitigating potential. PCEs promoted adult outcomes, irrespective of ACEs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad930fd94da18d23b99ab9fa5fedba00ed444c5775be40901d69eb85216adcef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
