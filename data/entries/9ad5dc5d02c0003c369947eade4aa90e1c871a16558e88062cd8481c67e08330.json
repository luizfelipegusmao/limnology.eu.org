{"title":"Research on the Modelling Design of Warmth Perception for Elderly Companion Robots Based on Kansei Engineering","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1255/v1","date":1721096910000,"content":"Elderly individuals frequently perceive companion robots devoid of warmth, resulting in a reluctance to accept these robots' services. This perception has become a significant barrier to the introduction of companion robots into households. To address this issue, this study employs KE methods to translate the elderly's need for warmth perception from companion robots into elements of modelling design. Initially, 20 pairs of affective words and 22 sample images of companion robots were chosen. The \"rational-emotional\" and \"dim-bright\" dimensions were identified as positively influencing the elderly's warmth perception of companion robots through SD method analysis. Subsequently, a hierarchical analysis table was established, with warmth perception as the root layer, modelling style and color matching as the basic layer, \"rational-emotional\" and \"dim-bright\" as the expansion layer, and the eight characteristic elements of companion robots as the morphological layer. The link between affective imagery and design elements was then established from the sample robots with higher warmth perception scores. Based on the correlation between the two, various design schemes were formed through random combinations. Finally, the design schemes were evaluated using the warmth perception scale, and the warmth perception scores of each sample model were obtained. This research provides design references for designing companion robots for the elderly with a \"sense of warmth\".","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ad5dc5d02c0003c369947eade4aa90e1c871a16558e88062cd8481c67e08330","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
