{"title":"Ionosonde Measurements Comparison during an ICME- and a SIR/CIR-Driven Geomagnetic Storm over Europe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1725/v1","date":1719292552000,"content":"The comparison of three types of ionosonde data from Europe during an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) and a Stream Interaction Regions (SIRs) / Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) -driven geomagnetic storm event is detailed in this study. The selected events are 16-20 March 2015 for the ICME-driven and 30 May to 04 June 2013 for the SIR/CIR-driven one. Ionospheric data from three European ionosonde stations, namely Pruhonice (PQ), Sopron (SO) and Rome (RO), are investigated. The ionospheric F2-layer responses to these geomagnetic events are analyzed with the ionospheric foF2 and hâ€™F2 parameter, the calculated deltafoF2 and deltahF2 values, ratio of Total Electron Content (rTEC) and Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere, Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) thermospheric [O]/[N2] measurement data. The storm-time and the quiet day mean values are also compared, and it can be concluded that the quiet day curves are similar at all stations while the storm-time ones showed the latitudinal dependence during the development of the storm. As a result of the electron density comparison, during the two events it can be concluded that SSC that characterized the ICME induced a Travelling Atmospheric Disturbance (TAD) seen in the European stations, while this is not in the SIR/CIR-driven ionospheric storm, which showed a stronger and more prolonged negative effect in all stations probably due to the season.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7780e64d432c52e7ecb4e34ebe49dc34bc57683243849b0f016e63149aed0ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
