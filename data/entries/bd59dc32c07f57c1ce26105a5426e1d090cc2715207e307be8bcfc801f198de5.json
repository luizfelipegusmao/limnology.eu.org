Due to the complexity of the volcanogenesis and the non-homogeneity of the reservoir, the construction of a reasonable volcanic rock petrophysical model to guide the reservoir prediction is the key to success or failure. Unlike conventional sedimentary reservoirs, volcanic rock skeletons have diverse mineralogical compositions and pore structures, making the construction of equivalent petrophysical models highly complicated. This paper proposes a method to construct equivalent petrophysical models of complicated volcanic rocks with multiple mineral components and pore structures utilizing conventional logging curves. In the middle basal volcanic rock development area of the Songnan Fault, the errors in mineral content calculation and transverse wave estimation are less than 10% when comparing the results of elemental capture spectroscopy (ECS) logging and core test analysis; meanwhile, it directs the volcanic rock phase-controlled pre-stack inversion work and upgrades the accuracy of volcanic rock well seismic multi-scale reservoir prediction.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"bd59dc32c07f57c1ce26105a5426e1d090cc2715207e307be8bcfc801f198de5","category":"Environment"}
