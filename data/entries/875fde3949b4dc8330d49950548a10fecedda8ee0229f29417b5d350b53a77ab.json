{"title":"Behavioral and genetic correlates of heterogeneity in learning performance in individual honeybees, <i>Apis mellifera</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304563","date":1718200800000,"content":"<p>by Neloy Kumar Chakroborty, Leboulle, Ralf Einspanier, Randolf Menzel</p>\r\n\r\nLearning an olfactory discrimination task leads to heterogeneous results in honeybees with some bees performing very well and others at low rates. Here we investigated this behavioral heterogeneity and asked whether it was associated with particular gene expression patterns in the beeâ€™s brain. Bees were individually conditioned using a sequential conditioning protocol involving several phases of olfactory learning and retention tests. A cumulative score was used to differentiate the tested bees into high and low performers. The rate of CS+ odor learning was found to correlate most strongly with a cumulative performance score extracted from all learning and retention tests. Microarray analysis of gene expression in the mushroom body area of the brains of these bees identified a number of differentially expressed genes between high and low performers. These genes are associated with diverse biological functions, such as neurotransmission, memory formation, cargo trafficking and development.","author":"Neloy Kumar Chakroborty","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"875fde3949b4dc8330d49950548a10fecedda8ee0229f29417b5d350b53a77ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
