{"title":"Self-Assembly of a Pd2L4 Hydrazone Molecular Cage Through Multiple Reaction Pathways","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1100/v1","date":1728912879000,"content":"Molecular cages are preorganized molecules with a central cavity, typically formed through the self-assembly of their building blocks. This requires in most cases forming and breaking reversible bonds during the self-assembly reaction pathway for error correction to drive the reaction to the cage product. In this work, we focus on both Pd–ligand and hydrazone bonds implemented in the structure of a Pd2L4 hydrazone molecular cage. As the cage contains two different types of reversible bonds, we envisaged a cage formation comparative study by performing the self-assembly of the cage through 3 different reaction pathways involving the formation of Pd–ligand bonds, hydrazone bonds, or a combination of both. The 3 reaction pathways produce the self-assembly of the cage with yields ranging from 73% to 79%. Despite the complexity of the reaction the cage is formed in a very high yield, even for the reaction pathway that involves the formation of 16 bonds. This research paves the way for more sophisticated cage self-assembly designs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc8582732d9e12955868c1016b8e1b0e36ba1afd00037189a6676a5926e66905","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
