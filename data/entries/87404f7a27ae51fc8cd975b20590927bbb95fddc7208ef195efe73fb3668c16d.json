{"title":"Application of Biosensors in Cancer Drug Discovery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1857/v1","date":1729707103000,"content":"The quest for effective cancer treatments has driven transformative strategies in drug discovery, and biosensors have emerged as indispensable tools, renowned for their precision, sensitivity, and real-time monitoring capabilities. The review begins with a brief overview of cancer drug discovery, underscoring the pivotal role of biosensors in advancing cancer research. Various types of biosensors employed in cancer drug discovery, including fluorescence- and bioluminescence-based biosensors, are then explored. Emphasis is placed on the integration of biosensors in high throughput screening (HTS) and validation for cancer drug compounds, elucidating their pivotal role in accelerating the identification of potential therapeutics. Real-time monitoring of cellular responses through biosensors yields invaluable insights into cancer cell signaling pathways, drug efficacy, and resistance mechanisms. The review illuminates how biosensors contribute to unraveling the dynamic nature of cancer cells, thereby facilitating the development of more targeted and personalized therapies. Challenges linked to biosensor applications in cancer drug discovery are addressed, alongside a discussion of emerging trends and future perspectives. In conclusion, this review offers a comprehensive analysis of biosensor applications in the dynamic field of cancer drug discovery. The integration of biosensor technologies holds the promise of revolutionizing the discipline, presenting novel avenues for the development of targeted and personalized cancer therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"87404f7a27ae51fc8cd975b20590927bbb95fddc7208ef195efe73fb3668c16d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
