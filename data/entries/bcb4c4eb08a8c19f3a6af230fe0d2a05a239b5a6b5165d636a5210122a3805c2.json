These materials, particularly nano-porous and 2D film particles, find extensive applications in electronics, catalysis and energy storage and conversion due to their structural stability, high surface activity, and superconductivity. Additionally, they have versatile compositions, ultrathin features, highly exposed surfaces, abundant surface chemistry, and tunable physical and chemical properties, making them valuable. [<a href=\"#ozae044.801-B1\">1-4</a>] Various methods can achieve HEO synthesis, including solid-state reactions and different wet chemistry synthesis techniques. The wet chemistry synthesis, while scalable and cost-effective, typically requires high-temperature post-treatment for oxide phase formation since metal ions in solution are bonded to OH groups.[<a href=\"#ozae044.801-B3\">3</a>] The high temperature conditions required for HEO synthesis pose challenges, especially when targeting 2D film-shaped materials. [<a href=\"#ozae044.801-B4\">4</a>] Among wet chemistry methods, the sol-gel process emerges as a reliable approach for synthesizing metal oxide nanoparticles from a solution by employing a gel-forming substance. This method involves three main stages: sol formation, gelation, and drying-densification. Sol-gel synthesis offers numerous advantages, including low-temperature processing, ease of composition control, and the ability to produce materials with unique properties such as high surface area, porosity, and homogeneous distribution of dopants.[<a href=\"#ozae044.801-B5\">5</a>] In recent years, several HEOs have been synthesized using sol-gel methods.[<a href=\"#ozae044.801-B6\">6-9</a>] However, understanding the formation mechanism of ultra-fine porous or 2D HEO structures requires insights into intermediate states between precursor to HEOs through in situ studies and direct observations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bcb4c4eb08a8c19f3a6af230fe0d2a05a239b5a6b5165d636a5210122a3805c2","category":"Environment"}
