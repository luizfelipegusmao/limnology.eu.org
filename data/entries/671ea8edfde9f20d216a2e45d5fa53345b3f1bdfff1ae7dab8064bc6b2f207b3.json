{"title":"Aflatoxin Contamination Association with Seed Coat Biochemical Markers in Peanut under Intermittent Drought","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0411/v1","date":1722932631000,"content":"In peanut aflatoxin contamination (AC) increases as the severity of drought stress increases. Identifying drought-tolerant (DT) genotypes with resistance to A. flavus in semi-arid tropics may aid in development of peanuts that minimising AC. The main goal was to identify the DT genotypes, resistant to A. flavus and AC. The experiments were conducted at ICRISAT Sahelian Center on fifty-five genotypes assessed in adjacent intermittent water-stressed (WS) from 60th DAS to maturity and well-watered (WW) conditions in a randomized complete block design. The yields and components, the incidence of A flavus colonisation, AC and the seed coat total polyphenol (SCTPP) were estimated. Water deficit reduced pod yield, seed yield, and haulm yield up to 19.49%, 27.24% and 22.07% respectively and increased the immature pods plant-1 (IMPN), and AC up to 67.16% and 54.95%. The genotypes ICG 2106, ICG 311, ICG 4684, ICG 4543, and ICG 1415 maintained high yield under WS, less of IMPN with intact seed coat and the lowest AC variation between WW and WS. The DT genotypes showed the relationship with aflatoxin resistance and SCTPP (r2=0.80; r2=0.82) respectively under WW and WS. These results can be used to select the genotype that combine DT and minimising AC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"671ea8edfde9f20d216a2e45d5fa53345b3f1bdfff1ae7dab8064bc6b2f207b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
