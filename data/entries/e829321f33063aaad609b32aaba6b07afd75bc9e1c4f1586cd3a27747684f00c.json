{"title":"Research on the path of green technology innovation driven by the Environmental Protection Tax Law: Based on data of heavy polluting enterprises","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308215","date":1722348000000,"content":"<p>by Wei Tao, Jian-ya Zhou, Ye-ling Zhao</p>\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Protection Tax Law (EPTL) is a compulsory environmental regulation measure adopted by China to deal with environmental problems. However, with the advancement of implementation, the EPTL produces a dissimilation effect and damages the realization of the Porter hypothesis effect. The study examines the dissimilation effect of green technology innovation regulated by the EPTL using sample data from heavy pollution firms in China. According to the empirical test results: (1) the coordination between levies and administrations, differential tax rate setting, tax information sharing, definition of the scope of levy and administration, tax declaration counseling, and tax rate level verification produce the dissimilation effect; (2) the Porter hypothesis effect of the EPTL is the most significant in medium-sized enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises. By constructing the research model group of dissimilation effect, this study analyzes the application of environmental regulation in Chinaâ€™s social and economic background, thus providing a reference for developing of the green economy.","author":"Wei Tao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e829321f33063aaad609b32aaba6b07afd75bc9e1c4f1586cd3a27747684f00c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
