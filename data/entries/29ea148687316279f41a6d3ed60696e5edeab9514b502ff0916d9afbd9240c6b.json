Firstly, the collision risk between ships is determined by the closest encounter distance (DCPA) and closest encounter time (TCPA). Secondly, a decision objective function is established based on rules, degree of ship deviation, and ship risk. Finally, the prediction mechanism is used to calculate the minimum value of the objective function and complete the collision avoidance decision. The simulation results show that in the scenario of multiple ship encounters, the collision avoidance model can achieve safe collision avoidance with a smaller steering frequency and a shorter col-lision avoidance time. The proposed multi ship collision avoidance model can provide reference for collision avoidance decision-making in multi ship encounter scenarios, which helps to im-prove the collision avoidance efficiency in multi ship collision avoidance","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"29ea148687316279f41a6d3ed60696e5edeab9514b502ff0916d9afbd9240c6b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
