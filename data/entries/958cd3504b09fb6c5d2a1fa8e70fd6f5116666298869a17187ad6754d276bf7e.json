{"title":"Beyond the Valve: Incidence, Outcomes, and Modifiable Factors of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients with Endocarditis Undergoing Valve Surgery â€” A Retrospective, Single-Center Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1204/v1","date":1718702449000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Infectious Endocarditis often requires surgical intervention, with postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) posing a significant concern. This retrospective study aimed to investigate AKI incidence, its impact on short-term mortality, and identify modifiable factors in patients with endocarditis scheduled for valve surgery. Methods: This single center study enrolled 130 consecutive endocarditis patients from 2013 to 2021 undergoing valve surgery. Creatinine levels were monitored pre- and postoperatively, and AKI was defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Patient demographics, comorbidities, procedural details, and complications were recorded. Primary outcomes included AKI incidence, the relevance of creatinine levels for AKI detection, and the association of AKI with 30-, 60- and 180-day mortality. Modifiable factors contributing to AKI were explored as secondary outcomes. Results: Postoperatively, 35.4% developed AKI. The highest creatinine elevation occurred on the 2nd postoperative day. Best predictive value for AKI was a creatinine level of 1.35 mg/dl on the 2nd day (AUC: 0.901; sensitivity: 0.89, specificity: 0.79). Elevated creatinine levels on the 2nd day were robust predictors for short-term mortality at 30, 60 and 180 days postoperatively (AUC ranging from 0.708 to 0.789). CK-MB levels at 24 hours postoperatively and minimum hemoglobin during surgery were identified as independent predictors for AKI in logistic regression. Conclusions: This study highlights the crucial role of creatinine levels in predicting short-term mortality in surgical endocarditis patients. A specific threshold (1.35 mg/dl) provides a practical marker for risk stratification, offering insights for refining perioperative strategies and optimizing outcomes in this challenging patient population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"958cd3504b09fb6c5d2a1fa8e70fd6f5116666298869a17187ad6754d276bf7e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
