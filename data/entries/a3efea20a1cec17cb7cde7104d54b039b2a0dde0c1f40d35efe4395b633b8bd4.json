{"title":"Advancing Physiatric Care: A Comprehensive Case Study on Laser Therapy and Hydrotherapy Integration Post-Femoral Head and Neck Resection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1702/v1","date":1721641779000,"content":"Hip dysplasia is a prevalent hereditary condition affecting dogs and cats, characterized by inadequate development of the hip joint. This condition leads to pain due to capsular distension, microfractures, and joint incongruity in young animals, ultimately progressing to osteoarthritis in adult and elderly animals. The pursuit of pain relief and improved quality of life for individuals with osteoarthritis has been a focal point in several studies. In this context, veterinary physiotherapy has gained prominence in small animal practice, serving as both palliative care and a supportive modality in the clinical or post-surgical management of degenerative joint diseases. Laser therapy and hydrotherapy, recognized for their analgesic effects and capacity to promote muscle mass gain, have garnered attention for their potential efficacy in treating joint diseases. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of super pulsed laser therapy and controlled low-impact exercises (water treadmill) on a patient recovering from surgery involving bilateral femoral head and forehead resection. We observed positive outcomes, including pain resolution, improved muscle mass, and enhanced range of motion, contributing to the patient's overall recovery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a3efea20a1cec17cb7cde7104d54b039b2a0dde0c1f40d35efe4395b633b8bd4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
