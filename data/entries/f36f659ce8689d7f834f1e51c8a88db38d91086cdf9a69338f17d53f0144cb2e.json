{"title":"Survival Determinants in Glioblastoma: An Insight into Biopsy-Only Patient Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2062/v1","date":1727334979000,"content":"Glioblastoma is a challenge in neuro-oncology, with survival significantly\ninfluenced mainly by extent of resection and molecular markers. Despite\nadvancements, the prognosis for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma remains poor,\nparticularly when surgical resection is not possible. However, some patients\nexhibit unexpectedly extended survival despite the extent of resection. This study aims to analyze the determinants that contribute to these atypical survival rates among glioblastoma patients who have had solely biopsy procedures. \nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with IDH-\nwildtype glioblastomas at our institution from 2017 to 2021, who underwent\nbiopsy only. The study focused on evaluating the impact of demographic\ncharacteristics, clinical features, molecular markers and treatment modalities on\nsurvival outcomes (Overall Survival (OS) and Progression-Free Survival (PFS)).\nStatistical analyses included survival analysis and logistic regression for\nevaluating associations between OS and preoperative characteristics and\npostoperative treatments.\nThe cohort included 99 patients, with a median age at diagnosis of 65.5\nyears. Median OS and PFS were 6.0 and 3.6 months, respectively. The\nmultivariate analysis revealed that higher KPS scores before biopsy, no contrast\nuptake on imaging and any adjuvant therapy, particularly the use of\nbevacizumab, were independently associated to increased OS (HR=0.97, p=0.009.\nHR=0.7, p=0.015; HR=0.27, p=0.002, respectively). Out of 99 patients, 77.8%\nsurvived past the 3-month threshold, with 87.0% of this receiving adjuvant\ntreatment. Only 8% of patients survived past 24 months, and in this group of patients, MGMT Methylation was observed in just 25% of cases. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a better prognosis with any type of adjuvant therapy across all patients, particularly so in those with KPS â‰¥70. Age did not significantly affect survival outcomes (OR=1.00, p=0.835). \nOur findings reveal that any adjuvant treatment, no contrast uptake on imaging and higher preoperative KPS are key determinants of survival in IDH wildtype glioblastoma and should therefore be considered when deciding whether to perform a biopsy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f36f659ce8689d7f834f1e51c8a88db38d91086cdf9a69338f17d53f0144cb2e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
