{"title":"A miniaturized ultra-wideband filter with high rejection and selectivity based on dual-notch bands","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306730","date":1722607200000,"content":"<p>by Mingming Gao, Ya He, Jingchang Nan, Zhenzhi Yang, Congying Wang</p>\r\n\r\nA novel compact and highly selective Ultra Wide Band (UWB) filter is proposed using multimode resonator (MMR) technology. To begin with, the filter’s ultra-wideband performance is achieved by coupling a stepped-triangular multimode resonator with input-output feedlines. Furthermore, dual-notch band characteristics are realized at 6.80 GHz and 9.82 GHz, employing asymmetric coupled lines and the split ring resonator (SRR) methods. Eventually, by using a Defected Ground Structure (DGS), the filter’s correct transmission zero is deepened, further enhancing the out-of-band suppression performance at higher frequencies. The measured results are in excellent agreement with the experimental results, and the filter has a passband range of 3.52-11.68 GHz, a center frequency of 7.59 GHz, an insertion loss of just 0.61 dB, and a return loss of more than 18 dB. The transmission zeros have a rejection capability of more than 47 dB attenuation, and the rectangular coefficient of the filter is 1.34, which is outstanding for filtering out the interference signals in the parasitic passband with superior selectivity. The overall structure is compact, and the size is just 0.41λ<sub>g</sub>×0.20λ<sub>g</sub>. The filter can be used for UWB system filtering and also to avoid interference from some Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) IEEE 802.11 series and x-band satellite link frequency bands.","author":"Mingming Gao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a753e768c53e0071e8d99e3e75199c58396dc5b6481aa807af43300364000ce7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
