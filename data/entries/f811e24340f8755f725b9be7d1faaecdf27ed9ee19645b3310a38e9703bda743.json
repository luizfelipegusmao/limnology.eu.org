{"title":"Effects of increasing dietary arginine supply during the three first weeks after weaning on pig growth performance, plasma amino acid concentrations, and health status","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae047/7638498?rss=1","date":1711929600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A total of 425 weaned pigs (Exp. 1: 225 pigs [5.8 ± 0.9 kg]; Exp. 2: 200 pigs [6.1 ± 1.2 kg]) were used to determine the optimal dietary standardized ileal digestible (<strong>SID</strong>) arginine (<strong>Arg</strong>) level in early nursery diets based on growth and health responses. The basal diet in Exp.1 was formulated to meet SID Arg recommendation (0.66%; <a href=\"#CIT0032\">NRC, 2012</a>) and in Exp. 2, SID Arg was set to simulate current industry practices for feeding nursery pigs (1.15 %). Basal diets were supplemented with 0.3%, 0.6%, 0.9%, and 1.2% of <span>l</span>-arginine to provide five levels of dietary SID Arg. Experimental diets were fed during phases I (days 0 to 7) and II (days 8 to 21) with common diets until market. Feed disappearance and body weight (<strong>BW</strong>) were measured on days 7, 14, 21, and 43. Final BW was recorded at first removal of pigs for market. Pen fecal score was assigned daily from days 0 to 21. Plasma immunoglobulin A (<strong>IgA</strong>) was determined on days 0, 7, and 14 and amino acids (<strong>AAs</strong>) concentration and plasma urea nitrogen (<strong>PUN</strong>) on days 0 and 14. Orthogonal polynomial contrasts were used to determine the linear and quadratic effects of dietary Arg. Optimal SID Arg was determined by fitting the data with piecewise regression, using growth performance as the primary response variable. In Exp. 1, dietary Arg linearly increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.1) BW, average daily gain (<strong>ADG</strong>), and gain to feed ratio (<strong>G:F</strong>) ratio on day 21, as well as reduced (<span>χ</span><sup>2</sup> = 0.004) the percentage of pigs that lost weight (<strong>PLW</strong>) in week 1 by 29%. Dietary Arg resulted in linear improvement (<span>P</span> = 0.082) of ADG for the overall nursery period and quadratic improvement (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.1) of final BW at marketing. In Exp. 2, dietary Arg linearly increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) ADG and average daily feed intake (<strong>ADFI</strong>) in week 1, BW and ADFI (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.1) on day 14, as well as reduced (<span>χ</span><sup>2</sup> ≤ 0.001) PLW in week 1. From days 0 to 21, G:F was improved quadratically (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.1). Dietary Arg linearly increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.1) ADG and BW on day 43. Dietary Arg supplementation decreased the incidence (<span>χ</span><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.05) of soft and watery feces during the first weeks after weaning and lower concentration of plasma IgA on days 7 and 14. Dietary Arg linearly and/or quadratically influenced plasma AA concentrations (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), including an increase in Arg, Leu, Phe, Val, citrulline, ornithine, and PUN concentrations. Overall, weaned pigs exhibit optimal nursery growth performance and health when provided with dietary SID Arg ranging from 1.5% to 1.9%. This dietary range contributes to a reduction in the occurrence of fall-back pigs and improvements in final BW at marketing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"f811e24340f8755f725b9be7d1faaecdf27ed9ee19645b3310a38e9703bda743","category":"Environment"}
