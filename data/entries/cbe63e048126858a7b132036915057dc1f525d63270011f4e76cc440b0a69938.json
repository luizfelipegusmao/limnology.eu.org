{"title":"Changes in the Release of Endothelial Extracellular Vesicles CD144+, CCR6+ and CXCR3+ in Individuals With Acute Myocardial Infarction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1050/v1","date":1720776964000,"content":"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) results from vulnerable plaque rupture, causing ischemic cardiomyocyte necrosis and intense inflammation. Paradoxically, this inflammation releases factors that aid heart repair. Recent findings suggest a role for extracellular vesicles (EVs) in intercellular communication during post-AMI cardiac repair. However, EVsâ€™ tissue origin and chemokine profile in the blood of patients with AMI remains unclear. This study characterized EV tissue origin and chemokine receptor profile in the coronary and peripheral blood of patients with AMI.\nThe results reveal that vesicles isolated from coronary and peripheral blood plasma are enriched in tetraspanin (CD9) and express CD81+, CD90+, and CD144+. The vesicle size ranged between 145 and 162 nm, with the control group exhibiting smaller vesicles than the AMI group. Furthermore, all vesicles expressed CCR6+ and CXCR3+, whereas a small percentage expressed CCR4+. In addition, a decrease in CXCR3+ and CCR6+ positivity was observed in coronary and peripheral blood vesicles compared with the control. Non-difference was found in the coronary and peripheral blood for the CXCR3+ and CCR6+ markers. \nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates, for the first time, changes in the number of extracellular vesicles expressing CD144+, CXCR3+, and CCR6+ in the peripheral circulation of patients with AMI. Extracellular vesicles present in the peripheral circulation of patients with AMI hold excellent promise as a potential diagnostic tool.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbe63e048126858a7b132036915057dc1f525d63270011f4e76cc440b0a69938","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
