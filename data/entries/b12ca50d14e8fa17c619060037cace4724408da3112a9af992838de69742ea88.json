Therefore, quantitative estimation of the beam coherence is one of the important issues for the correct interpretation and enhanced quality of the experimental data in those methods. In the present study, we have developed a method to precisely measure spatial coherence in electron beams based on analysis of the Airy diffraction pattern from a selected-area (SA) aperture [<a href=\"#ozae044.155-B1\">1</a>]. Although the spatial coherence is generally measured from the visibility of the interference fringes formed by an electron biprism, the present method can be conducted without biprism in most of existing analytical TEMs if equipped with a post-column energy filter to enhance the camera length.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b12ca50d14e8fa17c619060037cace4724408da3112a9af992838de69742ea88","category":"Environment"}
