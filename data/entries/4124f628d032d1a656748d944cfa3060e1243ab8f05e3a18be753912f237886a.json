{"title":"Combating Greenwashing of Construction Products: A Critical Analysis of Environmental Product Declarations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0423/v1","date":1728378645000,"content":"Global initiatives such as the Paris Agreement and Agenda 2030 have united nations around common sustainability goals, prompting critical discussions about the true nature of sustainability. A significant concern highlighted by the United Nations is greenwashing—a practice where companies or organisations mislead the public about the environmental benefits of their products or services. Tactics employed in greenwashing include using unclear or misleading labels like “green” and “eco-friendly” or emphasising a single aspect of the product’s lifecycle that appears sustainable while ignoring others. Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) have gained prominence in response to these challenges, particularly in New Zealand, where government climate declaration regulations have fuelled their demand. This study aims to comprehensively analyse existing EPDs for construction products by identifying and evaluating EPD programs, categorising product types, assessing the completeness of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) information modules, and verifying the accuracy of declared impact values. The research methodology involves a systematic literature review, drawing data from reputable databases, including Scopus, Elsevier, Taylor &amp; Francis, MDPI, and Emerald Insight, with data analysis conducted using ATLAS.ti 9 software. Examining the current state of EPDs in New Zealand’s construction sector, this study aims to highlight best practices, identify areas for improvement, and provide a foundation for enhancing the transparency and reliability of environmental impact assessments. The findings will contribute to ongoing efforts to combat greenwashing and promote genuine sustainability in construction projects, ultimately supporting the development of more environmentally responsible building practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4124f628d032d1a656748d944cfa3060e1243ab8f05e3a18be753912f237886a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
