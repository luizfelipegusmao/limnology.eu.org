However, in 20–30% of cases, ICIs can lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which sometimes require discontinuation of treatment. Due to the increased risk of irAEs, patients with pre-existing autoimmune diseases (AI) are often advised against receiving ICIs. However, there has not been sufficient objective risk assessment for AI. In our study, we conducted logistic regression analysis to assess the risk of irAEs by analyzing 478 cases that received anti-PD-(L)1 Ab and/or anti-CTLA4 Ab at our hospital between April 3, 2017, and May 24, 2022. Among these cases, 28 (5.9%) had pre-existing AI. We selected several independent factors for analysis: gender, age, performance status (PS), cancer type, type of ICI, type of combined anti-cancer agents, best overall response, and pre-existing AI. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of AI for irAE occurrence was 2.52 [95% CI: 1.08–5.86] (p = 0.033), and the adjusted OR of AI for ICI discontinuation due to irAE was 3.32 [1.41–7.78] (p = 0.006). Patients with pre-existing AI experienced a significantly shorter irAE-free survival time compared to those without AI (median irAE-free survival: 5.7 months [95% CI: 3.5–7.8] vs 10.4 months [95% CI: 7.9–12.9], respectively, p = 0.035). Frequently observed irAEs in full ICI cohort, such as dermatologic issues (7.5%), pneumonitis (7.1%), hepatitis (4.6%), and hypothyroidism (4.2%), were often accompanied by pre-existing AI. Furthermore, pre-existing AI flared up in 6 cases (37.5% in AI-positive irAE-positive cases). The activity of AI was not related to the occurrence of irAEs. Grade 3 or higher irAEs were observed in 6 out of 20 (30.0%) cases in AI-accompanied patients complicated with irAEs. Although having a complicated AI increases the risk of irAEs, it may not necessarily be a contraindication for ICI treatment if closely monitored.
