{"title":"Effects of Rowing on Cardiac Function in Breast Cancer Survivors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0250/v1","date":1719918946000,"content":"This longitudinal study aimed to analyze the effects of a team rowing-based training program on physical fitness and anthropometric parameters in female breast cancer survivors (n=40; 56.78±6.38 years). Participants were divided into two groups: one rowed in fixed seat rowing (FSR) boats (n=20; 56.35±4.89 years) and the other in sliding seat rowing (SSR) boats (n=20; 57.20±7.7 years). Both groups engaged in two 75-minute sessions per week for 24 weeks. Significant improvements were observed in both groups in resting heart rate (FSR: -10.65 bpm; SSR: -8.45 bpm), heart rate at the beginning of the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) (FSR: -10.7 bpm; SSR: -11.25 bpm), and heart rate at the end of the test (FSR: -13.85 bpm; SSR: -20.35 bpm). Blood pressure improved significantly in both diastolic blood pressure (FSR: -12.35 mmHg; SSR: -19.25 mmHg) and systolic blood pressure (FSR: -13 mmHg; SSR: -16.95 mmHg). Additionally, both groups increased the distance covered in the 6MWT (FSR: +63.05 m; SSR: +93.65 m). These results suggest that a rowing training program is a viable and safe activity for female breast cancer survivors, improving cardiac function, blood pressure, and cardiorespiratory capacity, particularly in sliding seat boats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c0571ace2ae955889730f6349aae3209f705250b5db275659e20e3c5a8ffba09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
