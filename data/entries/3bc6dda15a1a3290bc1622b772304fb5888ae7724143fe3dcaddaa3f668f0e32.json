{"title":"Evaluation of Neutralizing Antibodies on Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Japanese Mother-Infant Pairs after COVID-19 Pandemic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0131/v1","date":1719872372000,"content":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection in young children globally. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, RSV infections have become more prevalent. Consequently, a new vaccine targeting RSV infections in pregnant women has been introduced worldwide. To estimate the effectiveness of this new vaccine for pregnant women, we investigated neutralizing antibodies against RSV in samples taken from 51 mothers and their babies. The prevalence rate of neonatal antibodies, defined as a titer of â‰¥16, was 39.2%. We found no significant differences in neonatal neutralizing antibodies based on factors, such as sex, gestational age at birth, birth weight, presence of siblings, neonatal problem, and usage of palivizumab. Neonatal neutralizing antibodies were equal to or higher than those of their mother. A new RSV vaccine targeting all pregnant women is promising, as approximately 60% of neonates had low antibody titers against RSV. However, predicting low antibody titer against RSV remains challenging. Moreover, our findings indicate efficient transmission of RSV antibodies from babies to their mothers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3bc6dda15a1a3290bc1622b772304fb5888ae7724143fe3dcaddaa3f668f0e32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
