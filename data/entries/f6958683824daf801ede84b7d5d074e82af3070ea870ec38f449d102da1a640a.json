{"title":"The Next Frontier in Tuberculosis Investigation: Automated Whole Genome Sequencing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1122/v1","date":1718606082000,"content":"A fully automated bacteria whole genome sequencing (WGS) assay was evaluated to characterize Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and non-tuberculosis Mycobacterium (NTM) clinical isolates. Results generated were highly reproducible with 100% concordance in species and sub-lineage classification, and 92% concordance between antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genotypic and phenotypic profiles. These findings demonstrate that a fully automated WGS assay, with a short turnaround time of 24.5 hours, provides timely and valuable insights into MTB outbreak investigation while providing reliable genotypic AMR profiling consistent with traditional antimicrobial susceptibility tests (AST). This study establishes a favorable proposition in the adoption of an end-to-end fully automated WGS solutions for decentralized TB diagnostics, thereby aiding in WHOâ€™s vision of tuberculosis eradication.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6958683824daf801ede84b7d5d074e82af3070ea870ec38f449d102da1a640a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
