{"title":"A simple, safe method for preserving dissolved methane in freshwater samples using benzalkonium chloride","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lom3.10632?af=R","date":1720183749000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) dissolved in water is readily consumed by CH<sub>4</sub>-oxidizing bacteria, so the possibility of the dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> concentration (dCH<sub>4</sub>) in sampled water changing before analysis is a concern. To determine the accurate in situ dCH<sub>4</sub> level, mercury chloride (HgCl<sub>2</sub>) or sodium azide (NaN<sub>3</sub>) is traditionally used for sample preservation. However, these preservatives are very toxic and great care must be taken when adding them to samples. Benzalkonium chloride (BAC), a quaternary ammonium salt cationic surfactant, is a readily available disinfectant that is less harmful to the human body than HgCl<sub>2</sub>, NaN<sub>3</sub>, and other preservatives. In this study, we investigated the usefulness of BAC in preserving dCH<sub>4</sub> in swamp water, which is a critical terrestrial source of CH<sub>4</sub>. The dCH<sub>4</sub> in samples without BAC decreased immediately after sample collection, whereas the dCH<sub>4</sub> in the samples with added BAC did not change significantly for at least 15 d. In addition, when BAC was added to 18 water samples with different water chemistries, the dCH<sub>4</sub> did not change significantly from immediately after sampling to 1 week after sampling (average difference: 3%). Thus, in the water samples used in this study, BAC effectively preserved dCH<sub>4</sub> in the samples for at least 1 week. Further testing of the effect of BAC on the preservation of dCH<sub>4</sub> in different types of water samples worldwide will help to establish a more complete, simple, and safe method.</p>","author":"Ken'ichi Osaka, \nReina Nagata, \nMoegi Inoue, \nMasayuki Itoh, \nShoko Hosoi‐Tanabe, \nHiroki Iwata","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography: Methods: Table of Contents","siteHash":"1f94d009c9004887a6eb995bba0123a0db9011ce2034714a79b9376dbd1edfea","entryHash":"703eb8bd04b54d3db89418f3325c7257d21901eab4ae0c437bb27b6fcac58562","category":"Environment"}
