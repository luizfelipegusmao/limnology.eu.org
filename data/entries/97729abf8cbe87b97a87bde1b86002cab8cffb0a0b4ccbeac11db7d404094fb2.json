{"title":"Acupuncture-Assisted Catheter Ablation in the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation: A Prospective Cohort Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2126/v1","date":1727400019000,"content":"Objective: This study aims to investigate the effects of acupuncture therapy on the quality of life, early recurrence rate, and heart rate variability in patients following radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation, as well as to assess its safety. Methods: Seventy patients were enrolled in this study. Of these, 35 patients received acupuncture treatment post-radiofrequency ablation, forming the experimental group, while the remaining 35 patients received sham acupuncture treatment, constituting the control group. The acupuncture group targeted the Xinju (BL15), Neiguan (PC6), and Shenmen (HT07) points, whereas the sham acupuncture group received sham interventions at three non-meridian and non-acupoints. Both groups underwent acupuncture treatment twice weekly for a total of 24 consecutive sessions. After three months, the total scores on the Atrial Fibrillation Specific Quality of Life Scale (AFEQT)—including symptom scores, daily activity scores, treatment anxiety scores, atrial fibrillation control scores, and symptom improvement satisfaction scores—along with atrial fibrillation burden and satisfaction scores, were compared between the two patient groups. Additionally, the recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation, frequency of hospitalizations due to arrhythmia, and incidence of adverse events occurring three months post-catheter ablation were also assessed. No significant differences were observed in the general baseline characteristics between the two groups. Results: The total AFEQT scores—including symptom scores, daily activity scores, treatment anxiety scores, atrial fibrillation control scores, and symptom improvement satisfaction scores—were significantly higher in both groups post-treatment compared to pre-treatment. Notably, patients in the experimental group exhibited statistically significant improvements in daily activity scores, treatment anxiety scores, and symptom improvement satisfaction scores compared to those in the control group (P&lt;0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding other measured outcomes. Conclusion: Acupuncture-assisted treatment of atrial fibrillation can improve the clinical efficacy of drugs and catheter ablation, help maintain sinus rhythm, increase sinus rhythm conversion rate, reduce ventricular rate, and shorten conversion time, and is safe and reliable.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97729abf8cbe87b97a87bde1b86002cab8cffb0a0b4ccbeac11db7d404094fb2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
