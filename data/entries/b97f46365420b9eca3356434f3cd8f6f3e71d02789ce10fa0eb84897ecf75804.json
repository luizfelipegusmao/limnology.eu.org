{"title":"Topic Modeling as a Tool to identify Research Diversity: A Study Across Dental Disciplines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1649/v1","date":1724319275000,"content":"This study investigates the diversity and evolution of research topics within the dental sciences from 1994 to 2023 using topic modeling and Shannon's entropy as a measure of research diversity. We analyzed a dataset of 412036 scientific articles across six dental disciplines: Orthodontics, Pros-thodontics, Periodontics, Implant Dentistry, Oral Surgery, and Restorative Dentistry. This research relies on BERTopic to identify distinct topics within each field. The study revealed significant shifts in research focus over time, with some disciplines exhibiting robust growth in article numbers such as Periodontics and Prosthodontics. The application of Shannon's entropy revealed an increasing diversification of research efforts in disciplines such as Restorative Dentistry, while others, like Prosthodontics, in spite of their size and their high number of research topics, maintain a more specialized research focus. Taken together, our findings describe the dynamic nature of dental re-search and highlight the balance shifts in research focus across several key areas of Dentistry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b97f46365420b9eca3356434f3cd8f6f3e71d02789ce10fa0eb84897ecf75804","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
