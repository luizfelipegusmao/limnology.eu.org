{"title":"Short-term Comparison of Switch to Brolucizumab or Faricimab in Eyes with Aflibercept-Resistant Neovascular AMD","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1712/v1","date":1719326204000,"content":"Backgorund and Objectives: In this study, we aimed to evaluate and compare the changes in visual and structural outcomes in patients with intravitreal aflibercept (IVA)-resistant neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) switched to either intravitreal brolucizumab (IVBr) or intravitreal faricimab (IVF) injections in a clinical setting. Materials and Methods: This obser-vational clinical study included 20 eyes of 20 patients switched to brolucizumab and 15 eyes of 14 patients switched to faricimab for aflibercept-resistant nAMD. We measured the structural outcome (central macular thickness (CMT)) and the visual outcome (best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA); logMAR) as follows: just before the most recent IVA injection (B0), one month after the most recent IVA injection (B1), just before the first IVBr or IVF injection (A0), one month after (A1) and three months after (A3) the first IVBr or IVF injection. Results: BCVA showed significant im-provement at A1 (0.25 ± 0.34) and at A3 (0.19 ± 0.24) compared to A0 (0.38 ± 0.35) in IVBr group (p = 0.0156, p = 0.0166, respectively). CMT (μm) was significantly thinner at A1 (IVBr; 240.55 ± 51.82, IVF; 234.91 ± 47.29) and at A3 (IVBr; 243.21 ± 76.15, IVF; 250.50 ± 72.61) compared to at A0 (IVBr; 303.55 ± 79.18, IVF; 270.33 ± 77.62) in IVBr group (A1; p = 0.0093, A3; p = 0.0026) and in IVF group (A1; p = 0.0161, A3; p = 0.0093). There was no significant difference in BCVA and CMT improvement observed between two groups at any time point (p &gt; 0.05 for all). Conclusion: Switching from aflibercept to either brolucizumab or faricimab has a significant anatomical ef-fect on eyes with aflibercept-resistant nAMD and both treatments appear to be effective short-term treatment options. There is a trend towards greater visual improvements and reductions in CMT with brolucizumab.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2778b1c76766475b23e874c626c342fa46ef945fd42780ec20a731bc20d52046","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
