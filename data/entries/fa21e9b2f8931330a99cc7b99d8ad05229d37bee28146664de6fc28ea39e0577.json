{"title":"The Delta to Gamma Phase Transformation in Plutonium","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.525/7720042?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Late in his career, Terry Mitchell began applying his keen crystallography acumen to the mechanisms of phase transformations in pure and alloyed plutonium (Pu). Of the six solid-solid phase transformations found in these materials, two have distinctly different forward and reverse transformation behavior: δ↔γ in pure plutonium and δ↔α′^ in stabilized <span>δ</span>-phase alloys. Both transformations are characterized by large volume changes, with ΔV δ→γ= ∼7% and ΔV δ→α′^= ∼20%. The δ→α′^ transformation typically occurs below -100 °C in alloys with less than ∼3 atomic % of a <span>δ</span>-phase stabilizer [<a href=\"#ozae044.525-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.525-B2\">2</a>]. The transformation from face-centered cubic <span>δ</span>-Pu to monoclinic <span>α</span>´ is martensitic and progresses until strain arrests further transformation at about 30 vol. % α′^. Upon heating, the reverse transformation is characterized by a large hysteresis (∼150 °C) and by a series of steps or bursts that are controlled by an autocatalytic and self-quenching phenemona [<a href=\"#ozae044.525-B3\">3</a>]. Details of this transition were studied in detail using transmission electron microscopy by Zocco et al. [<a href=\"#ozae044.525-B4\">4</a>], and Hirth et al. [<a href=\"#ozae044.525-B5\">5</a>] used phase transformation modeling to reveal the crystallographic mechanisms.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fa21e9b2f8931330a99cc7b99d8ad05229d37bee28146664de6fc28ea39e0577","category":"Environment"}
