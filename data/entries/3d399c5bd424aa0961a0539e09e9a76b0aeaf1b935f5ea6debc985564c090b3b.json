{"title":"Dissolving the Self, Embracing the Earth: A Philosophical Exploration of Psychedelics, Self-Transcendence, and Environmental Connection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1664/v2","date":1714128611000,"content":"The experience of ego dissolution and self-transcendence induced by psychedelic substances offers a profound challenge to our conventional understanding of the self and our relationship with the natural world. This paper delves into the philosophical underpinnings and implications of this phenomenon, exploring how the temporary breakdown of ego boundaries during a psychedelic experience may foster a sense of profound interconnectedness with nature. Drawing from Western and Eastern philosophical traditions, as well as recent insights from neuroscience and consciousness studies, we examine the potential of psychedelic-induced self-transcendence to catalyze a shift in our perspectives on the human-nature relationship. The paper investigates the philosophical implications of this experience, including its resonance with deep ecological philosophies and its potential to inspire more ecocentric ethical frameworks. Furthermore, we explore the possible practical implications of fostering a sense of ecological connectedness through psychedelics, such as promoting environmentally sustainable behaviors and addressing the pressing challenges of climate change and ecological degradation. Ultimately, this exploration highlights the value of engaging with altered states of consciousness as a means to reconsider our place within the intricate web of life on Earth.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d399c5bd424aa0961a0539e09e9a76b0aeaf1b935f5ea6debc985564c090b3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
