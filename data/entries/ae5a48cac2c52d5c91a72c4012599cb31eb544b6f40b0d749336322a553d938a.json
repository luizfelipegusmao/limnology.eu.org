A discovery from Tomi Simola, a satellite tracking hobbyist living near Helsinki, Finland, appears to confirm this suspicion.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002584#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002584&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ae5a48cac2c52d5c91a72c4012599cb31eb544b6f40b0d749336322a553d938a","category":"Tech"}
