{"title":"Exploring the Mechanism of Topical Application of Clematis Florida in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis through Network Pharmacology and Experimental Validation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1291/v1","date":1718773401000,"content":"Clematis Florida (CF) is a folk medicinal herb in the southeast of China, which is traditionally used for treating osteoarticular diseases. However, the mechanism of action remains unclear. The present study used network pharmacology and experimental validation to explore the mechanism of CF in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identified 50 main compounds of CF, then the targets of them were obtained from TCMSP, ETCM, ITCM and Swiss TargetPrediction databases. RA disease related targets were obtained from DisGenet, OMIM and GeneCards databases. 99 overlapped targets were obtained using Venn diagram. The protein-protein interaction network (PPI)、the compound-target network (CT) and the compound-potential target genes-signaling pathways network (CPS) were built and analyzed. The results showed that the core compounds were screened as oleanolic acid, oleic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and syringic acid. And the core therapeutic targets were identified as PTGS2 (COX-2), MAPK1, NF-κB1, TNF, RELA by network pharmacology analysis, which belong to the MAPK signaling pathway and NF-κB signaling pathway. The animal experiments indicated that topical application of CF showed significant anti-inflammatory activity in mice model of xylene-induced ear edema and strong analgesic effect on acetic acid-induced withing. Furthermore, in the rat model of adjuvant arthritis (AA), topical administration of CF could alleviate toe swelling and ameliorate joint damage. The elevation of serum content of IL-6, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and RF caused by adjuvant arthritis were reduced by CF treatment. Western blotting tests showed that CF may exert regulation on the ERK and NF-κB pathway. The results provided a new perspective for the topical application of CF on RA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4360ab4469fc600700c9cc0eb9959b992443b6a11c6aa6dc55580e1db392c6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
