Gal-Chi-NPs were fabricated by the ionic gelation method, and it was characterized by several studies such as dynamic light spectroscopy, Fourier-transforms infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray, atomic force microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. We have obtained that Gal-Chi-NPs displayed 182.2 nm with crystal, smooth surface, and heat stability in nature. Gal-Chi-NPs induce significant toxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells that compared with normal NIH-3T3 cells. A significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction was observed in Gal-Chi-NPs treated MDA-MB-231. Flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) is a crucial protein involved in long patch base excision repair that is involved in repairing the chemotherapeutic mediated DNA-damaged base. Therefore, inhibition of FEN-1 protein expression is a crucial target for enhancing chemotherapeutical efficacy. In this study, we have obtained that Gal-Chi-NPs treatment enhanced the DNA damage by observing increased p-H2AX, PARP1; and suppressed the expression of FEN-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, Gal-Chi-NPs inhibited the expression of tumor proliferating markers p-PI3K, AKT, cyclin-D1, PCNA, and BCL-2; induced proapoptotic proteins (Bax and caspase-3) in MDA-MB 231 cells. Thus, Gal-Chi-NPs induce DNA damage and apoptotic features and inhibit tumor proliferation by suppressing FEN-1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells.</p>","author":"Monica Velaiyan, \nRajasekar Muthusamy, \nMiguel Kativa, \nAsaikkutti Annamalai, \nAnnamalai Govindhan, \nParthipan Punniyakotti, \nAgilan Balupillai","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"0cefa9ecc9b1d1a3abb743297c747a85a55b61c0ead6129b45fb4d8572cc6c29","category":"Environment"}
