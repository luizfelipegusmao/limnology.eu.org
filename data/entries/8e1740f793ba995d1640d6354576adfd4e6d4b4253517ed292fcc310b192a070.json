The aim of this study was to explore occupational and reproductive health challenges faced by women tobacco farm labors in Mysore District, India. We conducted interview and six focus group discussions among 41 women tobacco farm laborers. Codes and themes were generated based on deductive and inductive approaches using the socio-ecological model. Participants reported symptoms of green tobacco sickness including headaches, back pain, gastric problems, weakness, and allergies during menstruation, pre-natal, and post-natal periods. Participants had poor awareness about the health effects of tobacco farming and there were gender inequalities in wages and use of personal protective equipment. Participants received support from family and commu-nity health workers during their pregnancy and post-natal period. Women reported wanting ma-ternity benefits from the tobacco board, monetary support, and nutritional supplements. There is a need for health education about the environmental dangers of tobacco among farm laborers, and more supportive policies for women farmworkers during pregnancy and post-natal periods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e1740f793ba995d1640d6354576adfd4e6d4b4253517ed292fcc310b192a070","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
