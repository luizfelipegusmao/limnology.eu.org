To harness its potential, accurate modeling of photovoltaic (PV) systems is crucial. However, this relies on estimating elusive parameters concealed within PV models. This study addresses these challenges through innovative parameter estimation by introducing the logarithmic spiral search and selective mechanism-based arithmetic optimization algorithm (Ls-AOA). Ls-AOA is an improved version of the arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA). It combines logarithmic search behavior and a selective mechanism to improve exploration capabilities. This makes it easier to obtain accurate parameter extraction. The RTC France solar cell is employed as a benchmark case study in order to ensure consistency and impartiality. A standardized experimental framework integrates Ls-AOA into the parameter tuning process for three PV models: single-diode, double-diode, and three-diode models. The choice of RTC France solar cell underscores its significance in the field, providing a robust evaluation platform for Ls-AOA. Statistical and convergence analyses enable rigorous assessment. Ls-AOA consistently attains low RMSE values, indicating accurate current-voltage characteristic estimation. Smooth convergence behavior reinforces its efficacy. Comparing Ls-AOA to other methods strengthens its superiority in optimizing solar PV model parameters, showing that it has the potential to improve the use of solar energy.","author":"Erdal Eker","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1aaa8869f1b6e6d5a31117d2203e2434b387a0601490195061b9802c33bfa6b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
