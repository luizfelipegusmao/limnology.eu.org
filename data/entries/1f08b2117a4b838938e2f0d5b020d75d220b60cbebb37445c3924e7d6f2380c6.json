{"title":"Unraveling Electric Vehicle Preference: A Machine Learning Analysis of Vehicle Choice in Multi-Vehicle Households in the United States","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0945/v1","date":1715685158000,"content":"Electric vehicles (EVs) play a significant role in reducing carbon emissions. In the US, EVs are mostly owned by multi-vehicle households, and their usage is primarily studied in the context of vehicle miles traveled. This study takes a unique approach by analyzing EV usage through the lens of vehicle choice (between EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles) within multi-vehicle households. A two-step machine-learning framework (clustering and decision trees) is proposed. The framework determines the preferred trip category for EV use and captures the effects of household attributes, driver attributes, built-environment factors, and gas prices on EV use in multi-vehicle households. Results indicate that discretionary trips (accumulated local effect = 0.037) are mostly preferred for EV use. EV preference is more pronounced among households with fewer workers (&lt;2) and lower income levels. These findings are valuable for policymakers and auto manufacturers in targeting specific market segments and promoting EV adoption.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f08b2117a4b838938e2f0d5b020d75d220b60cbebb37445c3924e7d6f2380c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
