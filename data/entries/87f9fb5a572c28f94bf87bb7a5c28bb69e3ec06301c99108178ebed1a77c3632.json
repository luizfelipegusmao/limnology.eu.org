{"title":"Association between clinical biomechanical metrics of cervical spine function and pain or disability in people with neuromusculoskeletal neck pain: Protocol for a systematic review and planned meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303365","date":1715349600000,"content":"<p>by Saghar Soltanabadi, Sima Vatandoost, Michael J. Lukacs, Alison Rushton, David M. Walton</p>\r\nIntroduction/Background <p>Neck pain is a burdensome condition associated with pain, disability, and economic cost. Neck pain has been associated with observable changes in neuromuscular function and biomechanics. Prior research shows impairments in kinematic control, including reduced mobility, velocity, and smoothness of cervical motion. However, the strength of association between these impairments and patient-reported pain and disability is unclear rendering development of novel and relevant rehabilitation strategies difficult.The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize existing evidence on the strength of association between clinical biomechanical metrics of neck function (ROM, strength, acceleration, accuracy, smoothness, etc.) and patient-reported neck pain and disability.</p> Methods/Analysis <p>This protocol follows Cochrane guidelines and adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P). MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science and Scopus will be searched, along with the gray literature, up to 20 November 2023, using terms and keywords derived from initial scoping searches. Observational studies, including cohorts and cross-sectional studies, that explore associations between clinical biomechanics of the neck and patient-reported outcomes of neck pain or disability will be included. Two reviewers will independently perform study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment (National Institute of Health tool). Data will be synthesized using either a random effects meta-analytic approach or qualitatively using a modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, dependent on the homogeneity of data available.</p> Discussion and relevance <p>This review addresses a gap in the literature by systematically synthesizing findings on the relationship between neck function impairments and patient-reported outcomes. It will identify priorities for neck pain rehabilitation and gaps in current knowledge.</p> Dissemination <p>The results of this review will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication, conference presentation, and lay language summaries posted on an open-access website.</p> Trial registration <p>PROSPERO Registration number: CRD42023417317. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42023417317.</p>","author":"Saghar Soltanabadi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"87f9fb5a572c28f94bf87bb7a5c28bb69e3ec06301c99108178ebed1a77c3632","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
