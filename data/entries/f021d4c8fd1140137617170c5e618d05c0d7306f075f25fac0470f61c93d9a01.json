Foster, Philippe Gallay</p>\r\n\r\nA family of Peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases), called Cyclophilins, localize to numerous intracellular and extracellular locations where they contribute to a variety of essential functions. We previously reported that non-immunosuppressive pan-cyclophilin inhibitor drugs like reconfilstat (CRV431) or NV556 decreased multiple aspects of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice under two different non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mouse models. Both CRV431 and NV556 inhibit several cyclophilin isoforms, among which cyclophilin D (CypD) has not been previously investigated in this context. It is unknown whether it is necessary to simultaneously inhibit multiple cyclophilin family members to achieve therapeutic benefits or if loss-of-function of one is sufficient. Furthermore, narrowing down the isoform most responsible for a particular aspect of NAFLD/NASH, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), would allow for more precise future therapies. Features of human diabetes-linked NAFLD/NASH can be reliably replicated in mice by administering a single high dose of streptozotocin to disrupt pancreatic beta cells, in conjunction with a high sugar, high fat, high cholesterol western diet over the course of 30 weeks. Here we show that while both wild-type (WT) and Ppif-/- CypD KO mice develop multipe severe NASH disease features under this model, the formation of HCC nodules was significantly blunted only in the CypD KO mice. Furthermore, of differentially expressed transcripts in a qPCR panel of select HCC-related genes, nearly all were downregulated in the CypD KO background. Cyclophilin inhibition is a promising and novel avenue of treatment for diet-induced NAFLD/NASH. This study highlights the impact of CypD loss-of-function on the development of HCC, one of the most severe disease outcomes.","author":"Winston T.
