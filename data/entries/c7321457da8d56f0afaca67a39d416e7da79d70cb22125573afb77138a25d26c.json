{"title":"Adaptive Beamforming, Cell-Free Resource Allocation and NOMA in Large-Scale Wireless Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1977/v1","date":1729786822000,"content":"The goal of the study presented in this work is to evaluate the performance of a proposed adaptive beamforming approach when combined with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in cell-free massive multiple input multiple output (CF m-MIMO) orientations. In this context, cooperative beamforming is employed taking into consideration the geographically adjacent access points (APs) of a virtual cell, aiming to minimize co-channel interference (CCI) among mobile stations (MSs) participating in NOMA transmission. Performance is evaluated statistically via extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in a two-tier wireless orientation. As results indicate, for high data rate services various key performance indicators (KPIs) can be improved compared to orthogonal multiple access, such as the minimum number of users in the topology as well as the available PRBs for downlink transmission. Although in NOMA transmission more directional beamforming configurations are required to compensate for the increased CCI levels, the increase in the number of hardware elements is reduced compared to the corresponding gain in the considered KPIs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c7321457da8d56f0afaca67a39d416e7da79d70cb22125573afb77138a25d26c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
