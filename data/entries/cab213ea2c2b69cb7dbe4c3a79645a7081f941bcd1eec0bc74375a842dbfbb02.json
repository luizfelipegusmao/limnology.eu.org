{"title":"Correlation of handgrip strength with quality of life-adjusted pulmonary function in adults","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300295","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by Hae In Jung, Kang-Mo Gu, So Young Park, Moon Seong Baek, Won Young Kim, Jae-Chol Choi, Jong-Wook Shin, Jae-Yeol Kim, Young D. Chang, Jae-Woo Jung</p>\r\nBackground <p>Handgrip strength (HGS) is acknowledged as a key indicator of overall physical fitness and is associated with various health outcomes.</p> Objectives <p>This research investigates the correlation between HGS and quality of life (QoL), focusing on its relation to pulmonary function in the general adult population.</p> Method <p>The study involved 19,402 participants aged 40 and above, spanning from 2014 to 2019, who underwent pulmonary function and HGS tests. Participants were categorized based on lung function, and regression analyses were employed to examine the relationship between HGS and QoL, with adjustments made for lung function.</p> Results <p>The average age of the cohort was 58.2 years, comprising 44.6% males and 41.2% smokers. Out of the 18,708 participants who completed the European Quality of Life Scale-Five Dimensions (EQ-5D-3L) assessment, higher severity levels in mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression were linked to lower HGS in both sexes. Additionally, among the 3,723 participants who completed the Health-related Quality of Life Instrument with 8 Items (HINT-8) assessment, higher severity levels in pain, work, and depression were associated with lower HGS in men. In women, higher severity levels in climbing stairs, pain, vitality, and work correlated with lower HGS.</p> Conclusions <p>As problems indicated by EQ-5D worsened, there was a consistent decrease in handgrip strength (HGS) across both genders. The HINT-8 assessment further revealed that increased severity in pain and work-related issues led to reduced HGS in both men and women. This study highlights the relationship between HGS and Quality of Life (QoL), taking lung function into consideration, and underscores the importance of HGS as a potential marker of physical health and fitness.</p>","author":"Hae In Jung","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cab213ea2c2b69cb7dbe4c3a79645a7081f941bcd1eec0bc74375a842dbfbb02","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
