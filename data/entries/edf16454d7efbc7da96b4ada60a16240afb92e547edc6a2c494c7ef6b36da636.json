{"title":"Minireview on the Use of Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics in Modulating Disturbance of Gastrointestinal Microbiota: An Alternative Therapy to Antibiotics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1476/v2","date":1723532202000,"content":"Antibiotic prescription is the first line of treating bacterial diseases. But it affects the composition and function of non-targeted intestinal microbiota. Antimicrobial resistance will be the cause for the death of millions of people worldwide. By considering collateral damage of antibiotics, searching an alternative antimicrobial agent will be a solution to minimize the problems. Probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics are an alternative to antibiotics. Thanks to GIT microbes as they are responsible for metabolism, energy production, protection from pathogens and immunomodulation. So, it is appreciable if the gut microbiota modulated through consumption of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. Probiotic effects are genus and species specific. To get good health benefit of probiotics, safety of probiotics should be assessed before using them. This is mandatory for prebiotics and synbiotic selection. So this review paper gives information about side effects of antibiotics on gut microbiota, description of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics as alternative to antibiotics in modulating GIT microbiota, techniques of assessing safety of probiotics and health benefits of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics with scientific evidence in clinical trial and some disagreement and challenges of using probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"edf16454d7efbc7da96b4ada60a16240afb92e547edc6a2c494c7ef6b36da636","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
