{"title":"How Does Cartilage Lubrication Mechanisms Fail in Osteoarthritis? A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0827/v1","date":1712855982000,"content":"Cartilage degeneration is a characteristic of osteoarthritis (OA) which is often observed in aging populations. This degeneration is due to the breakdown of articular cartilage (AC) mechanical and tribological properties, primarily attributed to lubrication failure. Understanding the reasons behind these failures and identifying potential solutions could have significant economic and societal implications, ultimately enhancing the quality of life. This review provides an overview of developments in the field of AC, focusing on its mechanical and tribological properties. The emphasis is on the role of lubrication in degraded AC, offering insights into its structure and function relationship. Further it explores the fundamental connection between AC mechano-tribological properties and the advancement of its degradation and puts forth recommendations for strategies to boost its lubrication efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac41e3ca69b7c1c99fd7872db973fad3294edbf7270a2a2476ce0bdf6b41ab52","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
