{"title":"Does Adopting the Bean Technology Bundle Enhance Food Security Access and Resilience for Smallholder Farmers in Ethiopia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1241/v1","date":1729064516000,"content":"We assess simultaneous adoption and impacts of multiple improved technologies promoted as a bundle and recommended for legumes intensification systems for smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. We use DNA fingerprinting data to precisely identify our key treatment - “adoption to improved bean varieties” in the study. The results show significant positive impacts of adopting bundled interventions on, agricultural incomes and household food security but vulnerability to food insecurity persists. We find that growing improved varieties with fertilizers increased household agricultural revenue, allowing for more legume consumption and enhancing their likelihood of achieving adequate food consumption and food security outcomes. However, the vulnerability to food insecurity of the adopters remains high due to pre-existing resource degradation issues. Given similarity in production contexts in Sub Saharan Africa, our results provide perspective for similar development interventions. We use the results of our analysis to discuss potential policy implications and programmes to support technology intensification among small holder farmers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0065e66002c7d122b4237ad16873b40a05852f28ae23dd1309f526db8ddd5fc4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
