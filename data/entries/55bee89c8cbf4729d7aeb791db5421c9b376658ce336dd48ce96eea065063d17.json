{"title":"Fault-Tolerant Model Predictive Control Applied of a Sewer Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0935/v1","date":1715676135000,"content":"This work presents a Fault-Tolerant Model Predictive Control (FTMPC) algorithm applied to a simulation model for sewer networks. The control system will aim to prevent contaminated water from escaping the network, especially during periods of heavy rainfall, that can cause combined sewer overflows (CSO), while maintaining the flow of water towards the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) as close as possible to its nominal value. The main purpose of the work is to preserve the operation of the predictive controller as much as possible, in accordance with its operational objectives, when there may be anomalies affecting the elements of the control system, mainly sensors and actuators. Comparing the results obtained considering various types of faults, with situations of normal controlled operation and with the behavior of the sewer network when no control is applied, will allow some conclusions to be drawn at the end.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55bee89c8cbf4729d7aeb791db5421c9b376658ce336dd48ce96eea065063d17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
