{"title":"Neurological risks arising from the bioaccumulation of heavy metal contaminants: A focus on mercury","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24119?af=R","date":1713272355000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study investigated the concentrations of heavy metals in the water sources of the upstream region of the Huangpu River, the Yangtze River Estuary, and various areas in Shanghai, as well as the heavy metal concentrations in the blood of Shanghai residents. It aimed to analyze the heavy metal elements absorbed by the human body and the resulting pathological effects. The results revealed that surface water primarily contains five heavy metals: copper (Cu), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), and mercury (Hg), while water sediments primarily contain seven heavy metals: Cu, cadmium (Cd), Pb, chromium (Cr), Zn, As, and Hg. The main heavy metals present in the human body are Pb, Hg, As, and Cd. By reviewing previous articles, it was found that heavy metal concentrations in human blood are higher than those in surface water, suggesting uncertainties in the heavy metal content of surface water and its tendency to settle at the bottom. Furthermore, a comparison of heavy metal content in sediments revealed that Hg is the most readily absorbed heavy metal by the human body and is also a toxic environmental pollutant. Within the cell, Hg is highly toxic to mitochondria and may cause oxidative stress and neurodegenerative disease. This study concludes that water sediments serve as the major source of pollution in the human body and pose significant health risks, thereby necessitating the implementation of effective preventive measures.</p>","author":"Tianyu Dong, \nHanxuan Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"d2bd23ee1a561bff6b6010db75c5c565b6cdb7321e9163b4da657d75f797484f","category":"Environment"}
