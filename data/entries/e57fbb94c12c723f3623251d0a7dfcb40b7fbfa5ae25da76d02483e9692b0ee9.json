{"title":"Occurrence and Persistence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Population in Spontaneous Fermentation and the Relation with &ldquo;Winery Effect&rdquo;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1766/v1","date":1716808767000,"content":"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ensures successful fermentation in winemaking, although the persistent use of commercial strains lead the loss of aroma complexity of wines. Hence, the research of indigenous S. cerevisiae with proper oenological features and well adapted to specific wine-growing area become of great interest for winemakers. Here, 206 S. cerevisiae strains were isolated from two wineries during two-year sampling campaign and bio-typed with the aim to evaluate the occurrence and persistence of S. cerevisiae wild population linked to each winery. Both wineries belonging to the same Verdicchio DOC wine area (Castelli di Jesi), and never used commercial yeasts during fermentation. Results showed a specific and varied population of S. cerevisiae in each winery without cross-contamination each other and with commercial starter strains. Moreover, inside each winery it was observed a persistent of some dominant biotypes over the time, indicating a sort of “winery-effect”. The evaluation of S. cerevisiae populations for the oenological characters showed a proper and well distinct aromatic imprinting on the resulted wines confirming the “winery effect”.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e57fbb94c12c723f3623251d0a7dfcb40b7fbfa5ae25da76d02483e9692b0ee9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
