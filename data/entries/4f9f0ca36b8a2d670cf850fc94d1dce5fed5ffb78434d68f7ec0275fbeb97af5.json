{"title":"A divergent tumor overexpressed gene domain and oligomerization contribute to SPIRAL2 function in stabilizing microtubule minus ends","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/4/1056/7451230?rss=1","date":1701043200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The acentrosomal cortical microtubules (MTs) of higher plants dynamically assemble into specific array patterns that determine the axis of cell expansion. Recently, the Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) SPIRAL2 (SPR2) protein was shown to regulate cortical MT length and light-induced array reorientation by stabilizing MT minus ends. SPR2 autonomously localizes to both the MT lattice and MT minus ends, where it decreases the minus end depolymerization rate. However, the structural determinants that contribute to the ability of SPR2 to target and stabilize MT minus ends remain unknown. Here, we present the crystal structure of the SPR2 N-terminal domain, which reveals a unique tumor overexpressed gene (TOG) domain architecture with 7 HEAT repeats. We demonstrate that a coiled-coil domain mediates the multimerization of SPR2, which provides avidity for MT binding, and is essential to bind soluble tubulin. In addition, we found that an SPR2 construct spanning the TOG domain, basic region, and coiled-coil domain targets and stabilizes MT minus ends similar to full-length SPR2 in plants. These results reveal how a TOG domain, which is typically found in microtubule plus-end regulators, has been appropriated in plants to regulate MT minus ends.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"4f9f0ca36b8a2d670cf850fc94d1dce5fed5ffb78434d68f7ec0275fbeb97af5","category":"Environment"}
