{"title":"Identification of SNPs in the Second Intron of IGF2BP1 and Their Association with Growth Traits in Nanjiang Yellow Goat","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0956/v1","date":1718315533000,"content":"Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 mRNA binding Protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is a promising candidate gene for influencing economic traits in livestock and poultry. The second intronic region of IGF2BP1 is closely related to growth traits, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. The preliminary resequencing results of goats in our laboratory demonstrated that the IGF2BP1 gene region was subject to strong selection, then we selected multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify. Seven SNPs were located in the conserved region of the second intron, and their functions and relationship with growth traits require further clarification. This study selected 348 Nanjiang Yellow goats as experimental subjects, and chose Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (MALDI-TOF) as the main method. Our results showed that six SNPs were significantly correlated with the growth traits of the Nanjiang yellow goat by association analysis. Among them, the rs652062749(A&gt;G) was identified as the primary locus affecting the later stage of growth traits of Nanjiang yellow goat. Moreover, there was a strong linkage among three SNPs, and the rs638185407 (T&gt;A) mutant type was observed to increase the luciferase activity in H293T cells extremely significantly. The TTAACT, TTCCCC, and ATCACT combination genotypes were dominant combination genotypes, which provided theoretical references for further genetic co-breeding. The results of our study demonstrate the potential role of the IGF2BP1 gene as a functional genetic marker in the breeding programs of Nanjiang Yellow goats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4b16e5e20b46af70819bde320ad63fb086f6fcecca86776fd886405b98162c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
