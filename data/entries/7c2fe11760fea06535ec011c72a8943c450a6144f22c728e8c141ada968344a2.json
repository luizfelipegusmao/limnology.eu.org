{"title":"Cell Biology of Knee Joint Injuries: Early Mechanical Loading Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0190/v1","date":1722827901000,"content":"Knee joint injuries, including those affecting the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), meniscus, and cartilage, present significant challenges in sports medicine and orthopedics. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these injuries is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies. This systematic review explores the cell biology of knee joint injuries, focusing on the effects of early mechanical loading. We examine the types of knee injuries, cellular responses to mechanical loading, signaling pathways involved, and implications for treatment and rehabilitation. This comprehensive synthesis aims to provide insights into optimizing rehabilitation protocols and developing novel therapeutic approaches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c2fe11760fea06535ec011c72a8943c450a6144f22c728e8c141ada968344a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
