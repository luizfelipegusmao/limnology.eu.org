It alsoconsiders the roles of fossil fuels, specifically natural gas and coal. Toaccomplish this, a comprehensive analysis is initiated, making use of annualdata spanning from 1975 to 2022. A unique Fourier ARDL test serves as a centralanalytical tool alongside the Fourier Toda Yamamoto test. The empirical resultsunveil the presence of co-integration among the variables scrutinized. Moreover,it becomes evident that coal and biomass make positive contributions toeconomic growth, whereas natural gas appears to exert a negative influence oneconomic growth. To validate these findings, a Fourier-based Toda-Yamamoto testis applied, demonstrating that natural gas, coal, and biomass possesspredictive capabilities concerning economic growth. These discoveries carrysubstantial implications for comprehending the factors influencing economicgrowth in India.</p>","author":"Babatunde Sunday Eweade, \nFoday Joof, \nTomiwa Sunday Adebayo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"01fff0c62e65ce0021fea351ea79d66e569612213da75667965edd9d1e4ca852","category":"Environment"}
