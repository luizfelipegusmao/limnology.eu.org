{"title":"A New Paradigm in Cancer Treatment: Identifying and Targeting Clonal Mutations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202308.1536/v5","date":1711105573000,"content":"Over the last several years, large-scale cancer genomics studies involving multi region, multi-sample sequencing indicate that most or at least many cancer patients may have one or more “clonal\" mutations in their tumors.  Clonal mutations are those that are present in all of a patient’s cancer cells.  They can be identified via multiregion, multisample biopsies - or circulating tumor cells/cell-free DNA.  Achilles Therapeutics is currently the only company targeting patient-specific, clonal mutations.  They have opted to utilize an immunotherapy approach.  However, I recently devised another approach for exploiting clonal mutations called “Oncolytic Vector Replication Contingent on Omnipresent Mutation Engagement” (OVERCOME).  It is based on the identification of patient-specific, clonal mutations and targeting them using a bioengineered facultative intracellular bacterium.  It would be initially non-replicating, but transiently regain the ability to replicate (and also transiently become hyper-virulent) upon mutation detection via molecular switches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f31aab015f80b623a111ee21170d309c576ff503be264ed122050b6f9f01d4a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
