{"title":"Microscopic and Spectroscopic Understanding of Non-metal Dopants in Photocatalytic Properties of Titania","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.253/7719744?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Research into sustainable renewable energy sources has led to numerous innovative findings in search of a suitable catalyst that will be stable and possess the properties necessary for effective photocatalytic activities. Recently, photocatalysis has been gaining more insight due to the simplicity of setup, low cost, and effectiveness. Improvement of photocatalytic properties of catalyst can be achieved through detailed investigations of parameters required for the fabrication of efficient photocatalyst [<a href=\"#ozae044.253-B1\">1</a>]. Photocatalysis has played a key role in many environmental applications, including water remediation [<a href=\"#ozae044.253-B2\">2</a>], water splitting [<a href=\"#ozae044.253-B3\">3</a>], and battery application [<a href=\"#ozae044.253-B4\">4</a>]. TiO<sub>2,</sub> which has a high electron-hole recombination rate, is enhanced photo-catalytically when modified with other elements. Non-metal dopants have played a key role in enhancing light absorption and photocatalytic properties of TiO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.253-B5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.253-B6\">6</a>]. The contribution of dopants in modulating the properties and light absorption of TiO<sub>2</sub> is evident in the monitoring of the band gap of TiO<sub>2.</sub> Though Li et al. have outlined some advantages and disadvantages of metal and non-metal dopants [<a href=\"#ozae044.253-B7\">7</a>], non-metal dopants have been frequently used due to their greater synergistic effect [<a href=\"#ozae044.253-B8\">8</a>]. Non-metal dopants, such as nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, selenium, and sulfur, have been reported to introduce orbitals to the oxygen and titanium states in the valence band of titanium dioxide, thereby reducing its band gap. This enhances the light absorption of TiO<sub>2</sub> by reducing its band gap, allowing its photo-absorption to be extended to the visible region. Irfan et al. attributed the shift in the wavelength of absorption band after non-metal doping of TiO<sub>2</sub> to orbital mixing of TiO<sub>2</sub> and the impurity, production of vacancies at O<sub>2</sub> sites as well as raising of valence band of TiO<sub>2</sub>. The use of nitrogen dopant results in the interaction of nitrogen 2p and oxygen 2p states which raises the valence band level of TiO<sub>2</sub>, while the conduction band remains unchanged [<a href=\"#ozae044.253-B9\">9</a>][<a href=\"#ozae044.253-B10\">10</a>]. The impurity energy levels from the non-metals have also been observed to act as electron traps, reducing recombination of charge carriers [<a href=\"#ozae044.253-B9\">9</a>]. Theoretical studies have been employed to understand the role of non-metal dopants in TiO<sub>2</sub> and has proposed non-metal dopants as promising pathway to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.253-B9\">9</a>][<a href=\"#ozae044.253-B11\">11</a>][<a href=\"#ozae044.253-B12\">12</a>]. Overall, these orbital interactions help to narrow the band gap of TiO<sub>2</sub> for enhanced light absorption for efficient photocatalytic activity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"923dfaf129521b76d720060194dacabc777b3b5b7793da1b050588d11d6a7161","category":"Environment"}
