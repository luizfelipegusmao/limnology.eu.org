{"title":"Attraction of the Indian Meal Moth Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) to Commercially Available Vegetable Oils: Implications in Integrated Pest Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0823/v1","date":1720580878000,"content":"The Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, poses a significant threat to global agricultural products. Although pheromone-based technologies show promise for P. interpunctella management, limitations like single-sex targeting necessitate exploring complementary strategies. Vegetable-based oils represent a potential alternative, but their efficacy, sex-specificity, and interaction with sex pheromones remain unclear. To answer these questions, we first examined attraction of P. interpunctella female and male adults to ten different vegetable oils, i.e., camellia, corn, olive, peanut, rapeseed, sesame, soybean, sunflower, walnut, and a blended oil (mixture of sunflower seed, rapeseed, soybean, peanut, and sesame oils), in the semi-field conditions. Sesame, olive, and blended oils demonstrated most attractive, capturing significantly more adults compared to other oils. We then evaluated effectiveness of these three attractive oils and their combinations with P. interpunctella sex pheromone in a grain warehouse. Traps baited with these oils captured significantly more females and males compared to control traps without attractants. However, sex pheromone addition did not improve male capture and significantly reduced female capture, suggesting an inhibitory effect. Our findings highlight the potential of blended, olive, or sesame oil trap alone as alternative monitoring and trapping tools for P. interpunctella, delivering novel insights into the development of efficient integrated pest management strategies for stored products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9ec667b6c6554d4f676e1485e7b9ca5289621c4568ce05ad70c74d00b999a2e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
