{"title":"Childhood Cancer Incidence and Survival in South Australia and the Northern Territory, 1990-2017, with Emphasis on Indigenous Peoples","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0590/v1","date":1715257152000,"content":"Background &amp; Aims: Reports of a rise in childhood cancer incidence in Australia and globally prompted the investigation of cancer incidence and survival in South Australia (SA) and the Northern Territory (NT) over a 28-year period, with emphasis on Indigenous peoples.\nMethods: This cross-sectional analysis of two prospective longitudinal databases, the SA and NT Cancer Registries (1990-2017), included all reported cases of childhood cancers. Poisson regression provided estimates of incidence rate ratios and survival was modelled using Cox proportional hazard models for children aged 0.05). With reference to the 1990-1999 era, overall survival improved in subsequent eras in SA (2000-2009: HR 0.53 [0.38-0.73]; 2010-2017: 0.44 [0.28-0.68]); however, remained unchanged in the NT (2000-2009: 0.78 [0.40-1.51]; 2010-2017: 0.50 [0.24-1.05]). In the NT, overall survival of Indigenous patients was significantly lower compared with the non-Indigenous cohort (3.42 [1.92-6.10]). While the survival of Indigenous children with cancer significantly improved in the last two eras (p0.05).\nConclusions: The incidence of childhood cancers has remained unchanged over 28-years in SA and the NT. Encouragingly, improved survival rates over time were observed in SA and amongst Indigenous children of the NT. Nevertheless, survival rates in Indigenous children remain lower than non-Indigenous children.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7403f65de757ff0bc6cf885e7b588bec7362892f50efa11f2ed4addf99e6eba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
