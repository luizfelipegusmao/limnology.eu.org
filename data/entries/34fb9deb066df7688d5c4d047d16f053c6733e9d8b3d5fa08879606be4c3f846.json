{"title":"Home range, habitat use and capture-release of translocated leopards in Gir landscape, Gujarat, India","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305278","date":1718028000000,"content":"<p>by Mohan Ram, Aradhana Sahu, Nityanand Srivastava, Rohit Chaudhary, Lahar Jhala, Yashpal Zala, Meena Venkataraman</p>\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the spatial ecology of translocated leopards (<i>Panthera pardus fusca</i>) is crucial for their conservation and the effective assessment of conflict management strategies. We investigated the home range and habitat preferences of five radio-collared leopards (n = 5; 2 males; 3 females) in the Gir landscape. Additionally, we examined the usefulness of the capture-release strategy for these animals. We assessed home range and habitat selection using kernel density estimation (at 95% and 50% levels) and compositional analysis. Our findings revealed that leopards exhibited distinct patterns of movement, often returning to their original capture site or nearby locations or exploring new areas within 3 to 25 days, covering distances ranging from 48 to 260 km. The average home range (95% FK) was estimated at 103.96±36.37 (SE) km<sup>2</sup>, with a core area usage (50% FK) of 21.38±5.95 km<sup>2</sup>. Seasonally, we observed the largest home ranges during summer and the smallest during winter. Males exhibited larger home ranges (95% FK, 151±64.28 km<sup>2</sup>) compared to females (56.18±14.22 km<sup>2</sup>). The habitat analysis indicated that agricultural areas were consistently preferred in the multi-use landscape at the 2<sup>nd</sup> order habitat selection level. Additionally, habitat around water bodies was highly favoured at the 3<sup>rd</sup> order, with distinct variations in habitat selection observed during day and night. This study highlights the significance of riverine and scrubland habitats, as leopards exhibited strong preferences for these habitats within their home ranges. We emphasize the importance of conserving natural habitat patches, particularly those surrounding water bodies. We also report on the characteristics of the capture-release strategy and provide our observations indicating no escalated aggression by leopards’ post-release. In conclusion, this study evaluates widely employed approaches to conflict mitigation and suggests the continuous review and assessment of management strategies for mitigating human-leopard conflicts.","author":"Mohan Ram","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"34fb9deb066df7688d5c4d047d16f053c6733e9d8b3d5fa08879606be4c3f846","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
