{"title":"Improved Representation of Vegetation Soil Moisture Coupling Enhances Soil Moisture Data Assimilation in Water‚ÄêLimited Regimes: A Case Study Over Texas","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR035558?af=R","date":1718625616000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Assimilating remotely sensed surface soil moisture (SSM) into land surface models (LSM) is widely used to improve model representations of soil moisture (SM). However, the efficacy of SSM data assimilation (DA) has been found to be limited, particularly in resolving root-zone soil moisture (RZSM). This study investigates how the representation of vegetation phenology, modulates the efficacy of SSM DA in enhancing the realism of RZSM simulations. To this end, two sets of climatological leaf area index (LAI) are implemented in Noah-MP LSM over the state of Texas: (a) Noah-MP default based on long-term MODIS observations, (b) an alternative LAI adapted from AVHRR products. The former are found to exhibit conspicuous phase errors whereas the latter are more consistent with observed seasonal cycle. Two sets of DA experiments were performed accordingly, wherein SMAP L3 SSM is assimilated into Noah-MP equipped with each LAI product from 2015 to 2019, Validation of the resulting products against in-situ data reveals that (a) using the AVHRR-based LAI, the Noah-MP outperforms the baseline in reproducing the dynamics of RZSM, and the outperformance is particularly evident over the warm season and water-stressed western Texas; (b) using the alternative LAI enhances the ability of DA to improve the accuracy of Noah-MP RZSM, and to a lesser extent, SSM; and (c) gains in SM attained through improvement of LAI and application of DA is most pronounced over regions featuring tight vertical SM coupling. Additional model mechanistic limitations that need to be overcome to improve efficacy of DA are discussed.</p>","author":"Farhad Hassani, \nYu Zhang, \nSujay V.
