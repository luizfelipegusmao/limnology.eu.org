{"title":"Mathematical Modeling of the Heat Transfer Process in Spherical Objects With Flat, Cylindrical and Spherical Defects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0904/v1","date":1718261199000,"content":"This article discusses the application of thermal quality control methods for plant tissues. The purpose of the work is to determine the optimal parameters of thermal impact on a spherical-shaped plant control object, ensuring the detection of surface and subsurface defects. The authors of the work proposed mathematical models of the temperature field for a spherical body with defects and a flat sample when exposed to the thermal influence of a pulsed source. As a result of the use of mathematical models, the thermophysical characteristics of plant tissues of varying degrees of disease damage were obtained, which made it possible to simulate the temperature field of the control object and obtain an image of classified tissues. The developed recommendations made it possible to select the optimal parameters of the thermal effect on the test object.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6017468c22048156103396657b64bf288d92a1dd9ca64096758abddf1e5104fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
