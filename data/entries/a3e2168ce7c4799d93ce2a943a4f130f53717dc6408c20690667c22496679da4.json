{"title":"Blossoming Insights: A Bibliometric Review of Botanical Gardens’ Research Across Time (1960-2023)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1780/v1","date":1716841886000,"content":"This bibliometric analysis delves into the realm of botanical gardens through the process of mapping literature and discerning research frontiers, underlying themes, and interconnections within the extant body of knowledge. The study uses a dataset of 1340 publications and employs methodologies such as authors' keywords co-occurrence data to examine the discipline's trends, patterns, and knowledge gaps. The study finds significant growth in literature from 1960 to 2023, emphasizing botanical gardens, conservation, taxonomy, biodiversity, ex-situ conservation, and diversity. Key influencers such as Sanja Kovačić, Elaissi, and Chemli have steered research directions towards ex-situ conservation and essential oils, reflecting the field's interdisciplinary nature. The study shows global institutional variation, with entities like the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Royal Botanic Gardens UK, and the New York Botanical Garden US leading the discourse. Thematic analyses have identified core themes and emerging research topics, with ecological restoration, essential oils, invasive species, and climate change mirroring the field's expanding scope. The consistent prevalence of themes such as 'botanical gardens' and 'conservation' over time underscores their enduring significance. Emerging topics like climate change and biodiversity are gaining prominence, signaling a shift in research priorities. The expanding array of subjects, including 'invasive species' and 'genetic diversity,' indicates an amplified scope and growing complexity in botanical garden research. This study aims to bridge a crucial gap by outlining the developmental trajectory of botanical gardens and offering guidance for future research directions. Diverse research domains within botanical garden studies, including biodiversity, essential oils, taxonomy, and ex-situ conservation, present extensive avenues for exploration. Future research endeavors should delve into these impactful themes to better understand botanical ecosystems and their conservation. The study emphasizes the importance of nurturing interdisciplinary collaborations and multidisciplinary projects, advocating for a comprehensive and collaborative approach to future research in botanical garden studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a3e2168ce7c4799d93ce2a943a4f130f53717dc6408c20690667c22496679da4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
