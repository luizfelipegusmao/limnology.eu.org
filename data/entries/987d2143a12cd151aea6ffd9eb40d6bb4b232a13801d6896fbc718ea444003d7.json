{"title":"Additional organic and bacterium fertilizer input regulated soybean root architecture and dry matter distribution for a sustainable yield in the semi-arid Region of China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305836","date":1721224800000,"content":"<p>by Yu Liu, Chuhua Liu, Lichao Wei, Xudong Zhang, Qinhui Liu, Jiling Bai, Xiaolin Wang, Suiqi Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nIn the dryland area of the Loess Plateau in northwest China, long-term excessive fertilization has led to soil compaction and nutrient loss, which in turn limits crop yield and soil productivity. To address this issue, we conducted experiments using environmentally friendly organic fertilizer and bacterium fertilizer. Our goal was to investigate the effects of additional organic and bacterium fertilizer inputs on soil water migration, crop root architecture, and yield formation. We implemented six different fertilizer strategies, namely: N<sub>m</sub> (mulching, N 30 kg/ha), NPK<sub>1m</sub> (mulching, N 60 kg/ha; P 30 kg/ha; K 30 kg/ha), NPK<sub>2m</sub> (mulching, N 90 kg/ha; P 45 kg/ha; K 30 kg/ha), NPK<sub>Om</sub> (mulching, N 90 kg/ha; P 45 kg/ha; K 30 kg/ha; organic fertilizer 2 t/ha), NPK<sub>Bm</sub> (mulching, N 60 kg/ha; P 30 kg/ha; K 30 kg/ha; bacterium fertilizer 10 kg/ha), and N (N 30 kg/ha; no mulching). The results revealed that the addition of bacterium fertilizer (NPK<sub>Bm</sub>) had a positive impact on soybean root system development. Compared with the other treatments, it significantly increased the total root length, total root surface area, and total root length density by 25.96% ~ 94.89%, -19.63% ~ 36.28%, and 9.36% ~ 28.84%, respectively. Furthermore, NPK<sub>Bm</sub> enhanced soil water consumption. In 2018, water storage during the flowering and podding periods decreased by 12.63% and 19.65%, respectively, while water consumption increased by 0.97% compared to N<sub>m</sub>. In 2019, the flowering and harvest periods decreased by 23.49% and 11.51%, respectively, while water consumption increased by 0.65%. Ultimately, NPK<sub>Bm</sub> achieved high grain yield and significantly increased water use efficiency (WUE), surpassing other treatments by 76.79% ~ 78.97% and 71.22% ~ 73.76%, respectively. Subsequently, NPK<sub>1m</sub> also exhibited significant increases in yield and WUE, with improvements of 35.58% ~ 39.27% and 35.26% ~ 38.16%, respectively. The use of bacterium fertilizer has a profound impact on soybean root architecture, leading to stable and sustainable grain yield production.","author":"Yu Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"987d2143a12cd151aea6ffd9eb40d6bb4b232a13801d6896fbc718ea444003d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
