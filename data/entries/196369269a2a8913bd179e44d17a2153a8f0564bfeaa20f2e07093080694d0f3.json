{"title":"Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Urban Green Spaces and Climatic Vulnerability of Togolese Cities in the Context of Rapid Urbanisation: The Case of Lome and Kara","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0172/v1","date":1727866858000,"content":"The cities of Lomé and Kara in Togo are undergoing rapid urbanisation due to strong demographic pressure, leading to a reduction in Urban Green Spaces (UGSs), which are essential for climate regulation and urban well-being. This situation highlights the climatic vulnerability of these areas, making it imperative to reconcile urban development and the preservation of UGSs for urban sustainability. This study contributes to the sustainable conservation of UGSs in Togo. More specifically, it uses Landsat images from 1988_2000_2012_2022 to analyse the spatiotemporal dynamics of UGSs in Lomé and Kara and develops vulnerability models in 2022 and for the 2060 and 2100 horizons based on SSP 2.45 and SSP 5.85 climate scenarios via the multifactorial method. The results revealed a reduction in UGSs in Lomé (from 85.98% in 1988 to 40.78% in 2022) and Kara (from 93.99% to 36.68%), mainly due to urban expansion. Low- and medium-vulnerability zones, often located in UGSs, will likely disappear by 2060 and 2100, accentuating urban climatic vul-nerability. Hence, there is an urgent need to implement conservation policies, create new UGSs, and increase awareness among city dwellers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"196369269a2a8913bd179e44d17a2153a8f0564bfeaa20f2e07093080694d0f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
