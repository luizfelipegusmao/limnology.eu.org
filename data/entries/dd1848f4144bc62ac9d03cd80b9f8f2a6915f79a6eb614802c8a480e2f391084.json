{"title":"A Method for the Solution of Certain Non-Linear Problems of Combined Seagoing Main Engines Performance and Fixed Pitch Propeller Hydrodynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1982/v1","date":1727261129000,"content":"The numerical algorithm used for the original multi-dimensional non-linear optimization analysis of the marine fixed pitch (screw) propulsion presented herewith, after its invention and publication has been widely used for the analysis and best fit (most probable / less uncertain) solution of over-determined non-linear mathematical problems, where the points of observations (measured data) are more than the unknown parameters in the mathematical formulation expressing the significant aspects of the observed phenomena. Any “local” attainable solution of this formidable and ingenious algorithm, may rely to the set of initial values of the unknown parameters, while not all possible solutions are expected to be physically significant for a specific problem, whereas judgment, bounds and testing are to be practiced for making sure that the attained solution is the best fit (most probable / less uncertain) one, and not necessarily the “global minimum” one. In the present paper the above algorithm is applied for the original analysis of standard ships propulsion, and particularly for the original combined application of thermo-fluid and frictional models of main engines, as well as of fixed pitch propulsion hydrodynamic models, necessary for resolving in an integrated manner the combined marine propulsion problem for standard ships under seagoing conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd1848f4144bc62ac9d03cd80b9f8f2a6915f79a6eb614802c8a480e2f391084","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
