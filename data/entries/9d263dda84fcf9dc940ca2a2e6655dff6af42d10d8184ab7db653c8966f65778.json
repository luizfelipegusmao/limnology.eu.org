{"title":"Theoretical Framework for Future Developments: AI-Based Predictions and Risk Assessment for Coastal Ports in the Bulgarian Sector of the Black Sea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1541/v1","date":1721316414000,"content":"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in predicting and managing risks for coastal port developments significantly enhances planning and operational efficiency. This paper presents a theoretical framework utilizing AI to predict future scenarios based on geological, hydrodynamic, and oceanographic factors. Focusing on the effective implementation of AI in ports, with a specific emphasis on Bulgarian Black Sea coastal areas such as Nesebur, Sarafovo, Sozopol, St. Anastasia Island, and the region of Karantinata in Varna, the study explores AI applications for site selection, risk assessment, and operational optimization to ensure resilient, efficient, and sustainable port infrastructure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d263dda84fcf9dc940ca2a2e6655dff6af42d10d8184ab7db653c8966f65778","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
