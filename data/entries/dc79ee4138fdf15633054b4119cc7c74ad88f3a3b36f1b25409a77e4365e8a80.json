{"title":"Progress and Application of Genomic Selection in Sheep and Goat","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0592/v1","date":1715248658000,"content":"The advancement of sequencing technology and molecular breeding methods have provided technical support and assurance for accurate breeding. Genomic Selection (GS) utilizes genomic information to improve livestock breeding and, it is more accurate and more efficient than traditional selection methods. GS has been widely applied in domestic animals breeding, especially in cattle. However, there is still limited study on the application and research of GS in sheep and goat. In this paper, we outlined the principle, analysis methods, the influential factors of GS, and elaborated on the research progress, challenges, and prospects of applying GS in sheep and goat breeding. Through the review of these aspects this paper is expected to provide valuable references for the implementation of GS in the field of sheep and goat breeding.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc79ee4138fdf15633054b4119cc7c74ad88f3a3b36f1b25409a77e4365e8a80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
