{"title":"Improving Performance of a DC-DC converter in a PV System using Wavelet-Discreet-Denoiser (WDD)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0342/v1","date":1715049596000,"content":"This article deals with the denoising of signals from sensors (current and voltage) in a photovoltaic conversion chain using wavelet theory. The idea is to reduce the noise as much as possible without distorting or losing the original signal information. To see the reliability of this proposed method, a comparative study between our proposed method (WDD) and the classic low-pass filter method was presented. The contribution in this work is the improvement of the DC-DC boost converter via the use of wavelet theory, however, thatâ€™s why we set two objectives: the first is to obtain reliable control of the DC-DC boost converter via the proposed WDD and the second to increase the overall system efficiency. The experimental results show a very great improvement in the quality of the signals of the proposed method compared to the classic method of filtering by low-pass filter.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93f5edb64a07f986fc4636ae54b3b54f4172c5d3996fedae026a3d5c072fc622","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
