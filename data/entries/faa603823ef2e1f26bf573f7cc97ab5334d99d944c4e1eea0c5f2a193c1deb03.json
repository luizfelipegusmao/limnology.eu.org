{"title":"Evaluation of the Phytochemical Profiles, Antioxidant and &alpha;-Glucosidase Inhibitory Activities of Four Herbal Teas Originating from China: A Comparative Analysis of Aqueous and Ethanol Extraction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.1204/v2","date":1712125343000,"content":"Research has shown that the consumption of herbal teas is linked with positive effects on the regulation of postprandial blood glucose level. In this study, a comparative analysis of aqueous and ethanol extractions is performed on four herbal teas (Mallotus, Cyclocarya, Rubus, Vine) to evaluate their phytochemical profiles and functional activities. Investigations of phytochemical contents, antioxidant activities, α-glucosidase inhibitory activities and chemical compositions are carried out through colorimetric analyses and UPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS/MS, respectively. Results showed that among the studied herbal teas, Vine exhibited the highest glucose re-gulating abilities under both aqueous and ethanol extractions. Overall, ethanol extracted samples yielded higher phytochemicals content, but the compositions of the phytochemicals varied. Meanwhile, aqueous extracts showed surprisingly strong antioxidant activities and comparable α-glucosidase inhibitory activities with ethanol extracts. Phytochemicals contents presented a positive correlation with antioxidant activities and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities. Nevertheless, antioxidant activities displayed a weak positive correlation with α-glucosidase inhibitory activities. Results from this study provided evidence that aqueous extracts from herbal teas possessed valuable phytochemicals composition for antioxidants and the hyperglycemic populations, and are promising candidates for potential applications as functional ingredients with health promoting effects and as natural additives to boost the nutritional value of herbal food products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"faa603823ef2e1f26bf573f7cc97ab5334d99d944c4e1eea0c5f2a193c1deb03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
