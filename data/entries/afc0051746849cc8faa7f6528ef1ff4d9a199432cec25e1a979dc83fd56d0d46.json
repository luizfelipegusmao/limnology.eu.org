{"title":"Work engagement, impulsivity and, self-efficacy among Polish workers. Moderating role of impulsivity","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311856","date":1728568800000,"content":"<p>by Bohdan Rożnowski, Antoni Wontorczyk</p>\r\n\r\nThe study proposes adding a new component to the Job Demands-Resources Theory, termed ’personal demands’. Impulsivity serves as an illustrative example of personal demands. A cross-sectional questionnaire was conducted and a total of 394 (Female = 59.6%) workers were surveyed. Standardized survey questionnaires were used in the study, i.e. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9), Life Roles Self-Efficacy Scale (LRSES) and UPPS-P Impulsive Behaviour Scale. The obtained results indicate that Work Engagement correlates negatively with Impulsivity scales (lack of premeditation (r = -.22; p &lt; .001), lack of persistence (r = -.27; p &lt; .001), positive urgency (r = -.12; p, &lt; .01) and negative urgency (r = -.12; p &lt; .01)). In addition, Positive Urgency, moderates the relation between Self-efficacy and Work Engagement, in line with the theory (B = .133; SE = .067; t = 1.98; p &lt; .05; LLCI = .0007; ULCI = 0.2643). This confirmed the fact, that impulsivity should be included in the JDR theory as a ‘personal demand’.","author":"Bohdan Rożnowski","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"afc0051746849cc8faa7f6528ef1ff4d9a199432cec25e1a979dc83fd56d0d46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
