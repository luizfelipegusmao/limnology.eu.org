{"title":"Peatland Transformation: Land Cover Changes and Driving Factors in the Kampar Peninsula (1990-2020)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2411/v1","date":1722330205000,"content":"The Kampar Peninsula, a significant peatland region in Riau, Indonesia, is vital for its carbon re-serves and biodiversity, including the Sumatran tiger. Covering approximately 735,091 hectares, it comprises critical peat domes essential for hydrological balance. This research investigates land use changes from 1990-2020 using the Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI) to map disturb-ances and land cover changes. Additionally, interviews and regulatory analysis were conducted to examine the historical drivers of land use change in the Kampar Peninsula. In 2020, natural forests covered 433,395.20 hectares (59.9% of the total area), industrial pulpwood plantations (primarily acacia) covered 27.3%, oil palm plantations accounted for 10.4%, infrastructure occupied 2.4%, and water bodies made up 0.9%. Key drivers of land use change include the construction of access roads by oil companies since 1975 and government policies during the New Order period (1980s-1998) promoting forest exploitation and transmigration programs. These activities have significantly transformed the Kampar Peninsula's land cover, highlighting the need for sustainable management and conservation efforts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf1319b1dff1cea35434c1424c1b05408734b391250b302c294d0e53f856c332","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
