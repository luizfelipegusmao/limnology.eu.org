{"title":"Signal Transduction of Transient Receptor Potential TRPM8 Channels: Role of PIP5K, Gq-Proteins, and c-Jun","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0172/v1","date":1714714809000,"content":"Transient receptor potential melastatin-8 (TRPM8) is a cation channel that is activated by cold and “cooling agents” such as menthol and icilin, which induce a cold sensation. Stimulation of TRPM8 activates an intracellular signaling cascade that ultimately leads to a change in the gene expression pattern of the cells. Here, we investigated the TRPM8-induced signaling pathway that links TRPM8 channel activation to gene transcription. Using a pharmacological approach, we show that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5 kinase alpha (PIP5K), an enzyme essential for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, attenuated TRPM8-induced gene transcription. Analyzing the link between TRPM8 and Gq proteins, we show that pharmacological inhibition of the beta gamma subunits impairs TRPM8 signaling. In addition, genetic studies showed that TRPM8 requires an activated Galpha subunit for signaling. In the nucleus, the TRPM8-induced signaling cascade triggers an activation of the transcription factor AP-1, a complex consisting of a dimer of basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. Here, we identified the bZIP protein c-Jun as an essential component of AP-1 within the TRPM8-induced signling cscade. In summary, with PIP5K, Gq subunits and c-Jun we have identified key molecules in the TRPM8-induced signaling from the plasma membrane to the nucleus.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d996b08e375edc96818fa4afef469b974b4c5f806918ab6261dd4d2b9a2461d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
