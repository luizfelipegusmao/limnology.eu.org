For the construction of the results, it was only imposed that ϕ is a homeomorphism and the Schauder’s fixed point theorem allied with the concepts of L1-Carathéodory functions and sequences together with the equiconvergence on infinity and on each impulsive moments. Finally, a practical part illustrates the main theorem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"329da198d649531d278065ffe36ccca3514f67270af399ca9bdcf5c0822c8cdc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
