Campana, Klara Jakobsdóttir</p>\r\n\r\nThe velvet belly lanternshark (<i>Etmopterus spinax</i>) is a small, bioluminescent shark that is caught as bycatch in many deep-sea fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean. Using data from 10,597 seasonal research survey tows spanning 11 years, the distribution, relative abundance, life history, and environmental preferences of <i>E</i>. <i>spinax</i> in Icelandic waters was examined for the first time. <i>E</i>. <i>spinax</i> (n = 8774) were only captured in relatively deep offshore waters to the south and west of Iceland. Females grew to larger sizes than males and reached 50% sexual maturity at a total length of 50 cm. Females at a late stage of maturity and very small juveniles (&lt;20 cm) were restricted to the central south Icelandic shelf, suggesting that this might be critical habitat for the reproduction of the species. Most of the sharks were captured at depths of 400–500 m, a relatively narrow depth range, and classified as a stenothermic warm-water species with habitat temperature restricted to about 6.3–8.0°C. Teleosts, crustaceans and cephalopods made up most of the diet. There was no indication of a decline in abundance over the time span of the survey. However, climate-induced warming of the deep ocean may shift the distribution of the species to more northerly waters within Iceland.","author":"Helga Mattína","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d2645f1eaf8ed1fd8f03db6accb0205731f9326bb79bf84cf7a8412b32e4c2cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
