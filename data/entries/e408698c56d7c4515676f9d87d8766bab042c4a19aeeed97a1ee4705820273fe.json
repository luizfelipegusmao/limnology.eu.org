{"title":"Ipsilateral transfer of motor skill from lower to upper limb in healthy adults: A randomized controlled trial","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303459","date":1716213600000,"content":"<p>by Noa Efrat Sherman, Orit Elion, Zvi Kozol, Moshe Einat, Silvi Frenkel-Toledo</p>\r\nBackground and purpose <p>Whereas motor skills of the untrained upper limb (UL) can improve following practice with the other UL, it has yet to be determined if an UL motor skill can improve following practice of that skill with the lower limb (LL).</p> Methods <p>Forty-five healthy subjects randomly participated in a 10-minute single-session intervention of (1) practicing 50 reaching movement (RM) sequences with the non-dominant left LL toward light switches (LL group); or (2) observing the identical 50 light switches sequences (Switches Observation (SO) group); or (3) observing nature films (Nature Observation (NO) group). RM sequence performance with the left UL toward the light switches was tested before and immediately after the intervention and retested after 24 h.</p> Results <p>Reaching response time improved in the LL group more than in the SO and NO groups in the posttest (pBonferroni = 0.038 and pBonferroni &lt; 0.001, respectively), and improved in the LL group more than in the NO group in the retest (pBonferroni = 0.004). Percentage of fails did not differ between groups across the timepoints.</p> Conclusions <p>It appears that the actual practice of the RM sequence skill with the UL together with the cognitive element embedded in the observation of the RM sequences contributes to ipsilateral transfer from LL to UL.</p>","author":"Noa Efrat Sherman","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e408698c56d7c4515676f9d87d8766bab042c4a19aeeed97a1ee4705820273fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
