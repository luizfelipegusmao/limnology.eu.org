{"title":"Influence of a Shaft Shoulder on the Torsional Load-Bearing Behaviour of Trochoidal Profile Contours as Positive Shaft&ndash;Hub Connections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1879/v1","date":1711723386000,"content":"Shafts with a stepped shoulder are particularly well known in the field of drive technology. In combination with a form-fit shaftâ€“hub connection, the shaft shoulder fixes the hub on the shaft as well as the absorption of the axial forces. With profiled shafts, there is a notch overlay in the shaft shoulder, involving the shaft shoulder and profile. If the hub is also connected with the profiled shaft, the hub edge acts as an additional notch in the shaft shoulder area. The multiple resulting notches have not previously been part of research activities in the field of innovative trochoidal profile connections. Compared to conventional positive-locking connections, such as the keyway connection or the involute splined shaft profile, the favourable features of trochoidal profiles have only been based on connections with smooth shafts without a shoulder in previous studies. Accordingly, this article addresses the numerical and experimental investigations of trochoidal profile connections with offset shafts for pure torsional loading. Focusing on a hybrid trochoid with four eccentricities and six drivers, a well-founded numerical and experimental investigation was carried out with numerous fatigue tests. In addition, the influence of a shaft shoulder was also demonstrated on simple epi- and hypotrochoidal profiles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05688691c6e731474cc97f3a981a80402c4a6e5814c08f5504b41f808c810890","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
