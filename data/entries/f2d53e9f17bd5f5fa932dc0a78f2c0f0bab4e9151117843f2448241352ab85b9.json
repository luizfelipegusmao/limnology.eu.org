In the synthesis of these catalysts, up to twelve distinct metal-support interaction (MSI) types may arise. These interactions, characterized by varying levels of charge transfer and electronic interplay between the metal nanoparticles and their supports, act as crucial tuning levers for enhancing catalytic efficiency [<a href=\"#ozae044.588-B1\">1</a>]. Although photoemission spectroscopy has been employed to study MSIs, it falls short by offering only a generalized view, overlooking the nuanced spectrum of MSIs within a single specimen. The specific charge transfer dynamics surrounding individual nanoparticles are seldom explored [<a href=\"#ozae044.588-B2\">2</a>], leaving the link between charge distribution and catalytic efficacy ambiguous. Therefore, the direct investigation of charge transfer in singular nanoparticles and its impact on catalytic performance remains a significant challenge.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f2d53e9f17bd5f5fa932dc0a78f2c0f0bab4e9151117843f2448241352ab85b9","category":"Environment"}
