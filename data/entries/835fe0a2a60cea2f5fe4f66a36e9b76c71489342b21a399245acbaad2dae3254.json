{"title":"Dry and Wet Spells in Poland in the Period 1966&ndash;2023","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1132/v1","date":1713347551000,"content":"The aim of this study is to present the spatial and temporal variability of the frequency of dry and wet days and dry and wet spells against the background of changes in precipitation and atmospheric circulation. The study is based on daily precipitation totals from 46 meteorological stations in Poland for the years 1966-2023. Additionally seven circulation indices were used: GBI, NAO, AO, EA, EA/WR. SCAND ana AMO. Dry days are defined as days without precipitation. Wet days are days with at least 1 mm of precipitation. It was shown that dry spells are much more common that wet spells, are longer and cover larger areas. Long term changes in annual characteristics of dry and wet days and spells are statistically insignificant. Only the length of the longest dry spell in the year increases. However, there are significant changes in their annual cycles. Spring is drier, in summer months, precipitation decreases in the south and increases in the north, November and December, symbols of gloomy rainy weather, are increasingly drier, rainy weather moved to January and February. The impact of circulation varies with seasons and NAO, Ao, SCAN and GBI indices have the strongest impact.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"835fe0a2a60cea2f5fe4f66a36e9b76c71489342b21a399245acbaad2dae3254","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
