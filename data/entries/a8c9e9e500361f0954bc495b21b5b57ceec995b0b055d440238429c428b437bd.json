{"title":"Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate exposure aggravates hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in cerebral endothelial cells by downregulating epithelial cadherin expression","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae163/7808470?rss=1","date":1727913600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a widely used plasticizer that has adverse health effects. Most phthalates exhibit reproductive toxicity and are associated with diseases such as cardiovascular disorders. However, the effect of DEHP exposure on acute hypoxia/reperfusion injury remains unknown. Therefore, we assessed whether hypoxia/reperfusion injury is aggravated by exposure to DEHP and investigated plausible underlying mechanisms, including oxidative stress and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and endothelial junctional proteins. bEnd.3 cells were exposed to DEHP and subsequently subjected to oxygenâ€“glucose deprivation (OGD). Cell viability was analyzed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) proliferation assay. The effect of DEHP/OGD/reoxygenation (R) was evaluated by assessing the levels of NO, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and PGE2. The expression of COX-2, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and the endothelial tight junction proteins claudin-5 and ZO-1 was evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. OGD/R decreased cell viability, and DEHP exposure before OGD/R further aggravated cell viability. DEHP/OGD/R significantly increased NO, PGE2, and ROS production following OGD/R. In the DEHP/OGD/R group, iNOS, COX-2, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP expression increased, and claudin-5 and ZO-1 levels decreased compared with those in the OGD/R group. E-Cadherin expression decreased significantly after DEHP/OGD/R exposure compared with that after OGD/R; this decrease in expression was recovered by treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor indomethacin and antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Exposure to DEHP exacerbated hypoxia-reoxygenation injury. The enhanced damage upon DEHP exposure was associated with increased oxidative stress and COX-2 expression, leading to E-cadherin downregulation and increased apoptosis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"a8c9e9e500361f0954bc495b21b5b57ceec995b0b055d440238429c428b437bd","category":"Environment"}
