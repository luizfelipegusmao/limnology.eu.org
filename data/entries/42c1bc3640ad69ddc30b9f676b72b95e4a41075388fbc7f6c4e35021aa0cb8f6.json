{"title":"A Preliminary Study of Antibiofilm Activity of Ethyl Acetate Extracts of Actinomycetes Isolated from Bris Soil, Terengganu against Salmonella typhimurium","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0960/v1","date":1710749934000,"content":"Salmonella typhimurium is the predominant serovar identified in cases of salmonellosis. It is recognised for adhering to various surfaces and creating biofilm, leading to several foodborne outbreaks and antibiotic resistance. Actinomycetes are thought to possess a wide array of antibacterial characteristics that can combat different diseases. Currently, it is unclear whether it has antibiofilm properties against S. typhimurium. This study aimed to assess the antibiofilm efficacy of actinomycetes extracts against S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 by the Crystal Violet assay. Four actinomycetes isolates, EAS5, EAS7, EAA141, and EAA11, were obtained from BRIS soil in Terengganu. The actinomycetes isolates were extracted using ethyl acetate (EA). S. typhimurium was exposed to extracts for 6, 12, and 18 hours. The results showed that all EA extracts effectively prevented the S. typhimurium biofilm at 12 and 18 hours. EAAA11 was the most effective against the 12-hour biofilm, whereas EAS5 was the most effective against the 18-hour biofilm among these extracts. In conclusion, actinomycetes isolated from the BRIS soil in Terengganu show potential for controlling Salmonella infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"42c1bc3640ad69ddc30b9f676b72b95e4a41075388fbc7f6c4e35021aa0cb8f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
