Herein, we report a new specimen of <i>S. alphacrucis</i> collected on the continental slope off Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil, thereby extending its known distribution by 420 km. Additionally, we provide the new meristic and morphometric data, the molecular identification using sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (<i>COI</i>), an updated distribution map, and a discussion of troglomorphic traits.</p>","author":"Marcos Roberto dos Reis Júnior, \nHeloisa De Cia Caixeta, \nClaudio Oliveira, \nMarcelo Roberto Souto de Melo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"0ec8278c623776f9c2e50c3a915dbbf0acb5ac3b66ac1c5b19db90048f1acedc","category":"Environment"}
