{"title":"Analysis of the Bactericidal Properties of Filtration Nonwovens Containing Active Nanoparticles of ZnS, TiOâ‚‚ and Nano-Ag","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1592/v1","date":1726979736000,"content":"Due to the deteriorating state of surface waters and the resulting reduction in their availability for the population, efforts have been undertaken to develop a biodegradable or compostable water filtration system capable of reducing the amount of harmful bacteria in this environment. The aim of this research was to develop nonwovens using the classic needle-punching method with commercially available polylactide (PLA) polymer, and subsequently, to select appropriate concentrations of modifiers to create systems with antibacterial properties. The resulting composites could potentially serve as filtration materials for the purification of surface waters. Nanoparticles such as zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and silver were employed in this research. These compounds exhibit antibacterial properties and are insoluble in water. To confirm the bactericidal activity of the additives, biological tests were conducted, and the distribution of these additives on the structure of the filtration material was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33e56114a67aec80e9ed58cf6064657ea94eaeeef6851e99e14a19627cfdfa37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
