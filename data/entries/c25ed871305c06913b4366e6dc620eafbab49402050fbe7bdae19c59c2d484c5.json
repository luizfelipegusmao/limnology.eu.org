{"title":"Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography: A Review of Applications for the Cornea and Ocular Surface","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1744/v1","date":1724663289000,"content":"Dye-based angiography is the main imaging modality in evaluating the vasculature of the eye. Although most commonly used to assess retinal vasculature, it can also delineate normal and abnormal blood vessels in the anterior segment diseases â€“ but is limited due to its invasive, time-consuming methods. Thus, anterior segment optical coherence tomography angiography (AS-OCTA) is a useful non-invasive modality capable of producing high-resolution images to evaluate the cornea and ocular surface vasculature. AS-OCTA has demonstrated the potential to detect and delineate blood vessels in the anterior segment with quality images comparable to dye-based angiography. AS-OCTA has a diverse range of applications for the cornea and ocular surface, such as objective assessment of corneal neovascularization and response to various treatments; diagnosis and evaluation of ocular surface squamous neoplasia; and evaluation of ocular surface disease including limbal stem cell deficiency and ischemia. Our review aims to summarize the new developments and clinical applications of AS-OCTA for the cornea and ocular surface.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c25ed871305c06913b4366e6dc620eafbab49402050fbe7bdae19c59c2d484c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
