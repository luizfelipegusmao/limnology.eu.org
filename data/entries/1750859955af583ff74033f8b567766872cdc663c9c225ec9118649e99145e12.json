Kawser Ahmed</p>\r\n\r\nThe study aimed to assess the level of potentially toxic elements (As, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, Mn, and Ni) and associated health implications through commonly consumed rice cultivars of Bangladesh available in Capital city, Dhaka. The range of As, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, Mn, and Ni in rice grains were 0.04–0.35, 0.01–0.15, 0.01–1.18, 10.74–34.35, 1.98–13.42, 0.18–1.43, 2.51–22.08, and 0.21–5.96 mg/kg fresh weight (FW), respectively. The principal component analysis (PCA) identified substantial anthropogenic activities to be responsible for these elements in rice grains. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of the elements was below the maximum tolerable daily intake (MTDI) level. The hazard index (HI) was above the threshold level, stating non-carcinogenic health hazards from consuming these rice cultivars. The mean target cancer risk (TCR) of As and Pb exceeded the USEPA acceptable level (10<sup>−6</sup>), revealing carcinogenic health risks from the rice grains.","author":"Nazma Shaheen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1750859955af583ff74033f8b567766872cdc663c9c225ec9118649e99145e12","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
