{"title":"Advances in Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing Technology with Polymer Materials and Polymer Nanocomposites: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2448/v1","date":1727764452000,"content":"Additive manufacturing (AM) is a cutting-edge manufacturing technique that allows for the direct creation of complicated objects from digital desktop designs. Among the several AM techniques, the material extrusion technique has gained more attention because of its ability to manufacture complicated objects and customizes profiles at a reasonable costin a shortertime period. The main advantages of this technique are its easier fabrication process and low cost when compared to other well-known AM techniques. Enhancement in mechanical properties plays the key role in the AM objects. So, Incorporating nanofillers or nanoparticles into the basic materials like polymers, carbon ceramic and metal based materials is one of the most promising alternatives. This review attempts to enlighten and inform readers about the basic working principle of material extrusion technique and the many forms of polymer-based additives reported in the literature. This review can guide the readers to compare and assess the uses of polymer based raw materials before on choosing the kind of material be used, as well as it provides a view point on the application of AM by the material extrusion method in different disciplines. Finally, the challenges and upcoming prospects of the material extrusion process are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"548490b77a2fa68c2a879008ec505ebff50aec45046987fa74dd5525130bc196","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
