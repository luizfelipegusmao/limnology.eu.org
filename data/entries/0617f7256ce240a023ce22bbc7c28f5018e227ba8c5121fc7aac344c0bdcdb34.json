{"title":"Factors associated with adolescent pregnancy among Chepang women and their health-seeking behavior in Ichchhakamana rural municipality of Chitwan district","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301261","date":1711634400000,"content":"<p>by Smriti Pant, Saugat Koirala, Anand Prasad Acharya, Pranil Man Singh Pradhan</p>\r\n\r\nAdolescent pregnancy is a critical public health issue, particularly in developing regions like Nepal, where it poses significant risks to maternal and child health and perpetuates the cycle of poverty. This study focused on the marginalized Chepang community, which is endangered and faces unique challenges. The study aimed to explore the factors associated with adolescent pregnancy among Chepang women in Ichchhakamana Rural Municipality, Chitwan, Nepal, and also assessed their reproductive health-seeking behavior. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted with 217 Chepang women aged 15â€“20 years, and data was collected through face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. The collected data was entered and analyzed using IBM SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistical tools like frequency, and percentage were used to express the results. Pearson chi-square test, Fisher exact test were used for bivariate analysis to determine the presence of association between the dependent and independent variables. Binary logistic regression was used for further analysis. The prevalence of current adolescent pregnancy was 8.3%(18), while one-fourth had experienced prior pregnancies during their adolescence. Factors significantly associated with adolescent pregnancy included lack of education among the women and their mothers, as well as living in joint families. Additionally, number of antenatal visits and consumption of iron tablets seemed to be lower among Chepang women in comparison to the national data. Chepang women had high adolescent pregnancy rates, with low education level and joint family structure being important risk factors for it. They also had inadequate reproductive health seeking behavior. Addressing these problems requires strategies that prioritize education and raise awareness about reproductive health.","author":"Smriti Pant","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0617f7256ce240a023ce22bbc7c28f5018e227ba8c5121fc7aac344c0bdcdb34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
