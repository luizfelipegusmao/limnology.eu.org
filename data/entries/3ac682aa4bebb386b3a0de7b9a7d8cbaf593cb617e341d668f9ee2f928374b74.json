{"title":"Microneedles Patch: Design, Fabrication and Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0674/v1","date":1712667150000,"content":"The delivery of therapeutical molecules through the skin, particularly to its deeper layers is impaired due to the stratum corneum layer, which acts as barrier to foreign substances. Thus, for the past years, scientists have focused on the development of more efficient methods to deliver molecules to skin distinct layers. Microneedles, as a new class of biomedical devices, consists on an array of microscale needles. This particular biomedical device had been drawing attention due to their ability to breach the stratum corneum, forming micro-conduits to facilitate the passage of therapeutical molecules. The microneedle device has several advantages over conventional methods, such as better medication adherence, easiness and painless self-administration. Moreover, it is possible to deliver the molecules swiftly or over time. Microneedles can vary in shape, size and composition. The design process of a microneedle device must take in account several factors, like the location delivery, the material and manufacturing process. Microneedles have been used in a large number of fields from drug and vaccine application, cosmetics, therapy, diagnosis, tissue engineering, sample extraction, cancer research, wound healing, among others.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ac682aa4bebb386b3a0de7b9a7d8cbaf593cb617e341d668f9ee2f928374b74","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
