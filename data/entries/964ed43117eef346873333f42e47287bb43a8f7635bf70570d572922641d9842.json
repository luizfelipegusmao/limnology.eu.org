{"title":"Meta-Analysis of Internet Gaming Disorder Prevalence: Assessing the Impacts of DSM-5 and ICD-11 Diagnostic Criteria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1874/v1","date":1711724547000,"content":"With the inclusion of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) in both the DSM-5 and ICD-11, understanding the prevalence and diagnostic discrepancies is crucial for developing appropriate interventions. This study presents a meta-analysis of the prevalence of IGD based on two diagnostic criteria. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science databases. 17 studies were included in the final analysis, The analysis incorporated studies employing the DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria and focused on the impact of various factors, including study location, sample size, and quality score, on the reported prevalence rates using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity and publication bias were analyzed using an I2 test and Galbraith plots , The prevalence of IGD varied among the selected studies, with a general pooled prevalence of 5% (95% CI: 3%â€“7%). Subgroup analysis indicated that the prevalence rates of IGD (DSM-5 criteria) and GD (ICD-11 criteria) do not show significant differences. DSM-5-based scales yielded varied results, while heterogeneity among the studies was high (I2 = 98.50). In contrast, ICD-11-based scales produced more consistent and less variable findings. Our findings highlight that assessment scales, not diagnostic criteria, impact IGD prevalence. This underscores the importance of adopting standardized methodologies to guide public health interventions. However, given the limited research based on ICD-11 diagnostic criteria, further investigation is necessary to determine the variations in prevalence rates of IGD under different diagnostic standards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"964ed43117eef346873333f42e47287bb43a8f7635bf70570d572922641d9842","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
