{"title":"Innovative Air Preconditioning Method for Accurate Particulate Matter Sensing in Humid Environments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2482/v1","date":1722343057000,"content":"This paper addresses the challenges of improving the accuracy of low-cost particulate matter sensors (LCPMS) under high humidity conditions. Such weather conditions often lead to the overestimation of particle counts due to hygroscopic particle growth, resulting in a potential public concern, although most of the detected particles consist of just water. The paper presents an innovative design for an indicative air-quality measuring station that integrates the particulate matter sensor with a preconditioning subsystem designed to mitigate the impact of humidity. The preconditioning subsystem works by heating the incoming air, effectively reducing the relative humidity and preventing the hygroscopic growth of particles before they reach the sensor.\nTo validate the effectiveness of this approach, parallel measurements were conducted using both preconditioned and non-preconditioned sensors over a period of 19 weeks. The data was analyzed to compare the performance of the sensors in terms of accuracy for PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 particles. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in measurement accuracy for the preconditioned sensor, especially in environments with high relative humidity. When the conditions were too severe and both sensors started measuring incorrect values, the preconditioned sensor measured values were closer to the actual values. Also, the period of measuring incorrect values was shorter with the preconditioned sensor.\nThe results suggest that the implementation of air preconditioning subsystems in LCPMS can provide a cost-effective solution to overcome humidity-related inaccuracies, thereby improving the overall quality of measured air pollution data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8d05bca05bb30b6b419e02a5efdb37b7dfecd377529fb9e2859a08dfa2687f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
