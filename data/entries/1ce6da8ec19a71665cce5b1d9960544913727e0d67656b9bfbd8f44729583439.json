{"title":"Relationship between the Mediterranean Diet and Arterial Stiffness, Metabolic Syndrome and its Components in People over 65 Years of Age","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2265/v1","date":1727694279000,"content":"The aims of the study were to analyze the relationship between the Mediterranean diet (MD) and arterial stiffness and metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components in individuals aged over 65, overall and by sex. Subjects were people over 65 years of age with a full record of all variables analyzed from the EVA, MARK and EVIDENT studies. Data from 1,280 subjects with a mean age of 69.52±3.58 years (57.5% men) were analyzed. MD was recorded with the validated 14-item MEDAS questionnaire used in the PREDIMED study. MetS was defined following the guidelines of the joint scientific statement from the Programa Nacional de Educación sobre el Colesterol III. Arterial stiffness was assessed with the VaSera VS-1500® device by measuring the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). Results: The mean MEDAS score was 6.00 ± 1.90, (5.92 ± 1.92 in men, 6.11 ± 1.88 in women; p = 0.036). The mean CAVI value was 9.30 ± 1.11 (9.49 ± 1.05 men, 9.03 ± 1.13 women; p = &amp;lt;0.001). The mean baPWV value was 15.82 ± 2.56 (15.75 ± 2.46 men, 15.92 ± 2.68 women; p = &amp;lt;0.001). MetS was found in 51% (49% men, 54% women; p = 0.036). Subjects with MetS had lower MD adherence and higher arterial stiffness values than subjects without MetS. Overall, we found a negative association of MD score with the number of MetS components (β = -0.168), with glycemia (β = -0.007), triglycerides (β = -0.003), waist circumference (β = -0.018), CAVI (β = -0.196) and baPWV (β = -0.065), and a positive association with HDL cholesterol (β = 0.013). By sex, associations followed the same direction but without reaching statistical significance with blood glucose and triglycerides in women and with HDL cholesterol and waist circumference in men. Conclusion: Results indicate that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet decreases arterial stiffness and the percentage of subjects with MetS, although results differed in the association with MetS components by sex.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ce6da8ec19a71665cce5b1d9960544913727e0d67656b9bfbd8f44729583439","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
