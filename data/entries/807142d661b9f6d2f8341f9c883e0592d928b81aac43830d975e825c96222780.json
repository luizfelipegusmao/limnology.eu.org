{"title":"Perspectives: Two Approaches in Computational Social Sciences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1654/v1","date":1729595096000,"content":"Big data-driven machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) is not all computational social sciences (CSS) have. Agent-based modeling (ABM) or multi-agent system (MAS) is another fundamentally different but equally useful approach in CSS. In fact, the two approaches start from very different orientations and their differences have deeper root in ontology. ML/AI aims to imitate and then surpass human capacities, from sensing to perceiving, reasoning, calculating, and acting. In contrast, ABM seeks to simulate how social outcomes emerge from the complex interactions of agentsâ€™ actions within a specific environment. Yet, precisely because these two technologies are different, they can be complementary to each other. There is a bright future for integrating ABM with ML/AI for tackling real world challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"807142d661b9f6d2f8341f9c883e0592d928b81aac43830d975e825c96222780","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
