The real-time satellite data of the earth's surface and its different findings can be studied with the assistance of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems. This work builds the novel Fuzzy Swin Transformer-based LU/LC classification model using the LISS-III satellite data of Yelagiri Hills. In the proposed work, the LU/LC features extracted from fuzzy clustering were used as the input training patches when executing the Swin Transformer model. The training patches assist the transformer in finding the LU/LC classification map with good computational complexity and accuracy. The Simple Random, Cluster, Systematic, and Stratified Random sampling methods were used to validate the accuracy of the acquired LU/LC classification map. The proposed Fuzzy Swin Transformer model attains good results with an average classification accuracy of 98.43% using Simple Random Sampling, 97.45% using Stratified Random Sampling, 97.36% using Systematic Sampling, and 96.97% using Cluster Sampling. The LU/LC change detected in this work was considered an important source of information to support the concerned land resource planners in taking necessary action to preserve the land cover, exclusively for the forest-covered areas of the hill stations.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"d8620c10e150e4e9aa6b03ab046acfce7f7a16c519bb9e09cb03ce0c5fb30c91","category":"Environment"}
