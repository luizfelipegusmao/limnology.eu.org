{"title":"Fear of Artificial Intelligence? NLP, ML and LLMs Based Discovery of AI-Phobia and Fear Sentiment Propagation by AI News.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0704/v1","date":1710309787000,"content":"Confusion, fear and mixed sentiments prevail in the minds of people towards what is arguably one of the most important of dynamics of modern human society: Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study aims to explore the contributions of news media towards this phenomenon - we analyze nearly seventy thousand recent news headlines on AI, using natural language processing (NLP) informatics methods, machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs) to draw insights and discover dominant themes. Our theoretical framework was derived from extant literature which posits the power of fear producing articles and news headlines which produce significant impacts on public behavior even when available in small quantities. We applied extensive textual informatics methods using word and phrase frequency analytics, sentiment analysis and human experts based thematic analysis to discover insights on AI phobia inducing news headlines. Our rigorous analysis of nearly seventy thousand headlines using multiple validation methods in NLP (exploratory informatics including BERT, Llama 2 and Mistral based topic identification), ML (supervised informatics) and LLMs (neural nets for sentiment classification, with BERT, Llama 2 and Mistral) demonstrates the presence of an unreasonable level of emotional negativity and fear inducing verbiage in AI news headlines. The framing of AI as being dangerous or as being an existential threat to humanity can have a profound impact on public perception, and the resulting AI phobia and confusion in public perceptions are inherently detrimental to the science of AI. Furthermore, this can also impact AI policy and regulations, and harm society. We conclude with a discussion deducing implications for society and make recommendations for education and policies that could support human identity and dignity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"920399c41edbb74ed293ec0586b41af26af472ce21899b52567d380c2eb8d8ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
