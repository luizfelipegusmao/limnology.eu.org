IPV has social and economic impacts on women, family, and the wider society. In this study, we aimed to determine factors associated with IPV among currently partnered women aged 15–49.</p> Methods <p>We conducted a secondary data analysis of the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2022. The study examines the lifetime prevalence of IPV. IPV was measured in three domains: experience of physical violence, emotional violence, and sexual violence. Weighted univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were applied to determine factors associated with IPV. The results of logistic regression were presented as crude odds ratio (COR) and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI).</p> Results <p>Of 3853 women, 27.2% had experienced any form of IPV. The lifetime prevalence of physical violence, emotional violence, and sexual violence were 23.2%, 12.8%, and 7.1%, respectively. Higher odds of physical violence were reported among women aged 35–49 years (AOR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.58–2.87), women without formal education (AOR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.10–2.06), and women who justified wife-beating (AOR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.00–1.52). Women from poor households (AOR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.12–2.35) and women with uneducated partners (AOR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.08–2.58) were at higher risk of experiencing sexual violence. Women with unemployed husbands reported a higher risk of physical violence (AOR: 2.72, 95% CI: 1.45–5.06) and emotional violence (AOR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.12–2.35).</p> Conclusion <p>Almost one in three currently partnered women experienced some form of IPV in their lifetime. Various sociodemographic, partner-related, and women’s empowerment-related factors were associated with experiencing IPV. Acknowledging and addressing these factors is essential to mitigating the high rates of IPV among reproductive aged women.</p>","author":"Parash Mani Sapkota","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"825a7904728ac416a6652788ef1fbdb12793987f6b70596223add12637599ee7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
