{"title":"Design for an Orientation Algorithm of Ahrs Based on Gain Scheduling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2048/v1","date":1717118913000,"content":"In recent years, the AHRS has become an important research area. In order to improve the orientation measurement accuracy of AHRS, this paper first expounds the algorithm principle of the AHRS. Then, aiming at the problem of poor stability of the traditional gradient descent method under high dynamics or large magnetic field interference, a gain-scheduled anti-interference AHRS orientation algorithm is designed. By using the switching architecture designed with this algorithm for gain scheduling, it can ensure stable performance while being subjected to apparent acceleration and ferromagnetic interference. Finally, experimental verification is conducted, and the experimental results show that: in the presence of interference, the roll angle error is 0.0350°, the pitch angle error is 0.0277°, and the yaw angle error is 0.9611°, thereby verifying the strong anti-interference performance of the gain-scheduled AHRS orientation algorithm proposed in this paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d28bc379f692b25bb5775a998b2e8e1197318c6703aa359d119172c7b7b718cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
