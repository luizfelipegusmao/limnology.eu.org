{"title":"Effects of steam explosion pretreatment on the digestive properties and gut microbiota of Laminaria japonica polysaccharide","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13714?af=R","date":1719914947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p><i>Laminaria japonica</i> polysaccharide, which is an important bioactive substance of <i>Laminaria japonica</i> with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In this study, the molecular weight, functional groups and surface morphology were investigated to evaluate the digestive properties of <i>Laminaria japonica</i> polysaccharide before and after steam explosion.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results indicated that the <i>Laminaria japonica</i> polysaccharide entered the large intestine to be utilized by the gut microbiota after passing through the oral, gastric and small intestinal. Meanwhile, <i>Laminaria japonica</i> polysaccharide of steam explosion promoted the growth of beneficial bacteria <i>Phascolarctobacterium</i> and <i>Intestinimonas</i>, and increased the content of acetic, propionic and butyric acids, which was 2.29-folds, 2.60-folds and 1.63-folds higher than the control group after 48 h of fermentation.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study reveals that the effect of steam explosion pretreatment on the digestion <i>in vitro</i> and gut microbiota of <i>Laminaria japonica</i> polysaccharide will provide a basic theoretical basis for the potential application of <i>Laminaria japonica</i> polysaccharide as a prebiotic in the food industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yaqing Lin, \nZihao Zhang, \nSijie Ren, \nLin Wang, \nBin Xiong, \nBaodong Zheng, \nYi Zhang, \nLei Pan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"aa84d0da8cc0392c01a54aa9cb62c0e177d3d96345df314c902f3b3a14b73207","category":"Environment"}
