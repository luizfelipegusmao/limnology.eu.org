{"title":"Research on Citrus Fruit Freshness Detection Based on Near-Infrared Spectroscopy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1149/v1","date":1718619153000,"content":"The abstract should be an objective representation of the article and it must not contain results that are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the main conclusions. The study developed a novel method for evaluating the freshness of citrus fruits by integrating near-infrared spectroscopy with the nonlinear data processing capabilities of a BP neural network. This approach utilizes specific wavelength analysis to distinguish between fresh and non-fresh fruits effectively. Advanced preprocessing techniques are employed to remove spectral anomalies, enhancing the network's ability to accurately identify crucial quality indicators like sugar content. Concurrently, an experiment utilising a MATLAB-based BP neural network optimised the number of hidden layer nodes, identifying 61 as optimal. This configuration achieved impressive metrics, including a mean squared error of 0.0025665 and a root mean squared error of 49.8214, over 1000 training iterations with an 80% learning rate. The model demonstrated a high accuracy rate of 97.6275%, confirming its precision and reliability in assessing citrus freshness. This synergy between advanced neural network processing and spectroscopic techniques marks a significant advancement in agricultural quality assessment, setting new standards for speed and efficiency in data processing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"66de24ee67a7c10499be2aaa92dc6931991d5a1214eef75ca43295dba67870cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
