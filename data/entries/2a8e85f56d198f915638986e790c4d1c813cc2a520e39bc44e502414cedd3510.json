While the integration of virtual reality (VR) and robotics has already marked significant strides in the industry, AI is taking patient rehabilitation to new heights. The integration of AI, VR and robotics in physiotherapy linked to a significant leap forward in patient rehabilitation. These technologies not only increase the effectiveness of the treatment, but also make it more accessible and attractive. In this article, we propose to study the use of AI in the management of medical rehabilitation programs, and we present a comprehensive survey of the latest empirical studies, highlighting AI-based technologies that facilitate the rehabilitation process, trying to demonstrate that the integration of AI in medical rehabilitation programs offers a transformative approach to patient care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a8e85f56d198f915638986e790c4d1c813cc2a520e39bc44e502414cedd3510","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
