{"title":"Analysis of Migratory Catfish Production from Artisanal Fishing in the Middle Madeira Sub‐Basin Using New Monitoring Methods, Southwestern Amazon","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/6668857?af=R","date":1708675200000,"content":"<p>Studies on the production of <i>Pimelodidae</i> catfish in the Amazon are generally carried out in large fishing centers. However, the data referring to small-scale fisheries have gaps that can represent a risk to the activity. This study evaluated the volume produced and the revenue obtained from migratory catfish of the <i>Pimelodidae</i> family of commercial interest landed in Humaitá, Amazonas, Brazil, from May 2018 to April 2019. Daily monitoring was carried out with the Z-31 Fishermen’s Colony through questionnaires to fishermen for each vessel docked. The total production was 6013.93 kg, with 1,689 fish counted and 13 species. A total of 186 landings by 122 fishermen in 24 fishing sites characterized as rivers, lakes, and “igarapés” were evaluated. The average selling price was R$5.57/kg, and the highest volumes were obtained from July to September, mainly with gillnets, where the “Surubim” <i>Pseudoplatystoma punticfer</i> had the highest volume and revenue. Low productivity was verified in most localities, characterizing the fishing as artisanal. The lack of adequate conditions for storing and transporting fish, the local hydrological variations, and the presence of hydroelectric plants on the Madeira River are major factors limiting the fishing expansion in southern Amazonas.</p>","author":"Igor Hister Lourenço, \nLarissa Sbeghen Pelegrini, \nVictoria Judith Isaac Nahum, \nMarcelo Rodrigues dos Anjos, \nHamed Ghafarifarsani","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"37f790a376fb3bf13c6ce50127b1bca40a34bf706d76a776f1d2463bb0a464b9","category":"Environment"}
