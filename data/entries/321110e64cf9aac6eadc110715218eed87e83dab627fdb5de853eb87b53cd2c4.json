DNA-magnetite nanoparticles: Synthesis, characterization, and biocompatibility assays on normal and cancerous cells","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311927","date":1728914400000,"content":"<p>by David Arregui-Almeida, Martín Coronel, Karina Analuisa, Carlos Bastidas-Caldes, Santiago Guerrero, Marbel Torres, Andrea Aluisa, Alexis Debut, Werner Brämer-Escamilla, Fernanda Pilaquinga</p>\r\n\r\nMagnet-mediated gene therapy has gained considerable interest from researchers as a novel alternative for treating genetic disorders, particularly through the use of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs)—such as magnetite NPs (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>NPs)—as non-viral genetic vectors. Despite their commercial availability for specific genetic transfection, such as in microglia cell lines, many potential uses remain unexplored. Still, ethical concerns surrounding the use of human DNA often impede genetic research. Hence, this study examined DNA-coated Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>NPs (DNA-Fe₃O₄NPs) as potential transfection vectors for human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) and A549 (lung cancer) cell lines, using banana (Musa sp.) as a low-cost, and bioethically unproblematic DNA source. Following coprecipitation synthesis, DNA-Fe₃O₄NP characterization revealed a ζ-potential of 40.65 ± 4.10 mV, indicating good colloidal stability in aqueous media, as well as a superparamagnetic regime, evidenced by the absence of hysteresis in their magnetization curves. Successful DNA coating on the NPs was confirmed through infrared spectra and surface analysis results, while magnetite content was verified via characteristic X-ray diffraction peaks. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) determined the average size of the DNA-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>NPs to be 14.69 ± 5.22 nm. TEM micrographs also showed no morphological changes in the DNA-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>NPs over a 30-day period. Confocal microscopy of HFF and A549 lung cancer cell lines incubated with fluoresceinamine-labeled DNA-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>NPs demonstrated their internalization into both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Neither uncoated Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>NPs nor DNA-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>NPs showed cytotoxicity to A549 lung cancer cells at 1–50 μg/mL and 25–100 μg/mL, respectively, after 24 h. HFFs also maintained viability at 1–10 μg/mL for both NP types. In conclusion, DNA-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>NPs were successfully internalized into cells and exhibited no cytotoxicity in both healthy and cancerous cells across a range of concentrations. These NPs, capable of binding to various types of DNA and RNA, hold promise for applications in gene therapy.","author":"David Arregui-Almeida","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"321110e64cf9aac6eadc110715218eed87e83dab627fdb5de853eb87b53cd2c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
