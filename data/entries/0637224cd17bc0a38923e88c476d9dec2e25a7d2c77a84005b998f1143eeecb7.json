This study aimed to determine the prevalence of Salmonella and Campyl-obacter in poultry processing lines where different chlorination techniques were used. The sam-ples were collected from four types of processing plants considering the chlorine concentration used in the chill tank, which ranged from 2 ppm to 50 ppm. Salmonella and Campylobacter were isolated from carcass washings, neck skin, and, caecal samples. Subsequently, an antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates. The results revealed the overall prevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter was 78.25%, and 64% respectively. Positive percentages of Salmonella and Campylobacter were high in carcasses compared to neck skin and caeca. Carcass Campylobacter counts at higher chlorine concentrations ranging from 20 â€“ 50 ppm was significantly low (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0637224cd17bc0a38923e88c476d9dec2e25a7d2c77a84005b998f1143eeecb7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
