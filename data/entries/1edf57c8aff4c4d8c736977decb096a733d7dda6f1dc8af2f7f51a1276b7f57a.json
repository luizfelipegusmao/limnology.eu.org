{"title":"Insect Bacteriocytes: Adaptation, Development, and Evolution","link":"https://new.annurev.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ento-010323-124159?TRACK=RSS","date":1706140800000,"content":"<div><p>Bacteriocytes are host cells specialized to harbor symbionts in certain insect taxa. The adaptation, development, and evolution of bacteriocytes underlie insect symbiosis maintenance. Bacteriocytes carry enriched host genes of insect and bacterial origin whose transcription can be regulated by microRNAs, which are involved in hostâ€“symbiont metabolic interactions. Recognition proteins of peptidoglycan, the bacterial cell wall component, and autophagy regulate symbiont abundance in bacteriocytes. Horizontally transferred genes expressed in bacteriocytes influence the metabolism of symbiont peptidoglycan, which may affect the bacteriocyte immune response against symbionts. Bacteriocytes release or transport symbionts into ovaries for symbiont vertical transmission. Bacteriocyte development and death, regulated by transcriptional factors, are variable in different insect species. The evolutionary origin of insect bacteriocytes remains unclear. Future research should elucidate bacteriocyte cell biology, the molecular interplay between bacteriocyte metabolic and immune functions, the genetic basis of bacteriocyte origin, and the coordination between bacteriocyte function and host biology in diverse symbioses.</p></div>","author":"Jun-Bo Luan","siteTitle":"Annual Reviews: Annual Review of Entomology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7a213ec7b64ebddde52fd1163df325e740564b5ca434e1b9e961510d51a3f261","entryHash":"1edf57c8aff4c4d8c736977decb096a733d7dda6f1dc8af2f7f51a1276b7f57a","category":"Environment"}
