{"title":"Digest: Habitat and competition drive diversification in Gondwanan fish","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/5/1020/7607844?rss=1","date":1707868800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Why do some clades diversify more than others? And what are the roles of abiotic and biotic factors in driving such unequal diversification? To explore this, <a href=\"#CIT0004\">Burns et al. (2024)</a> investigate variation in body morphology in a group of freshwater fish, Characiformes, across South America and Africa. They find that habitat features such as slope, elevation, and flow rates have played a major role in the diversification of morphological variation in the Characiformes. The Neotropical lineages residing in significantly more diverse slope and elevation habitats were found to display more body shape diversity than African lineages. The authors also report that competition might have limited the morphological variation in African Characiformes compared to the Neotropical lineages. This study highlights the importance of exploring both abiotic and biotic factors when examining diversification.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"c01018c6c78f21dbb27a0d310dc470594756b640b300f1c3fa66dba6098c12bd","category":"Environment"}
