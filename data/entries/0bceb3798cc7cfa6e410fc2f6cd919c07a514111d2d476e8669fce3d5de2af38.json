This prospective cohort study enrolled 115 cancer patients, and data from 91 patients who received two doses of COVID-19 vaccines were analyzed. Blood was drawn at baseline, day 28, and 6 months post-second dose for neutralizing antibody analysis. The primary outcome was seroconversion rate against wild type and Omicron at day 28. Secondary outcomes included seroconversion at 6 months, factors associated with seroconversion, and safety. Of the 157 cancer patients screened, 91 were enrolled, with 45% receiving chemotherapy. Seroconversion rates at day 28 were 77% for the wild type and 62% for Omicron. Chemotherapy did not affect seroconversion (p=0.789 for wild type, p=0.597 for Omicron). Vaccine type positively correlated with seroconversion, with an adjusted ORR of 25.86 (p=0.029) for the wild type and 17.38 (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0bceb3798cc7cfa6e410fc2f6cd919c07a514111d2d476e8669fce3d5de2af38","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
