Samples were extracted by acetonitrile and then salted with an acetate buffer system. Extractants neutral alumina (Al-N), strong cation exchange silica gel bonded adsorbent (SCX) and graphitized carbon black (GCB) were used for sample purification. The method demonstrates excellent accuracy and reproducibility. Under optimized conditions, the correlation coefficients of hexachlorophene were higher than 0.995 in the range of 0.5–20 ng/mL. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 2.0 μg/kg. The average recoveries, assessed at three spiked levels (2.0, 4.0, and 20.0μg/kg) across various matrices including cabbage, celery, tomato, eggplant, potato, radish, cowpea, chives, apple, peach, grape, citrus, bitter melon, banana and hami melon ranged from 72.0 to 100.5% with relative standard deviations from 3.2 to 9.8% (n = 6).","author":"Yuan Ma","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d804abe098501bcb222087e4deb868376a1bd04f5684cd6d16e74937d1227a00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
