{"title":"Effects of selfing on the evolution of sexual reproduction","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/5/879/7590635?rss=1","date":1706313600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants exhibit diverse breeding systems, with populations capable of outcrossing, selfing, and/or asexual reproduction. However, interactions between the three reproductive pathways remain not fully clear. Sexual reproduction introduces segregation and recombination, but incurs several costs. Selfing can affect the relative costs and benefits of sexual vs. asexual reproduction. Building population genetic models, I explore how selfing affects the evolution of a sexual reproduction rate modifier via (a) indirect selection due to segregation, (b) indirect selection from changes in recombination rates, and (c) selection from the cost of meiosis and mate limitation. The dominant selective force mediating the evolution of sex is found to vary with the rate of sexual reproduction and selfing, but selective force (a) and (c) are generally stronger than selective force (b). A modifier enhancing sexual reproduction tends to be favored by indirect selection generated by partially recessive, small-effect deleterious mutations, while hindered by highly recessive lethal mutations. Overall, evolution toward higher sexual reproduction is hindered at low sexual reproduction rates and intermediate selfing rates, but favored under high selfing rates. The results suggest that asexual reproduction may precede the evolution of selfing and offer insights into the evolution of mechanisms reducing geitonogamy in partially clonal populations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"863613623431e2d714876650446863a7287481c2aa76ec36b018ff40cb7afd35","category":"Environment"}
