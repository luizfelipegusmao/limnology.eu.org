The Inqitat plateau (Khor Rori Archaeological Park, Oman) shows rich mollusc assemblages, present in the HAS1 settlement and in a shell midden nearby (Iron Age). By analysing the environmental requirements of the species identified in the assemblages, we reconstruct the past coastal environment and investigate its exploitation by the local population and human activities during the settlement occupation. This is the first multidisciplinary investigation of Iron Age molluscs from Dhofar. Our results indicate that the environment surrounding the site was characterised by rocky shores and shallow-water sandy to sandy-muddy substrates, where locals collected shells. Mangrove species were recovered in few numbers, indicating that this environment was restricted or not exploited. Furthermore, a different use of shells between circular houses within the settlement and the midden was observed; in the former, species used as ornaments are more abundant, whereas, in the latter, species used for food purposes are found, confirming the primary use of the midden as a dump. The presence of easily accessible settings for mollusc collection in the site's vicinity and the richness in food resources due to a coastal upwelling makes this region very attractive for human populations.</p>","author":"Gaia Crippa, \nSilvia Lischi, \nMauro Cremaschi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Quaternary Science: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e4cb264adfd99de4695eda5f992d61d2819971c444b4237b1e7b12202742678e","entryHash":"2f3ad97875178559936421f3a17de27e2ce2bb5102fa0ebdd4ca7344454f56c1","category":"Environment"}
