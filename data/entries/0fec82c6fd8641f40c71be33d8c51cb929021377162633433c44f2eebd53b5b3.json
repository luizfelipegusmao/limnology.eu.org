{"title":"4D-STEM Study on Ferroelectric Domain Structure within Biaxially-Strained BiFeO3 Film","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.574/7720171?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>BiFeO<sub>3</sub> (BFO) has been intensively studied for the last two decades because the multiferroic property, i.e., ferroelectricity with <span>G</span>-type antiferromagnetism well above room temperature [<a href=\"#ozae044.574-B1\">1</a>], implies significant application potential for emerging spintronics technology [<a href=\"#ozae044.574-B2\">2</a>]. In particular, epitaxial growth techniques have been widely used to grow BFO films on single crystal substrates that have comparable crystal structures and lattice parameters. As a result, a variety of metastable BFO phases have been reported to grow owing to elastically applied strain within the BFO film caused by the lattice mismatch with different substrate materials. While the orientations of spontaneous polarization within these metastable BFO phases are found different than those in equilibrium BFO, the magnitudes of spontaneous polarization reported for these metastable BFO phases area similar to that found for equilibrium BFO (∼100 μC/cm<sup>2</sup>) [<a href=\"#ozae044.574-B3\">3</a>] with no sign of significant magnitude changes predicted by theoretical calculations [<a href=\"#ozae044.574-B4\">4</a>]. Furthermore, while some of the metastable phases are reported with complete structural information such as space group, lattice parameter, and basis location [<a href=\"#ozae044.574-B5\">5</a>], others are simply based on lattice parameter distortions measured by X-ray diffraction and include no such information. Thus, the relationship between the crystal structures of metastable BFO phases and spontaneous polarization property within epitaxially grown BFO films remains debated.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0fec82c6fd8641f40c71be33d8c51cb929021377162633433c44f2eebd53b5b3","category":"Environment"}
