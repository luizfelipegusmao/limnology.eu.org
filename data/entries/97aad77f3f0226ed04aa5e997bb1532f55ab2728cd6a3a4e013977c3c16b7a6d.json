{"title":"A van der Waals Model of Solvation Thermodynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0624/v1","date":1720486095000,"content":"Exploiting the van der Waals model of liquids, it is possible to derive analytical formulas for the thermodynamic functions governing solvation, the transfer of a solute molecule from a fixed position in the ideal gas phase to a fixed position in the liquid phase. The solvation Gibbs free energy change consists of two contributions: (a) the high number density of all liquids and the repulsive interactions due to the basic fact that each molecule has its own body lead to the need of spending free energy to create a cavity suitable to host the solute molecule; (b) the ubiquitous intermolecular attractive interactions lead to a gain in free energy for turning on attractions between the solute molecule and surrounding liquid molecules. Also the solvation entropy change consists of two contributions: (a) there is an entropy loss in all liquids because the cavity presence limits the space accessible to liquid molecules during their continuous translations; (b) there is an entropy gain in all liquids, at room temperature, due to the liquid structural reorganization as a response to the perturbation represented by solute insertion. The latter entropy contribution proves to be balanced by a corresponding enthalpy term. This scenario emerged from the van der Waals model is in qualitative agreement with experimental results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97aad77f3f0226ed04aa5e997bb1532f55ab2728cd6a3a4e013977c3c16b7a6d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
