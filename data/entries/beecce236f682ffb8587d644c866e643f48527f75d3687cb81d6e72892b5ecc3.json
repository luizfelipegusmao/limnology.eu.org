{"title":"Optimising Sensor Controlled Systems With Minimal Intervention: A Fuzzy Relational Calculus Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0372/v1","date":1712227002000,"content":"This article describes an approach for optimising sensor-controlled systems through minimal intervention, utilising Fuzzy Linear Systems of Equations (FLSE). Staring with a generalised model of the system behaviour, incorporating an array of control units, environmental sensors, and an expert knowledge base. The described problems of detecting the level of intervention needed to change the system state to another is handled with the help of developed methods for solving the inverse problem for FLSE. By achieving minimal intervention, we ensure that system adjustments effective, economically optimal and non-intrusive. A MATLAB-based implementation is presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"beecce236f682ffb8587d644c866e643f48527f75d3687cb81d6e72892b5ecc3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
