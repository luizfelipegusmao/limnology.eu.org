{"title":"Effects of Continuous and Rotational Grazing Practices on Forage Production and Goat Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0090/v1","date":1714644271000,"content":"In an effectively managed grazing system, goats as grazers can benefit the land's physical, chemical, biological, and economic aspects. However, little research has evaluated rotational and continuous goat grazing in Kentucky. This observational study investigated the impact of rotational and continuous grazing on forage production and goat performance. One group of 10 does was placed on a rotational pasture, and another group of 10 does were placed on a continuous pasture, each pasture measuring two acres. The pastures were side-by-side with similar forage types and compositions. Goat performance was measured by body weight and eye color score (FAMCHA). Forage production was measured weekly by collecting forage heights at three random spots in each pasture. The rotational grazing field displayed a more evenly grazing pattern, while the continuous field experienced overgrazing in some areas and overgrown of the less desired forage. Goats on the continuous field had a decrease in body weight, while the weights were more consistent in the rotational grazing field. The FAMACHA score was temporarily reduced on the rotational grazing pasture, indicating that properly managed rotational grazing may prevent anemia, possibly by reducing the shedding of gastrointestinal parasites. However, due to drought and lack of forage, the FAMACHA score of goats in the rotational grazing system reverted to its original status by the end, indicating that more extensive management and timely adjustments are necessary to ensure optimal goat performance. Our results suggest that rotational grazing may support more consistent forage yields and body weights of goats and has the potential to reduce the incidence of anemia and parasitic infestations in goats in Kentucky.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc4db03835cf8ec9141675d14e4808acd362407e349e69b5364e3a050479dde4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
