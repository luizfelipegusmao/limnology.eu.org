It provides high-resolution imaging with contextual information, making it valuable for studying complex biological systems and materials science. CLEM allows researchers to correlate specific molecules or structures observed with LM to ultrastructural details revealed by EM, providing insights into spatial organization and function. The light microscopy component of CLEM can include almost any modalities, and electron microscopy component comprises almost any electron microscopy method. The selection of these methods is dictated by experimental design and the instrumental capabilities of the core facility. The Center of Advanced Microscopy (CAM) predominantly emphasizes state-of-the-art confocal and super-resolution microscopy techniques, with a less extensive electron microscopy instrumentation which is managed by two full-time staff members. Here we discuss the specifics and challenges that may occur while providing CLEM services in such a core facility setting.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"57b10285d0b8020c5a79d40216e5aa294e55973432eaa5c6d74b0145722d230f","category":"Environment"}
