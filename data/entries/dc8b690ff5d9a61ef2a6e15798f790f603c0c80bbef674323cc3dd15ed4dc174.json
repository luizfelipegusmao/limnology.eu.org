{"title":"Chromatin sensing: integration of environmental signals to reprogram plant development through chromatin regulators","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/14/4332/7618509?rss=1","date":1709510400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Chromatin regulation in eukaryotes plays pivotal roles in controlling the developmental regulatory gene network. This review explores the intricate interplay between chromatin regulators and environmental signals, elucidating their roles in shaping plant development. As sessile organisms, plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to perceive and respond to environmental cues, orchestrating developmental programs that ensure adaptability and survival. A central aspect of this dynamic response lies in the modulation of versatile gene regulatory networks, mediated in part by various chromatin regulators. Here, we summarized current understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which chromatin regulators integrate environmental signals, influencing key aspects of plant development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"dc8b690ff5d9a61ef2a6e15798f790f603c0c80bbef674323cc3dd15ed4dc174","category":"Environment"}
