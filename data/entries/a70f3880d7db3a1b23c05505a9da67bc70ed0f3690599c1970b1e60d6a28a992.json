{"title":"Production optimization of food functional factor ergothioneine in wild‐type red yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa DL‐X01","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13287?af=R","date":1712732400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Ergothioneine (EGT) is a high-value food functional factor that cannot be synthesized by humans and other vertebrates, and the low yield limits its application.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this study, the optimal fermentation temperature, fermentation time, initial pH, inoculum age, and inoculation ratio on EGT biosynthesis of <i>Rhodotorula mucilaginosa</i> DL-X01 were optimized. In addition, the effects of three key precursor substances – histidine, methionine, and cysteine – on fungal EGT synthesis were verified. The optimal conditions were further obtained by response surface optimization. The EGT yield of <i>R. mucilaginosa</i> DL-X01 under optimal fermentation conditions reached 64.48 ± 2.30 mg L<sup>−1</sup> at shake flask fermentation level. Finally, the yield was increased to 339.08 ± 3.31 mg L<sup>−1</sup> (intracellular) by fed-batch fermentation in a 5 L bioreactor.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest EGT yield ever reported in non-recombinant strains. The fermentation strategy described in this study will promote the efficient biosynthesis of EGT in red yeast and its sustainable production in the food industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Kexin Xiong, \nHui Guo, \nSiyu Xue, \nMengyang Liu, \nYiwei Dai, \nXinping Lin, \nSufang Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a70f3880d7db3a1b23c05505a9da67bc70ed0f3690599c1970b1e60d6a28a992","category":"Environment"}
