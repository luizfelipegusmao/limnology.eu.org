{"title":"Do Firm&rsquo;s Characteristics Influence Its IT Strategies? A Study of the Driving Force of a Firm&rsquo;s Decision to Appoint IT Expertise","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0441/v1","date":1725523392000,"content":"The demand for information technology expertise has grown rapidly in the last few   decades, signaling a firm’s commitment to integrating IT into its core business strategy. Understanding the conditions under which firms appoint a chief information officer (CIO) can provide valuable insights into the evolving role of IT in corporate governance. This study addresses a crucial gap in the literature by exploring the determinants of a firm's decision to hire a CIO at the top management level. The study identifies several factors that influence a firm’s decision to appoint a CIO, including the firm's size, its level of innovation, and its prior performance. The study examines these assertions by comparing the characteristics of firms that appoint a CIO at the top management level with those of similar firms in their industries that do not have a CIO position prior to the appointment. A logistic regression model that considers CIO firms and their matched firms indicates that firms are more likely to hire a new CIO after they experience loss, have larger capital expenditures and higher market value. Our study provides empirical evidence on why certain firms prioritize IT leadership at the executive level.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a0e58f19a543f205a928ef880ed94f8875c2d2098c060124ef3f3d88b72a8e5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
