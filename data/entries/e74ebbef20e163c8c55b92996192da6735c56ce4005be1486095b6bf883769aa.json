{"title":"Discharge teaching quality positively predicts quality of life in colorectal cancer patients with temporary enterostomy: The mediating role of readiness for hospital discharge and stoma self-efficacy","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306981","date":1720706400000,"content":"<p>by Liying Lin, Yifang Fang, Feifei Huang, Xiaoying Zhang, Jianwei Zheng, Huimin Xiao</p>\r\nObjectives <p>This study aimed to examine the mediating role of readiness for hospital discharge (RHD) and stoma self-efficacy (SSE) in the relationship between quality of discharge teaching (QDT) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in colorectal cancer patients with temporary enterostomy, and the gender difference of mediating effect.</p> Background <p>It is not clear how RHD, QDT, SSE and HRQOL interact in colorectal cancer patients with temporary enterostomy.</p> Methods <p>This was a prospective follow-up survey. 221 colorectal cancer patients with temporary enterostomy were conveniently recruited from a general hospital in Southeast China. The Quality of Discharge Teaching Scale, Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale, Stoma Self-Efficacy Scale, and Stoma Quality of Life Scale were used to collect data. Pearsonâ€™s correlation and structural equation models were used to analyze the data. SPSS 26.0 and Amos 28.0 software were used for analysis the collected data.</p> Results <p>Regarding the relationship of QDT and HRQOL, only QDT-T had a direct effect among colorectal cancer patients with stomas (b = 0.233, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001, percentile 95% CI = [0.145, 0.314]). However, both QDT-T and QDT-R can predict HRQOL indirectly through three paths: (1) the mediating role of SSE (b = 0.050, <i>P</i> = 0.009, percentile 95% CI = [0.013, 0.098]; b = 0.077, <i>P</i> = 0.008, percentile 95% CI = [0.021, 0.164]), (2) the mediating role of RHD (b = 0.044, <i>P</i> = 0.004, percentile 95% CI = [0.014, 0.085]; b = 0.044, <i>P</i> = 0.005, percentile 95% CI = [0.010, 0.102]), and (3) the chain mediating role of SSE and RHD (b = 0.030, <i>P</i> = 0.003, percentile 95% CI = [0.011, 0.059]; b = 0.047, <i>P</i> = 0.003, percentile 95% CI = [0.015, 0.103]). The similar chain mediating effect in male stoma patients was also found (b = 0.041, <i>P</i> = 0.002, percentile 95% CI = [0.016, 0.080]; b = 0.046, <i>P</i> = 0.004, percentile 95% CI = [0.011, 0.114]).</p> Conclusions <p>Stoma self-efficacy and readiness for hospital discharge played important intermediary roles in the relationship between quality of discharge teaching and health-related quality of life in colorectal cancer patients with stomas. Health care providers can design SSE-enhancing and RHD-enhancing discharge planning for colorectal cancer patients with temporary enterostomies.</p>","author":"Liying Lin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e74ebbef20e163c8c55b92996192da6735c56ce4005be1486095b6bf883769aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
