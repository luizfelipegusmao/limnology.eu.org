{"title":"Fungi as indicators of indoor Air Quality: Their Effects on Human Health and treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1835/v1","date":1727169755000,"content":"Indoor air quality (IAQ) is a critical determinant of human health, with fungal contamination posing significant risks. In 2023, a total of 160 samples were collected from 40 selected rooms. These samples were cultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) medium using a portable air sampler and incubated at 28Â°C for 7 days. Initial identification of fungal isolates was performed based on their morphology. Suspected isolates underwent further analysis using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA analysis. The results revealed 11 species across 8 genera in various rooms. The most prevalent fungi were Aspergillus niger (183 CFU) , Penicillium chrysogenum (139 CFU) and Cladosporium halotolerans (135 CFU). On the other hand, Curvularia hawaiiensis and A. ustus were rarely isolated (10 and 19 respectively). Effective treatment involves a combination of preventive measures, such as controlling humidity and ensuring proper ventilation, alongside targeted interventions like antifungal treatments and thorough cleaning. Continuous monitoring and management of indoor environments are essential to reduce fungal contamination, enhance air quality, and protect human health from the harmful effects of airborne fungi. This abstract underscore the importance of addressing indoor fungal contamination to promote safer, healthier living and working spaces.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2bea6d269e4eb5643d3300a69823b199aa0a9d5f4b259ab6e2667fe51d02181c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
