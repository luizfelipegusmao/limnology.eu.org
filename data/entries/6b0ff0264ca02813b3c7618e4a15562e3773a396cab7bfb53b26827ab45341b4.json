{"title":"Prediction of Tempering Properties of Low‐Carbon Bainitic Steels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0950/v1","date":1720690590000,"content":"The objective of this study is to develop a predictive model for low-carbon bainitic steel utilising the P and λ parameters. The tempering activation energy of the steel was calculated through statistical methods. Kinetic curves for the hardness equivalents and a nomograph for tempering process parameters were plotted. The error analysis indicates that the predicted values based on the λ and P parameters had errors within 15% and 10%, respectively. The model can be effectively utilised to predict mechanical properties and optimise parameters during the tempering process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b0ff0264ca02813b3c7618e4a15562e3773a396cab7bfb53b26827ab45341b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
