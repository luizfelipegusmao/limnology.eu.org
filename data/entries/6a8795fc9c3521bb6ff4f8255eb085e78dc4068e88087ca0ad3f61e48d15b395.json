{"title":"Utilization of Upholstery Furniture Fibrous Mat Residues as Sustainable Fillers in Plywood Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0026/v1","date":1722513900000,"content":"Upholstery nonwoven fabric is a waste product mainly generated during upholstered furniture production. The polyester composition makes it problematic to recycle and reuse this product. This study examined the manufacturing process of nonwoven fabric-reinforced plywood composites and their selected mechanical and physical properties. Nonwoven fabric was integrated between veneers bound with urea-formaldehyde resin to improve standard layered composites' mechanical and physical properties. Several board variants were produced, differing in the position of the nonwoven layers in the composite structure. The composites were evaluated for modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), and screw withdrawal resistance, among others. The results showed that the addition of nonwoven fabric significantly improved some properties. Variants with strategically placed nonwoven layers showed the highest performance increases. The results underscore the potential of nonwoven fabric as an effective reinforcing material, offering a path to developing high-performance plywood composites suitable for demanding applications. Another, environmental profit is that the nonwoven fabric waste, that was used in tested plywood production, has not been subjected burning nor landfilling, but, by incorporation to plywood structure, have positively contributed to Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) policy. The findings advocate for a circular economy approach, where industrial waste is effectively repurposed, contributing to the development of green materials in the wood-based composite industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a8795fc9c3521bb6ff4f8255eb085e78dc4068e88087ca0ad3f61e48d15b395","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
