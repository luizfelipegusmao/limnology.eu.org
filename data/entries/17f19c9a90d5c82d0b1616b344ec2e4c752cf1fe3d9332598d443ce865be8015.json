{"title":"Biogeochemical‐Argo floats show that chlorophyll increases before carbon in the high‐latitude Southern Ocean spring bloom","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10322?af=R","date":1716819035000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In the Southern Ocean, phytoplankton blooms are an annually recurring prominent feature that play a significant role in ocean CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. Understanding the timing of the phytoplankton bloom is necessary to provide insights into the underlying physiological drivers, for the study of ecosystem dynamics and consequent patterns in downward carbon export. Previous studies have used chlorophyll (chl) and particulate organic carbon, from either satellites or biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) floats, to investigate bloom phenology, but provide inconsistent findings regarding bloom timing. Here, we compare bloom dynamics based on three diagnostics from 7114 BGC-Argo float profiles, south of 60°S. Bloom onset consistently occurs earlier when calculated using chl than when based on phytoplankton carbon or nitrate uptake, and the decoupling increases with latitude. This suggests that phytoplankton synthesize increased chl to acclimate to low-light conditions, before increasing their biomass. These results highlight the importance of considering phytoplankton physiology when choosing proxies for phytoplankton growth.</p>","author":"Clara R. Vives, \nChristina Schallenberg, \nPeter G.
