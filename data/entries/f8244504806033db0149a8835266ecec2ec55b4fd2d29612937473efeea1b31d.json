These technologies have significantly impacted the consumer goods market, including the smart footwear industry. AI and ML are extensively utilized in the design and production of smart and agile footwear. There are various methods for manufacturing smart footwear, which can be categorized based on their applications. These include medical and healthcare smart footwear, assistive footwear for individuals with impairments, footwear designed for navigation in unfamiliar areas, foot-wear for studying foot movements and gait analysis, safety footwear, anti-skid footwear, foot-wear for the elderly, army shoes, and energy-harvesting footwear, among others. These smart shoes enable real-time patient monitoring and provide appropriate suggestions for their care. Additionally, smart footwear can be classified based on the tools and techniques used in their production, as well as the sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices integrated into them. This paper reviews the various tools and techniques used in the creation of smart footwear for dif-ferent applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8244504806033db0149a8835266ecec2ec55b4fd2d29612937473efeea1b31d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
