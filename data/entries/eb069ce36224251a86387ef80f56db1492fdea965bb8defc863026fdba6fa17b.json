{"title":"A Review on Hydrogen Storage and Transportation: Progresses and Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0609/v1","date":1718085948000,"content":"As the global demand for clean and sustainable energy sources intensifies, hydrogen emerges as a promising alternative fuel. The widespread adoption of hydrogen, however, is impeded by the lack of efficient systems for storage and transportation. This review aims to summarize the recent advancements and prevailing challenges within the realm of hydrogen storage and transportation, thereby providing guidance and impetus for future research and practical applications in this domain. Through a systematic selection and analysis of the latest literature, this study highlights the strengths, limitations, and technological progress of various hydrogen storage methods, including compressed gaseous hydrogen, cryogenic liquid hydrogen, organic liquids hydrogen, solid materials hydrogen storage, as well as the feasibility, efficiency, and infrastructure requirements of different transportation modes such as pipelines, road and seaborne transportation. The findings reveal that challenges such as low storage density, high costs, and inadequate infrastructure persist despite progress in high-pressure storage and cryogenic liquefaction. The review also underscores the potential of emerging technologies and innovative concepts, including metal-organic frameworks, nanomaterials, and underground storage, along with the potential synergies with renewable energy integration and hydrogen production facilities. In conclusion, interdisciplinary collaboration, policy support, and ongoing research are essential in harnessing hydrogenâ€™s full potential as a clean energy carrier. This review concludes that research in hydrogen storage and transportation is vital to global energy transformation and climate change mitigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eb069ce36224251a86387ef80f56db1492fdea965bb8defc863026fdba6fa17b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
