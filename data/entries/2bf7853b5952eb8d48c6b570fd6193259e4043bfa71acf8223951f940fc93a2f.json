{"title":"Infusions of Baccharis articulata and Citrus sinensis Decrease Lipid Content in a Human In Vitro Model of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0635/v1","date":1728478045000,"content":"Since the use of antioxidants can potentially reduce the risk of chronic diseases related to oxidative stress, such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), we analyzed the effects of aqueous infusions from natural sources with a high antioxidant capacity on a model of MASLD. We applied a central composite rotatable design to establish the extraction conditions for Citrus sinensis (orange) leaves with maximum antioxidant capacity. These conditions were then applied to Baccharis articulate (carqueja) leaves. This approach resulted in antioxidant capacities of 71.6 ± 2.2 % and 51.5 ± 1.3 % for orange and carqueja leaves, respectively. Only flavonoids were significantly higher in Baccharis articulata (0.44 ± 0.08 mg/mL) than in Citrus sinensis (0.14 ± 0.04 mg/mL), as confirmed by HPLC. We developed an in vitro MASLD model with human hepatic cells, specifically Hep-G2 cells. MASLD cells were treated with both infusions for 48 h. Our results demonstrate that only Baccharis articulata could inhibit lipid accumulation in the MASLD cells (1.11 ± 0.21 AU [infusion-treated MASLD cells] vs. 2.19 ± 0.32 AU [MASLD cells], p &amp;lt; 0.05). We suggest that despite the different components of the infusions, the high concentration of flavonoids could be responsible for such activity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2bf7853b5952eb8d48c6b570fd6193259e4043bfa71acf8223951f940fc93a2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
