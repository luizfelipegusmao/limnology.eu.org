{"title":"The Effect of rs80860411 Polymorphism on Fattening and Slaughter Traits in Pigs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0789/v1","date":1728551721000,"content":"The aim of the study was to analyze the association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs80860411A&gt;C located in the intergenic region of chromosome 13 (near the GALNT15 gene encoding Polypeptide N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferase15, GALNTL2) and fat-tening and slaughter traits of pigs. The study was conducted on 426 individuals belonging to three breeds: Polish Landrace (n = 192), Polish Large White (n = 187) and Pulawska (n = 48). The rs80860411 genotypes were determined using the PCR-RFLP method. Association analysis was performed for each breed separately, as well as for the entire study group. The study showed that rs80860411A&gt;C had a significant effect on fattening performance traits, as well as on several slaughter performance traits, including: width of the loin eye, loin and ham weights without skin and backfat and carcass meat content (P ≤ 0.01, P ≤ 0.05). The obtained results indicate that the studied SNP has the potential to be included in pig selection programs, thus potentially influencing the improvement of fat-tening and slaughter traits of different pig breeds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22967db5708a83dde189f4f3798a4a585f942914caf8ff473a7c8ea275f92d41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
