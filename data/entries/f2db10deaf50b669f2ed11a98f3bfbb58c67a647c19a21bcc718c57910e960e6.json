{"title":"Length‐Weight and Length‐Length Relations of 14 Freshwater Fish Species from the Qiantang River, China","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/4101501?af=R","date":1719307075000,"content":"<p>The Qiantang River, located in Zhejiang Province, China, is a crucial water resource with significant ecological and economic importance. This study aimed to evaluate fishery resources in the Qiantang River Basin by analyzing the length-weight relationships (LWRs) and length-length relationships (LLRs) of 14 fish species. Fish samples were collected between July 2021 and November 2023 using multipanel nylon gillnets and cage nets. Each specimen was measured for total length (TL) and standard length (SL), as well as weighed. Linear regression models were employed to estimate LWRs and LLRs, with statistical tests revealing significant relationships (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and high <i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> values above 0.91. The study contributed new LWRs for two species and LLRs for three, deepening our understanding of their biology. These findings enriched FishBase and offered valuable data for fish stock assessments and management strategies in the Qiantang River Basin. Future research can utilize this foundation to explore population dynamics and promote sustainable management practices.</p>","author":"Yangxin Dai, \nNan Xie, \nYulai Dai, \nWei Guo, \nJinyu Tang, \nYuxi Wang, \nGeorgii Ruban","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"f2db10deaf50b669f2ed11a98f3bfbb58c67a647c19a21bcc718c57910e960e6","category":"Environment"}
