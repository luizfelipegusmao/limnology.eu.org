{"title":"Numerical Modeling for Tunnel Lining Optimization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1329/v1","date":1721142392000,"content":"The construction of tunnels excavated by the conventional method in densely populated urban environments requires an adequate characterization of the loads acting on the primary lining during the excavation process to ensure that the ground is deformed and stresses around the tunnel are relieved, simultaneously complying with the failure and serviceability limits of international standards while minimizing damage to nearby structures. In this paper, common lining design criteria are revisited, through the numerical simulation of an instrumented tunnel section which is part of a 4.5 km long metro line currently under construction in Mexico City. Key needs for improvement in current design approaches are identified. The tunnel was instrumented with load cells, extensometers, and topographical references for convergences and divergences. A three-dimensional finite difference model of the instrumented section was developed, and the load transfer mechanisms between the excavated soil and the primary lining was analyzed. Then, the numerical simulation of the contribution of the secondary lining in the overall stability for sustained load was established, along with the expected ground settlements, which can significantly affect nearby structures. Results gathered from this research are key for updating lining design criteria for urban tunnels built in stiff brittle soils.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4471aa6c445a4054ad0663071f52aee17966ed377f203b9356e84321b7a1a570","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
