This genus includes poliovirus, echoviruses, Coxackieviruses A and B, EVs A and D, as well as human rhinovirus (HRV). These single stranded (+) RNA viruses can cause a broad spectrum of serious illness. Infection with these pathogens is known to elicit the production of cross-reactive antibodies to other species of enteroviruses. The significance of these cross-reactive antibodies to antiviral immunity is not well understood. These antibodies are assumed not to neutralize infection as they are thought to recognize shared epitopes that are only exposed when the conformation of the virion is perturbed [<a href=\"#ozae044.349-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0aa4c98596f0663076ff8d5d44b81b9c5d1a94eced4ac50b203ca2a2acdcf8ab","category":"Environment"}
