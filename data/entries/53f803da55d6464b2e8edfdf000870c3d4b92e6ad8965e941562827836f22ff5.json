{"title":"Novel Ionic Liquid Crystal as Electrolytic Ion Charges Carrier for Energy Storage Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0681/v1","date":1720485906000,"content":"The development of novel ionic liquid crystals for energy storage applications has gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential to develop the field of energy storage. Ionic liquid crystals represent a unique class of materials with high ionic conductivity and thermal stability, making them ideal candidates for use in advanced energy storage devices. This research aims to explore the fundamental properties, structure and liquid crystals performance of these novel materials, with the goal of advancing their practical application in next-generation energy storage technologies. By understanding the structure-function relationship of ionic liquid crystals, researchers can tailor their properties to meet specific energy storage requirements, such as high energy density, fast charging capabilities, and long cycle life. This study seeks to contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the field of energy storage by investigating the potential of novel ionic liquid crystals as efficient and sustainable energy storage solutions. The two ionic liquid crystals show mesomorphic behavior and typical zwitterion characteristics that revealed by the cyclic voltammetry techniques. These materials uploaded with lithium ions for more stability and higher ionic conductivity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53f803da55d6464b2e8edfdf000870c3d4b92e6ad8965e941562827836f22ff5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
