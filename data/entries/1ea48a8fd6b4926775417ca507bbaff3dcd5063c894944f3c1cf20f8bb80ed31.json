{"title":"Evolution, Current Trends and Latest Advances of Endoscopic Spine Surgery: A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1095/v1","date":1713358891000,"content":"The aging of the population in developing and developed countries has lead to a significant increase in health burden of spinal diseases. These elderly patients often have a number of medical co-morbidities due to aging. The need for minimally invasive techniques to address spinal disorders in this elderly population group cannot be stressed enough. Minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) has several proven benefits such as minimal muscle trauma, minimal bony resection, lesser post-operative pain, decreased infection rate and shorter hospital stay. Over the last 40 years, constant efforts are being made to develop newer techniques of spine surgery. Endoscopic spine surgery is one such subset of MISS which has all the benefits of modern MISS. Endoscopic spine surgery initially was limited only to treatment of lumbar disc herniations. With improvement in optics, endoscopes, endoscopic drills and shavers, irrigation pumps, there has been a paradigm shift. Endoscopic spine surgery can now be performed with high magnification thus allowing its application not only to lumbar spinal stenosis, but also to spinal fusion surgeries, cervical and thoracic pathology as well. There has been increasing evidence in support of these newer techniques of spine surgery. For the purpose of this review, we studied current available literature and outlined the historical evolution of endoscopic spine surgery, the various different endoscopic systems, and techniques available and the current applications of endoscopic techniques as an alternative to traditional spinal surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ea48a8fd6b4926775417ca507bbaff3dcd5063c894944f3c1cf20f8bb80ed31","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
