{"title":"Image Processing and Analysis Methods for Assessing Aerosol Jet Printed Traces","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.173/7719546?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Aerosol Jet Printing (AJP) is a manufacturing technique in which a material (e.g., metallic nanoparticle and particle-free inks) is aerosolized, carried and focused through gas flows, and deposited onto a substrate on a temperature-controlled platen. In the case of metal-soluble inks, the printed traces are cured to promote densification and increase conductivity. The chief advantage of AJP over traditional methods such as inkjet printing is flexibility. AJP is compatible with a large combination of inks and substrates, can print over curved or textured surfaces, and is inexpensive to use for prototyping and development at small scale. To facilitate this flexibility of ink and substrate combinations, AJP devices can vary key process parameters over a wide range. Small changes to these parameters can significantly affect characteristics of the resulting traces including quantity of deposition, trace width, edge roughness, overspray, and print discontinuities. Examples of these variations are presented in Fig. 1. Optimal parameters for various ink and substrate combinations can differ significantly, so some amount of investigation is necessary for each new pairing. An image processing and analysis method was developed in MATLAB to determine critical measurements of printed traces more efficiently, including trace width, edge roughness, overspray density, and rectangularity of printed pads. This method will assist in identifying values of process parameters that produce precise and conductive prints.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"eabba0ddba2d65e32ebf555b169416501e620ae175fd11adc565dab545b775e3","category":"Environment"}
