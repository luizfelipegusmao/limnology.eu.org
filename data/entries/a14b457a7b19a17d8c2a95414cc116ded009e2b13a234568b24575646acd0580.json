{"title":"Symbiotic Relationship of Comasterschlegelii (Crinoidea: Comatulidae) and Gymnolophus obscura (Ophiuroidea: Ophiotrichidae) Derived from Stable Isotope and Fatty Acid Analyses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/64/1/67/7442076?rss=1","date":1700611200000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>Coral reef community exhibits high species diversity and a broad range of biological relationships, including widespread symbiosis and complex food utilization patterns. In our study, we investigated the symbiotic relationship between the commonly crinoid host <span>Comaster schlegelii</span> and its ophiuroid obligatory symbiont <span>Gymnolophus obscura</span>. Using a combination of fatty acid biomarkers and stable isotopic compositions, we explored differences in their organic matter utilization strategies and nutritional relationships. The result of stable isotopes revealed that <span>G. obscura</span> had higher δ<sup>15</sup>N values than its crinoid host. Particulate organic matter and phytoplankton were identified as the primary food sources for both species, however <span>C. schlegelii</span> showed a higher proportional contribution from benthic microalgae. Fatty acid markers showed that <span>C. schlegelii</span> was more dependent on benthic microalgae such as diatoms, and less on debritic organic matter and bacteria than <span>G. obscura</span>. Elevated δ<sup>15</sup>N values of <span>G. obscura</span> and similar food source contribution rates between the host and symbiont suggest that ophiuroid feeds on materials filtered by crinoids and have similar diet to the host. Our results provide insights into the symbiotic patterns of crinoids and ophiuroids, while also supplying foundational data on how symbiotic reef species select organic matter utilization strategies to adapt to their environment.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative and Comparative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"715dd1b0fb4f45600bceadb227e9b7fdf8bd9d1d7a2fd3d5e0399d2c1f410646","entryHash":"a14b457a7b19a17d8c2a95414cc116ded009e2b13a234568b24575646acd0580","category":"Environment"}
