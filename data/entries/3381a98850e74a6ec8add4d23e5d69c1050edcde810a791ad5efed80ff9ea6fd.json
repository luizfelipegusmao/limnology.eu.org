However, relatively high production costs associated with the extraction and manufacturing techniques utilized prevent the widespread application of titanium alloys [<a href=\"#ozae044.113-B1\">1</a>]. Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, presents a promising solution, offering potential economic advantages over the conventional casting methods by building the component layer by layer to achieve a near net shape [<a href=\"#ozae044.113-B2\">2</a>]. During AM processes, the titanium alloys undergo unique thermomechanical processes, which can influence the microstructure evolution and formation of defects within the AMed titanium alloys. Recent developments in multi-dimensional characterization techniques, such as X-ray computed tomography, focused ion beam- scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) tomography and atom probe tomography enabled detailed investigation of the three- dimensional (3D) features in the AM-built parts at various length scales. Due to the good site-specific precision and highly efficient automated data collection, FIB-SEM tomography offers the unique opportunity to reveal the complex micro- to nano-scale structure and defects in the AM-built titanium based alloys and composites [<a href=\"#ozae044.113-B3\">3-4</a>]. In this presentation, we will discuss our recent study focusing on the phase transformation and defect analysis in the direct energy deposited (DEDed) Ti-5Al-5Mo-5V-3Cr (wt.%, Ti-5553) alloy using 3D FIB-SEM tomography. Serial sectioning was performed using a ThermoFisher Scientific Scios 2 Dual-beam FIB/SEM, and the image segmentation and 3D reconstruction were conducted using the MIPAR image processing software.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3381a98850e74a6ec8add4d23e5d69c1050edcde810a791ad5efed80ff9ea6fd","category":"Environment"}
