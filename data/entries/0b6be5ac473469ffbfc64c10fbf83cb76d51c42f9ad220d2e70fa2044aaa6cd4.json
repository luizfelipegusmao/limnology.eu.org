{"title":"Phosphorylation of sugar transporter TST2 by protein kinase CPK27 enhances drought tolerance in tomato","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1005/7618155?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Drought is a major environmental stress threatening plant growth and productivity. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are plant-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors with multifaceted roles in signaling drought responses. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underpinning how CPKs transmit downstream drought signaling remain unresolved. Through genetic investigations, our study unveiled that knocking out <span>CPK27</span> reduced drought tolerance in tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>) plants and impaired abscisic acid (ABA)-orchestrated plant response to drought stress. Proteomics and phosphoproteomics revealed that CPK27-dependent drought-induced proteins were highly associated with the sugar metabolism pathway, which was further verified by reduced soluble sugar content in the <span>cpk27</span> mutant under drought conditions. Using proteinâ€“protein interaction assays and phosphorylation assessments, we demonstrated that CPK27 directly interacted with and phosphorylated tonoplast sugar transporter 2 (TST2), promoting intercellular soluble sugar accumulation during drought stress. Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ABA enhanced CPK27-mediated interaction and phosphorylation of TST2, thus revealing a role of TST2 in tomato plant drought tolerance. These findings extend the toolbox of potential interventions for enhancing plant drought stress tolerance and provide a target to improve drought tolerance by manipulating CPK27-mediated soluble sugar accumulation for rendering drought tolerance in a changing climate.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"0b6be5ac473469ffbfc64c10fbf83cb76d51c42f9ad220d2e70fa2044aaa6cd4","category":"Environment"}
