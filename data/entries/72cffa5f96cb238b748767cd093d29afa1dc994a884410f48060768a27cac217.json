Deceasing sample damage for a given dose, thus increasing effective real signal to noise, is important to characterize many important technological and biological materials, such as polymers, pharmaceuticals, proteins, and perovskites, which have particularly low critical electron dose thresholds. Conventionally such fast and repetitive exposures in an electron microscope are obtained using either pulsed laser stimulated electron emission, or perhaps a fast electrostatic deflector or shutter. However, here we explore an alternative scheme using a conventional electromagnetic beam deflection in a STEM / TEM combined with using the synchronous fast (&lt; 1 μs) multi-trigger exposure mode of the Merlin detector [<a href=\"#ozae044.512-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"72cffa5f96cb238b748767cd093d29afa1dc994a884410f48060768a27cac217","category":"Environment"}
