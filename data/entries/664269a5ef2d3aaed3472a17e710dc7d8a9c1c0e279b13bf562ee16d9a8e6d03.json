The aim of this research was to evaluate the relationship between nutritional status and quality of life perception of mothers caring for children with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. This research was conducted from July to September 2022, with mothers of children aged 5 to 10 years with diabetes. Data were collected through an online questionnaire including soci-oeconomic information, anthropometric data, clinical data of the children, and the WHO-QOL-abbreviated quality of life questionnaire. For statistical analysis, Statistical Package for Social Science 24 was used. Fifty-five mothers of children with diabetes were evaluated. Over 33% of the mothers were overweight and reported a regular perception of quality of life. Higher BMI was associated with poorer perception of quality of life in the psychological and self-assessment domains, and longer diagnosis time was associated with better perception of quality of life in the physical, psychological, and environmental domains. Therefore, it is understood that actions aimed at improving the quality of life of these mothers are necessary.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"664269a5ef2d3aaed3472a17e710dc7d8a9c1c0e279b13bf562ee16d9a8e6d03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
