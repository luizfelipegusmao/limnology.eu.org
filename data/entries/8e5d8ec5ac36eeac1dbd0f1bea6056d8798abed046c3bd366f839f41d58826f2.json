{"title":"Effect of a Single Dose of Deflazacort on Postoperative Pain, Swelling and Trismus after Impacted Lower Third Molar Surgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1879/v1","date":1716958035000,"content":"Background and Objectives: The complications seen after lower impacted third molar surgery affect the quality of life of the patients. The aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of a single preoperative dose of deflazacort on pain, swelling and trismus following impacted lower third molar surgery. Materials and Methods: This randomised, prospective, double-blind, split-mouth clinical study included 30 healthy individuals with bilaterally impacted lower third molars that was removed for orthodontic purposes between September 2017 and September 2018. Group 1 was given a placebo (single dose vitamin C tablet) and group 2 was given a single 30 mg dose of deflazacort 1 hour prior to the surgery. Pain was evaluated using the visual analog scale for 1 week postoperatively. Edema (in mm) and trismus (in mm) were evaluated preoperatively and on postoperative days 2 and 7. The Mann-Whitney U test was applied for group analysis. p values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: When postoperative pain scores were evaluated, a significant difference was found between the groups only at the 6th and 12th hours (p0.05). Even high trismus values were recorded on the 2nd day, it was observed that the trismus resolved on the 7th day. There were no significant differences in trismus between the groups at any time point (p&gt;0.05). Evaluation of swelling showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the study and control groups at any time point (p&gt;0.05). No side effect was detected in both the study and the control groups. Conclusions: This was the first split-mouth study evaluating the anti-inflammatory effect of deflazacort after lower impacted third molar surgery. A single dose of 30 mg deflazacort was shown to be effective in reducing pain at 6 and 12 hours postoperatively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e5d8ec5ac36eeac1dbd0f1bea6056d8798abed046c3bd366f839f41d58826f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
