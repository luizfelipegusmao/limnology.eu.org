{"title":"Reallocation of the magnificent catshark Proscyllium magnificum Last & Vongpanich, 2004 to the genus Ctenacis Compagno, 1973 (Carcharhiniformes: Proscylliidae)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15969?af=R","date":1729749853000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The magnificent catshark <i>Proscyllium magnificum</i> was described in 2004 based off five specimens collected in the Andaman Sea off Myanmar. It was originally allocated to the genus <i>Proscyllium,</i> but recent molecular analyses suggested it was more closely related to the harlequin catshark <i>Ctenacis fehlmanni</i> from the western Indian Ocean. This study incorporated meristics and external and internal morphology, together with molecular data to reclassify the magnificent catshark as <i>Ctenacis magnificum</i> and provides revised diagnoses for the genera <i>Ctenacis</i> and <i>Proscyllium</i>. <i>Ctenacis</i> consists of two allopatric Indian Ocean species, while <i>Proscyllium</i> is monotypic genus confined to the northwest Pacific. The revised <i>Ctenacis</i> can be distinguished from <i>Proscyllium</i> in having a broader and longer head (head length 21%–23% vs. 16%–18% of total length), distance between pectoral and pelvic bases shorter than head length (vs. greater than head length), more teeth (upper jaw with 80–86 vs. 46–62 tooth files), and a complex colour pattern of dark reddish-brown blotches and saddles (vs. colour pattern of small black spots). A revised key to the genera of proscylliids and species of <i>Ctenacis</i> is provided.</p>","author":"William T. White, \nHelen L. O'Neill, \nLei Yang, \nGavin J. P.
