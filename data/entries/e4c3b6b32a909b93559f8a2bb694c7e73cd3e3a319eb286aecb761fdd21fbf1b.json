{"title":"Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Urban Heat Island (UHI) Intensity in Mbombela City, Mpumalanga Province from 2008 to 2023","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0348/v1","date":1728046393000,"content":"Urban Heat Islands (UHI) are a growing concern in rapidly urbanizing regions, leading \nto significant ecological and public health challenges. This study investigates the spatiotemporal dynamics of UHI intensity in Mbombela City, Mpumalanga Province, South \nAfrica, from 2008 to 2023. Using Landsat satellite imagery and geospatial analysis \ntechniques, the research quantifies changes in land cover and their impact on Land \nSurface Temperature (LST) and UHI intensity. The results show that built-up areas \nincreased by 86.67% over the study period, while vegetation cover decreased by \n22.22%. Mean LST rose from 28.3°C in 2008 to 30.1°C in 2023, indicating a significant \nintensification of the UHI effect. Statistical analyses reveal strong correlations between \nurbanization metrics and UHI intensity, highlighting the role of human activities in \nexacerbating this phenomenon. This research contributes valuable insights for urban \nplanning and climate adaptation strategies, particularly in secondary cities like \nMbombela, where rapid development is creating new environmental challenges. The \nfindings underscore the need for green infrastructure and nature-based solutions to \nmitigate the negative impacts of urbanization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4c3b6b32a909b93559f8a2bb694c7e73cd3e3a319eb286aecb761fdd21fbf1b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
