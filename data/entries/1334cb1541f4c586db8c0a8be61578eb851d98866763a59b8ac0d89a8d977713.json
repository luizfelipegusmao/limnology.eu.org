{"title":"Deep Venous Thrombosis as an Initial Manifestation of Rectal Adenocarcinoma Metastasis to Skeletal Muscle: Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1501/v2","date":1722240976000,"content":"Colorectal cancer is third most common malignancy. For metastasis of rectal cancer, metastasis to skeletal muscle tissue is rare. In this case report, we describe a 51-year-old male patient with rectal cancer with neoadjuvant concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by transanal total mesorectal excision with ileostomy. However, he had deep venous thrombosis of left leg after operation and skeletal muscle metastasis was diagnosed via tissue proof. Therefore, less possibility of metastasis increased included brain, duodenum, bone, and nervous system. The prognosis of metastasis to skeletal muscle is poor in contrast to liver or lung metastasis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1334cb1541f4c586db8c0a8be61578eb851d98866763a59b8ac0d89a8d977713","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
