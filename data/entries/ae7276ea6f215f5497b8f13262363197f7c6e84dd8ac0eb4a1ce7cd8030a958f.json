{"title":"Evaluating the Efficacy, Durability, and Clinical Implications of Zirconia vs. Titanium Dental Implants: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0331/v1","date":1722940043000,"content":"Achieving the best aesthetic result is a key objective of implant-prosthetic therapy. To maximize the aesthetic outcome, ensuring that implant-supported restorations are in harmony with the peri-implant soft tissues and bone is essential. A comparative analysis of zirconia and titanium dental implants revealed that both materials offer high success rates; however, they present distinct advantages and limitations in clinical practice. Titanium implants, with surface modifications but without chemical composition changes, boast remarkable long-term survival. In contrast, zirconia implants, while presenting high aesthetic and biocompatibility qualities, have a relatively high incidence of material-specific failure, ranging from 4% to 2% after 5-10 years. While titanium implants generally show superior long-term performance, zirconia implants benefit from ongoing advancements aimed at improving their osseointegration and longevity. This study emphasizes the need for short-term and long-term studies, complemented by randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are essential for optimizing implant materials and ensuring patient satisfaction. Continued innovation and research are crucial for advancing dental implant technology and enhancing the quality of life for patients requiring dental restorations. Finally, it is important to understand that all materials have both advantages and disadvantages, so the choice of the optimal material should be based on the specific purpose.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ae7276ea6f215f5497b8f13262363197f7c6e84dd8ac0eb4a1ce7cd8030a958f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
