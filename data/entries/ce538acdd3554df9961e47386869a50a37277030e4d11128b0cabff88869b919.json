This protocol describes a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the prevalence and risk factors of early postoperative seizures in patients with glioma.</p> Methods and analysis <p>Searches will be conducted on CNKI, WanFang, VIP, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases and Web of Science for the period from database inception to December 31st, 2023. Case-control and cohort studies of the incidence and risk factors for early postoperative seizures in all gliomas will be included. The primary outcome will be incidence, risk factors. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for quality evaluation. Review of article screening, extracting data and risk of bias assessment will be repeated by two independent reviewers.</p> Result <p>This study will provide evidence for the risk factors and incidence of early postoperative seizures in patients with glioma.</p> Conclusion <p>Our study will provide evidence for the prevention of early postoperative seizures in glioma patients.</p> Trail registration <p>This protocol was registered in PROSPERO and registration number is CRD42023415658.</p>","author":"Bo Sun","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ce538acdd3554df9961e47386869a50a37277030e4d11128b0cabff88869b919","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
