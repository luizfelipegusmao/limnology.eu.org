{"title":"Effects of Floorball and Strength Training in a Real-Life Setting on Health and Physical Function in Older Men","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0203/v1","date":1727936013000,"content":"There is lacking information about the physiological response when conducting training of older men in a real-life setting. Seventy-six sedentary men aged 72.3 ± 0.6 (means ± SE; range: 63–92) years with a height, body mass and body mass index of 178.9 ± 0.8 cm; 92.1 ± 2.2 kg: 28.7 ± 0.6 kg/m2, respectively, were recruited to floorball (FG, n = 29), strength (SG, n = 38) or bowls (BG, n = 9) training 1 h twice a week in municipal activity centers and senior sport clubs. Subjects were tested at baseline, after 12 and 24 weeks. Twelve weeks of floorball and strength training lead to reduced blood Hb1Ac, body mass, fat mass, visceral and android fat. Further, SG had a decrease in gynoid fat and blood total and LDL cholesterol. Both groups decreased heart rate at rest. In SG, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also reduced. FG increased markers for bone growth. FG and SG improved functional capacity. The improvements in FG and SG were maintained after 24 weeks. BG did not have any changes. In conclusion, older men conducting floorball or strength training twice a week in a real-life setting can improve functional capacity and a high number of health factors, whereas playing bowls does not lead to physiological changes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5652c5027701245478da81a29e493c5bb1e26116a03f8defba54de6a9b1d0b23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
