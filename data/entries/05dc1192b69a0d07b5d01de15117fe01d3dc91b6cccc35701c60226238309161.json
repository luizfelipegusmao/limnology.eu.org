{"title":"Relationships between Six Cultural Scales and Ten Ageism Dimensions: Correlation Analysis Using Data from 31 Countries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0705/v1","date":1723471566000,"content":"As the aging of the world accelerates, clarifying the relationship between cultural differences and ageism is an urgent issue. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a correlation analysis between the six cultural scales of Hofstede et al. [1] and the 10 ageism scales calculated from data on 35,232 people from 31 countries included in the World Values Survey Wave 6 by Inglehart et al. [2]. The results of a partial correlation analysis controlling for economic and demographic factors showed that the cultural scales were correlated with ageism. This is the first study to show that diverse cultural scales are related to multiple dimensions of ageism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05dc1192b69a0d07b5d01de15117fe01d3dc91b6cccc35701c60226238309161","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
