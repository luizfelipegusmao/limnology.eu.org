{"title":"Negotiation of Calcified Canals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1226/v1","date":1710982902000,"content":"Hard tissue apposition along the root canal walls is a slow, normally occurring physiological aging process. In response to tooth wear, local deposition of hard tissue may also occur in the pulp at a slow pace.  Sometimes, the rate of hard tissue deposition acceleration may seem to be uncontrolled after dental trauma, autotransplantation, and orthodontic therapy, leading to rapid partial or total obliteration of the root canal space. This situation is called calcific metamorphosis (CM) or pulp canal obliteration (PCO). Although the incidence of pulpal necrosis in these teeth is believed to be infrequent, conventional endodontic therapy in severely calcified canals poses extreme difficulties and a higher risk for procedural accidents. This article aims to review the available approaches for the predictable negotiation of calcified canals and to introduce the buckling resistance activation test (BRAT) technique.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d7ac0434312e11d42d6b70d4d6cf4994b1ec052e60dafdfaa17c2ba10a2c186","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
