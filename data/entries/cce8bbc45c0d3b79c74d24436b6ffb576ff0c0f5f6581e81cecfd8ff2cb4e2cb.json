{"title":"Carbon Dots and Their Films with Narrow Full Width At Half Maximum Orange Emission","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1665/v1","date":1727074600000,"content":"To obtain carbon dots (CDs) with narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) and long-wavelength emission, carbon sources with high conjugate sizes and abundant functional groups can be employed to synthesis CDs. In this study, orange-emissive carbon dots (OCDs) were synthesized with phloroglucinol and rhodamine B as precursors. When the molar ratio of them was 30:1 and ethanol was served as solvent, OCDs with optimized emission wavelength at approximately 580 nm, an FWHM of 30 nm and a quantum yield (QY) of 27.31% were obtained. Subsequently, the OCDs were incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to fabricate solid-state OCDs/PVA fluorescent films, which exhibited an FWHM of 47 nm. The PVA matrix facilitated the dispersion of OCDs, thereby suppressing non-radiative energy transfer among the OCDs and enhancing luminescence efficiency. Consequently, compared with OCDs, the OCDs/PVA film exhibited significant luminescent enhancement, and the QY of the composite film was increased to 84.74%. Moreover, OCDs/PVA film show good transmittance and thermal stability. This research offers a solid theoretical and experimental foundation for the potential applications of CDs in the fields of solid-state lighting.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cce8bbc45c0d3b79c74d24436b6ffb576ff0c0f5f6581e81cecfd8ff2cb4e2cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
