{"title":"The Culture of Ecological Security Policy; Research of Polish Regional Cities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2135/v1","date":1724918783000,"content":"I examine national environmental security policy cultures to assess the opportunities for increasing global environmental security. The question is whether the difficulties in modeling the state's ecological security are a consequence of limitations in the coherence of the four dogmas: ecological security, sustainable development, social responsibility and environmental management. The presented fragments of theoretical research explain the question by presenting the logic of the constructive value of the national culture of ecological safety policy. I conducted empirical research based on 18 development strategies of regional cities in Poland. The multi-criteria method made it possible to identify and describe a micro-community reflecting the macroscopic observation of regional cities as an emerging whole of the stateâ€™s development. Assumption: ownership of the environmental aspects of cities is a natural quantity influencing the ecological security of the state in the contemporary global civilization system. I have formulated new definitions: ecological security of the state, culture of ecological security policy, sustainable development and socially responsible and sustainable development of the city. I have developed 13 catalogues of elements of the structure of the development strategy of regional cities in Poland, containing 1 390 public services. I have shown when there is a lack of culture of the state's ecological security policy in the global ecological security system according to the cause-effect principle. I have been conducting research since 2019.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd942f962876a42a3c5c05764582c09b419256d40b52ea02a1ca243bf0ac41e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
