{"title":"Depicting of DNA Makeup of Spring Bread Wheat Genotypes Using SSR Markers and Their Association with Heat Tolerance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0824/v1","date":1726043986000,"content":"Wheat is threatened by global warming. This study aimed to characterize based on DNA profile and identify heat-tolerant wheat genotypes. Fifteen wheat genotypes were sown in Nov 21 and Dec 21 and evaluated within 13 SSR markers. A dendrogram classified the genotypes into two main groups. The highest genetic distances (0.93) were drawn between BAW 1290 and BARI Gom 28, and the lowest one between Nadi 2 and BAW 1147. Heat susceptibility index (HSI) values for 1000-grain weight (TGW) and grain yield indicated moderate heat tolerance in Cluster I genotypes (HSI 0.50-1.00), closely matching Group A's Cluster II members. In Group B, Cluster III genotypes had higher HSI (1.04-1.23) and significant reductions in TGW and grain yield under heat stress, indicating heat susceptibility. The varieties BARI Gom 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30 were identified as heat-stress tolerant. This research provides insights for future heat stress-molecular breeding programs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"532a07f4b4a550b1902677ebeb76cd85653b88fc3821ef9453a8943a92e798c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
