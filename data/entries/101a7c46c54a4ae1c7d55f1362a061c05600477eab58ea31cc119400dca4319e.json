{"title":"Exploring the Dynamic Relationships between Agricultural Production and Environmental Pollution: Evidence from a GMM-SYS Model in the Three Seas Initiative (3SI)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1353/v1","date":1711095671000,"content":"Three Seas Initiative (3SI) is still an underresearched area and is particularly important due to historical circumstances and economic backwardness. A study was carried out to assess the impact of renewable energy and production generated by the agricultural sector on CO2 emissions in 3SI countries between 2008 and 2020. The study used panel data analysis based on the two-step system generalised method of moments (GMM) and the Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test. The results show that a 1% increase in the value-added generated by agriculture increases CO2 emissions in the countries studied by 0.11%. In contrast, a 1% increase in GDP leads to a 0.29% increase in CO2 emissions. Conversely, when renewable energy consumption increases by 1%, CO2 emissions fall by 0.25% in the countries studied. One way to reduce CO2 emissions from agricultural production in the short term is to increase the share of renewables, which, incidentally, is in line with EU action.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"101a7c46c54a4ae1c7d55f1362a061c05600477eab58ea31cc119400dca4319e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
