{"title":"Diallyl disulfide antagonizes DJ‐1 mediated proliferation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and chemoresistance in gastric cancer cells","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24300?af=R","date":1713609845000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Diallyl disulfide (DADS), an organic component of allicin abstracted from garlic, possesses multi-target antitumor activity. DJ-1 performs a vital function in promoting AKT aberrant activation via down-regulating phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) in tumors. It is unknown the involvement of DJ-1 in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of gastric cancer (GC) cells. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether diallyl disulfide (DADS) intervenes in the role of DJ-1 in GC. Based on the identification that the correlation between high DJ-1 and low PTEN expression in GC was implicated in clinical progression, we illuminated that down-regulation of DJ-1 by DADS aided in an increase in PTEN expression and a decrease in phosphorylated AKT levels, which was in line with the results manifested in the DJ-1 knockdown and overexpressed cells, concurrently inhibiting proliferation, EMT, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, the antagonistic effects of DADS on DJ-1 were observed in in vivo experiments. Additionally, DADS mitigated the DJ-1-associated drug resistance. The current study revealed that DJ-1 is one of potential targets for DADS, which hopefully provides a promising strategy for prevention and adjuvant chemotherapy of GC.</p>","author":"Jian Su, \nHong Xia, \nHui He, \nHuan Tang, \nJuan Zhou, \nYi Xun, \nFang Liu, \nBo Su, \nQi Su","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"6cd716402d5d1ed746e9faa3c3ce38b86e5dd54425b0c316e6de797ca0113060","category":"Environment"}
