The solid phase characterization of samples of environmental concern such as contaminated soils, airborne particles, and tailings from mining industries for example, are crucial to investigate pollutants partition and indicate adequate remediation strategies. The characterization of these materials can be challenging due to their very nature. They often times occur as very fine particles of many different aggregated phases, and their separation by chemical or physical methods is difficult and not rarely impossible. Chemical analysis, X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and other spectrometry tools, as well as scanning electron microscopy, have been employed to investigate these specimens. To overcome the spatial resolution limit of these characterization techniques, (scanning) transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with electron diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) techniques have been successfully applied to investigate several specimens of environmental concern [<a href=\"#ozae044.150-B1\">1-8</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3ec3702bff45146350e0ebaa4345bc0bd12ad54087cad61d4fef3177f7d1e201","category":"Environment"}
