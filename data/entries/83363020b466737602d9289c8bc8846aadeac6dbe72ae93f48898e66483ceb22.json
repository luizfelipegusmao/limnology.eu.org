{"title":"Symmetry in Formal Calculation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0503/v1","date":1723045784000,"content":"Formal Calculation uses an auxiliary form to calculate various nested sums and provides results in three forms. It is also a powerful tool for analysis.  This article studies the symmetry of the coefficients in Formal Calculation. Three types of extended numbers were introduced, and many formulas for symmetric functions were obtained.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"83363020b466737602d9289c8bc8846aadeac6dbe72ae93f48898e66483ceb22","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
