{"title":"A strategic roadmap for carbohydrate utilization in crustaceans feed","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/raq.12861?af=R","date":1710918000000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Carbohydrates serve as essential macronutrients in aquaculture feeds, providing cost-efficiency and numerous advantages, including energy supply, pellet stability, reduced ammonia excretion, and support for exoskeleton synthesis in crustaceans. Despite their significance, research on carbohydrate nutrition in crustaceans has been relatively limited compared to finfish. This comprehensive review addresses this knowledge gap by presenting contemporary insights into carbohydrate utilization in commercially important crustacean species, encompassing shrimps, prawns, crabs, lobsters, and crayfishes. The review underscores the pivotal role of carbohydrates, identifies limiting factors, and outlines strategies for enhancing efficiency. Wheat and sorghum/milo emerge as particularly promising carbohydrate sources. Nevertheless, determining species-specific carbohydrate inclusion levels remains essential for further investigation. This review also emphasizes species-specific distinctions in carbohydrate utilization during starvation, influenced by factors such as age, moulting stage, and digestive capacity. Challenging the misconception that carbohydrates are superfluous for crustaceans is imperative. Additional research to advance comprehension of their utilization mechanisms is vital. Enhanced knowledge of carbohydrate utilization can pave the way for economically sustainable and environmentally friendly feeds in crustacean aquaculture. Furthermore, exploring exogenous enzyme potential, optimizing pre-treatment methodologies, and harnessing probiotics can further augment carbohydrate utilization. These advancements hold promise for bolstering the growth and sustainability of the crustacean industry, meeting the surging demand for seafood production while minimizing environmental impact.</p>","author":"Krishna P.
