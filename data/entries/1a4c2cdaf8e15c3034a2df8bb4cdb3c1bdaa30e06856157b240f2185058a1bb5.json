{"title":"New Design Options for Container Barges with Improved Navigability on the Danube","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1878/v1","date":1711949209000,"content":"One of the measures required by the European Green Deal to decarbonise the freight transport sector is the promotion of inland waterway transport (IWT), in particular intermodal transport in Europe. To facilitate intermodal transport on the Danube, we developed six new barge designs for the transport of 45' pallet-wide high-cube containers using a four-step approach. Our approach consisted of detailed desk research, followed by design and further analysis of the identified barge types, taking into account, for example, sight lines or stability. The container carrying capacity reaches up to 90 containers in three layers, which is double the capacity of existing standard barges on the Danube. Nevertheless, three-layer transport is hardly feasible in several cases, due to restrictions regarding sight lines and stability. We conclude that each loading condition must be evaluated separately to determine the best barge design option for each case. The study is limited by its geographical scope and the type of container used to develop the new barge designs. This could be a possible direction for further research on this topic: using other container types and/or extending the geographical scope.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a4c2cdaf8e15c3034a2df8bb4cdb3c1bdaa30e06856157b240f2185058a1bb5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
