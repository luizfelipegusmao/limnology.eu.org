{"title":"Identification of reproductive sex‐biased gene expression in Asparagopsis taxiformis (lineage 6) gametophytes","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13419?af=R","date":1703848506000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The sub-tropical red seaweed <i>Asparagopsis taxiformis</i> is of significant interest due to its ability to store halogenated compounds, including bromoform, which can mitigate methane production in ruminants. Significant scale-up of aquaculture production of this seaweed is required; however, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control fundamental physiological processes, including the regulatory factors that determine sexual dimorphism in gametophytes. In this study, we used comparative RNA-sequencing analysis between different morphological parts of mature male and female <i>A. taxiformis</i> (lineage 6) gametophytes that resulted in greater number of sex-biased gene expression in tips (containing the reproductive structures for both sexes), compared with the somatic main axis and rhizomes. Further comparative RNA-seq against immature tips was used to identify 62 reproductive sex-biased genes (59 male-biased, 3 female-biased). Of the reproductive male-biased genes, 46% had an unknown function, while others were predicted to be regulatory factors and enzymes involved in signaling. We found that bromoform content obtained from female samples (8.5 ± 1.0 mg·g<sup>−1</sup> dry weight) was ~10% higher on average than that of male samples (6.5 ± 1.0 mg·g<sup>−1</sup> dry weight), although no significant difference was observed (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). There was also no significant difference in the marine bromoform biosynthesis locus gene expression. In summary, our comparative RNA-sequencing analysis provides a first insight into the potential molecular factors relevant to gametogenesis and sexual differentiation in <i>A. taxiformis</i>, with potential benefits for identification of sex-specific markers.</p>","author":"Zubaida Parveen Patwary, \nMin Zhao, \nNicholas A.
