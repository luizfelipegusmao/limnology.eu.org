{"title":"One more role for the brassinosteroid regulators: BZR1 and BES1 inhibit stomatal development in Arabidopsis cotyledons","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1106/7611680?rss=1","date":1708387200000,"content":"<span>Stomatal density affects growth by regulating gaseous exchange and affects defense by controlling pathogen entry. The development of guard cells is initiated from the differentiation of meristemoid mother cells to become guard mother cells (GMCs), which further divide to form a pair of guard cells surrounding the stoma. The cell differentiation and division processes are regulated by various hormones, including brassinosteroid (BR). BR promotes guard cell formation in the hypocotyl but represses it in cotyledons (<a href=\"#kiae092-B7\">Wei et al. 2021</a>). The tissue-specific effects suggest the delicate signaling regulation, which has remained unclear. In this issue of <span>Plant Physiology</span>, Li et al. report the role of BR in stomatal development in cotyledons in the dark (<a href=\"#kiae092-B4\">Li et al. 2024</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"749a1eef890459c73e67a9572b8fab2f8af65503e4f3b6c64be4e47f844756e5","category":"Environment"}
