{"title":"In Situ AFM-SEM-EDS, a Correlative Microscopy Platform for Surface Characterization and Elemental Analysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.234/7719808?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Here, we present a highly integrated correlative microscopy platform (see Fig. 1) which incorporates complementary techniques such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS/EDX). In combination with a unified coordinate system, each of these techniques reveals different properties/characteristics of the sample from the same region of interest easily, in contrast to the challenges of <span>ex-situ</span> correlative techniques [<a href=\"#ozae044.234-B1\">1</a>]. This would be very advantageous in fields seeking correlative information, such as the life sciences [<a href=\"#ozae044.234-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.234-B3\">3</a>], semiconductor industry [<a href=\"#ozae044.234-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.234-B5\">5</a>], earth sciences [<a href=\"#ozae044.234-B6\">6</a>], and pharmaceutical industry [<a href=\"#ozae044.234-B7\">7</a>]. And until now, to our knowledge, no single platform has offered a turnkey <span>in-situ</span> correlative solution of AFM-SEM-EDS with a unified coordinate system for a seamless correlation experience.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b8e340a90ac1453e2d086209b5db687b90172d804b3d022ea6b85082beebc4e2","category":"Environment"}
