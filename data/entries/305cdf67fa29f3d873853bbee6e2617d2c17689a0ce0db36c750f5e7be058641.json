The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of non-communicable chronic diseases among academics at Mutah University in Jordan, while also taking into account the global trend of non-communicable diseases impacting different demographics. In a cross-sectional study, the majority of faculty members completed a questionnaire that included demographic information and prevalence of chronic diseases. The most prevalent conditions detected were hypertension (19.6%), diabetes mellitus (17.5%), rheumatoid arthritis (14.2%), heart disease (12.6%), and respiratory disorders (11.3%). Specifically, smoking and being overweight are underlined as significant risk factors, particularly among male respondents. These findings highlight the need of implementing health promotion programs in educational academic institutions, with an emphasis on fostering healthy dietary habits and encouraging physical activity.","author":"Abdullah M.
