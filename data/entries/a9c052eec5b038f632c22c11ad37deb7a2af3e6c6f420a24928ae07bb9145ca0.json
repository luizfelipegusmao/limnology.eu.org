The HKUST-1 was considered a significant improvement over traditional adsorbents. Several factors affecting dye removal, including adsorbent dose, contact time, initial MB concentration, and acidic function, were studied. The findings show that using 0.2 g HKUST-1 for model wastewater with 20 ppm MB and 7.5 PH exhibited the highest dye removal efficiency (96%) after a 2 h contact time. The isotherm adsorption data fit into the Freundlich isotherm best and followed “a pseudo-second-order.”</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"a9c052eec5b038f632c22c11ad37deb7a2af3e6c6f420a24928ae07bb9145ca0","category":"Environment"}
