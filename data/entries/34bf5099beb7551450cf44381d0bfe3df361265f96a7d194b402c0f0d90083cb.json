{"title":"Combined Theoretical Signal (CTS): A Potential Universal Theory Model Integrating Gravity and Quantum Physics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1233/v2","date":1716425749000,"content":"In this research, we present the Combined Theoretical Signal (CTS) model, which integrates influences from dark matter, quantum fluctuations, and higher-dimensional effects. Our goal is to provide a potential framework for unifying gravity and quantum physics. We validate the CTS model against observational gravitational wave data and perform residual analysis to assess its accuracy. The results suggest that CTS aligns well with the observational data and provides a robust theoretical model that may contribute significantly to the quest for a universal theory. This model has the potential to enhance our understanding of the fundamental forces and the structure of the universe, supporting a hierarchical tree structure rather than parallel universes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"34bf5099beb7551450cf44381d0bfe3df361265f96a7d194b402c0f0d90083cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
