{"title":"Therapeutic Potential of Psychedelic Compounds for Substance Use Disorders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1406/v1","date":1729177578000,"content":"Psychedelics have recently (re)emerged as therapeutics of high potential for multiple mental health conditions, including substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite early mid-20th century anecdotal reports and pilot studies demonstrating the possibility of these substances in efficaciously treating conditions such as alcohol and opioid use disorders, legal restrictions and social stigma have historically hindered further research into this area. Nevertheless, concurrent with the rise in SUDs and other mental health conditions, researchers have again turned their attention to these compounds, searching for differing pharmacological targets as well as more holistic treatments that might increase patient adherence and efficacy. The aim of this review is to examine the emerging evidence with regards to the therapeutic treatment of SUDs with the psychedelic compounds psilocybin, ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), ayahuasca, ibogaine and peyote.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95dddbe4a032d75ce491479b16046680a8e4bce3f6b67188c0f85539aeb9ec72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
