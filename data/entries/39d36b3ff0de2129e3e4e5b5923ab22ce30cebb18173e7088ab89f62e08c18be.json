{"title":"Lung Cancer and Interstitial Lung Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1111/v1","date":1715858235000,"content":"Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. There is evidence of a complex interplay between lung cancer and interstitial lung disease (ILD), affecting disease progression, management strategies, and patient outcomes. Both conditions develop as the result of common risk factors such as smoking, environmental exposures, and genetic predispositions. The presence of ILD poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in lung cancer management, including difficulties in interpreting radiological findings, increased susceptibility to treatment-related toxicities, such as acute exacerbation of ILD after surgery and pneumonitis after radiation therapy and immunotherapy. Moreover, due to the lack of large, phase III randomized controlled trials in patients with lung cancer and ILDs, the evidence-based therapeutic options remain limited. The role of antifibrotic treatment in the prevention of lung-cancer-related treatment toxicities remains to be elucidated. Emerging diagnostic modalities and biomarkers, and optimizing personalized treatment strategies are essential to improve outcomes in this patient population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39d36b3ff0de2129e3e4e5b5923ab22ce30cebb18173e7088ab89f62e08c18be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
