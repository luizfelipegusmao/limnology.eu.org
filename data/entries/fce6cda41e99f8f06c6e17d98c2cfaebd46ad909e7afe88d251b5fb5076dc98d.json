{"title":"A High-Homology Region in Bacterial β-Barrel Pore-Forming Toxins","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1156/v1","date":1710933787000,"content":"Pathogenicity of many bacteria including Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus depends on pore-forming toxins (PFTs), which cause lysis of host cells by forming pores in membranes of eukaryotic cells. Bioinformatic analysis revealed in over 600 PFTs a region homologous to the Lys171-Gly250 sequence in hemolysin II (HlyII) from B. cereus, which we designated as “homologous peptide”. Three β-barrel PFTs were used for a detailed comparative analysis. Two of them –HlyII and cytotoxin K2 (CytK2), – are synthesized in Bacillus cereus sensu lato; the third – S. aureus α-toxin (Hla) – is the most investigated representative of the family. Protein modeling showed certain amino acids of homologous peptide to be located on the surface of the monomeric forms of these β-barrel PFTs. We obtained monoclonal antibodies against both a cloned homologous peptide and a 14-membered synthetic peptide DSFNTFYGNQLFMK as part of homologous peptide. The HlyII, CytK2 and Hla regions recognized by the obtained antibodies, as well as an antibody capable of suppressing the hemolytic activity of CytK2, were identified in the course of the work. Antibodies capable of recognizing PFTs of various origins can be useful tools for both identification and suppression of the cytolytic activity of PFTs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fce6cda41e99f8f06c6e17d98c2cfaebd46ad909e7afe88d251b5fb5076dc98d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
