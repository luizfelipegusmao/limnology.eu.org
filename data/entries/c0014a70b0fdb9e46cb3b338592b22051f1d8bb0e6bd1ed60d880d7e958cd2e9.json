{"title":"Effect of the Wing Morphology and Structural Form on the Flexible Hovering Flapping Wing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1164/v1","date":1718704946000,"content":"Flapping wing aircraft represents a new frontier in biomimetic aviation. Researchers have developed various flapping wing aircraft intending to harness their high aerodynamic efficiency to enhance flight performance. However, current flapping wing designs still have differences in morphology and structure forms compared to real bird wings. These differences may contribute to the key problem of low lift generation in flapping wing aircraft while hovering. Hence, this paper aims to find the influence of morphology and to overcome the aerodynamic efficiency problems. By using fluid-structure interaction analysis, this study investigates the influence of variation in wing area, and aspect ratio. The results show that increasing the wing area will promote the flexible deformation and passive twist of the flapping wing, resulting in a 173.7% increase in lift coefficient. However, this also leads to increased structural stress that must be taken into consideration. Additionally, as the aspect ratio increases, total deformation and tip deformation also increase; lower aspect ratios result in a more pronounced passive twist on the wing surface (84.4% higher). Moreover, this study has designed different wing structure layouts. With different rib distributions, the passive twist, stress concentration between ribs and at rib joints, maximum stress values at the root of the wing spar, and fluctuations in stress curves are influenced. Based on the result of wing parameters and structure layout, this study proposed a flapping wing structure design with efficient aerodynamic performance. The results highlight the influence of the key parameters of wing design and lay the theoretical groundwork for future research endeavors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c0014a70b0fdb9e46cb3b338592b22051f1d8bb0e6bd1ed60d880d7e958cd2e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
