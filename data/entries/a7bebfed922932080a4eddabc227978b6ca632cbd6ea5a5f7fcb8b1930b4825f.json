{"title":"Evaluating the Preparedness of Healthcare Providers for Prone Position CPR Across Jordan&#039;s Healthcare Sectors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1798/v1","date":1721730162000,"content":"Background: Health care providers (HCPs) may required to initiate a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) while patients are in a prone position. Healthcare providers must possess the necessary information, abilities and experience to do cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a prone position (PPCPR) confidently. \nAim: This study aimed to assess healthcare providers' (HCPs) preparedness to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a prone position at specialized units in Jordan's healthcare sectors.\nMethods: In eight tertiary hospitals, a descriptive cross-sectional survey was carried out. An on-line questionnaire was conducted among 332 healthcare professionals who are employed in operating rooms, intensive care units or interventional procedure rooms.\nResults: Preparedness levels among healthcare providers were 24.4% excellent, 2.1% acceptable and 73.5% poor. The average preparedness score was 32.38 (SD = 39.90), indicating significant variability. A lack of targeted training was associated with lower preparedness levels. Notably, providers with Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) training showed significantly higher preparedness.\nConclusion: The HCPs in Jordan are poorly prepared to perform PPCPR whenever indicated. However, the study findings represent a significant step towards improving HCPs' preparedness to perform PPCPR. They serve as a baseline assessment and highlight the gaps in HCPs' readiness, which help their organizations develop and implement targeted training strategies and interventions. Nevertheless, incorporating this training in the hospital orientation, training policies, and clinical guidelines is equally important to enhance their capabilities for better outcomes.\nImplications for Clinical Practice: The findings emphasize the urgent need for hospitals to integrate PPCPR training into their standard orientation and ongoing training programs. Providing comprehensive ACLS training and regular PPCPR drills will enhance HCPs' competence and confidence, leading to improved patient outcomes during emergency situations involving prone position CPR.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7bebfed922932080a4eddabc227978b6ca632cbd6ea5a5f7fcb8b1930b4825f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
