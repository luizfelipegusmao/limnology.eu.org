This paper aims to show how the activities developed under FISU's Healthy Campus (HC) program can be an asset in promoting the environment, sustainability and social responsibility in Higher Education Institutions. The methodology used includes (1) diagnosis, (2) drawing up the action plan and (3) preparation, development and monitoring of activities. The methodology approach adopted to analyze the activities uses: (1) mentimiter tool; (2) mind map and (3) SWOT analysis. Results show that when activities are designed in a collaborative and participatory way, they end up towards the aspirations of the participants, allowing for greater involvement of people and growth of the institution in the aspects of the environment, sustainability, and social responsibility. The HC program is an asset program to align, HC requirements, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), integrated and transdisciplinary approach, and people's environmental awareness and sustainable mindset.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a2717c79b2bebbacc3d47104d8663da20373330fe26f2326c2161b8ded90559","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
