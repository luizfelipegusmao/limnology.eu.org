{"title":"The COVID-19 Pandemic&#039;s Impact on Eating Disorders: an Italian Residential Center Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2456/v1","date":1727764724000,"content":"Background/Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on mental health worldwide, especially exacerbating Eating Disorders (EDs). This study aims to evaluate changes in the presentation and severity of EDs before and after the pandemic at the Regional Residential Center \"Mariconda\" in Salerno. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 162 patients admitted to the Regional Residential Center \"Mariconda\" between December 2018 and December 2023. The onset of pandemic restrictions in mid-2020 was the dividing line for the pre-COVID and post-COVID groups. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including age, gender, education level, previous hospital admissions, admission diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidity with other psychiatric illnesses. Results: Of the 162 subjects, 115 were admitted post-pandemic. The post-pandemic group was significantly younger, had lower education levels, more frequent previous hospitalizations, and a higher frequency of severe comorbidity with other mental illnesses compared to the pre-COVID group. No significant differences were found between the groups regarding gender distribution, initial diagnosis upon admission, average and length of hospital stay. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the presentation and severity of EDs, particularly among younger individuals with lower educational attainment. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted, integrated treatment approaches for EDs, especially global crises. Further research is essential to understand the long-term effects of the pandemic on EDs and to refine treatment strategies to better support affected individuals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa861bad40d6c8be5365113a8e4e5083ed0d2e97d89fa72ede567e9fe4ca75f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
