{"title":"The Association between Specimen Neuromuscular Characteristics and Urinary Incontinence after Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1703/v1","date":1721642351000,"content":"Urinary incontinence after Radical prostatectomy (RALRP) has been associated with older age, longer operative time, higher BMI, short membranous urethral length and preoperative erectile function. We sought to assess the association between the neuromuscular characteristics and postoperative urinary incontinence. Methods: RALRP specimens from 29 men who underwent bilateral nerve sparing were reanalyzed. Urinary incontinence was evaluated using the International Consultation on Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) at 6 weeks post surgery and last follow-up. Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess neuromuscular characteristics and incontinence. Results: At a median follow-up of 11 months (IQR 9-12), 11 patients (38%) reported on severe incontinence (&gt;12 ICIQ-SF score). Median number of peripheral nerves observed at the base and apex of the specimens were 52 (IQR 13-139) and 59 (IQR: 28-129), respectively. Ganglia were present in 19 patients (65%) at the base and 12 patients (41%) at the apex. Additionally, the median proportional area of detrusor smooth muscle fibers at the base was 0.54 (IQR 0.31-1), while the median proportional area of striated muscle fibers at the apex was 0.13 (IQR 0.08-0.24). No statistical significant associations were found. Conclusion: Histologic neuromuscular characteristics were not associated with postoperative urinary incontinence. Enhanced intraoperative evaluation and larger scale studies may prove useful for prediction of post prostatectomy incontinence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5bc4d6cced27885c605047eb9dc7b6bc140c8f21e6407395a255ef2cbdd9b4ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
