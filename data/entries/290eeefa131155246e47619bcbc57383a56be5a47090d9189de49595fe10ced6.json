{"title":"Multi Parametric Investigations on White etching Crack formation in 6203 Ball Bearings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1138/v1","date":1721031366000,"content":"Research on White Etching Cracks (WEC) apparent in multiple bearing applications has identified various drivers to cause them. Lubricants, Electricity combined with contact mechanics are proven to catalyze WEC significantly.  However, none of them is solely causing WEC by its own, instead combinations discretize whether WEC appears or not. Hence, the WEC topic appears to be multidimensional, making WEC still unpredictable. The current paper is about a systematic study by the use of a DGBB test rig on how lubricant chemicals combined with electricity and by varying oil flow and pressure lead to WEC. It becomes evident, that even WEC critical conditions turn to be WEC free by simply increasing the oil flow and decrease the contact pressure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"290eeefa131155246e47619bcbc57383a56be5a47090d9189de49595fe10ced6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
