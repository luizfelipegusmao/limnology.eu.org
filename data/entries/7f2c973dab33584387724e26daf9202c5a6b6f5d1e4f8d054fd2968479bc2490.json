{"title":"Selection of Urban Trees to Enhance Pollinator Food Resources: Comprehensive Consideration of Various Factors for Productivity Comparison","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0153/v1","date":1725357259000,"content":"The decline in global pollinator populations has raised serious concerns about the sustainability of ecosystems and agricultural productivity. Urban environments, often characterized by habitat loss and environmental stressors, are considered challenging habitats for pollinators. However, urban green spaces, including street and ornamental trees, can play a crucial role in supporting pollinators by providing essential food resources. This study aimed to evaluate the sugar and amino acid production of eight urban tree species to determine their potential contributions to pollinator nutrition. Our findings revealed significant variability among species regarding nectar volume, sugar content, and amino acid composition, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple factors when assessing the utility of floral resources. Consequently, Tilia amurensis, Heptacodium miconioides, Aesculus turbinata, and Wisteria floribunda demonstrated superior potential in supporting urban pollinator communities. Contrastingly, Sorbus commixta, Styrax japonicus, and Cornus kousa, often favored for their aesthetic appeal, showed less potential. This study underscores the need for urban tree selection that prioritizes species that provide diverse and abundant nutritional resources for pollinators while balancing aesthetic and ecological values. Our results offer a foundation for better-informed urban biodiversity management and contribute to creating pollinator-friendly urban environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f2c973dab33584387724e26daf9202c5a6b6f5d1e4f8d054fd2968479bc2490","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
