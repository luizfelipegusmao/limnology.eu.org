{"title":"Liquid Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy for Real-World Problems","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mt/article/32/2/17/7651172?rss=1","date":1713398400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Transmission electron microscopy of liquid samples is a relatively new technique that has the potential to reveal processes taking place within electrochemical, catalytic, and biological systems, during crystal growth from solution, and at the liquid/air interface. It is technically demanding yet can provide unique views of processes and structures in liquid environments. We will describe some highlights of the development of this technique and the equipment required to use it, explore questions that it can help address in microelectronics and battery research, and speculate on future directions and opportunities.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"c74ef6cf2fb2acca1bd8752649f37545609a167c88a9fd5c474807dfa9a3ab34","category":"Environment"}
