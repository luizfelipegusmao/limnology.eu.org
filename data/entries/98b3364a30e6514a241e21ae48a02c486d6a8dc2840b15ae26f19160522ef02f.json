{"title":"MicroRNAs As Biomarkers of Brain Tumors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0788/v1","date":1715575918000,"content":"Brain tumors still remain a deadly cancer that, in most cases, is difficult to diagnose at an earlier stage. Therefore, it is necessary to develop rapid, sensitive methods for detecting cancer biomarkers. Such a biomarker may be a microRNA which expression level in body fluids is strongly correlated with cancer. Numerous studies have demonstrated changes in the expression of microRNAs in cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples collected from patients with brain tumors. These new biomarkers have the potential to help diagnose brain cancers at an early stage, avoiding the most invasive procedures. This review discusses the functional role of microRNAs and the prospects for their use as diagnostic biomarkers in patients with brain tumors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"98b3364a30e6514a241e21ae48a02c486d6a8dc2840b15ae26f19160522ef02f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
