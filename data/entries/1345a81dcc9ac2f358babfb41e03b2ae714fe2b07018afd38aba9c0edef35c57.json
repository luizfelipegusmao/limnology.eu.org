{"title":"Adherence to Mediterranean diet and female urinary incontinence: Evidence from the NHANES database","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311771","date":1729605600000,"content":"<p>by Shiwang Xie, Zuyi Li, Qinyuan Yao, Yupei Zhang, Yuan Ou</p>\r\nBackground <p>Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common condition in female. Oxidative stress and inflammation levels play important roles in UI progression. Mediterranean diet (MD) as a healthy anti-inflammatory dietary pattern has been reported to be associated with several inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to assess the association between the adherence to Mediterranean diet (aMED) and female UI.</p> Methods <p>Data of study women aged ≥18 years old and diagnosed as stress UI and urgency UI were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2018. Dietary intake information was obtained by 24-h dietary recall interview. Covariates included sociodemographic information, physical examination, and history of diseases and medication were extracted from the database. The weighted univariable and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the association between aMED and different types of UI, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis were further evaluated this association based on different age, body mass index (BMI), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), depression and smoking.</p> Results <p>Totally, 13,291 women were included, of whom 5,921 (44.55%) had stress UI, 4276 (32.17%) had urgency UI and 2570 (19.34%) had mixed UI. After adjusted all covariates, high aMED score was associated with the lower odds of urgency (OR = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.75–0.98) and mixed UI (OR = 0.84, 95%CI: 0.70–0.99), especially in female, aged 45–60 years old, NLR ≥1.68 and had smoking history. No relationship was found between the aMED and stress UI (<i>P</i> &gt;0.05).</p> Conclusion <p>Greater aMED was connected with the low odds of urgency UI and mixed UI among female. Adherence to an anti-inflammatory diet in daily life are a promising intervention to be further explored in female UI.</p>","author":"Shiwang Xie","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1345a81dcc9ac2f358babfb41e03b2ae714fe2b07018afd38aba9c0edef35c57","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
