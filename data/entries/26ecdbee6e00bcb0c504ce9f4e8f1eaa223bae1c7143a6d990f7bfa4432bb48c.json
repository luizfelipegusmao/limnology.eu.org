{"title":"Another Trial of a Solar-Powered, Cooperative Sensor/Actuator, Opto-Acoustical, Virtual Road-Fence to Mitigate Roadkill in Tasmania, Australia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1529/v1","date":1711437422000,"content":"When wildlife and motor vehicles collide, the result for the animals is often death (roadkill). A commercial roadkill Virtual Fence (VF) mitigation device (iPTE Traffic Solutions) was used in a field trial to test its effectiveness along a 4.9-km segment of road on Bruny Island, Tasmania. A total of 585 days of monitoring of roadkill by species was conducted, with six sections alternatively switched on or off, according to a variation of a Crossover and Multiple Before-After-Control-Impact (MBACI) experimental designs that divided monitoring into “off-on” then “on-off” blocks of periods with each “on” period followed by a 16 d “wash-out” period. For the six sections over the four periods that exclude wash-outs, the 24 aggregated values of daily counts of roadkill of Tasmanian pademelons (Thylogale billardierii), that gave a total count of 222, were modelled. Other species were killed in insufficient numbers for analysis to be informative. The statistical analysis exploited the MBACI design to estimate the VF effect using a log-odds ratio parameter (LORP) while accounting for local spatio-temporal effects. Both versions of the analysis, either averaging over the three spatial replicates (paired sections) or two temporal replicates (blocks) gave no statistically significant effect of the VF judged as a LORP estimate not sufficiently below zero. Corresponding percentage reduction estimates of 9% and 16% were derived from the LORP estimates and given parameter uncertainty estimates the power to detect as significant a LORP corresponding to a 50% reduction in rate were 0.5 and 0.6, respectively. This study confirms results from a similar field trial carried out in 2018 also in southern Tasmania and adds to the evidence that this VF is likely to give if anything only a minor reduction in roadkill for a commonly killed species for which researchers have the best chance of detecting any practically useful reduction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"26ecdbee6e00bcb0c504ce9f4e8f1eaa223bae1c7143a6d990f7bfa4432bb48c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
