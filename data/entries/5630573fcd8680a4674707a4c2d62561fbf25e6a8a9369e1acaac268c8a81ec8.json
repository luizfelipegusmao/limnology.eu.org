{"title":"Design and Assessment of an Austenitic Stainless Alloy for Laser Powder Bed Additive Manufacturing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0079/v1","date":1725263139000,"content":"Recent developments in metallic additive manufacturing (AM) processes for the production of high-performance industrial pieces have been hampered by the limited availability of reliably processable or printable alloys. To date, most of the alloys used in AM are commercial grades that have been previously optimized for different manufacturing techniques. This study aims to design new alloys specifically tailored for AM processes, to minimize defects in the final products and optimize their properties. A computational approach is proposed to design novel and optimized austenitic alloy compositions. This method integrates a suite of predictive tools, including machine learning, calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD) and physical models, all piloted by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Within this framework, several material-dependent criteria are examined and their impact on properties and on the occurrence of defects is identified. To validate our approach, experimental tests are performed on a selected alloy composition: powder is produced by gas atomization and samples are fabricated by laser powder bed fusion. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloys are evaluated and its printability is compared to a commercial 316L stainless steel taken as a reference.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5630573fcd8680a4674707a4c2d62561fbf25e6a8a9369e1acaac268c8a81ec8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
