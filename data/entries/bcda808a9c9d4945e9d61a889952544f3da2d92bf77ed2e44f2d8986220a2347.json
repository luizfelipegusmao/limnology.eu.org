{"title":"Super-pigment: Deciphering shikonin biosynthesis to fight cancer, inflammation, and much more","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2482/7643765?rss=1","date":1712707200000,"content":"<span>The roots of red gromwell (<span>Lithospermum erythrorhizon</span>) produce shikonin, a unique 1,4-naphthoquinone with a broad range of applications. Shikonin is a precious red pigment for the Asian culture, not only as a dye or cosmetic but also as an exceptional traditional herbal medicine. Shikonin has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties and anticancer activity and helps with wound healing, among many other pharmacological uses (<a href=\"#kiae210-B8\">Yadav et al. 2022</a>). For decades, shikonin and shikonin-derived metabolites have been produced industrially in cell cultures. However, despite its commercial value, the biosynthetic pathway of shikonin has not been completely solved.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"bcda808a9c9d4945e9d61a889952544f3da2d92bf77ed2e44f2d8986220a2347","category":"Environment"}
