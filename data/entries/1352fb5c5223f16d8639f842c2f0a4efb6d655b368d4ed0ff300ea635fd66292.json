{"title":"Impact of VR-Based Cognitive Training on Working Memory and Inhibitory Control in IDD Young Adults","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1785/v1","date":1721734587000,"content":"Background: Young people with intellectual developmental disabilities have a persistent delay in the development of executive functions. Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly being used as a cognitive intervention tool, with significant effectiveness demonstrated in different types of populations. Methods: This pilot study aims to investigate the impact of a cognitive training program utilizing VR on young adults diagnosed with intellectual developmental disability (IDD). The participants (N=15) served as their own control group and were assessed three times: weeks 0, 8 and 16, with a rest period (0-8 weeks) and an intervention period (8-16 weeks). The assessments included measures of cognitive function, provided by E-PrimeÂ®. Results: Overall, an improvement in working memory and inhibitory control was found after the intervention, but not in sustained attention. Conclusions: These findings suggest that VR-based cognitive training holds promise as an effective intervention for enhancing cognitive abilities in young adults with intellectual developmental disability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1352fb5c5223f16d8639f842c2f0a4efb6d655b368d4ed0ff300ea635fd66292","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
