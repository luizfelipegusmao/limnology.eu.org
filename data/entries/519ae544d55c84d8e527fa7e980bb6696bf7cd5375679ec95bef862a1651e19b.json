{"title":"Eosinophilic Esophagitis: Our Experience with the Emerging Disease at a Single Center in North Israel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1422/v1","date":1716357288000,"content":"Purpose: Data on Eosinophilic esophagitis in Israel is sparse. We appraised the clinical, endoscopic, and histological characteristics of 50 Israeli adults with EoE. \nMethods: Medical records of 50 adult patients with established diagnoses of EoE who were referred to our center from 2020 until 2023 at Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel, were reviewed. \nResults: Fifty patients with EoE were included, the mean age at diagnosis was 34±9.5 years. The sex ratio of males to females was approximately 2:1 with 34 males (68%) and 16 females (32%). Twenty-two of the 50 patients had a history of allergic diseases, Symptoms at diagnosis were as follows: Dysphagia was the primary presenting symptom observed (n=25, 50%), followed by food impaction (n=17, 34%) and GERD-like symptoms (n=14, 28%). Less frequent symptoms included vomiting, nausea, and chest pain. The most common endoscopic findings were normal mucosa (n=21, 42%) followed by Trachealization (n=17, 34%), esophagitis (n=7, 14%), and exudates (n=5, 10%). 66% of the subjects were initially treated with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). Nine patients (18%) were asymptomatic without any treatment. The remaining eight patients (16%) were given topical steroids. Clinical and histological resolution was detected in 50% of the patients who underwent a second EGD after 6–8 weeks of PPI. \nConclusion: Our current study depicts the clinical features of adult patients with EoE in north Israel. This is the first demographic study in Israel that defines the clinical, endoscopic, and histological manifestations of EoE in the adult population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"519ae544d55c84d8e527fa7e980bb6696bf7cd5375679ec95bef862a1651e19b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
