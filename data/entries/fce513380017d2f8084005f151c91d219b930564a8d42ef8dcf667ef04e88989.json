{"title":"Estimating the potential distribution range of the invasive South American suckermouth armoured catfishes Pterygoplichthys spp. in the Indo‐Burma biodiversity hotspot using MaxEnt","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4173?af=R","date":1716274800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nThe Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot has one of the world's most species-rich inland waters. However, its freshwater biodiversity faces habitat loss and species extinction due to large-scale development of water resources, pollution, exploitation of native biota, and introduced non-native species.\nThese threats include the South American suckermouth armoured catfishes, <i>Pterygoplichthys</i> spp., that have invaded parts of this biodiversity hotspot. <i>Pterygoplichthys</i> spp. are among the most impactful introduced fishes globally and pose a ‘very high risk’ of becoming invasive once introduced.\nThis paper aims to compile a distribution database for <i>Pterygoplichthys</i> spp., map their current global distribution, and estimate their potential distribution extent in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot using MaxEnt.\nIn the Indo-Burma region, <i>Pterygoplichthys</i> spp. have already been reported from China, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, with populations also present in neighbouring India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. No populations were verified for Cambodia and Laos.\nA maximum entropy model was developed based on the current global distribution of <i>Pterygoplichthys</i> spp. The species distribution model showed that the entire biodiversity hotspot, except the spine of the Arkan Mountains and the Hengduan Mountains from Three Gorges to the Hong River Valley, is suitable for <i>Pterygoplichthys</i> spp. An effective temperature of 15°C was identified as the lower limit of <i>Pterygoplichthys</i> spp. habitat suitability.\n<i>Pterygoplichthys</i> spp. were identified as a high-risk taxon for freshwaters of almost the entire Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. A coordinated management plan for <i>Pterygoplichthys</i> spp. is required to safeguard the freshwater biota of the Indo-Burma freshwater ecosystems.\n</p>","author":"S.M. Marr, \nJ. Patoka, \nD.D.
