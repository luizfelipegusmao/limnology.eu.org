{"title":"Antibiotic Resistance of Helicobacter pylori: Data from Central Asia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1357/v1","date":1726629756000,"content":"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a global health concern, particularly in regions with a high incidence of stomach cancer. The effective eradication of this bacteria is essential for the prevention and treatment of related gastrointestinal disorders. However, antibiotic resistance has emerged as a significant challenge to effective treatment. This review examines antibiotic resistance among H. pylori populations in Central Asia, a region with limited data on this topic. We critically analyze the available literature, exploring the mechanisms behind resistance and highlighting implications for clinical practice and future research. Despite the lack of studies in the region, data suggest alarming levels of resistance to two common antibiotics, clarithromycin and metronidazole. These results underscore the need for enhanced surveillance and personalized treatment strategies to combat H. pylori infections and reduce the risk of stomach cancer in Central Asian populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0469ee9aef16382c1acfdd85d05a2b7ee765c79a78b9fe8cd4f5784058f7ceb2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
