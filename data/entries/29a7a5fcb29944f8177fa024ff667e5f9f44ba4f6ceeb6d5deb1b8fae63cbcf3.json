Nonetheless, the sensitivity to Poisson noise poses a notable obstacle, particularly regarding the precision required for strain measurements. In nanobeam 4D-STEM, the accuracy of strain measurements is intrinsically linked to the precise determination of Bragg peak centers of mass [<a href=\"#ozae044.927-B1\">1</a>]. Various denoising techniques exist. However, they often come with compromises, such as reduction of resolution or artifact introduction.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"29a7a5fcb29944f8177fa024ff667e5f9f44ba4f6ceeb6d5deb1b8fae63cbcf3","category":"Environment"}
