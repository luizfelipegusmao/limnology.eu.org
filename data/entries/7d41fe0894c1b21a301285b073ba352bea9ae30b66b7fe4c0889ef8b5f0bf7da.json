{"title":"IFU Spectroscopic Study of the Planetary Nebula Abell 30: Mapping the Ionization and Kinematic Structure of the Inner Complex","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2062/v1","date":1717069399000,"content":"This work presents emission line flux and kinematic structure mapping based on IFU data of the planetary nebulae Abell 30 (A30). The IFU has a field of view (FoV) of 16\" x 12.3\" and was used to partially cover knots J1 and J2, and completely cover knots J3 and J4 of A30. Our emission line flux map shows recombination species C II, C III, He I, O II as well as forbidden line species [O III], [Ne III] and [Ne IV] of high excitation level are all distributed in different parts of the knots. The kinematic structure shows considerable variation in both the velocities and spatial locations of these knots with positive and negative velocity excursions from the systematic value. Forbidden line species [O III], [Ne III] are distributed in both knots J3 and J4 but they are travelling at different speeds in opposite directions. Despite variation in distribution of the species, the velocities of [Ne IV] and [O III] are similar and travelling in the same direction while the other species [Ne III], He I, and O II share similar velocity of 200kmsâˆ’1 up in the opposite direction. The complexity of distribution and kinematic structure of the knots revealed in this work indicates a strong tendency towards the hypothesis of multiple triggering events in the past history of A30.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d41fe0894c1b21a301285b073ba352bea9ae30b66b7fe4c0889ef8b5f0bf7da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
