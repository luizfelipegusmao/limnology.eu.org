{"title":"How to Avoid Becoming a Risk Factor of Fecal Incontinence Due to OASIS &ndash; a Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0452/v1","date":1720131907000,"content":"Third and fourth-degree anal sphincter injuries are among the most severe traumas women can experience during childbirth, often leading to lifelong continence issues. Despite extensive research, current repair techniques are often inadequate, failing to provide long-term solutions. Women with previous severe injuries face a higher risk of recurrence in subsequent deliveries, making caesarean sections a safer option in many cases. The existing WHO classification system is outdated, as it doesn't account for injuries to muscles like the levator ani, which are crucial for continence.\n\nEffective repairs require skilled surgeons and often involve more than just fixing the sphincter. Smaller hospitals may not have the necessary expertise and resources for these complex repairs. Delaying repairs to allow specialists to perform them can be just as effective as immediate repairs. Comprehensive care that includes thorough anatomical knowledge and surgical skill is essential. As maternal age increases and birth rates decline, it's crucial for specialized centers to handle severe perineal injuries to ensure the best outcomes and long-term care for patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5653797ec79d822a2d5ca149e6beb83e35621e9bcc8f43ad8e23aec5ad309e7a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
