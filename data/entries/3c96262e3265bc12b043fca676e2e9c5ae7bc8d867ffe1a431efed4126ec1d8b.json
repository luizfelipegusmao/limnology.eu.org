{"title":"Sustainable sojourns: Fostering sustainable hospitality practices to meet UN-SDGs","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307469","date":1721829600000,"content":"<p>by Jing He, Umer Zaman</p>\r\n\r\nThis research discusses the significance of environmental transformational leadership (ENTL) in the creation of energy-saving sustainable behaviors (EESB) among employees in the tourism and hospitality sector of China. The method is consequently a quantitative analysis, where the mediating effect of green intrinsic motivation (GNIM) and green passion (GRP), and the moderating role of green altruism (GNA) are examined to understand their influence on the relationship between ENTL and EESB. The data were gathered from multiple hotels in major Chinese cities, with the use of a structured questionnaire. The study shows that ENTL has significant effect on EESB, with GNIM and GRP serving as mediating factors. In addition, GNA was shown to have been able to boost the effects that ENTL has on these mediators. The findings are indicative of the vital role of leadership in promoting responsible practices within the tourism and hospitality sector, and towards the attainment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This research not only fills the gaps in the existing literature that primarily focuses on developed economies but also provides policy makers and business leaders with practical solutions for enhancing the sustainability in emerging economies.","author":"Jing He","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3c96262e3265bc12b043fca676e2e9c5ae7bc8d867ffe1a431efed4126ec1d8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
