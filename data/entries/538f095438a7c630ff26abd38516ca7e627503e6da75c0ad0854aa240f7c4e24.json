FastVDO LLC, 3097 Cortona Dr., Melbourne, FL 32940\nAbstract: Millions of small investors fare poorly in the financial markets. For them, the markets\nare like turbulent seas. Braving them in a mere skiff, a major storm can spell financial doom at any\ntime. But the reality is that most investment funds also underperform the market. Against this\nbackdrop, there are some savvy investors who have consistently beat the market, for decades!\nNames such Benjamin Graham, John Templeton, Peter Lynch, or Jim Simons come to mind. But\nno investor has beat the market as decisively or for as long as Warren Buffett, getting an annual\nreturn of nearly 20% since 1965! Is there a way that the small investor can swim with these sharks?\nThese legendary investors developed a refined sense for valuing companies through fundamental\nanalysis (hard work), investing in solid companies that are deep in value. The untrained small\ninvestor cannot hope to replicate their method. To enter these waters, she needs a new boat:\nalgorithmic trading. Not the kind that trades in microseconds (high frequency trading), which is\nagain out of her reach, but the type that trades only a few times a year (very low frequency). Using\nan approach developed and tested in previous papers, we go head-to-head with Buffett's famous\nBRK-A fund and compare performance over the 44-year period 1980-2024. Buffett's BRK-A\nearned 19% annual return over the 44 years. We also test a 50-year period, the historical limit for\nNasdaq. By using simple algorithmic trading methods, we show that the small investor can indeed\nkeep pace with Buffett, without the hard work. Our simple methods allow us to obtain both strong\ngains, and reduced drawdowns, helping us to survive the major market downturns known as Black\nSwan events. This win-win is good news for small investors worldwide.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"538f095438a7c630ff26abd38516ca7e627503e6da75c0ad0854aa240f7c4e24","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
