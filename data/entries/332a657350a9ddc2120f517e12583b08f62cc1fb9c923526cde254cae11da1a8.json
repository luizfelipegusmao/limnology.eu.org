{"title":"Higher incidence of Congenital Aortic Valve Stenosis  in higher Magnetic latitudes countries: New Insights and Potential Therapies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0148/v1","date":1719872232000,"content":"Bicuspid Aortic valve Stenosis (BCAS) with an incidence of 3% of the world's population constitutes the most frequent Congenital Heart Disease whereas all other subtypes collectively constitute 1% of all life births. Most and the extreme severity spectrum of valvular Aortic Stenosis (VAS) in adulthood are cases of congenital bicuspid aortic valve. It seems that the congenital occurrence of the bicuspid aortic valve is a major prerequisite of the pathological calcifications and fibrosis seen in adults. Those progressive changes can't be explained by sole hemodynamic destructive forces but other factors inherent to the bicuspid valve tissue are also contributing. Therapeutic options of (VAS) are relatively stagnant and have been limited to invasive and surgical options. Prudent observation of the risk factors of some CHDs including BCAS was the epigenetic effect of planetary electromagnetic field on the delicate process of endothelial mesenchymal transformation (EndoMT). The incidence of BCAS is progressively increasing as we depart north from the equator to the north pole. A deeper understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying EndoMT in congenital as well as acquired heart diseases is expected to open a new era in reversing heart disease in the human species. The potential to manipulate EndoMT and its signaling pathways or to reverse it with external electromagnetic power is an exciting therapeutic option for a wide array of congenital and acquired heart diseases including bicuspid aortic stenosis (BCAS) in the human species.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"332a657350a9ddc2120f517e12583b08f62cc1fb9c923526cde254cae11da1a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
