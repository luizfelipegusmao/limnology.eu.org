{"title":"Effects Of Moderate-Frequency Resistance Training On Cardiometabolic Risk Factors In Adults With Overweight And Obesity: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1847/v1","date":1721742862000,"content":"Background: Cardiometabolic risk factors (CRFs) are significant health concerns among adults with overweight and obesity. Resistance training (RT) is known to manage CRFs, but the impact of moderate-frequency RT (two to three times weekly) remains unclear.\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing moderate-frequency RT with non-exercise control or usual care in overweight and obese adults. Searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library up to February 2024, following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Eligible studies included non-athletic adults (BMI ≥ 25) aged 18 years or older, with RT interventions lasting 7 weeks or longer.\nResults: Fifteen RCTs were included. Moderate-frequency RT significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by -4.66 mmHg (95% CI -9.34 to 0.02, p=0.01) and mean arterial pressure by -6.48 mmHg (95% CI -10.63 to -2.33, p=0.002) compared to controls. Additionally, RT significantly lowered fasting insulin levels by -12.52 mmol/L (95% CI -24.17 to -0.88, p=0.04) and HOMA-IR by -1.49 (95% CI -1.63 to -1.35, p＜0.00001). Improvements were more pronounced in participants with dietary control.\nConclusion: Moderate-frequency RT effectively improves CRFs in overweight and obese adults, suggesting its potential as a beneficial intervention for this population.\nPROSPERO registration number: CRD42022343167.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c07c3371aaaf0566581d4451d140b1d4aaa5e37151ad8e94d04bf351b2572141","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
