{"title":"350 Awardee Talk: Beef cattle mineral nutrition: What do we know and where do we go from here","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/367/7757505?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Trace minerals are pivotal in enhancing cattle growth and ensuring profitability in beef production. Historically, supplementation strategies have aimed at preventing deficiencies, significantly improving growth and reproductive performance. However, as cattle breeding has evolved to achieve remarkable growth rates, the challenges related to health and stress during the feeding period have intensified. This presentation explores refined trace mineral recommendations, focusing on zinc’s “stress requirement” for cattle undergoing transit and health challenges, and its impact on performance. The segmented nature of the beef industry, necessitating multiple transports, induces physiological stress and oxidative stress, highlighting the need for tailored mineral supplementation. Further, when recognizing feedlot cattle as the high-performing athletes they are, the potential benefits of adjusted trace mineral concentrations become apparent. Preliminary findings suggest that optimal zinc concentrations may exceed current National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) 2016 recommendations, whereas for other minerals like copper and manganese, the existing guidelines remain appropriate. This presentation will explore the differential effects of increasing dietary zinc and copper in conjunction with various growth-promoting technologies. Preliminary data indicates that increasing zinc concentrations can linearly enhance average daily gain (ADG) and hot carcass weight (HCW), especially when using potent anabolic implants, while the response to increased copper concentrations exhibits a more quadratic relationship with performance. Building upon the foundational work of pioneering researchers in the field of mineral nutrition, this presentation advocates for the continuous refinement and optimization of trace mineral supplementation strategies. By integrating cutting-edge technologies and fostering collaborative research efforts, we aim to further enhance the sustainability of the beef industry. A deeper understanding of trace mineral requirements in the face of modern production challenges will pave the way for more precise and effective nutritional strategies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"0212d056ea447890a842320b2b2674e380c6831d39cad756d921d7f9160cdd04","category":"Environment"}
