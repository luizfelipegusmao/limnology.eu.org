{"title":"Thermochemical Transformation of Municipal Household Solid Waste Fractions into Bio-Oils and Bio-Adsorbents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0084/v2","date":1723821242000,"content":"This work aims to investigate the effect of process temperature and catalyst content by thermochemical degradation of municipal solid waste (MSW) fraction (organic matter + paper + plastic) on the yield of reaction products (bio-oil, biochar, H2O and gas), physi-cochemical properties and chemical composition of bio-oils, as well as on the morphol-ogy and crystalline phases of biochar in laboratory scale. The organic matter, paper and plastic segregated from the gravimetric composition of total waste sample were subject-ed to the pre-treatments of drying, crushing and sieving. Thermal pyrolysis was per-formed at 400, 450 and 475 °C and 1.0 atmosphere, and catalytic pyrolysis at 450°C and 1.0 atmosphere, using 5.0, 10.0 and 15.0% (wt.) of FCC zeolite, bath mode, using a laboratory-scale borosilicate glass reactor. The bio-oil was characterized for acidic val-ue. The chemical functions present in the bio-oil identified by FT-IR and the composi-tion by GC-MS. Biochar was characterized by SEM/EDS and XRD. Thermal pyrolysis of the MSW fraction shows bio-oil yields between 9.44 and 9.24% (wt), aqueous phase yields between 21.93 and 18.78% (wt), solid phase yields between 67.97 and 40.34% (wt) and gas yields between 28.27 and 5.92% (wt). The bio-oil yield decreased with in-creasing process temperature. For the experiments using FCC, the biochar and gas yields slightly increased with increasing FCC content, while that of bio-oil decreased and the H2O phase remained constant. GC-MS of bio-oils identified the presence of hy-drocarbons and oxygenates, as well as nitrogen-containing compounds including am-ides and amines. The acidity of the bio-oil increased with increasing temperature and with the aid of FCC as a catalyst. The presence of hydrocarbons in bio-oil was identified by the addition of FCC catalyst due to the deoxygenation of carboxylic acids, followed by decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions, producing aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e262de59fdc382a6b2544b323987804a4a2d7d059232b1305bd56b8a221a0ea3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
