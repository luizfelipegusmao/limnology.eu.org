{"title":"A Comprehensive Survey on Investigation of Machine Learning-Powered Augmented Reality Applications in Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1758/v1","date":1711629467000,"content":"Machine learning (ML) is enabling augmented reality (AR) to gain popularity in various fields, including gaming, entertainment, healthcare, and education. ML enhances AR applications in education by providing accurate visualizations of objects. For AR systems, ML algorithms facilitate the recognition of objects and gestures from kindergarten through university. The purpose of this survey is to provide an overview of various ways in which ML techniques can be applied within the field of AR within education. The first step is to describe the background of AR. In the next step, we will discuss the ML models that are used in AR education applications. Additionally, we discuss how ML is used in AR. Each subgroupâ€™s challenges and solutions can be identified by analyzing these frameworks. In addition, we outline several research gaps and future research directions in ML-based AR frameworks for education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"74358178ef2bf39f9c11d47a7234eb48c665a25b36ef7c8d5a7146708303217d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
