A substantial part of anthropogenic methane is emitted by the livestock sector, as methane is a normal product of ruminant digestion. We present the latest developments and challenges ahead of the main efficient mitigation strategies of enteric methane production in ruminants. Numerous mitigation strategies have been developed in the last decades, from dietary manipulation and breeding to targeting of methanogens, the microbes that produce methane. The most recent advances focus on specific inhibition of key enzymes involved in methanogenesis. But these inhibitors, although efficient, are not affordable and not adapted to the extensive farming systems prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. Effective global mitigation of methane emissions from livestock should be based not only on scientific progress but also on the feasibility and accessibility of mitigation strategies.</p></div>","author":"Simon Roques, Gonzalo Martinez-Fernandez, Yuliaxis Ramayo-Caldas, Milka Popova, Stuart Denman, Sarah J.
