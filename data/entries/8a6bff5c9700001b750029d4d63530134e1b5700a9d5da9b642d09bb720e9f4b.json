{"title":"Technique And Tectonic Concepts As Theoretical Tools In Object And Space Production: An Experimental Approach To Building Technology I And II Courses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2346/v1","date":1722263978000,"content":"By focusing on technical content, this study presents “two experimental building technology courses” connecting the conceptual and practical aspects of architectural object production. Built on the fundamental “concept of making”, these courses encourage students to explore their creative abilities by uniting material, form, and purpose. In Building Structure I, exploration starts with the concept of “technique” as the knowledge of making that shapes the object. This technique allows the production of architectural objects that encapsulate spaces carrying action and time, making a mere explanation of space creation insufficient. Thus, in Building Technology II, the focus shifts to the “tectonic” concept, which involves creating coherent spatial entities within a single structural system. These courses aim to equip students with the ability to develop their own unique knowledge and methods for construction before advancing to more theorized building technologies courses. Students are encouraged to engage with materials to uncover their potential, experiment with forms to achieve design goals, and personalize construction processes. This proposal advocates for foundational construction courses built on intuitive knowledge to replace traditional rational knowledge courses. Our study presents the methodologies and outputs of the proposed building technology courses as a basis for ongoing construction courses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a6bff5c9700001b750029d4d63530134e1b5700a9d5da9b642d09bb720e9f4b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
