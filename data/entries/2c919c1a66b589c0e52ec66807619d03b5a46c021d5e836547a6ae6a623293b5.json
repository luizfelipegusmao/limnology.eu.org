{"title":"The effects of Mitragyna speciosa extracts on intestinal microbiota and their metabolites in vitro fecal fermentation","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13677?af=R","date":1719394219000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Kratom (<i>Mitragyna speciosa</i>) has a long history of traditional use. It contains various alkaloids and polyphenols. The properties of kratom's alkaloids have been well-documented. However, the property of kratom's polyphenols in water-soluble phase have been less frequently reported. This study assessed the effects of water-soluble <i>Mitragyna speciosa</i> (kratom) extract (MSE) on gut microbiota and their metabolite production in fecal batch culture.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The water-soluble kratom extract (MSE0) and the water-soluble kratom extract after partial sugar removal (MSE50) both contained polyphenols, with total phenolic levels of 2037.91 ± 51.13 and 3997.95 ± 27.90 mg GAE/g extract, respectively and total flavonoids of 81.10 ± 1.00 and 84.60 ± 1.43 mg CEQ/g extract. The gut microbiota in fecal batch culture was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing at 0 and 24 h of fermentation. After fermentation, MSE50 stimulated the growth of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> more than MSE0. MSE0 gave the highest total fatty acids level among the treatments. The phenolic metabolites produced by some intestinal microbiota during fecal fermentation at 24 h were analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The major metabolite of biotransformation of both water-soluble MSEs by intestinal microbiota was pyrocatechol (9.85–11.53%).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The water-soluble MSEs and their produced metabolites could potentially be used as ingredients for functional and medicinal food production that supports specific gut microbiota. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Nattha Pansai, \nJuraithip Wungsintaweekul, \nSantad Wichienchot","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"2c919c1a66b589c0e52ec66807619d03b5a46c021d5e836547a6ae6a623293b5","category":"Environment"}
