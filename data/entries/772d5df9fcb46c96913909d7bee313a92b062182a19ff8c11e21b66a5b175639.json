Composites of iron oxide and MCC were synthesized with a 5%–20% loading of iron (w/w%). The effect of pH, concentration, and contact time was studied. The adsorption isotherms were fitted to nonlinear Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D-R) isotherms, and kinetics were studied for pseudo-first and second-order kinetic fit models. Adsorption of Pb(II) ions increased with increasing pH value up to 5. Maximum adsorption of Pb(II) was observed up to 299.91 mg<sup>−1</sup> in D-R equilibrium for onto MCC-Iron oxide composite for composite with iron loading of 20% at pH 5.</p>","author":"Bhupender Kumar, \nAmarjeet Dahiya, \nJ.
