{"title":"Bias correction of daily precipitation from climate models, using the Q‚ÄêGAM method","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/env.2881?af=R","date":1728526425000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Climate models are useful tools for analyzing historical and projecting future climate conditions. However, the model results tend to differ systematically from observations, particularly for parameters with complex spatial and temporal distributions such as precipitation. A combination of quantile mapping and generalized additive models (GAMs) is presented and proposed as a new method (Q-GAM) for the bias correction of daily precipitation. Q-GAM is demonstrated by using data from five European stations with different climate characteristics. For each station, the closest continental grid point of a EURO-CORDEX climate model was selected for bias correction. A bootstrapping experiment is presented with over 1000 repetitions of randomly splitting the historical period 1981 to 2005 into a calibration and evaluation period. The results for all stations reveal that Q-GAM is a straightforward, accurate and computationally efficient method for the bias correction of precipitation. In particular, the method improves the frequency of dry days and the total annual rainfall amount. This outcome is robust across stations with varying climate characteristics and also to the choice of calibration and evaluation periods. Similar results are also obtained for other precipitation characteristics such as the 0.9 and 0.95 quantiles.</p>","author":"Georgia Lazoglou, \nTheo Economou, \nChristina Anagnostopoulou, \nAnna Tzyrkalli, \nGeorge Zittis, \nJos Lelieveld","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmetrics: Table of Contents","siteHash":"4718a208dff669d8713b9a4772fb9e30bd4e6b10bc59ba738841df9ffc8f1e42","entryHash":"8e27389acc4e6e6d1d334fb4cddc3aba527ac854c7400651a8ac0959bf90d151","category":"Environment"}
