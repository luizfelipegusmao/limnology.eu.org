{"title":"Impact Of A Toothpaste Containing Enzymes And Proteins On Gum Health: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2431/v1","date":1727764897000,"content":"The aim of the present review is to investigate the role of a toothpastes containing enzymes and proteins in supplementing natural salivary defenses. A systematic review was conducted using PRISMA with PROSPERO ID code CRD42024558854. An exhaustive search of PubMed, Web Of Science, and Scopus, using the PICO format was carried out. The used MeSH were enzymes; AND proteins; AND toothpaste. In vivo studies on humans analyzing the gum effects of a toothpaste containing enzymes and proteins, in the English language, published in the last 10 years were included. The search period started on 04 June 2024 and ended on 20 July 2024. The risk of bias was evaluated according to the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0) while non-randomized studies were evaluated with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool in Non-Randomized Studies (ROBINS-I). From a total of 62 studies, 3 were included. Two RCTs and had low and medium risk of bias, the N-RCT had low risk of bias. With the limitations of the present study, a toothpaste containing enzymes and proteins can improve gum health after 12 week and after 12 months, the role against black stains seemed not to be confirmed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aed65f644cf085937bd353b3dcbfc66c9298a745fd226d87675a2a187aaaa7f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
