{"title":"PSXII-7 Forage quality and grazing dairy cattle performance as affected by the circadian rhythm: A meta-analytic investigation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/606/7757657?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The circadian rhythm alters forage chemical composition by balancing processes of photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration. Timing of moving animals to a new paddock in a rotationally stocked system may take advantage of potential improvements in forage quality. The objective of this study was to collate available peer-reviewed papers aiming at comparing the forage quality and grazing dairy cattle performance when moved to a new paddock either in the morning (a.m.) or afternoon (p.m.). Twenty-four studies were gathered in total, and the number of observations per variable varied according to its availability within the studies. Among forage chemical composition parameters, contents of dry matter (DM), total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC), soluble carbohydrates (SC), starch, neutral-detergent fiber (NDF), acid-detergent fiber (ADF), acid-detergent lignin (ADL), ether extract (EE), crude protein (CP), and digestibility were assessed. The animal performance parameters included dry matter intake (DMI), milk yield (MY), energy-corrected milk yield (ECM), milk fat (MF) and milk protein (MP) contents, fat yield (FY), and protein yield (PY). A meta-analysis was performed according to a random effects model weighted by inverse variance (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V3.3.070). Means, standard deviations or p-values, and number of observations were used to compute the effect sizes. Heterogeneity between observed effect sizes was examined with the Cochran’s Q test and the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. The standardized mean difference was reported with its 95% confidence interval (CI), where positive values indicate an increment of p.m. compared with a.m., and negative values indicate a reduction. Statistical differences were declared significant at <span>P</span> ≤ 0.05, and trends were declared at <span>P</span> ≤ 0.10. Forage sampled in the p.m. had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) contents of DM, TNC, SC, starch, and digestibility by 19.8, 16.3, 21.3, 12.1, and 1.0%, while NDF (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001), ADF (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001), ADL (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001), and C<span>P</span> (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) were decreased by 1.8, 2.4, 2.4, and 1.7% relative to a.m. forage, respectively (Table 1). Content of EE was not influenced (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) by time. The ECM was 3.4% greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) and the PY tended to be 3.7% greater (<span>P</span> = 0.07) for dairy cows moved in the p.m. compared with those moved in the a.m (Table 2). Dry matter intake, MY, MF, MP, and FY were not affected (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) by time. Results indicate that even with considerable improvements of forage nutritive value in the afternoon, the benefits in terms of animal performance are small. Future studies assessing potential benefits of moving animals to a new paddock during the afternoon, should consider statistical power analysis and sample size calculation when designing the experiment.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"257496bbe0d9caff28cb4aa30f42ca2bb57a167f23dc4118723ebe090e7dae06","category":"Environment"}
