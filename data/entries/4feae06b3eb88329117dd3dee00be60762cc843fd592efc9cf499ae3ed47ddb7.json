{"title":"Economic Recovery After Corona: Legal and Management Solutions for Small Businesses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0545/v1","date":1725717081000,"content":"The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly disrupted small businesses, exacerbating financial vulnerabilities and operational challenges. As these enterprises play a crucial role in economic stability and growth, identifying effective recovery strategies is imperative. This study investigates the legal and management solutions necessary for small businesses to recover and thrive post-pandemic. The research aims to examine the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small businesses, evaluate the effectiveness of existing legal and governmental support measures, and propose management strategies that enhance resilience and drive recovery. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, comprising both quantitative and qualitative analyses. A survey was conducted with 500 small businesses across various sectors to collect data on financial performance, operational disruptions, and the utilization of government support programs. Additionally, 30 in-depth interviews with small business owners provided qualitative insights into adaptive strategies and challenges faced. A review of relevant legal documents and policy frameworks was also performed to assess the support mechanisms in place. The study revealed that 68% of small businesses experienced substantial revenue losses, with 50% encountering severe liquidity crises. Government support measures, such as grants and low-interest loans, were pivotal but often marred by accessibility issues and delays. Successful management strategies identified included accelerating digital transformation, diversifying revenue streams, and optimizing supply chain management. Legal measures that temporarily eased regulatory requirements and offered tax relief significantly aided in alleviating immediate pressures. The economic recovery of small businesses post-COVID-19 hinges on comprehensive legal and management solutions. Enhancing the effectiveness and reach of government support programs is crucial, as is the adoption of agile and innovative management practices by small businesses. Policymakers and business leaders must work collaboratively to create an environment that fosters resilience and sustainable growth, ensuring small businesses can navigate future economic uncertainties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4feae06b3eb88329117dd3dee00be60762cc843fd592efc9cf499ae3ed47ddb7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
