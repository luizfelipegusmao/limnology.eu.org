{"title":"Residential Sizing of Solar Photovoltaic Systems and Heat Pumps for Net Zero Sustainable Thermal Building Energy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0149/v1","date":1714728141000,"content":"To enable net zero sustainable thermal building energy this study develops an open-source thermal house model to couple solar photovoltaic (PV) and heat pumps (HP) for grid-connected residential housing. The calculation of both space heating and cooling thermal loads and the selection of HP is accomplished with a validated Python model for air-source heat pumps. The capacity of PV required to supply the HPs is calculated using an System Advisor Model integrated Python model. Self-sufficiency and self-consumption of PV and the energy imported/exported to the grid for a case study are provided, which shows that simulations based on the monthly load profile have a significant reduction of 43% for energy sent to/from the grid compared to the detailed hourly simulation and an increase from 30% to 60% for self-consumption and self-sufficiency. These results show the importance of more granular modeling and also indicate mismatches of PV generation and HP load based on hourly simulation datasets. The back-calculation PV sizing algorithm combined with HP and thermal loads presented in this study exhibited robust performance. The results indicate this approach can be used to accelerate the solar electrification of heating and cooling to offset the use of fossil fuels in northern climates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c0acce89f4315f721734a85ee778a634bb07c6051d930c25707df89850920295","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
