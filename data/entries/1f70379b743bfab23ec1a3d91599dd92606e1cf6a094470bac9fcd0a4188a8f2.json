Ewing sarcoma tumors are driven by the fusion gene EWS/Fli1, and while these tumors are genetically homogenous, the transcriptional heterogeneity can lead to a variety of cellular processes including metastasis. In this study, we demonstrate that in Ewing sarcoma cells, the canonical Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway is heterogeneously activated in vitro and in vivo, correlating with hypoxia and EWS/Fli1 activity. Ewing sarcoma cells predominantly express β-Catenin on the cell membrane bound to CDH11, which can respond to exogenous Wnt ligands leading to the immediate activation of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling within a tumor. Knockdown of CDH11 leads to delayed and decreased response to exogenous Wnt ligand stimulation, and ultimately decreased metastatic propensity. Our findings strongly indicate that CDH11 is a key component of regulating Wnt//β-Catenin signaling heterogeneity within Ewing sarcoma tumors, and is a promising molecular target to alter Wnt//β-Catenin signaling in Ewing sarcoma patients.","author":"Ryota Shirai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1f70379b743bfab23ec1a3d91599dd92606e1cf6a094470bac9fcd0a4188a8f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
