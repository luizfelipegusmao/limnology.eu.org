These alloys have attracted considerable interest for their remarkable ability to maintain strength at high temperatures [<a href=\"#ozae044.654-B2\">2</a>]. However, only a few RHEA compositions are known to exhibit significant strain resistance exceeding 10% at room temperature. TiHfZrNb<sub>x</sub> is one example [<a href=\"#ozae044.654-B3\">3</a>]. With Nb in non-equimolar proportions, this alloy can improve the ductility with the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phase transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) [<a href=\"#ozae044.654-B4\">4</a>]. This alloy also has a high density of fine ω particles that are often observed in conventional Ti alloys. However, the role of hexagonal ω phase in ductility is not clear.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2a8350f64daacf741818ed36096ecf19c12aae9414713e0428f8ea7f56881f00","category":"Environment"}
