{"title":"Hemolymph metabolism of black soldier fly (Diptera: Stratiomyidae), response to different supplemental fungi","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae050/7666476?rss=1","date":1715040000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The black soldier fly, <span>Hermetia illucens</span> L. (Diptera: Stratiomyidae), is commonly used for organic waste recycling and animal feed production. However, the often inadequate nutrients in organic waste necessitate nutritional enhancement of black soldier fly larvae, e.g., by fungal supplementation of its diet. We investigated the amino acid composition of two fungi, <span>Candida tropicalis</span> (Castell.) Berkhout (Saccharomycetales: Saccharomycetaceae) and <span>Pichia kudriavzevii</span> Boidin, Pignal &amp; Besson (Saccharomycetales: Pichiaceae), from the black soldier fly gut, and commercial baker’s yeast, <span>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> Meyen <span>ex</span> E.C. Hansen (Saccharomycetales: Saccharomycetaceae), and their effects on larval growth and hemolymph metabolites in fifth-instar black soldier fly larvae. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was used to study the effect of fungal metabolites on black soldier fly larval metabolism. Amino acid analysis revealed significant variation among the fungi. Fungal supplementation led to increased larval body mass and differential metabolite accumulation. The three fungal species caused distinct metabolic changes, with each over-accumulating and down-accumulating various metabolites. We identified significant alteration of histidine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and glycerophospholipid metabolism in BSF larvae treated with <span>C. tropicalis</span>. Treatment with <span>P. kudriavzevii</span> affected histidine metabolism and citrate cycle metabolites, while both <span>P. kudriavzevii</span> and <span>S. cerevisiae</span> treatments impacted tyrosine metabolism. Treatment with <span>S. cerevisiae</span> resulted in down-accumulation of metabolites related to glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. This study suggests that adding fungi to the larval diet significantly affects black soldier fly larval metabolomics. Further research is needed to understand how individual amino acids and their metabolites contributed by fungi affect black soldier fly larval physiology, growth, and development, to elucidate the interaction between fungal nutrients and black soldier fly physiology.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"a4593ecf881287c68935f7e5c4ff4c28d2c3bae0a36228cc8c1c010dab37442e","category":"Environment"}
