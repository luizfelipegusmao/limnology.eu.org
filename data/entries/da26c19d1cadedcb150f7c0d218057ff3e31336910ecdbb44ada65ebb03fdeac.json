{"title":"Does Trauma Change the Way Individuals with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Deal with Positive Stimuli?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2189/v1","date":1725008050000,"content":"(1) Background: although current theories of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) had focused on depressed mood and intrusion, the mechanism through which depression increases the risk of PTSD remains unclear. Research has concentrated on the hyper-active negative valence system (NVS) (e.g., increased fear and threat responses), but a significant role for hypo-active positive valence system (PVS) (e.g., less neural activation towards rewards) was conceivable. (2) Methods: To investigate the implicit processing in a refugee’s sample, ratings of arousal, dominance, and valence for 60 IAPS pictures (positive, neutral, and negative) were collected from 42 individuals with probable PTSD, and 26 trauma-exposed individuals (M age = 28.49 years, SD = ± 7.78). (3) Results: ANOVAs revealed a main group effect (η2p = 0.379) on arousal, dominance, and valence dimensions, and pictures’ categories (η2p = 0.620). Participants with PTSD responded to unpleasant images with enhanced arousal and lower valence ratings compared with individuals without PTSD. Moreover, arousal ratings were negatively correlated with valence (r = - 0.709, p &amp;lt; 0.01). (4) Conclusions: Our findings supported evidence according to which PTSD origins a state of maladaptive hyperarousal and difficulties in regulating emotions. Positive stimuli are considered less pleasant providing evidence for a complementary involvement of NVS and PVS in PTSD development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da26c19d1cadedcb150f7c0d218057ff3e31336910ecdbb44ada65ebb03fdeac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
