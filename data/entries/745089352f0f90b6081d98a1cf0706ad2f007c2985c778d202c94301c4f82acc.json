{"title":"Improving aromatic higher alcohol acetates in wines by co‐fermentation of Pichia kluyveri and Saccharomyces cerevisiae: growth interaction and amino acid competition","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13519?af=R","date":1720851246000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Higher alcohol acetates (HAAs) are potent aroma-active esters that impart desirable fruity and floral aromas. However, the conversion of higher alcohol precursors into HAAs is extremely low in winemaking. To investigate the underlying yeast–yeast interaction on targeted improvement of aromatic HAAs, we evaluated fermentation activity, cell viability, amino acid consumption and HAA production when <i>Pichia kluyveri</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> were inoculated concurrently or sequentially.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p><i>Pichia kluyveri</i> PK-21 possessed the ability to survive and increased HAA level up to 5.2-fold in mixed fermentation. Such an increment may benefit from the efficient conversion of higher alcohol precursors into HAAs (&gt;27-fold higher than <i>S. cerevisiae</i>). During mixed fermentation, the two yeasts exhibited crucial interactions regarding cell growth and amino acid competition. <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> dominated over the co-inoculated <i>P. kluyveri</i> by efficient uptake of amino acids and biomass production. However, this dominance decreased in sequential fermentation, where <i>P. kluyveri</i> growth increased due to the consumption of preferred amino acids prior to <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that phenylalanine and aspartic acid may act as positive amino acids in boosting <i>P. kluyveri</i> growth and HAA production. Laboratory-scale winemaking validated the fermentation performance of <i>P. kluyveri</i> in sequential inoculum, resulting in a balanced aroma profile with enhanced floral and tropical fruity characteristics in the final wines.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study proposes a microbial, non-genetically engineered approach for targeted increase of HAA production in winemaking and the findings provide new insights into yeast–yeast interactions. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yueqi Li, \nLingbin Xu, \nFaisal Eudes Sam, \nAihua Li, \nKai Hu, \nYongsheng Tao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"745089352f0f90b6081d98a1cf0706ad2f007c2985c778d202c94301c4f82acc","category":"Environment"}
