The study focuses on three main objectives: (1) to propose strategies to enhance the tourism value of Pathum Thani, (2) to assess the satisfaction of tourists regarding the current logistics systems, and (3) to offer recommendations for the development of sustainable tourism logistics. Logistics management is a key element in tourism, involving the coordination of physical flow, such as the movement of tourists and services; information flow, which includes real-time travel details and guidance; and financial flow, ensuring seamless transactions for bookings and services. Efficient management of these flows is essential to improve tourist experiences, enhance the destination's appeal, and support long-term sustainability in the tourism industry.\n\tPathum Thani, located near Bangkok, holds potential as a significant tourist destination, with its rich cultural heritage, historical sites, natural reserves, and commercial attractions. However, despite its favorable location, the province faces major logistical challenges that affect tourist satisfaction. Public transportation systems are limited, and connectivity between key tourist sites is often inadequate. These inefficiencies can hinder tourists’ ability to fully enjoy what the province has to offer. In response to these issues, the research aimed to study and recommend strategies that would improve logistics management, thereby increasing both the convenience for tourists and the sustainability of tourism activities in the province.\n\tIn this study, data were collected through structured questionnaires distributed to 400 tourists currently visiting Pathum Thani. The focus of the survey was to evaluate their satisfaction levels with the province’s transportation, infrastructure, and overall logistics systems. The survey was designed to measure various factors such as the ease of transportation, the availability of clear signage and tourist information, the quality of infrastructure at tourist sites, and the environmental friendliness of the logistics systems in place. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as means, percentages, and standard deviations, as well as inferential statistics including t-tests and one-way ANOVA to examine the differences in satisfaction across various demographics.\n\tThe findings from this research revealed significant insights into the current state of tourism logistics in Pathum Thani. First, the analysis showed that 55% of tourists used private vehicles for transportation due to a lack of efficient public transportation options. This reliance on private transport reflects a clear gap in the availability of affordable and convenient public transport systems. Tourists also reported dissatisfaction with the connectivity between tourist attractions, which led to logistical difficulties during their visits. Specifically, on a 5-point satisfaction scale, transportation logistics scored an average of 3.5, indicating that tourists felt inconvenienced by the lack of comprehensive transport networks linking popular sites. Attractions like Bung Kum and Patumwanarom Park, which are more difficult to access, received lower satisfaction scores compared to easily accessible commercial venues such as Dream World and the National Science Museum.\n\tFurthermore, tourists expressed concerns about the lack of digital resources to aid in navigation and trip planning. Most respondents felt that more could be done to implement user-friendly apps or platforms that provide real-time information on public transport schedules, directions, and nearby amenities. This digital gap also contributed to the tourists’ reliance on private vehicles and decreased their overall satisfaction with their trip. The research findings underscored the need for better integration of digital tools, especially those that support multiple languages to cater to international tourists. By introducing such platforms, Pathum Thani could significantly improve the convenience of travel within the province.\n\tAnother key aspect of the research involved exploring how sustainable logistics practices could enhance both tourist experiences and environmental conservation. Over 60% of tourists surveyed expressed interest in eco-friendly travel options, with many indicating that they would prefer public transportation systems that reduce carbon emissions, such as electric buses. However, the lack of such options in Pathum Thani detracts from its image as a sustainable tourist destination. This highlights the importance of incorporating green transportation strategies, which not only align with global sustainability trends but also cater to the growing demand for environmentally responsible tourism.\n\tThe research concludes with several important recommendations based on the analysis of tourist feedback and logistical challenges. Firstly, the study advocates for the establishment of a comprehensive shuttle bus system that connects key tourist attractions. Such a system would reduce the reliance on private vehicles and provide tourists with a more convenient and cost-effective mode of transportation. Additionally, the introduction of electric buses would help Pathum Thani reduce its carbon footprint and attract environmentally conscious travelers. The creation of a multilingual digital platform offering real-time information about transportation, accommodation, and tourist services would further enhance the convenience for tourists, especially international visitors who may struggle with language barriers.\n\tIn conclusion, this research highlights the critical role that logistics management plays in the tourism sector, particularly in ensuring both tourist satisfaction and sustainability. The findings demonstrate that Pathum Thani has significant potential to enhance its appeal as a tourist destination through the implementation of effective logistics strategies. By improving transportation networks, introducing green logistics solutions, and leveraging digital technologies, the province can offer a more seamless and satisfying experience for tourists while promoting environmentally responsible tourism. The study’s recommendations provide a comprehensive framework for policymakers and tourism stakeholders to improve logistics management in Pathum Thani, making it a more attractive and sustainable destination for both domestic and international visitors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93f14981e4edb7fc25c177b1ce297aff11accee9e80706f4af50f77504489f2b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
