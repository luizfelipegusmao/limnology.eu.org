{"title":"Unveiling metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease: Knowledge gaps and attitudes among Lebanese university students","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306825","date":1722607200000,"content":"<p>by Mohamad Abdelkhalik, Samah Al Tawil, Adam El Fouani, Nour Allakiss, Lama Mattar, Wissam H. Faour, Rajaa Chatila</p>\r\nBackground <p>Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a rapidly growing global health problem. Despite its growing incidence and potential for significant repercussions, MAFLD is still widely misunderstood and underdiagnosed.</p> Aim <p>The purpose of this study was to investigate MAFLD-related knowledge, attitudes, and risk profiles among university students aged 17 to 26.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional study with 406 university students in Lebanon, equally distributed among males and females, was conducted using a questionnaire that includes demographics, medical information, dietary habits, physical activity, and MAFLD-related knowledge and attitudes.</p> Results <p>The findings demonstrated a significant lack of knowledge regarding MAFLD, with more than half of participants (54.7%) having no prior knowledge of the illness. Students exhibited unhealthy lifestyle behaviors such as smoking (68%), insufficient physical exercise (44.1%), and poor food habits (52.5%). Having a family history of heart disease, personal history of diabetes mellitus, a balanced diet and prior knowledge of the disease were associated with a higher knowledge score (p&lt;0.05). A higher attitude score existed among those who have a personal or family history of chronic diseases and those who have a prior negative impression about the disease, prior knowledge of the disease, and those who are physically active (p&lt;0.05).</p> Conclusion <p>Despite knowledge gaps, university students in Lebanon have, in general, an appropriate and positive attitude towards MAFLD. We recommend the introduction of focused educational interventions to address the necessity of lifestyle changes among university students and the community as a whole. Developing comprehensive MAFLD prevention methods requires future studies in different age groups and demographics</p>","author":"Mohamad Abdelkhalik","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c0d94a92e3424a69906b7e8ce8130da406f06904552f21bc38ffea7a6a4ea85a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
