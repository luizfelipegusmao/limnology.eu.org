{"title":"Analysis of Hospital Safety in Fall Prevention in the Elderly","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1277/v1","date":1721111243000,"content":"This study analyzed the risk of falls in the elderly and the safety of the environment in a teaching hospital in Brazil. The Morse Falls Scale was used to stratify the risk of falls in 45 hospitalized elderly individuals, and a checklist was used to analyze the hospital environment. The analysis was based on the chi-square test and multiple regression. The moderate risk of falls was predominant (51.1%). The variable age group (p-value = 0.024) showed statistical evidence of association with the risk of falls. However, the multiple regression analysis showed no difference between the age groups and the risk situation for falls. The hospital wards showed an adequate arrangement of furniture, but some aspects had inadequacies, such as objects in the corridors, non-functional bells in some beds, and inadequacy of the toilet bowls in terms of the recommended height, the absence of non-slip flooring and the support bar in some bathrooms. In conclusion, the moderate risk of falls among the elderly and the adequacy of the hospital environment to technical standards were evident, with the exception of failures in the emergency communication system and sanitary installation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49f864d8f0bbd52291dbdf197a88d936214508148681ea423772e12904f626e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
