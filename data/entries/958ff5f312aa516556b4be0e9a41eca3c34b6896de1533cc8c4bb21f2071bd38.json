{"title":"Optimization of Cassava (Manihot esculenta) Effluent Methani-Zation by Organic Nitrogen Supply in Mesophilic Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0285/v1","date":1720000527000,"content":"This study aims to explore anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) of cassava (EUM) and poultry (FP) ef-fluents using one inoculum-substrate ratio (30%) and three EUM vs FP substrate composition ra-tios (25 :75, 50 :50 and 75 :25). The AcoD process was therefore designed for 20 L batch digesters, under mesophilic conditions, with less than 5% total solids for 66 days. The results showed that EUMs were highly resistant to degradation, while FPs were the most easily degradable. Kinetic analysis indicated specific organic matter reduction rates of 0.28% per day for EUM and 0.76% per day for FP. EUM alone produced 45.47 mL/g MOV, while the 50 :50 substrate produced 1184.60 mL/g MOV. The main factors contributing to EUM inefficiency were the inability to tame acidic conditions, and the accumulation of volatile fatty acids. AcoD produced 23 to 50 times more methane than EUM alone, 2 to 5 times more than FP alone and 2 to 4 times more than ino-culum. Consequently, AcoD of both types of waste had a positive effect on gas formation in terms of quantity and quality, with CH4 content increasing from around 2 to 75% as a function of organic nitrogen input","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"958ff5f312aa516556b4be0e9a41eca3c34b6896de1533cc8c4bb21f2071bd38","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
