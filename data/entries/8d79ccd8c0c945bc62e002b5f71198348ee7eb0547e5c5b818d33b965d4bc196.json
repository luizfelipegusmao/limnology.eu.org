Selecting the right tool steel for these molds is crucial for ensuring part quality, production efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Given the comprehensive requirements of plastic molds, surface finishing is of particular interest since the injected plastic part can replicate any detail (as well as defects) from the mold surface. Therefore, several aspects of mold finishing are relevant, especially those related to manufacturing conditions—machining, grinding, polishing, and texturing—as well as the quality of the tool steel, concerning microstructure homogeneity and the absence of non-metallic inclusions (cleanliness) [<a href=\"#ozae044.100-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8d79ccd8c0c945bc62e002b5f71198348ee7eb0547e5c5b818d33b965d4bc196","category":"Environment"}
