The current study aimed to evaluate the immunoregulatory function of TNFα1 on gut barrier in a novel hybrid fish (WR), which was produced by crossing white crucian carp (<i>Carassius cuvieri</i>, ♀) with red crucian carp (<i>Carassius auratus</i> red var, ♂). In this study, WR<i>-tnfα1</i> sequence was identified, and a high-level expression was detected in the intestine. Elevated levels of WR<i>-tnfα1</i> expressions were detected in immune-related tissues and cultured fish cells on stimulation. The appearance of vacuolization and submucosal rupture was observed in TNFα1-treated midgut of WR, along with elevated levels of goblet cell atrophy, whereas no significant changes were detected in most expressions of tight-junction genes and mucin genes. In contrast, WR receiving gut perfusion with WR-TNFα1 showed a remarkable decrease in antioxidant status in midgut, whereas the expression levels of apoptotic genes and redox responsive genes increased sharply. These results suggested that TNFα1 could exhibit a detrimental effect on antioxidant defense and immune regulation in the midgut of WR.</p>","author":"Ke‐Xin Li, \nNing‐Xia Xiong, \nJin‐Fang Huang, \nShi‐Yun Li, \nJie Ou, \nFei Wang, \nSheng‐Wei Luo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"417e90c5e09f5c3eca7a74af45810ff98f26454a3c18b050c641fcf0a1e5fd5f","category":"Environment"}
