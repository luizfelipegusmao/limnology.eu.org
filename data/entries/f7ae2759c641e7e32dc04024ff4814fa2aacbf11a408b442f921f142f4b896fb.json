KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, is home to 11.5 million people and suffers a burden of tuberculosis disease that is among the highest in the world. The last tuberculin survey in the province was undertaken in 1979. We performed a tuberculin skin test survey nested within a demographic and health household surveillance programme in Northern KwaZulu-Natal. We enrolled children aged between six and eight years of age attending primary schools in this community. Mixture analysis was used to determine tuberculin skin test thresholds and the Annual Risk of Tuberculous Infection derived from age at testing and infection prevalence. The Community Infection Ratio, a measure of the relative importance of within-household and community transmission, was calculated from data on tuberculin positivity disaggregated by household tuberculosis contact. Between June and December 2013, we obtained tuberculin skin test results on 1240 children. Mixture analysis proved unstable, suggesting two potential thresholds for test positivity. Using a threshold of ≥10mm or treating all non zero reactions as positive yielded estimates of the Annual Risk of Tuberculous Infection of 1.7% (1.4–2.1%) or 2.4% (2.0–3.0%). Using the same thresholds and including children reported to be receiving TB treatment as cases, resulted in estimates of 2.0% (1.6–2.5%) or 2.7% (2.2–3.3%). The Community Infection Ratio was 0.58 (0.33–1.01). The force of infection in this community is lower than that observed in Western Cape province, South Africa, but higher than that observed in community settings in most other parts of the world. Children in this community are commonly infected with <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> outside the home. Interventions to interrupt transmission are urgently needed.","author":"Tom A.
