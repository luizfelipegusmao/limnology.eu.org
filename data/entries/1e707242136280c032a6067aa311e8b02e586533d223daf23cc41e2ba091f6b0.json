{"title":"Ultrastructural changes in cardiac and skeletal myoblasts following <i>in vitro</i> exposure to monensin, salinomycin, and lasalocid","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311046","date":1727272800000,"content":"<p>by Danielle Henn, Antonia V. Lensink, Christo J. Botha</p>\r\n\r\nCarboxylic ionophores are polyether antibiotics used in production animals as feed additives, with a wide range of benefits. However, ionophore toxicosis often occurs as a result of food mixing errors or extra-label use and primarily targets the cardiac and skeletal muscles of livestock. The ultrastructural changes induced by 48 hours of exposure to 0.1 Î¼M monensin, salinomycin, and lasalocid in cardiac (H9c2) and skeletal (L6) myoblasts <i>in vitro</i> were investigated using transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Ionophore exposure resulted in condensed mitochondria, dilated Golgi apparatus, and cytoplasmic vacuolization which appeared as indentations on the myoblast surface. Ultrastructurally, it appears that both apoptotic and necrotic myoblasts were present after exposure to the ionophores. Apoptotic myoblasts contained condensed chromatin and apoptotic bodies budding from their surface. Necrotic myoblasts had disrupted plasma membranes and damaged cytoplasmic organelles. Of the three ionophores, monensin induced the most alterations in myoblasts of both cell lines.","author":"Danielle Henn","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1e707242136280c032a6067aa311e8b02e586533d223daf23cc41e2ba091f6b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
