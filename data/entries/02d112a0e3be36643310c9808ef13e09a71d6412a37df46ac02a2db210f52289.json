Scaling up mental health (MH) services places new resource demands on health systems in crises-affected settings and raises questions about how to provide equitable MH services for refugee and host populations. Our study investigates barriers, facilitators, and proposed solutions to MH financing and access for Lebanese populations and Syrian refugees in Lebanon, a protracted crisis setting. We collected qualitative data via 73 interviews and 3 focus group discussions. Participants were purposively selected from: (i) national, United Nations and NGO stakeholders; (ii) frontline MH service providers; (iii) insurance company representatives; (iv) Lebanese and Syrian adults and parents of children aged 12–17 years using MH services. Data were analysed using inductive and deductive approaches. Our results highlight challenges facing Lebanon’s system of financing MH care in the face of ongoing multiple crises, including inequitable coverage, dependence on external humanitarian funds, and risks associated with short-term funding and their impact on sustainability of services. The built environment presents additional challenges to individuals trying to navigate, access and use existing MH services, and the social environment and service provider factors enable or hinder individuals accessing MH care. Registered Syrian refugees have better financial coverage to secondary MH care than Lebanese populations. However, given the economic crisis, both populations are facing similar challenges in paying for and accessing MH care at primary health care (PHC) level. Multiple crises in Lebanon have exacerbated challenges in financing MH care, dependence on external humanitarian funds, and risks and sustainability issues associated with short-term funding. Urgent reforms are needed to Lebanon’s health financing system, working with government and external donors to equitably and efficiently finance and scale up MH care with a focus on PHC, and to reduce inequities in MH service coverage between Lebanese and Syrian refugee populations.","author":"Rozane El Masri","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"02d112a0e3be36643310c9808ef13e09a71d6412a37df46ac02a2db210f52289","category":"Environment"}
