The Kuleshov effect, a famous example of how editing influences viewers’ emotional perception, was initially proposed to support montage theory through the Kuleshov experiment. This effect, which has since been recognized as a manifestation of point-of-view (POV) editing practices, posits that the emotional interpretation of neutral facial expressions is influenced by the accompanying emotional scene in a face-scene-face sequence. However, concerns persist regarding the validity of previous studies, often employing inauthentic film materials like static images, leaving the question of its existence in authentic films unanswered. This study addresses these concerns by utilizing authentic films in two experiments. In Experiment 1, multiple film clips were captured under the guidance of a professional film director and seamlessly integrated into authentic film sequences. 59 participants viewed these face-scene-face film sequences and were tasked with rating the valence and emotional intensity of neutral faces. The findings revealed that the accompanying fearful or happy scenes significantly influence the interpretation of emotion on neutral faces, eliciting perceptions of negative or positive emotions from the neutral face. These results affirm the existence of the Kuleshov effect within authentic films. In Experiment 2, 31 participants rated the valence and arousal of neutral faces while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The behavioral results confirm the Kuleshov effect in the MRI scanner, while the neural data identify neural correlates that support its existence at the neural level. These correlates include the cuneus, precuneus, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, post cingulate gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and insula. These findings also underscore the contextual framing inherent in the Kuleshov effect. Overall, the study integrates film theory and cognitive neuroscience experiments, providing robust evidence supporting the existence of the Kuleshov effect through both subjective ratings and objective neuroimaging measurements. This research also contributes to a deeper understanding of the impact of film editing on viewers’ emotional perception from the contemporary POV editing practices and neurocinematic perspective, advancing the knowledge of film cognition.","author":"Zhengcao Cao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0999bde836f7294211e1dffd5743c607a90ba93707a01fe84e7f2ef535aa167e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
