{"title":"A Multi-step Data Assimilation Framework to Investigate the Effect of Measurement Uncertainty in the Reduction of Water Distribution Network Model Errors","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11269-024-03809-9","date":1719792000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Water distribution network (WDN) models are a common decision support tool for understanding the behavior and performance of WDNs, aiding in the planning and management of WDN systems. The increasing availability of real-time data has recently promoted the exploration of Data Assimilation (DA) techniques to improve these models. However, flow, pressure and demand data are uncertain, particularly due to sensor characteristics such as precision and noise. An open question is to what extent DA can still improve hydraulic models when the data used to this end is uncertain. This paper proposes a three-step Ensemble Kalman Filter based DA approach for WDNs (3-EnKF-WDN), building on previous approaches, and advancing in two main fronts: the use of extended period simulation, and the use of pressure-dependent demand (PDD) analysis. Different scenarios considering uncertain sensor data, with varied precision and noise, are applied to two networks of different sizes, representative of real-world WDNs. The computational demand of the 3-EnKF-WDN method is also assessed. Results show that increasing sensor’s precision and decreasing the noise in state measurements reduce model error, as expected. However, we also found that model errors: 1) are reduced more effectively by using 3-EnKF-WDN than by increasing sensors’ precision; 2) are not reduced if certain noise thresholds are surpassed; 3) can be reduced without assimilating demand data if the WDNs are fully monitored with head sensors in all the nodes and flow sensors in all the links.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"55746fbab3d2d7f0b7161fa393a1df5b65749a06778e5594333696f064cb60b7","category":"Environment"}
