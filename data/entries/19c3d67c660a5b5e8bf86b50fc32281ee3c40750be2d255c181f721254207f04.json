Our proof appeals to Senâ€™s Impossibility Theorem and an extract from a proof of the same theorem, that is available in an earlier paper of this author.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"19c3d67c660a5b5e8bf86b50fc32281ee3c40750be2d255c181f721254207f04","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
