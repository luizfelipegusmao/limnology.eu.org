{"title":"Comparing the migration behavior and survival of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) smolts","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15749?af=R","date":1713244817000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Many organisms rely on migrations between habitats to maximize lifetime fitness, but these migrations can be risky due to a suite of factors. In anadromous salmonids, the smolt migration from fresh water to sea is a critical life stage, during which smolts can experience high mortality from multiple sources. This study investigated the migratory behavior and survival of Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) and anadromous brown trout (<i>Salmo trutta</i>) smolts during their seaward migration using acoustic telemetry between March and May 2021. Due to the extinction of wild salmon in the River Gudenaa after the construction of the Tange hydropower plant, this study used hatchery-reared salmon originating from a nearby Danish river. A total of 75 hatchery-reared salmon smolts, 75 hatchery-reared trout smolts, and 75 wild trout smolts were tagged with acoustic transmitters and released into River Gudenaa, Denmark. The downstream movements of tagged fish were monitored using acoustic receivers deployed in the river and fjord. Hatchery-reared trout initiated migration first, followed by hatchery-reared salmon, with wild trout being the last to migrate. There was no difference in riverine progression rates among the three smolt groups, but noticeable differences emerged once in the fjord: trout (wild and hatchery) slowed down, whereas hatchery-reared salmon maintained their speed. Riverine migration was predominantly nocturnal for all smolts; however, daytime migration increased at the fjord arrays. Day-of-year significantly influenced diurnal patterns in the river and fjord, where daytime migration increased later in the year. Hatchery-reared salmon and wild trout had reasonably good overall survival from river to sea entry (≥66%), whereas hatchery-reared trout had poor survival (c.26%). The fjord was the major bottleneck for survival of hatchery-reared trout. We found no strong evidence for differences in progression rate or diurnal patterns between wild and hatchery-reared trout to explain the lower survival. This study demonstrates that salmon and trout differ in their life-history strategy already in the post-smolt phase, and that stocking is a sub-optimal strategy to aid wild populations.</p>","author":"Lene Klubben Sortland, \nKim Aarestrup, \nKim Birnie‐Gauvin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"58b8abe2fc71f46b7cfcf78db107fb3295baba8d75d32a1674e558df14b08dd9","category":"Environment"}
