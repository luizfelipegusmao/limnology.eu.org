{"title":"Prosapia bicincta (Hemiptera: Cercopidae) abundance, plant associations, and impacts on groundcover in Hawaiʻi Island rangelands","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/5/870/7704522?rss=1","date":1719878400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The twolined spittlebug, <span>Prosapia bicincta</span> (Say), is a major economic pest of forage grass and turfgrass. <span>Prosapia bicincta</span> was first detected in rangelands on Hawaiʻi Island in 2016 and has since spread to an estimated 72,000 ha in the North and South Kona districts. This study aimed to quantify <span>P. bicincta</span> abundance, plant associations, and impacts on groundcover over time. Monthly surveys of <span>P. bicincta</span> nymphs and adults were conducted from February 2018 to September 2022 along 17 established 100-m transects at 4 ranches located in Kona, Hawaiʻi Island, spanning an elevation gradient from 519 to 1,874 m above sea level (a.s.l.). Monitoring revealed <span>P. bicincta</span> occurs from 519 to 1,679 m a.s.l., primarily in Kikuyu grass (<span>Cenchrus clandestinus</span> (Hochst. ex Chiov.)) Morrone (Poales: Poaceae) pastures. Peaks in <span>P. bicincta</span> abundance coincided with the wet season, with most activity occurring from April to October and little to no activity between November and March. Mid elevation (1,000–1,300 m) transects had significantly higher mean <span>P. bicincta</span> abundance (126 nymphs/m<sup>2</sup>) relative to low (500–999 m) (64 nymphs/m<sup>2</sup>) and high elevations (&gt;1,300 m) (20 nymphs/m<sup>2</sup>). Sites with the highest abundance of <span>P. bicincta</span> were also associated with the greatest decrease in mean grass cover (30%) and were replaced by forbs, bare ground, and shrubs. Grasses accounted for 72% of the total <span>P. bicincta</span> detections, with the remaining plants comprised of legumes (16%), sedges (6%), and forbs (6%). Twenty new <span>P. bicincta</span> plant associations were found. This information will help improve the effectiveness of management to suppress populations below economic thresholds.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"282c6f9899609c8be58d56cd11cea53f385a0fb77726958f86357a025b92a213","category":"Environment"}
