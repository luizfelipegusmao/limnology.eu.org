The investigation involves an examination of the flow pattern in the spouted bed to obtain relevant data, followed by an optimization of the entire drying process. The drying process of green soybeans was simulated using SolidWorks and ANSYS Fluent software, based on the principles of computational fluid dynamics.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The simulation test results showed that the simulation outcomes were consistent with the experimental data. The optimal conditions for the process of green soybean infrared-assisted spouted bed drying were found to be an inlet speed of 8 m/s and a temperature of 50 °C with the wavelength and power settings of the infrared board at 10 μm and 500 W, respectively.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The simulation method selected in this article, based on gas–solid two-phase flow dynamics, is feasible for green soybean infrared-assisted spouted bed drying process. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Zhiyun Hou, \nXu Duan, \nYike Zhao, \nGuangyue Ren, \nLinlin Li, \nWeiwei Cao, \nZhenbin Liu, \nWenchao Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"845c6d6650877a24186ef7809efe3e508f89b4ce4e0327cbfdf99c76207fbf13","category":"Environment"}
