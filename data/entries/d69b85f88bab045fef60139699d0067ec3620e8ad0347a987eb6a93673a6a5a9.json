Teaghrelin, a unique bioactive compound in some oolong tea varieties, has been demonstrated to protect SH-SY5Y cells against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium induced neurotoxicity by binding to the ghrelin receptor to activate the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway. In this study, an animal model was established using a neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a byproduct of a prohibited drug, to evaluate the oral efficacy of teaghrelin on PD by monitoring motor dysfunction of mice in open field, pole, and bean walking tests. The results showed that MPTP-induced motor dysfunction of mice was significantly attenuated by teaghrelin supplementation. Tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter protein were found reduced in the striatum and midbrain of MPTP-treated mice, and significantly mitigated by teaghrelin supplementation. Furthermore, teaghrelin administration enhanced mitophagy and mitochondria biogenesis, which maintained cell homeostasis and prevented the accumulation of αSyn and apoptosis-related proteins. It seemed that teaghrelin protected dopaminergic neurons in MPTP-treated mice by increasing PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy and AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α-mediated mitochondria biogenesis, highlighting its potential therapeutic role in maintaining dopaminergic neurons function in PD.
