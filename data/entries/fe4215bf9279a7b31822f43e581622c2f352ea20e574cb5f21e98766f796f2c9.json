{"title":"Perfect Crossed Andreev Reflection in the Staggered Graphene/Superconductor/Periodic Line Defect Superlattice Junctions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1239/v1","date":1729086630000,"content":"We study the crossed Andreev reflection and the nonlocal transport in the staggered graphene/superconductor/periodic line defect superlattice (LDGSL) junctions. The staggered pseudospin potential in the left graphene electrode suppress the local Andreev reflection, while the elastic cotunneling of K′ valley electrons is inhibited due to the exclusive rightward motion of K valley electrons in the right LDGSL electrode, thereby enabling the realization of perfect intravalley crossed Andreev reflection for incident electrons from the K′ valley. Meanwhile, the intravalley elastic cotunneling occurs while both local Andreev reflection and crossed Andreev reflection are completely eliminated for incident electrons in the K valley. Furthermore, the probability of intervalley crossed Andreev reflection scattering is significantly lower than that of intravalley CAR scattering across a broad range of incident angles and electron energies. Our results are helpful for designing the flexible and high-efficiency Cooper pair splitter based on the valley degree of freedom.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe4215bf9279a7b31822f43e581622c2f352ea20e574cb5f21e98766f796f2c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
