{"title":"Environmental Stress and Small Heat Shock Proteins in Selected Animals: A Comprehensive Review of Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1567/v1","date":1729504916000,"content":"Insects, nematodes, and aquatic animals face several biotic and abiotic stressors that can significantly affect their fitness – specifically damaging their cellular proteins' competent functional nature. In response, they have evolved sophisticated stress-responsive mechanisms. Certain endogenous proteins, known as small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), serve to maintain the stability and function of proteins under stress. Since the identification of the first sHSPs, an increasing number of sHSPs, mainly due to the new robust sequencing tools, continue to be identified and reported to play a critical role in the organism’s response to stress. This review explores and summarizes the contributions of the sHSPs implicated in stress response. Understanding their function is crucial for advancing our knowledge in agricultural pest management, climate change adaptation, and biotechnology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1747ef5d4677c535bba8b14ecf79f7ba19b2a13ccd641c01d54634dd2a7aff20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
