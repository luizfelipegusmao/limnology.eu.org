{"title":"261 Vitamin A administration in pregnant cows or newborn calves: Growth performance and carcass traits","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/86/7757146?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Vitamin A (VA) injection on the growth performance and carcass traits of Nellore × Angus crossbred steers and heifers. For that, the same sire inseminated Nellore cows from two artificial insemination (AI) groups were randomly assigned to one of three treatments at 250 d of gestation: no VA injection (Control); VA injection in pregnant cows at 250 d of gestation (VAcow; 2,000,000 IU single dose); VA injection in newborn calves at birth and 60 d of age (VAcalf; 200,000 IU each dose). Cow-calf pairs were kept in the same paddock, and calves received creep-feeding supplementation from 90 d of age to weaning. After weaning, steers and heifers [n = 36; body weight (BW) 213 ± 25.7 kg] were stratified by treatment and BW and allotted into 16 pens. After 207 d of feeding (77 d of growing diet + 130 d of finishing diet), steers and heifers were slaughtered at a commercial abattoir. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS 9.4 with fixed effects of VA injection, sex, and VA injection*sex interaction. The random effects were animal, AI group, and cow parity. Average daily gain before weaning (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) and final BW in the finishing phase were greater (<span>P</span> = 0.04) in VAcow steers compared with heifers from all treatments (Table 1). Vitamin A had a positive impact on weaning BW of male calves and a negative impact on heifers (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). There was no treatment difference (<span>P</span> = 0.35) in feedlot average daily gain (ADG), but steers had greater (<span>P</span> = 0.03) ADG compared with heifers. Moreover, VAcow steers had greater dry matter intake (DMI) in the feedlot (<span>P</span> = 0.04) compared with other treatments, and there was no effect of VA on DMI of heifers. On the other hand, feedlot feed efficiency tended to be greater (<span>P</span> = 0.07) in Control steers compared with other treatments, with no VA effect on heifers too. The ribeye area was greater (<span>P</span> = 0.04) in VAcow steers than in Control steers and heifers from all treatments. Intramuscular fat content was greater (<span>P</span> = 0.04) in VAcow steers than in Control and VAcalf steers. However, there was no effect of VA on heifers and VAcow steers. In addition, VAcow treatment tended (<span>P</span> = 0.08) to increase backfat thickness. In conclusion, VA injection in pregnant cows can be a strategy to improve marbling in steers, but there is no effect on intramuscular fat in heifers. Additionally, VA injection in pregnant cows produced intramuscular content in beef of steers, similar to heifers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"332ccce974380ff78d1556317fe09a2e234e1fc4cda7a075eb8eb4e5cea302b9","category":"Environment"}
