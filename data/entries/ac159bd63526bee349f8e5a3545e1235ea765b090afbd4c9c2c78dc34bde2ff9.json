However, there is currently no easy, flexible, and fast adaptive ELISA-based system for testing antibodies directed against new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. In this study, we utilized the tANCHOR protein display system that provides a cell surface decorated with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) to monitor specific antibodies derived from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and vaccinated individuals directed against it. To test sera from vaccinees or convalescent individuals, only the RBD coding sequence needs to be cloned in the tANCHOR vector system and transfected into HeLa cells. Time-consuming protein expression, isolation, and purification followed by coating assay plates are not necessary. With this technique, the immune evasion of new SARS-CoV-2 variants from current vaccination regimes can be examined quickly and reliably.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"ac159bd63526bee349f8e5a3545e1235ea765b090afbd4c9c2c78dc34bde2ff9","category":"Environment"}
