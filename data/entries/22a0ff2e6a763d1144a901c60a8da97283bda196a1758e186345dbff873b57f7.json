{"title":"Comparison of Novel Hematological Biomarkers in Alopecia Areata and Other Not-Cicatricial Alopecia: A Retrospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1619/v1","date":1726824731000,"content":"Introduction &amp; Objectives: Blood cells-(BC)count derived parameters have been inves-tigated in systemic inflammation, cancer, and various cutaneous diseases. Little is known about their usefulness in trichology, especially as prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers. We conducted a retrospective study on patients with not-cicatricial alopecia to assess differences in BC-count. Materials &amp; Methods: Patients with alopecia areata (AA), telogen effluvium (TE), androgenic alopecia (AGA), psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) were included in the study. Baseline complete BC-count and derived parameters (i.e. NLR, PLR, MLR, SII; PIV) were recorded and analyzed for each patient and at different timepoints for AA patients on systemic agents. Results: 170 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. BC-count and derived values were similar across the not-cicatricial alopecia groups, while general differences were observed compared to psoriasis and HS. TE displayed a closer inflammatory signature to psoriasis with respect to CRP, NLR, MLR, SII and PIV. We also found a significant reduction in RBCs in severe versus patchy-AA and an increase of SII in acute versus chronic AA. Modulation of platelet number and volume could be used as therapeutic marker in AA. Conclusions: In our experience, the BC-count and its derived parameters could represent potential tools in AA and TE.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22a0ff2e6a763d1144a901c60a8da97283bda196a1758e186345dbff873b57f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
