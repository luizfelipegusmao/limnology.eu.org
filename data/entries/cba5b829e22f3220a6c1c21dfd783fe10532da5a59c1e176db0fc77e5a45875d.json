{"title":"Singular Value Decomposition of Elliptic Quaternion Matrices: Theory and Algorithms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2598/v1","date":1722431807000,"content":"In this study, we obtained results for the computation of eigen-pairs, singular value decomposition, pseudo-inverse, and the least square problem for elliptic quaternion matrices. Moreover, we established algorithms based on these results and provided illustrative numerical experiments to substantiate the accuracy of our conclusions. In the experiments, it was observed that the p-value in the algebra of elliptic quaternions and elliptic numbers directly affects the performance of the problem under consideration. Selecting the optimal p-value for problem-solving and the elliptic behavior of many physical systems make this number system advantageous in applied sciences.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cba5b829e22f3220a6c1c21dfd783fe10532da5a59c1e176db0fc77e5a45875d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
