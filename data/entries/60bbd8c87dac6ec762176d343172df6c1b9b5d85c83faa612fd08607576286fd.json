Meanwhile, reported methods for TR cryo-EM either use microfluidic channels for efficient rapid premixing and spraying onto the grid, at the cost of significant sample usage per experiment [<a href=\"#ozae044.356-B1\">1</a>], or employ precision robotics for precise control of time of flight of the grid and pL volume dispensers for dispensing multiple samples that mix on the grid enroute ethane, albeit with inefficient mixing [<a href=\"#ozae044.356-B2\">2</a>]. Further, these custom systems are difficult to build.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"60bbd8c87dac6ec762176d343172df6c1b9b5d85c83faa612fd08607576286fd","category":"Environment"}
