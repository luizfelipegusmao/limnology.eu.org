{"title":"Factors Affecting Awassi Sheep Weight and Breeding Strategies in Arid Environments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0211/v1","date":1727935438000,"content":"This research provides an in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of sheep farming, with a particular focus on the Awassi breed in the harsh environments of the Middle East. Investigations were conducted at the Fjaj sheep station in Jordan, with emphasis on how various factors, including lambing type, lamb sex, parity, age at lambing, and the ram affect the weight characteristics of 2,263 records. Advanced statistical models, both fixed and mixed were employed to estimate genetic and breeding values, particularly in relation to the number of lambs per ram. The findings underscore the crucial role that both genetic and environmental factors play towards improving weigh traits and overall flock performance. Similar strategies may be effective in other breeds and in other regions with diverse environmental conditions. The study concludes that when farmers prioritize selective breeding and environmental management they can significantly enhance weight traits, boost profitability, and achieve sustainable economic success in sheep farming.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"14fc4f551843f629a686e8d3bb80d200be303f205dd76bf39e0135477121c8a3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
