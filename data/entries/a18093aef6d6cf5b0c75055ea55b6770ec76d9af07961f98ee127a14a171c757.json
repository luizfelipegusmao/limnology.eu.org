{"title":"Aging Mechanism of Mn-based Prussian Blue Cathode Material by Synchrotron 2D X-ray Fluorescence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1039/v1","date":1710760875000,"content":"The aging mechanism of 10% and 30% nickel substituted manganese hexacyanoferrate cathode material in aqueous zinc-ion batteries has been explored through the advanced synchrotron-based two-dimensional x-ray fluorescence technique. Thanks to the two-dimension modality, not only the metal concentration dynamics throughout the entire electrodes was followed during the aging process, but their spatial distribution was also revealed, suggesting the route of the material transformation. The dissolution of Mn and Ni, and the penetration of Zn inside the framework, alongside the Mn aggregations outside the hexacyanoferrate framework were detected. Additionally, the possibility of conducting x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements on the regions of interest made it possible to explore the chemical state of each metal, and furthermore, synchrotron-based powder x-ray diffraction demonstrated the gradual structural modification in 30% Ni-containing sample series, in terms of the different phase formation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a18093aef6d6cf5b0c75055ea55b6770ec76d9af07961f98ee127a14a171c757","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
