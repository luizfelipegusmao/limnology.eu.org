{"title":"Ketogenic Interventions in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Comprehensive Review of Current Evidence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0919/v1","date":1720666349000,"content":"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the development and progression of multiple renal cysts, leading to progressive renal function decline. To date, the only approved treatment for this condition is able to slow down the loss of annual renal function, without stopping the disease progression. Furthermore, this therapy is approved only for patients with rapid disease progression and its compliance is problematic because of the impact of this drug on quality of life. The recent literature suggests that cystic cells are subject to metabolic dysregulation in the glucose pathway (Warburg Effect). This finding paved the way for new lines of research targeting potential therapeutic interventions for ADPKD. In particular, this review highlights the latest studies on the use of ketosis, through ketogenic dietary interventions (daily calorie restriction, intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding, and ketogenic diets), as a potential strategy for patients with ADPKD, and the possible involvement of microbiota in the ketogenic interventionsâ€™ effect.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be0e75ad0e33b6446dd3578e1832f214ff9e554a9c82802d8ebf087d5e104f83","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
