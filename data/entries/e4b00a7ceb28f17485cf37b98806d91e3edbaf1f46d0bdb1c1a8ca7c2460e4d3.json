{"title":"Enhancing Indoor Thermal Comfort with Vertical Greenery: A Simulation Study on Heavyweight Walls in Mediterranean Climates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0702/v1","date":1723192905000,"content":"This study investigates the impact of vertical greenery systems (VGS) applied to heavyweight walls on indoor thermal conditions in a building module situated in the Mediterranean climate of Catania, Italy. Using dynamic simulations in TRNSYS, the research compares the thermal behavior of walls constructed from hollow clay blocks (Poroton) and lava stone blocks with a lightweight wall setup already in place at the University of Catania. The primary focus is on evaluating the VGS’s effect on reducing peak inner surface temperatures and moderating heat flux fluctuations entering the building. The findings indicate that adding a vertical greenery layer to heavyweight walls can decrease the peak inner surface temperature by up to 1.0°C compared to the same wall without vegetation. However, the greenery’s impact on mitigating heat flux fluctuations is less pronounced than in the case of the lightweight wall. This research underscores the potential of green facades in enhancing indoor thermal comfort in regions with climates similar to the Mediterranean, providing valuable insights for sustainable building design and urban planning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4b00a7ceb28f17485cf37b98806d91e3edbaf1f46d0bdb1c1a8ca7c2460e4d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
