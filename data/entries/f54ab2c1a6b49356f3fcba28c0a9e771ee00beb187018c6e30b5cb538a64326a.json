{"title":"First Derivative Approximations and Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0713/v1","date":1725918009000,"content":"In this paper we consider constructions of first derivative approximations using the generating function. The weights of the approximations contain the powers of a parameter whose modulus is less than one. The values of the initial weights are determined, and the convergence and order of the approximations are proved. The paper discusses applications of approximations of first derivative for numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations and proposes an algorithm for fast computation of the numerical solution. Proofs of the convergence and accuracy of the numerical solutions are presented and the performance of the numerical methods considered is compared with the Euler method. The main goal of constructing approximations for integer-order derivatives of this type is their application in deriving high-order approximations for fractional derivatives, whose weights have specific properties. The paper proposes the construction of an approximation for the fractional derivative and its application for numerically solving fractional differential equations. The theoretical results for the accuracy and order of the numerical methods are confirmed by the experimental results presented in the paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f54ab2c1a6b49356f3fcba28c0a9e771ee00beb187018c6e30b5cb538a64326a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
