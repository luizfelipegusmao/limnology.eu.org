The garnet-type Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LLZO) solid electrolyte holds great promise due to its excellent stability against lithium and relatively high ionic conductivity [<a href=\"#ozae044.859-B1\">1</a>]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful tool for materials characterization, especially essential for battery research when in situ and operando techniques are available to provide valuable information for dynamic phenomena and processes [<a href=\"#ozae044.859-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.859-B3\">3</a>]. However, TEM characterization of various Li-containing solid electrolyte materials has been very challenging due to the radiation damage induced by high-energy electron beam, which makes the atomic imaging of LLZO difficult to achieve. Despite the advancement of cryo-TEM to mitigate the effect of beam damage [<a href=\"#ozae044.859-B4\">4</a>], it is necessary to control the electron dose below the critical damage threshold to allow for reliable and reproducible characterization results. For accurate quantification of specimen damage, utilizing image dissimilarity as a surrogate measure can be an effective approach. Traditional methods such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) have limitations: PSNR is overly sensitive to image content variations and lacks considerations for structural integrity, while SSIM may not adequately consider complex perceptual and cognitive elements. Therefore, we propose using pre-trained convolutional neural networks as feature extractors, followed by similarity computation in the feature domain. Pre-trained networks, such as ImageNet that is based on training of large datasets, can extract and compare high-level features and patterns in images, with less interference by human perception and more robustness to image variations than traditional metrics.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9cc40e5ebf56ab91ab3fed36e89cc95ecc5174521b6f43b65d509ad68aa63f10","category":"Environment"}
