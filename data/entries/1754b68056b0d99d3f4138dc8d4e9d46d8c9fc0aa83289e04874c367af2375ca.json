{"title":"Influence of polarized light, disruptive visual patterns, and chemical cues on oviposition in the aquatic midge, Chironomus riparius (Diptera: Chironomidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/1/57/7503660?rss=1","date":1703808000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Chironomid nonbiting midges are common in many waterbodies, occurring at high densities in sediment and also when flying adults emerge. Although important for food webs and ecosystem processes, the mass emergences of chironomid adults make some species nuisance pests. As part of an effort to develop “push–pull” strategies for managing midge populations, we investigated the importance of visual and chemical cues used by gravid females when selecting sites for oviposition. Field and laboratory oviposition choice tests with <span>Chironomus riparius</span> (Meigen) were used to assess the attractiveness of dark container colors and polarized light for females seeking water for egg laying. Females were not sensitive to increased intensity of polarized light, but they laid fewer eggs in containers with white color above the water’s edge but black below the surface. A disruptive pattern of vertical black and white stripes at the water’s edge reduced egg laying to a similar degree as white. To investigate the importance of olfactory or gustatory cues in oviposition decisions, we tested 3 potential chemical repellents (damaged larvae simulating predator presence, azadiractin, and picaridin) and 5 potential attractants (a tannin–molasses mixture, leaf detritus, live <span>Hydrilla</span> plants, periphyton, and fermented alfalfa infusions used to bait mosquito oviposition traps). Chemical cues appeared to play a weak role, if any, in oviposition choices. Onlyazadiractin (0.02 and 0.11 ppm) reduced the number of egg ropes deposited, but the mechanism may have been from mechanical trapping and drowning, not deterrence.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"1754b68056b0d99d3f4138dc8d4e9d46d8c9fc0aa83289e04874c367af2375ca","category":"Environment"}
