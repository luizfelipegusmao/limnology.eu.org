{"title":"Enabling New Science with Atom Probe Tomography via Environmentally Protected Specimen Handling","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.984/7720232?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The liquid/solid and gas/solid interface represents a rich scientific and technological frontier for discovery and innovation in many areas of science. However, the direct nano- to atomic-scale characterization of these interfaces remains technically challenging within broad range of analytical tools that require high to ultrahigh vacuum conditions. This challenge has been largely addressed within the electron microscopy community through the development of unique specimen holders and differentially pumped vacuum systems that allow researchers to probe, <span>in situ</span>, liquid/solid and gas/solid interfaces using electron probes. However, the direct application of Atom Probe Tomography (APT) to liquid/solid and gas/solid interfaces is not directly possible and requires the development of unique specimen preparation and handling of cryogenically frozen specimens and/or working with specimens under environmentally protected conditions enabling controlled gas exposures. The utilization of the focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) has opened the application of APT to a continually growing variety of complex materials. However, the regular application of APT to hydrated materials, such as biological and environmental materials, is lacking due to challenges in specimen preparation using a FIB-SEM under high and ultra-high vacuum conditions and cryogenic temperatures. Although a FIB-SEM based cryogenic specimen preparation approach offers a rational route to the preparation of such specimens for TEM analysis, there are still many unaddressed aspects such as welding and limitations in the cryo stage manipulation which makes it challenging for FIB-based cryo specimen preparation of APT specimens. At PNNL, we have developed a unique suite of hardware and experimental protocols for the preparation, handling, and analysis of environmentally sensitive materials centered around a unique environmental transfer hub, <span>in situ</span> environmental chemical reactor, specimen suitcase device, and modified cryo FIB/SEM capabilities. The ability to prepare, manipulate, and transfer specimens under either cryogenic or vacuum conditions thus provides a means to uniquely apply APT analysis to a wide variety of material systems that would not be possible otherwise. Here I will describe some new science areas relevant to biological, materials, and surface sciences that can be explored with APT analysis applied to <span>temperature sensitive</span> material systems requiring cryo specimen preparation and transfer, as well as <span>air sensitive</span> material systems requiring vacuum following controlled gas exposures.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2c0395ad647bfc71f982edb788ad6e6d6d5fdc92de7214f838fa4c8b1f078401","category":"Environment"}
