{"title":"Assessing pyrethroid resistance in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> from Cordoba Colombia: Implications of <i>kdr</i> mutations","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309201","date":1724335200000,"content":"<p>by María Claudia Atencia–Pineda, Diana Diaz-Ortiz, Paula Pareja–Loaiza, Javier García–Leal, Richard Hoyos–López, Alfonso Calderón–Rangel, Pedro Fragozo-Castilla, Lisandro Pacheco-Lugo, Adriana E.

The constant use of pyrethroid-type insecticides worldwide has caused selection pressure in populations of the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> vector, which has promoted the emergence of resistant populations. The resistance mechanism to pyrethroid insecticides most studied to date is target-site mutations that desensitize the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) of the insect to the action of pyrethroids. In the present study, susceptibility to the pyrethroid insecticides permethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and deltamethrin was evaluated in fourteen populations from the department of Córdoba, Colombia. The CDC bottle bioassay and WHO tube methods were used. Additionally, the frequencies of the F1534C, V1016I, and V410L mutations were determined, and the association of resistance with the tri-locus haplotypes was examined. The results varied between the two techniques used, with resistance to permethrin observed in thirteen of the fourteen populations, resistance to lambda-cyhalothrin in two populations, and susceptibility to deltamethrin in all the populations under study with the CDC method. In contrast, the WHO method showed resistance to the three insecticides evaluated in all populations. The frequencies of the mutated alleles ranged from 0.05–0.43 for 1016I, 0.94–1.0 for 1534C, and 0.01–0.59 for 410L. The triple homozygous mutant CIL haplotype was associated with resistance to all three pyrethroids evaluated with the WHO bioassay, while with the CDC bioassay, it was only associated with resistance to permethrin. This study highlights the importance of implementing systematic monitoring of kdr mutations, allowing resistance management strategies to be dynamically adjusted to achieve effective control of <i>Aedes aegypti</i>.","author":"María Claudia Atencia–Pineda","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ef68283eedcb93317236659f15409da33e69df52f9502ef4703bc47542d26e5b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
