{"title":"School Counsellors&rsquo; Perspectives on the Loss of a Colleague: A Qualitative Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0508/v1","date":1723033515000,"content":"Background: The loss of a co-worker always evokes complex emotions. Such a loss is particularly challenging for those who spend many hours at work and develop close interpersonal relationships with their colleagues. While many studies have examined how losing colleagues affects employees in various organizations, no research has specifically examined this topic in the school environment. Methods: This qualitative study explored the experiences of school counsellors facing the loss of colleagues from their school educational team. Twenty-one school counselors ranging in age from 28 to 61 who had lost a colleague within the past five years were examined by semi-structured in-depth interviews. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results: Three main themes emerged from the data: (1) “From Shock to Action”: School Counsellors’ Reactions to Colleague Loss; (2) “From Friendship to Conflict”: School Counsellors' Diverse Experiences with Colleague Loss; and (3) “The Burden of Care”: Coping Mechanisms for School Counsellors Facing Colleague Loss. Conclusion: This study highlights the complex experiences of school counsellors in dealing with the death of colleagues. It underscores the importance of providing long-term emotional support for counsellors throughout their careers, particularly when coping with crises and emergencies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"114212d0084c0d1494a2690fcc3000fa23e2e65c3f9be0d50b35743798cc5bd9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
