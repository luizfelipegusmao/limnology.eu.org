{"title":"Development of Carbon Composite Blades within the Context of the Experimental Validation of a CFD-Based Design Tool for Contra-Rotating, Electric Fan Engines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0622/v1","date":1718088965000,"content":"Electric propulsion systems have emerged as a disruptive technological approach towards achieving sustainable and climate-neutral aviation. To expand the operational envelope of such propulsion units in terms of altitude and velocity, an enclosing duct and counter-rotating rotors to enhance efficiency can be utilized. In this study, an iterative CFD-based design tool developed for these novel propulsion systems is utilized to design a reference engine. A substantial reduction in discrepancies between initial specifications, subsequent CFD simulations, and experimental investigations compared to conventional design tools relying on empirical formulations can be demonstrated using a classic rotor-stator configuration. This allows the CFD-based tool to be validated for designing scalable counter-rotating fan engines. Furthermore, to facilitate the transferability of research on such propulsion systems, a validated manufacturing process for composite blades is presented. This effort aims to make state-of-the-art technology accessible to smaller research projects, promoting the widespread adoption of electric propulsion technology in the aviation sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7caf601775ea8e130f350b79eef6042f00e0471f3ebcafcf3a695ad8e4ff7c53","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
