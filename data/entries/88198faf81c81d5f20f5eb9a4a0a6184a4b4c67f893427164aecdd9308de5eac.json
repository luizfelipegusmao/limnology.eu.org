{"title":"Water Budget for Lake Trafford, a Natural Subtropical Lake in South Florida: An Example of Enhanced Groundwater Influx in a Subtropical Lake Subsequent to Organic Sediment Dredging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0908/v1","date":1710497241000,"content":"A very detailed water budget was conducted on Lake Trafford in southern Florida. The inflow was dominated by surface-water influx via five canals (61%) with groundwater influx constituting 12% and direct rainfall 27%. Lake discharge was dominated by sheet-flow (69%) and evapotranspiration (30.5%) with groundwater recharge of the hydraulically connected unconfined aquifer accounting for only 0.5%. Removal of 30 M tons (4.4 x 106 m3) of organic sediment impacted groundwater influx, causing enhanced groundwater flows into the deeper parts of the lake and mixed flows along the banks creating a rather unusual pattern. The large number of groundwater seepage meters used during the investigation led to a very reliable set of measurements with occasional failure of only a few meters. A distinctive relationship was found between the wet season lake stage, heavy rainfall events and pulses of exiting sheet-flow from the lake. Estimation of the evapotranspiration loss using data collected from a weather station on the lake allowed the use of three different models which, when averaged, produced results comparable to Lake Okeechobee (southern Florida). A limitation of the investigation was the inability to directly measure sheet-flow discharges, which had to be estimated as a residual within the calculated water budget.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88198faf81c81d5f20f5eb9a4a0a6184a4b4c67f893427164aecdd9308de5eac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
