Hyperspectral confocal fluorescence microscopy (HCFM) is based on the principles of fluorescence which occurs when tissue absorbs light of a shorter wavelength and partially re-emits it at a longer wavelength. Typical applications of HCFM in plant science have leveraged autofluorescence emitted by naturally occurring photosynthetic pigments in plant tissue such as chlorophylls and bilins [<a href=\"#ozae044.407-B1\">1-3</a>]. In contrast, hyperspectral confocal Raman microscopy (HCRM) is based on spontaneous Raman spectroscopy, which probes the vibrational excitations of molecules through the inelastic scattering of photons. Typical applications of HCRM in plant science have studied molecules found in the cell walls such as lignin and cellulose, as well as carotenoids [<a href=\"#ozae044.407-B4\">4</a>]. Though the two methods arise from distinct optical phenomena they fall under the umbrella field of spectroscopic imaging and are often similar in their microscope hardware design, the most common of which is a raster scanning confocal microscope coupled to a spectrometer. They also share the advantages of being label-free and nondestructive.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1d914d82e465a2e32e805d84e642e3fba0fa89bf808e284eff1279e74ee208de","category":"Environment"}
