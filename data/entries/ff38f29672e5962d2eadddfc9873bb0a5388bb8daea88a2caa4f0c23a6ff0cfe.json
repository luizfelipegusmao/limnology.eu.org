{"title":"A qualitative study of stressors faced by older stroke patients in a convalescent rehabilitation hospital","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309457","date":1724680800000,"content":"<p>by Yuta Asada, Kaori Nishio, Kohei Iitsuka, Jun Yaeda</p>\r\n\r\nThis study aimed to explore the stressors experienced by older patients with stroke in convalescent rehabilitation wards in Japan. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four stroke patients aged &gt; 65 years who experienced a stroke for the first time in their lives. The interviews were analyzed using the Steps for Coding and Theorization method for qualitative data analysis. The results of the qualitative analysis demonstrated that patients experienced specific stressors, such as, difficulty in movement of the paralyzed hand, fear of stroke recurrence, and dietary problems. Some stressors were manageable through healthcare professionals’ active and sensitive communication strategies. These stressors were derived from the theoretical framework of “stressors related to hospitalization” and “stressors related to the illness”. Additional stressors emerged from the interaction between these two types within the theoretical framework. The results of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the specific stressors experienced by older stroke patients during the recovery process.","author":"Yuta Asada","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ff38f29672e5962d2eadddfc9873bb0a5388bb8daea88a2caa4f0c23a6ff0cfe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
