However, the role of mammary-derived serotonin in energy homeostasis during lactation is unclear. To investigate this, we utilized C57/BL6J mice with a lactation and mammary-specific deletion of the gene coding for the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis (<i>TPH1</i>, Wap-Cre x TPH1<sup>FL/FL</sup>) to understand the metabolic contributions of mammary-derived serotonin during lactation. Circulating serotonin was reduced by approximately 50% throughout lactation in Wap-Cre x TPH1<sup>FL/FL</sup> mice compared to wild-type mice (TPH1<sup>FL/FL</sup>), with mammary gland and liver serotonin content reduced on L21. The Wap-Cre x TPH1<sup>FL/FL</sup> mice had less serotonin and insulin immunostaining in the pancreatic islets on L21, resulting in reduced circulating insulin but no changes in glucose. The mammary glands of Wap-Cre x TPH1<sup>FL/FL</sup> mice had larger mammary alveolar areas, with fewer and smaller intra-lobular adipocytes, and increased expression of milk protein genes (e.g., WAP, CSN2, LALBA) compared to TPH1<sup>FL/FL</sup> mice. No changes in feed intake, body composition, or estimated milk yield were observed between groups. Taken together, mammary-derived serotonin appears to contribute to the pancreas-mammary cross-talk during lactation with potential implications in the regulation of insulin homeostasis.","author":"Sena L.
