Several anti-obesity drugs that target GLP-1 receptors have recently come to the market. Here, we describe the effects of tesofensine, a novel anti-obesity drug that acts as a triple monoamine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor. Using various techniques, we investigated its effects on weight loss and underlying neuronal mechanisms in mice and rats. These include behavioral tasks, DeepLabCut videotaped analysis, electrophysiological ensemble recordings, optogenetic activation, and chemogenetic silencing of GABAergic neurons in the Lateral Hypothalamus (LH). We found that tesofensine induces a greater weight loss in obese rats than lean rats, while differentially modulating the neuronal ensembles and population activity in LH. In Vgat-ChR2 and Vgat-IRES-cre transgenic mice, we found for the first time that tesofensine inhibited a subset of LH GABAergic neurons, reducing their ability to promote feeding behavior, and chemogenetically silencing them enhanced tesofensine’s food-suppressing effects. Unlike phentermine, a dopaminergic appetite suppressant, tesofensine causes few, if any, head-weaving stereotypy at therapeutic doses. Most importantly, we found that tesofensine prolonged the weight loss induced by 5-HTP, a serotonin precursor, and blocked the body weight rebound that often occurs after weight loss. Behavioral studies on rats with the tastant sucrose indicated that tesofensine’s appetite suppressant effects are independent of taste aversion and do not directly affect the perception of sweetness or palatability of sucrose. In summary, our data provide new insights into the effects of tesofensine on weight loss and the underlying neuronal mechanisms, suggesting that tesofensine may be an effective treatment for obesity and that it may be a valuable adjunct to other appetite suppressants to prevent body weight rebound.","author":"Claudia I.
