{"title":"In Vivo Challenge Trials with Dietary Antiparasitics Reveal New Insights into the Practical Use of Fenbendazole against Sparicotyle chrysophrii (Monogenea) Infection in Sparus aurata (Teleostei)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/5515748?af=R","date":1717669156000,"content":"<p>The microcotylid <i>Sparicotyle chrysophrii</i> is one of the most harmful parasites for the aquaculture of the gilthead seabream <i>Sparus aurata</i>, for which effective treatments are needed. The efficacy of dietary praziquantel (PZQ, 30–50 mg kg body weight<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>), emamectin benzoate (EMB, 0.015–0.050 mg kg BW<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>), and fenbendazole (FBZ, 40–75 mg kg BW<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) against <i>S. chrysophrii</i> on gilthead seabream was tested in four different <i>in vivo</i> challenge trials. Specimens of gilthead seabream naturally infected with <i>S. chrysophrii</i> were maintained in three separate recirculating aquaculture systems of 142 L (1 control vs. 2 treated). Fish were fed (ration 1.2% BW day<sup>−1</sup>) 5 days a week for 4 weeks, alternating weeks with medicated and control feed. On days 0, 14, and 28, samples of 7–9 fish per group were collected and the gills were examined for <i>S. chrysophrii</i>. The gills of hosts treated with EMB and FBZ were evaluated by histopathology. The trials showed that in-feed PZQ has low palatability, causing rejection which did not allow its efficacy to be adequately investigated. While dietary EMB was associated with adverse effects, such as gill de-epithelialisation and necrosis, with no demonstrated efficacy against <i>S. chrysophrii</i>. On the other hand, all the fish treated with FBZ lost all parasites, showing 100% efficacy and also suggesting a preventive/repellent action against the monogenean. In conclusion, the present study provides indications for the use of dietary FBZ as a medical device for the treatment/prophylaxis of sparicotylosis in aquaculture.</p>","author":"Paolo Merella, \nFrancisco Esteban Montero, \nLuca Parma, \nLorenzo Morsiani, \nRoberto Cerri, \nAndrea Di Biase, \nMarta Polinas, \nClaudio Murgia, \nElisabetta Antuofermo, \nGiovanni Garippa, \nHamed Ghafarifarsani","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"cac6855ace931ba61cc1f03ab158764a641d1fa7a6250c89b63be475a36a373c","category":"Environment"}
