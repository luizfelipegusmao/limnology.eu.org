Using a parametric constraint, it establishes the existence and uniqueness of a linear feedback-Nash equilibrium involving two specialized fleets and allows for continuous time results for a class of payoffs that have constant elasticity of the marginal utility. These results contribute to the scarce literature on analytically tractable predator–prey models with endogenous harvesting. A discussion based on industry size effects is provided to highlight the role played by biological versus strategic interactions in the multispecies context.</p>\n<p><b>Recommendations for Resource Managers</b>\n</p><p>This model presents a thorough examination of the economic inefficiencies inherent in the exploitation dynamics of two interdependent species, elucidating the complex interplay between ecological interactions and economic outcomes.</p>\n<p>The size of the fishing industries constitutes a significant variable that must be integrated into the formulation of pertinent policy recommendations.</p>\n<p>This constitutes an advancement towards a more time-consistent approach to Ecosystem-Based Fishery Management (EBFM).</p><p></p>","author":"Guillaume Bataille","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resource Modeling: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3719477483f67b16afdbb60e07461dbbb5827188dd5d72806069fb36caa95c59","entryHash":"12f1f7ae159ddcc94d508ca9e873e52f8344fb844a0c49f549096469db8864c2","category":"Environment"}
