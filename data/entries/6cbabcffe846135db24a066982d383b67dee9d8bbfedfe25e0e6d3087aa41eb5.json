{"title":"Diets, Condition, and Reproductive Fitness of Slimy Sculpin (Uranidea cognata) after Catastrophic Flooding in Trout Streams in Southeastern Minnesota, USA","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0883/v1","date":1713148779000,"content":"Slimy sculpin (Uranidea cognata) inhabitat coldwater streams in southeastern Minnesota, USA, many of which were subjected to probable 2000-year flood events in August 2007.  Floods scoured streambeds, created new stream channels, and greatly reduced benthic invertebrate communities that serve as the primary food resource for sculpin.  Diets and Fulton condition of sculpin in Gilmore Creek (with moderate flooding) and Garvin Brook (with very severe flooding) had been examined just prior to flooding, and were re-examined two weeks after flooding to assess possible diet and condition changes.  Diets, condition, and reproductive fitness of sculpin were examined seven months post-flood in these same two streams, plus nearby Trout run (also experienced very severe flooding).  Sculpin condition declined significantly post-flood in Garvin Brook, but improved in Gilmore Creek.  Prior to spring spawning, condition of Garvin Brook sculpin had improved, but Gilmore Creek fish condition worsened.  Sculpin diets were more diverse before and after flooding in Gilmore Creek than in Garvin Brook, although diets of fish from both streams were dominated (&gt;55%) by midge (Diptera: Chironomidae) larvae.  Diets differed significantly before versus after flooding in the more severely flooded Garvin Brook, but not in Gilmore Creek.  Prey number per sculpin stomach declined post-flood in Gilmore Creek, but not in Garvin Brook, although dry mass of prey/fish wet mass declined post-flood in both streams.  Pre-spawn sculpin displayed no patterns in reproductive fitness (gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, oocyte number) among the three streams that may have been related to flooding severity the previous summer.  Although sculpin diets and condition were altered significantly immediately post-flood in the more severely flooded stream, food resource recovery apparently was rapid enough to prevent longer-term impacts on sculpin condition and reproductive fitness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6cbabcffe846135db24a066982d383b67dee9d8bbfedfe25e0e6d3087aa41eb5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
