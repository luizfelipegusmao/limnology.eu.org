Marketing interventions can be an effective way of influencing consumer preferences, but little is known about the effectiveness of these interventions at increasing demand for organic foods and beverages. This review synthesises recent evidence from studies evaluating real-world marketing interventions that aim to increase consumer demand for organic foods and beverages. Five databases were systematically searched and 18,743 titles and abstracts were screened against eligibility criteria. 21 studies covering 29 marketing interventions were included and assessed for risk of bias using the Evidence Project risk of bias tool. We found that price premiums had negative or no effects on overall consumer demand, although a subset of customers were willing to pay higher prices. Price promotions had mixed effects depending on product and customer type. Some place-based interventions–such as arranging organic products in a cluster and ensuring ready availability of these products–had positive and statistically significant impacts on consumer demand. Some promotional interventions–such as including organic messaging near product displays and securing newspaper coverage–were generally effective at increasing consumer demand. Ultimately, the effectiveness of these interventions differed across product categories, message framing, and the type of store and customer, necessitating strategic targeting of organic marketing interventions to promote more sustainable consumption.","author":"Alexandra Sadler","siteTitle":"PLOS Sustainability and Transformation","siteHash":"5acd099bb614e5ebff1e724af0cad6ab2b3ef1c50ce1616dc0b5d51f3d4a8e96","entryHash":"417f92eec3fc8dbc48a433e5d3fc0d5e641e4819e6983c6d9978da833399295b","category":"Environment"}
