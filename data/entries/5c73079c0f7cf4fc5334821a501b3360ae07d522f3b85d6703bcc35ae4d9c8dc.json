{"title":"ASLO Opportunities for Students and Early Career Professionals in Aquatic Sciences","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lob.10671?af=R","date":1729502742000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Students and early career researchers/professionals (ECRs) must increasingly acquire a variety of skills and expand their collaborative networks to become more competitive as they apply for jobs and grants. Funding for skills training and overall availability of opportunities can, however, pose a challenge to this career plan. The Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) is proud to support the professional development of member and non-member students and ECRs by offering a myriad of skill-building programs. These include opportunities to: receive mentoring, travel to ASLO events, expand networks, conduct outreach projects, research exchanges, and internships, better understand scientific publishing, and exercise leadership within the society. In addition, ASLO recognizes the contribution of member students and ECRs to their communities, field, and to the society. Participation in ASLO-sponsored programs can, thus, assist in the successful transition of students to ECRs, and of ECRs to independent researchers.</p>","author":"Rita M Franco‚ÄêSantos, \nMina Bizic, \nRobert F Chen, \nBenjamin Cuker, \nJeanette Davis, \nLaura J Falkenberg, \nMary R Gradoville, \nManda Kambikambi, \nPaul F Kemp, \nAbigail Kreuser, \nErin K Peck, \nBrittany M Schieler","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Bulletin: Table of Contents","siteHash":"4067ad97a51cc8dc25fbbbaa2160150c28c0da1c950424683ce4f339a8ef5bff","entryHash":"5c73079c0f7cf4fc5334821a501b3360ae07d522f3b85d6703bcc35ae4d9c8dc","category":"Environment"}
