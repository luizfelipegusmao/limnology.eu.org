{"title":"The eco‐evolutionary importance of reproductive system variation in the macroalgae: Freshwater reds as a case study","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13407?af=R","date":1708105134000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The relative frequency of sexual versus asexual reproduction governs the distribution of genetic diversity within and among populations. Most studies on the consequences of reproductive variation focus on the mating system (i.e., selfing vs. outcrossing) of diploid-dominant taxa (e.g., angiosperms), often ignoring asexual reproduction. Although reproductive systems are hypothesized to be correlated with life-cycle types, variation in the relative rates of sexual and asexual reproduction remains poorly characterized across eukaryotes. This is particularly true among the three major lineages of macroalgae (green, brown, and red). The Rhodophyta are particularly interesting, as many taxa have complex haploid–diploid life cycles that influence genetic structure. Though most marine reds have separate sexes, we show that freshwater red macroalgae exhibit patterns of switching between monoicy and dioicy in sister taxa that rival those recently shown in brown macroalgae and in angiosperms. We advocate for the investigation of reproductive system evolution using freshwater reds, as this will expand the life-cycle types for which these data exist, enabling comparative analyses broadly across eukaryotes. Unlike their marine cousins, species in the Batrachospermales have macroscopic gametophytes attached to filamentous, often microscopic sporophytes. While asexual reproduction through monospores may occur in all freshwater reds, the Compsopogonales are thought to be exclusively asexual. Understanding the evolutionary consequences of selfing and asexual reproduction will aid in our understanding of the evolutionary ecology of all algae and of eukaryotic evolution generally.</p>","author":"Stacy A.
