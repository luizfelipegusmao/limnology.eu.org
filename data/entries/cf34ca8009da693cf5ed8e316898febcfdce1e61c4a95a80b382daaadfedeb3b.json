{"title":"Association between weight-adjusted waist index and periodontitis: A population-based study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305010","date":1717682400000,"content":"<p>by Lihan Xu, Yuntao Liu, Chenchen Zhao, Jiaying Wang, Haojing Zhou</p>\r\nObjective <p>This study aims to examine the association between the Weight-adjusted Waist Circumference Index (WWI) and the prevalence of periodontitis, providing novel evidence on the link between central obesity and periodontal health.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional study was conducted with 10,289 participants enrolled from NHANES 2009 to 2014. WWI was calculated by dividing waist circumference by the square root of weight. We employed a multivariate logistic regression model and smoothed curve fitting method to evaluate the relationship between WWI and periodontitis. We also compared different subgroups and analyzed the interaction effects.</p> Results <p>A significant positive association between WWI and periodontitis was observed in 10,289 participants aged ≥30 (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.12–1.28). Upon categorizing WWI into quartiles, the top quartile group exhibited a 27% increased prevalence of periodontitis compared to the bottom quartile (OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.10–1.46; P for trend = 0.001). Among individuals aged 30 to 60, the strength of this positive correlation is more pronounced than in those aged 60 and above.</p> Conclusions <p>WWI demonstrates a positive correlation with periodontitis with a particularly pronounced impact on moderate periodontitis, suggesting its potential to improve periodontitis prevention in a broad population.</p>","author":"Lihan Xu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cf34ca8009da693cf5ed8e316898febcfdce1e61c4a95a80b382daaadfedeb3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
