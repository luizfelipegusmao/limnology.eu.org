{"title":"PSV-26 Effect of addition of Ascophyllum nodosum and Asparagopsis taxiformis, alone or in combination, to an herbage-based diet on in vitro fermentation in continuous culture","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/740/7757848?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study investigated the effect of individual or simultaneous addition of two macroalgae species on in vitro fermentation in continuous culture. Four single-flow continuous culture fermentors were fed an orchardgrass herbage-based (orchardgrass; <span>Dactylis glomerata L.</span>) basal diet and randomly assigned one of four treatments: 1) control (CON), no macroalgae addition; 2) <span>Ascophyllum nodosum</span> dosed at 2.5% dry matter (DM; ASC); 3) <span>Asparagopsis taxiformis</span> dosed at 0.5% DM (ATX); and 4) A. nodosum (2.5% DM) + <span>A. taxiformis</span> (0.5% DM) dosed simultaneously (AS+AT). Four experimental periods were conducted in a randomized block design with 7 d of treatment adaptation and 3 d of sample collection. Fermentors were fed 82 g of DM per day in 4 equal feedings. In the last 3 d of each experimental period, daily samples of total effluent were taken for analyses of ammonia N and volatile fatty acids (VFA). Effluent was composited by fermentor and analyzed for DM, ash, neutral and acid detergent fiber, and crude protein. Purine concentrations of effluent and bacterial isolates were determined to estimate partitioning of N flow into feed, bacterial, and ammonia N fractions. Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions were measured in each fermentor every 15 min using a Fourier transform infrared gas analyzer, and pH was recorded every 2 min. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS v 9.4 with pre-planned contrasts comparing each individual macroalgae to CON (CON vs. ASC and CON vs. ATX) and comparing <span>A. taxiformis</span> with and without simultaneous addition of <span>A. nodosum</span> (ATX vs. AS+AT). Significance was declared at <span>P</span> ≤ 0.05 and tendencies at 0.05 &lt; <span>P</span> ≤ 0.10. Nutrient digestibilities, CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, pH, and N metabolism variables were not affected (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) in ASC compared with CON, but total VFA concentration increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) by 10%. Contrarily, the ATX diet tended (<span>P</span> = 0.61) to have reduced true organic matter digestibility, reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) total VFA concentration by 11%, and reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) CH<sub>4</sub> production by 99.9% versus CON. Simultaneous the combination of microalgae (AS+AT) did not further reduce (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) nutrient digestibility or total VFA concentration compared with ATX, and did not change (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) the degree of CH<sub>4</sub> inhibition. However, <span>A. nodosum</span> did not mitigate (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) any of the negative effects on fermentation associated with <span>A. taxiformis</span>, as nutrient digestibilities and N metabolism variables in AS+AT were also not different (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) from ATX. While the macroalgae species, A<span>. nodosum</span> and <span>A. taxiformis</span>, led to different fermentation patterns when added individually to continuous culture fermentors, no negative or positive interactions were observed from their simultaneous addition.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"9cd9602ac396c14e3f510c1330a2cedbe16903c6640997b1093a453fe6eceb95","category":"Environment"}
