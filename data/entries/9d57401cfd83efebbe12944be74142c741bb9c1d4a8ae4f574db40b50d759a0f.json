{"title":"Smooth and Spiky: The Importance of Variability in Marine Climate Change Ecology","link":"https://new.annurev.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-022323-082123?TRACK=RSS","date":1698883200000,"content":"<div><p>Greenhouse gas emissions are warming the ocean with profound consequences at all levels of organization, from organismal rates to ecosystem processes. The proximate driver is an interplay between anthropogenic warming (the trend) and natural fluctuations in local temperature. These two properties cause anomalously warm events such as marine heatwaves to occur with increasing frequency and magnitude. Because warming and variance are not uniform, there is a large degree of geographic variation in temporal temperature variability. We review the underappreciated interaction between trend and variance in the ocean and how it modulates ecological responses to ocean warming. For example, organisms in more thermally variable environments are often more acclimatized and/or adapted to temperature extremes and are thus less sensitive to anthropogenic heatwaves. Considering both trend and variability highlights the importance of processes like legacy effects and extinction debt that influence the rate of community transformation.</p></div>","author":"Jon D.
