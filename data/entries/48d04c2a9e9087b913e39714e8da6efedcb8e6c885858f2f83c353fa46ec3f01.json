{"title":"The number of health-promoting substances that all edible vascular plantscontain compared to the species-specific number of health-promoting substances of five Wild Edible Plants (WEPs)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0601/v1","date":1712647764000,"content":"Abstract: The Mediterranean diet, a widely studied and highly beneficial diet, underpins my research. Initially, the Mediterranean diet included Wild Edible Plants (WEPs). According to numerous research reports, this diet 1) promotes health and longevity and 2) prevents various modern diseases, including coronary and Alzheimer’s disease. A vital component of this diet is consuming locally available green plants, which are rich in health-promoting substances. In Åhlberg (2021, 2022b), I presented evidence for 56 health-promoting substances that all green vascular WEPs contain. While reading research reports of these five species, I found eight more health-promoting substances that all green vascular wild edible plants have. This article adds eight new substances to the earlier 56, bringing the total to 64. This is a novel and groundbreaking finding for which I provide research evidence. Each WEP has 1) health-promoting substances that all green vascular plants share and 2) species-specific health-promoting substances. I present the latest research on five invasive wild edible plants (WEPs) species. Each contains at least 64 health-promoting substances and varying species-specific health-promoting substances. I also present the experimental research results showing how many of these substances prevent Alzheimer’s disease. \nKeywords: wild edible plants (WEPs); wild food plants; Mediterranean diet; functional foods; good health, longevity; Alzheimer’s disease; alimurgic plants; invasive species; sustainability","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"48d04c2a9e9087b913e39714e8da6efedcb8e6c885858f2f83c353fa46ec3f01","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
