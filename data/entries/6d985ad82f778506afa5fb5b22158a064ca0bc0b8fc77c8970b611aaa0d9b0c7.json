{"title":"A Narrative Review on Gut Microbiome Disturbances and Microbial Preparations in ME/CFS: Implications for Long COVID","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2021/v1","date":1714525317000,"content":"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, also known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID are characterized by debilitating post-exertional malaise and other core symptoms related to immune dysregulation resultant from post-viral infection, including mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic neuroinflammation and gut dysbiosis. The reported associations between altered microbiota composition and cardinal symptoms of ME/CFS and Long COVID, suggesting that use of microbial preparations, such as probiotics, by restoring the homeostasis of the brain-immune-gut axis may help in the management of symptoms in both conditions. Therefore, this review aims to investigate the implications of alerted gut microbiome and assess the evidence supporting use of microbial-based preparations, including probiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics alone and/or in combination with other nutraceuticals in the management of fatigue, inflammation, as well as neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal symptoms among patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d985ad82f778506afa5fb5b22158a064ca0bc0b8fc77c8970b611aaa0d9b0c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
