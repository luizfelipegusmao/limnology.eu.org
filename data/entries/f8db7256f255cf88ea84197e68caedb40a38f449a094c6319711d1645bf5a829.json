{"title":"Study on the Resilience Measurement of New Energy Vehicle Industry Chain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1700/v1","date":1711611814000,"content":"In the current complex and uncertain macroeconomic situation, improving the inherent resilience of the new energy vehicle industry chain is the key to effectively addressing various risks and challenges, and achieving dynamic balance between high-quality industrial development and industrial chain security. Based on the basic concept of resilience and the actual situation of new energy vehicle industry chain development, this study constructs a comprehensive evaluation index system for the resilience of the new energy vehicle industry chain, which includes four dimensional first-level indicators of coping resistance, adaptive resilience, autonomous control and leading competitiveness. In addition, it is measured by combining the data related to the new energy vehicle industry chain in Changzhou City. Our study shows that the situation on the new energy vehicle industry chain is complicated, and the comprehensive evaluation index system is more favorable for evaluating its resilience level.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8db7256f255cf88ea84197e68caedb40a38f449a094c6319711d1645bf5a829","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
