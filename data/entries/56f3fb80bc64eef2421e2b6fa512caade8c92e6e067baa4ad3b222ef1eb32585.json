{"title":"Development of a UAV-Based Multi-Sensor Deep Learning Model for Predicting Napa Cabbage Fresh Weight and Determining Optimal Harvest Time","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1797/v1","date":1721730376000,"content":"Accurate and timely prediction of Napa cabbage (Brissica rapa subsp. Perkinensis) fresh weight is crucial for optimizing harvest timing, crop management, and supply chain logistics, contributing to food security and price stabilization. Traditional manual sampling methods are labor-intensive and imprecise. This study addresses this challenge by developing a comprehensive (artificial intelligence) AI-powered model for predicting Napa cabbage fresh weight using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multi-sensor data. High-resolution RGB, multispectral, and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery were collected over a Napa cabbage field throughout the 2020 growing season. Various vegetation indices, crop features (vegetation fraction, crop height model), and water stress indi-cators (CWSI) were extracted from the imagery. Three AI algorithms—deep neural network (DNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF)—were trained and evaluated, with the DNN model consistently outperforming the others. The DNN model achieved the highest accuracy (R² = 0.86 for training, 0.82 for testing; root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.432 kg for training, 0.465 kg for testing) during the mid-to-late rosette growth stage (DAP 35-42), highlighting this period as crucial for fresh weight estimation due to stable leaf area and well-developed canopy structure. The model tended to underestimate the weight of Napa cabbages exceeding 5 kg, potentially due to limited samples and saturation effects of vegetation indices. However, the overall error rate was less than 5%, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach. Spatial analysis revealed that the model accurately captured the variability in Napa cabbage growth across different soil types and irrigation conditions, particularly reflecting the positive impact of drip irrigation on the sandy loam plot. Bias analysis indicated the DNN model's tendency to overestimate smaller Napa cabbages (2 kg), suggesting areas for future refinement. This study demonstrates the potential of UAV-based multi-sensor data and AI algorithms for accurate and non-invasive prediction of Napa cabbage fresh weight. The developed DNN model offers a promising tool for optimizing harvest timing, improving crop management practices, and en-hancing supply chain efficiency. Future research should focus on refining the model for specific weight ranges and diverse environmental conditions, as well as extending its application to other crops, to further advance precision agriculture and contribute to sustainable food production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56f3fb80bc64eef2421e2b6fa512caade8c92e6e067baa4ad3b222ef1eb32585","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
