{"title":"Exploring the Dark Matter of Human Proteome: Emerging Role of Non-canonical Open Reading Frame (ncORF) in Cancer Diagnosis, Biology, and Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2031/v1","date":1719575338000,"content":"Cancer develops from abnormal cell growth in the body, causing significant mortalities every year. To date, potent therapeutic approaches have been developed to eradicate tumor cells, but intolerable toxicity and drug resistance can occur in treated patients, limiting the efficiency of existing treatment strategies. Therefore, searching for novel genes critical for cancer progression and therapeutic response is urgently needed for successful cancer therapy. Recent advances in bioinformatic and proteomic techniques have allowed the identification of a novel category of peptides encoded by non-canonical open reading frames (ncORFs) from historically non-coding genomic regions. Surprisingly, many of the ncORFs express functional microproteins that play a vital role in human cancers. In this review, we provide a comprehensive description of different ncORF types with coding capacity and technological methods in discovering ncORFs among human genomes. We also summarize the diagnostic and prognostic value of these ncORF as well as their carcinogenic role in cancer progression and underestimated potential as therapeutic targets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50f066413f7da42e0b79f6fb1b030a9ea74e01ff60b25b8867f791c5c500490b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
