{"title":"Heritage Education of Memory: Gamification to Raise Awareness of the Cultural Heritage of War","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1693/v1","date":1719267982000,"content":"This study focuses on the use of gamification, specifically the UrbanGame activity, to enhance heritage education related to the Spanish Civil War bombings in Alicante. The research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of active methodologies in raising cultural heritage awareness among university students. By employing a combination of collaborative work, meaningful learning, problem-based learning, discovery learning, concentration, and motivational strategies, the study involved 122 students from primary and secondary education programs. The methods included the design and implementation of the UrbanGame, followed by surveys to collect quantitative and qualitative data on students' perceptions, satisfaction, and learning outcomes. The results indicated that while collaborative work did not have a significant impact on content comprehension, skill acquisition, or value acquisition, meaningful learning showed a positive trend towards content comprehension. Problem-based learning had a weak but notable relationship with content comprehension, while motivation and concentration significantly influenced learning outcomes. Additionally, the UrbanGame activity promoted memory and cultural heritage by emotionally connecting students with local history. The findings suggest that an integrated approach that combines various active methodologies is essential for maximizing educational effectiveness and cultural promotion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5060243e63ae9dcd556bfc8ab4c93bcfb93b1330f2e264209f46251516808fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
