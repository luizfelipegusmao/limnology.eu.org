{"title":"A Bptf Inhibitor That Interferes with the Multidrug Resistance Pump to Sensitize Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells to Chemotherapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0791/v1","date":1718186314000,"content":"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with a generally poor prognosis due to its highly aggressive and metastatic nature, lack of targetable receptors, as well as the frequent development of resistance to chemotherapy. We previously reported that AU1, a small molecule developed as an inhibitor of BPTF (bromodomain PHD finger containing transcription factor), was capable of sensitizing preclinical models of triple negative breast cancer to chemotherapy, in part via the promotion of autophagy. In studies reported here, we identify an additional property of this compound, specifically that sensitization is associated with inhibition of the P-glycoprotein efflux pump. In silico molecular docking studies indicate that AU1 binds to active regions of the efflux pump, in a manner consistent with inhibition of pump function. This work identifies a novel chemical structure that can influence multidrug efflux, an established mechanism of drug resistance in triple negative breast cancer, that has not yet been successfully addressed by clinical efforts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ac6caab26cd015ee01f046043d86e7929b005bd798a813562cb8b1227a0fc26","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
