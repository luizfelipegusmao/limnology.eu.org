{"title":"Experimental Verification of Geometric Changes Caused by the Release of Residual Stresses for Large-Scale Welded Frames","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1304/v1","date":1711418262000,"content":"This paper presents geometric analyses of welded frames after free relaxing and vibratory stress relief (VSR). Respected frames were tested components of a prototype packaging machine. Two types of relaxation were carried out to remove stresses introduced as a result of welding process. One of the frame was subjected to free relaxing, while the other one to accelerated vibration relaxing. Detection of the frame geometry changes was performed using a photogrammetric system. In addition, an evaluation of the geometry change was conducted for fifteen variants of steel frame support. A comparative analysis of the geometric deviations of the frames after free and vibratory stress relief confirmed the assumption that the frame after vibration stress relief better reproduces the nominal dimensions. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that after vibratory stress relief the frame is not subject to further deformation, which is a desirable effect. In the case of free relaxing, the frame undergoes dimensional changes in a random manner. In summary, carrying out accelerated vibratory stress relief allows control of spontaneous dimensional changes in the designed frame of a packaging machine resulting from spontaneous relaxation of stresses arising from the welding process. The shortening of the relaxation process of the welded frame is also an unquestionable advantage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbccb08ec1b9a78e6eac1cac60eaf778e83e8270c706be0f48eb41f62face32b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
