{"title":"Technology Acceptance Level of Dark Web Users","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1156/v1","date":1713353072000,"content":"“Dark Web” usually describes a new world of e-living space perceived as a place, free from con-straints, in which its main actors generally are criminal, unstable, and mentally disturbed individ-uals. Nowadays, advancements in information and internet technologies have made the Dark Web more accessible in recent decades. The Dark Web is a virtual world component; therefore, as-sessing users’ behavior may be crucial in understanding motivation to use it. This study aims to discuss the behavior patterns of Dark Web users within the theoretical framework of the technol-ogy acceptance model via a structural equation model.  The resulting structural equation model showed that considered causal relationships were statistically significant.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3fe3ae3cd7fd05e1e3e1538f8b50deb643f36778b691bea556cce002dc475515","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
