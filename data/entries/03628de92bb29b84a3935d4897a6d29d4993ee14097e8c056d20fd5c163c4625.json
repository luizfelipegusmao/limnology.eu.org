{"title":"Homogenization of a Thermoelastic Bristly Structure Immersed in a Thermofluid","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0957/v1","date":1726194161000,"content":"The effective macroscopic model describing interactions of a viscous compressible heat-conducting fluid and a two-level fine bristly thermoelastic structure is derived from microstructure by means of the Allaire–Briane multi-scale convergence method. This new model naturally generalizes the isothermal formulation earlier constructed by the authors in 2020, see in Siberian Electronic Mathematical Reports, vol. 17 (https://doi.org/10.33048/semi.2020.17.100). In applications, the established model can be used, for example, in description, with account of heat transfer phenomemon, of airflow near surface of plant’s leaf, in simulation of epithelium surfaces of blood vessels, and in design of biotechnological devices operating in liquids.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"03628de92bb29b84a3935d4897a6d29d4993ee14097e8c056d20fd5c163c4625","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
