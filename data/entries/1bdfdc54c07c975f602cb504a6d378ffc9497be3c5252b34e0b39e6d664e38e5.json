Pyric herbivory results in a mosaic of patches with varying levels of herbivory and grazing intensity fire intensity and frequency. The importance of pyric herbivory for ecosystem heterogeneity and biodiversity has been described for North American, Australian and African systems, but the concept remains largely untested in a European context.\n\nWe introduced fire and herbivory in a full-factorial experiment in a temperate European wood-pasture system to test whether pyric herbivory operates in ways comparable to grassy systems elsewhere in the world. Using camera traps, we observed the behaviour of cattle in burned subplots (49 m<sup>2</sup>) compared with unburned subplots. We measured grass height and the proportion of the subplot that burned as variables affecting cattle preference and to assess how grazing affects fire behaviour. We also examined the effect on plant species and life-form composition after six seasons of treatment.\n\nCattle spent more time grazing in burned than in unburned subplots in the most productive paddock, where a larger proportion of the subplot burned. The proportion of a subplot that burned was positively related to pre-fire grass height. Moreover, both grass height and the proportion of subplot burned declined in the burned subplots during the 6-year study period and fire and cattle grazing altered the relative cover of graminoids and shrubs (<i>Rubus</i> spp.), with more graminoids in grazed and/or burned subplots and more shrubs in ungrazed subplots at the end of the study.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>. In our temperate European wood pasture, fire and (cattle) grazing interacted in ways comparable to pyric herbivory in grassy ecosystems elsewhere in the world, especially in the most productive paddock. Fire attracted grazing, with cattle grazing longer on subplots that burned more fully. Grazing also affected fire, where over the course of our experiment cattle grazing reduced grass height and the proportion of a subplot that burned. We suggest that pyric herbivory is an interesting management method to further explore in the European context to address the loss of biodiversity in open ecosystems, particularly in more productive sites.\n</p>","author":"Karin Amsten, \nJoris P.
