[<a href=\"#ozae044.098-B1\">1</a>]. Since then, Tohoku University, QST, Shimadzu Corporation and JEOL have been collaborating to develop and launch commercial models of the SXES that can be mounted on JEOL scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). These spectrometers enable microscopic chemical state analysis and have been utilized in various fields such as batteries, metals, minerals, and polymers. One of the commercial models of SXES (SS-94000SXES, JEOL Ltd.) can obtain SXES spectra in 50 - 170 eV and 70 - 210 eV energy regions using two gratings [<a href=\"#ozae044.098-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"dbee5ecf8f044328050a4fc2e2a98a92fb60b0c1b83a4554bb7a5d938a9ab622","category":"Environment"}
