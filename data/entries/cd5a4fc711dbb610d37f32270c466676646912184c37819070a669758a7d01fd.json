{"title":"Factors Associated with HPV Genital Warts: A Self-Reported Cross-Sectional Study Among Students and Staff of a Northern University in Nigeria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1970/v1","date":1714464456000,"content":"The menace of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections among low- and middle-income countries with no access to free HPV vaccine is a public health concern. HPV is one of the most common Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) in Nigeria with high-risk HPV-16 and 18 genotypes. In this study, we explored the predictors of self-reported HPV infections and HPV genital warts infection among a population of students, non-academic staff, and academic staff of Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB) university located in Lapai, Nigeria. We also assessed their knowledge about HPV infections and genotypes, and sexual behaviors. An online cross-sectional study was conducted by setting up a structured questionnaire on google form and it was distributed to the University community via Facebook and other social media platforms of the university. The form captured questions on HPV infection, knowledge about HPV infection and genotypes, as well as sexual health of the participants. All variables were described using frequencies and percentage distribution, chi-squared test statistics was used to explore the association between HPV infection (medical records of HPV infection) and the participants’ profile, and logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the factors associated with HPV genital warts infection among the population. This study reveals those participants between the ages of 26 – 40 years (81.3%) and those currently not in a union (26.4%) who have self-reported having HPV-16 and -18 genotypes. Also, participants between 26 – 40 years of age (OR: 0.45, 95%CI: 0.22 – 0.89) reported to be carriers of HPV genital warts. Therefore, this study reveals the factors associated with HPV infection and genital warts peculiar to IBB university students and staff. Hence, we suggest the need for HPV awareness programs and free HPV vaccine availability at IBB university.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd5a4fc711dbb610d37f32270c466676646912184c37819070a669758a7d01fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
