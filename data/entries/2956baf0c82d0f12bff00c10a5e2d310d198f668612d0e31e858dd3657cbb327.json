{"title":"Trends in the Use of Probiotics in Aquaculture of Bangladesh—Present State, Problems, and Prospects","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/5566980?af=R","date":1691737200000,"content":"<p>Aquaculture in Bangladesh has expanded, diversified, and intensified over the last decades. Control of infectious diseases is critical for a successful and sustainable aquaculture. In this study, we examined the extent of use of probiotics in aquaculture of Bangladesh, using a questionnaire. Data were collected from 200 individual respondents from commercial fish farms located at Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Jashore, and Cumilla (50 from each) regions. A total of 88 different probiotics products from 36 companies, mostly imported, are used in the aquaculture in Bangladesh. Although in most cases the purpose of the use of probiotics is not clear for the farm owners, several representatives of different companies suggested the use of their different probiotic products, for different situations. Most of the farm owners responded that they used probiotics to get higher production by promoting the growth of fish. A considerable number of farm owners responded that probiotics reduced mortality as well as reduced gas emissions from the aquaculture ponds. Although the use of commercial probiotics varies from region to region, Pondcare and Safegut, the product of SK + F, are mostly used in aquaculture based on the responses (32% and 21% of respondents, respectively). To safeguard and clarify the value and effectiveness of these goods, the fish feed manufacturers and regulatory authorities should monitor their production, collection, and marketing.</p>","author":"Md Kabir Hossain, \nMd Shahjahan, \nZulhisyam Abdul Kari, \nGuillermo Téllez-Isaías, \nÖmerhan Dürrani","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"2956baf0c82d0f12bff00c10a5e2d310d198f668612d0e31e858dd3657cbb327","category":"Environment"}
