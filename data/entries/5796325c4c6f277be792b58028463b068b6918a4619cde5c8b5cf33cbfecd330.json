{"title":"A Detailed Review on Cancers: It's Physical and Biochemical Basis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2203/v1","date":1725014638000,"content":"This thesis presents a comprehensive review of cancer, with a particular focus on its physical and biochemical basis. Cancer, a leading cause of mortality worldwide, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Understanding the fundamental differences between cancerous and normal cells is essential for developing effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies.\n\nThe review begins by exploring the physical anomalies of cancer cells, including their irregular shape, size, and structural organization. These cells often exhibit altered cell membranes, disrupted cytoskeletal architecture, and irregularities in cell adhesion and communication, which contribute to their invasive and metastatic potential.\n\nThe biochemical basis of cancer is examined in detail, with an emphasis on the dysregulation of key metabolic pathways. Cancer cells undergo profound metabolic reprogramming, often referred to as the Warburg effect, where they preferentially utilize glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation, even in the presence of oxygen. This metabolic shift supports the rapid proliferation of cancer cells and their survival in hypoxic conditions. Additionally, cancer cells produce abnormal proteins that contribute to tumor progression, such as mutant p53, and fail to produce critical tumor suppressor proteins like RB1, leading to unchecked cell division and evasion of apoptosis.\n\nFurthermore, the thesis reviews the role of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in cancer development, highlighting how mutations and epigenetic alterations drive the transformation of normal cells into malignant ones. The complex interplay between these genetic changes and the tumor microenvironment is also discussed, emphasizing the importance of signaling pathways, immune evasion, and angiogenesis in cancer progression.\n\nThis detailed review synthesizes current research and insights from authoritative sources, including peer-reviewed journals and foundational medical texts, to provide a thorough understanding of the physical and biochemical underpinnings of cancer. The findings underscore the importance of continued research in these areas to advance the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5796325c4c6f277be792b58028463b068b6918a4619cde5c8b5cf33cbfecd330","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
