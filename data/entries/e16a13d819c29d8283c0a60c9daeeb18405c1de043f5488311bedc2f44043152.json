{"title":"Using Knowledge Graphs for Enabling Collaborative Financial Market Data Analytical Processes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1921/v1","date":1721807038000,"content":"Financial market data analysts are increasingly turning towards machine learning techniques for data analysis and making decisions. This paper explores how knowledge graphs, essentially a network of real entities and their relationships, can be used to improve collaborative financial market data analysis and make it more efficient and user friendly. This paper reviews the current state of financial market data analysis, the challenges in deploying machine learning models in industrial environments, and the concepts such as ML-Ops and knowledge graphs. A software architecture comprising various roles, layers and services such as Data Engineers, Data Analysts, public users, APIs, workflows, analytics libraries, UX layer, Business Layer, etc. is introduced and described in detail. Then, it discusses how knowledge graphs can be used to enhance collaborative financial market data analysis. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the usage of the whole system, within the context of financial market data analytics of equities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e16a13d819c29d8283c0a60c9daeeb18405c1de043f5488311bedc2f44043152","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
