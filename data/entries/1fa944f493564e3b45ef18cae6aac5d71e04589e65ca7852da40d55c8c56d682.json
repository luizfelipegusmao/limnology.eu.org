{"title":"Interannual variation in survival of wild Atlantic salmon smolts through a dynamic estuarine habitat","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12685?af=R","date":1705413946000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Migration timing is critical for diadromous fish, especially for survival. Migration through fresh water and estuarine transitional waterbodies may be an important early life survival bottleneck through potential exposure to anthropogenic pressures and predators. Monitoring smolt movement and survival through riverine and estuarine habitats is important for identifying causes of smolt mortality and the potential for directing focused, mitigating management actions. Acoustic telemetry was used to track 186 Atlantic salmon smolts during migration from the river Boyne to the Irish Sea on the east coast of Ireland during 2019â€“2021. Migration success from release to sea entry that ranged from 47% to 81% was linked to biotic (predation) and abiotic effects (water flow and water temperature). Predation was associated with interannual variation in smolt survival, with 5.4% of smolts consumed by marine mammals and 26.3% lost to unknown fates. Our findings contribute to the understanding of predation on smolts and also how water temperature, flow and tidal phase can influence this critical life stage of Atlantic Salmon, a species in decline across its range.</p>","author":"J.
