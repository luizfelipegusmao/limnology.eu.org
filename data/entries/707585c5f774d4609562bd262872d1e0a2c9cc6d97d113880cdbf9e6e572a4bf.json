{"title":"Assessment of Water Supply and Water Quality in the Rural Area of Obokun Local Government, Osun State, Nigeria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1435/v3","date":1727660522000,"content":"Rural areas are not only faced with the problems of rural depopulation but also with the problem of water supply and water quality which is a basic necessity of life. In light of this, this paper assesses the rural water supply situation and the bacteriological quality of different water sources in the Obokun Local Government Area of Osun State, Nigeria. The safety of the water sources for human consumption and possible occurrence of the water borne diseases in the study area were determined. The study employed descriptive and analytical methods of data analysis to achieve the objectives of the inquiry. Findings showed that the study area suffered from inadequate water supply and poor locations of the sources of water: The study also revealed that the microbiological quality of the water sources used was unsafe, poor and not acceptable for human consumption. In addition, many man- days-hours were wasted in search of water. It is therefore recommended that the government should make the rural water supply and the maintenance of water quality a priority in its policy formulation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"707585c5f774d4609562bd262872d1e0a2c9cc6d97d113880cdbf9e6e572a4bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
