{"title":"The Effect of Bargaining Power of Buyers to Enhance Sustainability Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2233/v1","date":1722333228000,"content":"Various studies on sustainability development as emerging competitive strategy present it as exogenous factor that businesses have to cope with for being successful. However, considering current changes in business processes in which customers are taking an important position, sustainability development tends to be endogenous factor. To study this change, this paper analyses how industrial benefits of bargaining power of buyers, one of five forces of M. Porterâ€™ model fosters sustainability development.  To achieve this objective, integrative literature review and statistical measure of the relation between price, quality of products, and sustainability achievement among countries are used. The findings are that, high quality products, one of the benefits of bargaining power is significant related to sustainability development, whereas low prices benefit is not. This is due to the fact that; low prices are not that main driver for current consumer generations which are more driven by social values than price competitiveness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4be2cc4f1a51bdd79b5535c77f2813bde717b2275b4ed30f8e6a5d046b1c387","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
