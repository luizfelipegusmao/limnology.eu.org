How can such production be implemented? For this purpose, this article analyses the effects of the developed Dresden Model of Adaptability on the integration of holistic sustainability. The focus is on investigating the promotion of economic, environmental and social sustainability goals in terms of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals as well as analysing strategies to increase resilience to changing environmental conditions. A human-centered perspective is considered. The model proves to be a holistic approach that drives sustainable development of the production system through the comprehensive integration of human, technology, and organisational structures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2034a52b32dfab6a45b0c6ccda61aa90c43739f1b35320f82dd21e1c55c4e636","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
