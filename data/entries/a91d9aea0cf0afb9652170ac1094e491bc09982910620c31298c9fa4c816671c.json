{"title":"Dynamic changes of tenderness, moisture and protein in marinated chicken: the effect of different steaming temperatures","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13603?af=R","date":1722924325000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The steam processing characteristics of chicken are a key factor in the simplicity and versatility of steamed chicken dishes. The aim of this study was to investigate in depth the changes in tenderness and water retention of marinated chicken at different slow steaming endpoint temperatures, and to further explore the effect of the evolution of protein conformations on the water status.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that chicken samples’ shear force peaked at 80 °C and decreased rapidly at 90 °C. As the steaming endpoint temperature increased between 50 and 90 °C, <i>T</i>\n<sub>21</sub>, <i>T</i>\n<sub>22</sub>, moisture content and centrifugal loss decreased, but <i>P</i>\n<sub>21</sub>, <i>P</i>\n<sub>22</sub> and myofibril water-holding capacity showed regular changes. The electrophoretic bands and protein conformation changes showed that protein in marinated chicken underwent different degrees of denaturation, degradation and aggregation. And at 70 °C, with an increase of hydrophobic groups and crosslinking of disulfide bonds as well as an increase in the number of denatured sarcoplasmic proteins, the intermolecular network was enhanced, thus affecting the water retention.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Water status of chicken meat heated at different steaming temperatures is closely related to the evolution of protein conformations. The present study serves as a robust theoretical foundation for enhancing the quality of steamed chicken products at an industrial scale. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jiawei Zhang, \nDandan Du, \nYujuan Xu, \nZhaoming Wang, \nKezhou Cai, \nQingmei Zeng, \nHui Zhou, \nBaocai Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a91d9aea0cf0afb9652170ac1094e491bc09982910620c31298c9fa4c816671c","category":"Environment"}
