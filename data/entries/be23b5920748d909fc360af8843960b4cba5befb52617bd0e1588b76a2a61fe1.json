{"title":"Hamiltonian Model for Electron Heating by Lower Hybrid Drift Waves during Magnetic Reconnection with a Strong Guide Field","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1227/v1","date":1718710414000,"content":"Recent measurements in the MRX laboratory plasma [J.Yoo et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 145101 (2024)] have evidenced the role of lower hybrid drift waves produced during magnetic reconnections in producing an effective anomalous resistivity and heating of electrons. A detailed modelization of the energy transfer from the waves to electrons is missing, though. In this work, we attempt such an exercise using a Hamiltonian test-particle model for wave-electron interaction, valid for low-β weakly collisional plasmas. Quantitative agreement with MRX results is found.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be23b5920748d909fc360af8843960b4cba5befb52617bd0e1588b76a2a61fe1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
