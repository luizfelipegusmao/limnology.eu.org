{"title":"56 Establishing grain-based modified protocols for the nutritional and physical reconditioning of malnourished horses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/215/7757078?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>From April to June 2023, we conducted a study to evaluate the effects of Total Equine containing <span>Ascophyllum nodosum</span> seaweed and chelated minerals on the continued recovery and reconditioning of 10 horses. Horses were used on a preceding 8-wk study and given a 21-d, 24-h turnout, with ad libitum access to Bermuda hay washout period between trials. Once the washout was complete horses were randomly assigned to one of three diets: Control (Ctrl) - a commercial grain product and Bermuda hay (n = 3); Treatment (Trt) - Total Equine and Bermuda hay (n = 4); and Grain only (Grn) - Total Equine without Bermuda hay (n = 3); for 8 wk with ad libitum access to water. For Ctrl and Trt diets we offered hay twice a day in port-a-gazer tubs to control waste, adjusted daily for a 3% refusal rate, and orts were collected twice a day. Individuals were weighed weekly, and their body condition score (BCS) was evaluated during the standardization period, wk 4 and wk 8. Grain was offered at a rate of 0.005% BW + 227 kg and divided into 2 equal feedings for Ctrl and Trt diets, while for the Grn diet horses were offered up to 9.07 kg of grain divided into 3 daily feedings, with grain amounts adjusted weekly based on BW. For physical reconditioning, horses were exercised 5 d/wk with a Priefert hot walker, increased in duration and intensity from wk 1 to 8. We collected samples of grain, hay, and orts for DM, NDF, ADF, EE, CP, and ash analysis. Blood samples were collected at wk 0, 4, and 8 for analysis. Baseline health parameters as rectal temperature, heart, and respiratory rate were measured weekly throughout the study to evaluate possible detrimental effects of the trial. Data were analyzed using Proc Mixed procedures in SAS. Investigation into Dry matter intake (DMI) between the Ctrl and Trt cohorts revealed no significant difference. However, significant differences (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05) were observed in Overall DMI (grain + hay) among Grn and other diet pairs. Significant average daily gain (ADG) and Efficiency (EFF) observations in wk 1, 4, and 6 (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05) suggest that Total Equine grain had better overall performance in both groups during the first 6 wk of the trial compared with the Ctrl grain. Our results demonstrate the successful outcome of a modified, grain-based protocol in nutritional and physical reconditioning of a cohort of malnourished horses. Further evaluation of larger populations is still needed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"a44778ed75fd99a44343e76dc8ed835952ab5209b9166c2971d8286737d12e2c","category":"Environment"}
