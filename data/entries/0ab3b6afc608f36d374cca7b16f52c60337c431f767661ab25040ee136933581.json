Although the public health importance of iron-rich consumption in Ethiopia is known, evidence for iron-rich food consumption and predictors among children aged 6–59 months old in Ethiopia is sparse. This study aimed to assess iron-rich food consumption and predictors among children aged 6–59 months old in Ethiopia.</p> Methods <p>This study used Ethiopia mini demographic and health survey 2019 (EMDHS-2019) data with a total weighted sample size of 5,112 among children aged 6–59 months old. A multilevel mixed effect logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of good iron-rich food consumption.</p> Results <p>The proportion of good consumption of iron-rich foods among children aged 6–59 months was 27.99% (24.22, 32.10%). The findings revealed that children born to mothers who completed primary education [AOR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.11, 3.19], a higher education [AOR = 4.45, 95% CI: 1.28, 15.48], being born to the poorer family [AOR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.43], richer [AOR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.03, 4.36], and richest [AOR = 3.57, 95% CI: 1.29, 9.93] were positively associated with good iron-rich food consumption among children aged 6–59 months old. Nevertheless, being 24–59 month-old children [AOR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.72], residents of the Afar [AOR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.67], Amhara region [AOR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.65], and Somali region [AOR = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07] were negatively associated with good iron-rich food consumption among children aged 6–59 months old.</p> Conclusion <p>The finding revealed that there was low consumption of iron-rich foods among children aged 6–59 months in Ethiopia compared to reports from East African countries. Improving women’s literacy and economic empowerment would improve iron-rich food consumption among children aged 6–59 months old. This study’s findings would have implications for policymakers in Ethiopia to enhance iron-rich food consumption.</p>","author":"Girma Beressa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0ab3b6afc608f36d374cca7b16f52c60337c431f767661ab25040ee136933581","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
