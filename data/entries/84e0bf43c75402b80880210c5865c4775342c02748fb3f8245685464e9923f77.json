{"title":"Limb Temperature Observations in the Stratosphere and Mesosphere Derived From the OMPS Sensor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1538/v1","date":1724225878000,"content":"Molecular scattering (Rayleigh scattering) has been extensively utilized from the ground with lidars and from space to observe the limb, thereby deriving vertical temperature profiles between 30 and 80 km. In this study, we explore how temperature can be measured using the new Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) sensor, aboard the Suomi NPP and NOAA-21 satellites. OMPS comprises three instruments primarily tasked with studying the composition of the stratosphere. Among them, the Limb Profiler (LP) measures the radiance of the middle atmosphere's limb (stratosphere and mesosphere, 12 to 90 km altitude) across wavelengths from 290 to 1020 nm. This new dataset has been leveraged to derive temperature profiles with a vertical resolution of 1 km.\n\nTo validate the method, the OMPS-derived temperature profiles were compared with data from four ground-based lidars, the ERA5 and MSIS models, and MLS at the lidar locations. The results indicate that OMPS and the lidars agree within a margin of approximately 5 K from 30 to 80 km. Comparisons with the models also show similar results, except for ERA5 beyond 50 km. Comparisons with MLS exhibit slightly higher deviations than those with the lidars.\n\nWe investigated various bias sources, such as different attenuation sources that can generate errors up to 120 K in the UV range, while instrumental errors are around 0.8 K, and noise issues can cause errors up to 150 K in the visible range for OMPS.\n\nThis study also highlighted the interest in developing a new miniaturized instrument that could meet real-time observation of atmospheric vertical temperature profiles using a constellation of CubeSats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84e0bf43c75402b80880210c5865c4775342c02748fb3f8245685464e9923f77","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
