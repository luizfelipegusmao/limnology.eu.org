{"title":"Commercial determinants of mental ill health: An umbrella review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003605","date":1724853600000,"content":"<p>by Kate Dun-Campbell, Greg Hartwell, Nason Maani, Alice Tompson, May CI van Schalkwyk, Mark Petticrew</p>\r\n\r\nMental ill health has complex and interrelated underlying causes, with wider determinants of health often overlooked as risk factors. The ‘commercial determinants of health’ are gradually receiving more attention and recognition but there is a relative lack of awareness of the commercial determinants of <i>mental</i> health. This aim of this umbrella review was to synthesise systematic review level evidence for the association between commercial determinants and mental health outcomes. This umbrella review included evidence from high, middle, and low-income countries. We included terms related to broader commercial activities and terms focused on six key unhealthy commodities (tobacco, alcohol, ultra-processed foods, gambling, social media, fossil fuels) and the impacts of fossil fuel consumption (climate change, air pollution, wider pollution). We included 65 reviews and found evidence from high quality reviews for associations between alcohol, tobacco, gambling, social media, ultra-processed foods and air pollution and depression; alcohol, tobacco, gambling, social media, climate change and air pollution with suicide; climate change and air pollution with anxiety; and social media with self-harm. There was a lack of evidence examining wider practices of commercial industries. Our umbrella review demonstrates that by broadening the focus on commercial determinants, the influence of commercial products and activities on mental ill health can be better understood. The lack of research examining broader commercial practices on mental ill health is an area that should be addressed. Our review highlights the existing base of high-quality evidence for many of these unhealthy commodities’ impacts on mental ill health and indicates that commercial determinants is a valuable framework for understanding the drivers of mental ill health.","author":"Kate Dun-Campbell","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"2632ea087d59e13711c679adb88e7c5d933d7e795beb09eba993eb183abbbfd6","category":"Environment"}
