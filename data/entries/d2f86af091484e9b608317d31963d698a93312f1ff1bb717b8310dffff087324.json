{"title":"Channel restoration in urbanized systems: Guiding design using ecological flow targets and future management scenarios","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.13232?af=R","date":1727675976000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Restoration of urban rivers must simultaneously design for ecological habitat while accounting for altered flow regimes associated with urban runoff, flood protection, and industrial/wastewater discharge. The goal of this study was to use ecological flow targets to guide channel restoration of the Los Angeles (LA) River across potential future flow regimes. Using a one-dimensional hydraulic model, we simulated a range of channel cross section configurations subject to different flow management decisions (wastewater reuse, low-flow [LF] treatment, and baseflow augmentation). Hydraulic results were assessed relative to ecohydraulic targets for desirable aquatic species in the LA River (willow, steelhead trout, and Santa Ana sucker). Results suggest that, along the mainstem of the LA River, restoration designs that include narrow LF channels may support Santa Ana sucker habitat and steelhead migration if management decisions decrease instream flows (e.g., by reusing treated wastewater). However, the same channel design and management decisions may not provide conditions needed to propagate floodplain vegetation such as willows. In tributary reaches, flows are too low to support habitat conditions for Santa Ana sucker or steelhead but may be able to support riparian habitat if a soft-bottom LF channel and active floodplain are present. In general, results illustrate the trade-offs between water management goals and habitat requirements for target species.</p>","author":"Anneliese Sytsma, \nDaniel Philippus, \nJordyn M.
