Standards-based analysis relies on k-ratios (ratios of peak intensity per time per beam current) between unknown samples and standards) and a matrix correction (e.g. XPP or PAP [<a href=\"#ozae044.103-B1\">1</a>]), to determine accurate element concentrations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a70c1ddfcfaab6d0654cb515d157c6b06b096f671d80162e4e1a0b975794021c","category":"Environment"}
