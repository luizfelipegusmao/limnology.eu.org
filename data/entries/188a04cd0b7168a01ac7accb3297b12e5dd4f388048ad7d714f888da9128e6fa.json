{"title":"Mitigating Distributed Denial of Service Attacks in Software-Defined Networking","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0641/v1","date":1725866470000,"content":"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is among the commonly used type of network attacks, particularly aimed at the IoT devices in the emerging future wireless services specially for strictly latency-limited applications. DDoS attacks pose serious threats for many entrepreneurial businesses as they can prevent legitimate customers from accessing network resources of corporate websites, demanding intelligent analytics prior to entertaining a service request. DDoS involves exploiting the vulnerability of IoT devices by launching distributed multi-point attacks to generate high traffic by flooding the network of victims. The consequences of DDoS attacks could be worst in any Software-Defined Networking (SDN) than in traditional networks because SDN is configured as centralised architecture, failing to address the weaknesses current paradigm. However, SDN can play a crucial role in mitigating the effects of DDoS attacks as it bears the features of easy programmability, manageability, flexibility, and scalability. In this manuscript preliminary framework to detect DDoS attacks by mitigating their threats in an SDN architecture is presented. The authors propose a defense mechanism that uses OpenFlow and sFlow to mitigate the effects of DDoS attacks. The initial results show that the proposed model can minimize efficiently the consequences of DDoS attacks in an SDN type of architectural paradigm.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"188a04cd0b7168a01ac7accb3297b12e5dd4f388048ad7d714f888da9128e6fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
