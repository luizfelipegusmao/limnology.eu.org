Across decades, the simplicity of operation, the accessibility of ex situ EM capabilities and the reliability of in situ EM results have intermittently constrained or propelled research endeavors within this domain. Notably, in the past 5 to 10 years, the maturation of industrial scale production of Nano-Reactors/Cells based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) has ushered in a new era of progress, addressing the former two constraints, and fostering heightened exploration within the later domain. This overall evolution has facilitated a closer and more direct correlation within the material science domain by establishing a closed loop that intertwines processes, structures, and properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c0c534d33ede19ccf4352550f621d9adf9b9a0855f0f56370aa6dcdcbec65b6a","category":"Environment"}
