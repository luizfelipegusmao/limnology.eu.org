{"title":"Local Government Cybersecurity Analysis: From Policy Review to Policy Framework Formulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0641/v1","date":1715333455000,"content":"Cybersecurity is a crucial concern for local governments, as they serve as the primary interface between public and government services, managing sensitive data and critical infrastructure. While technical safeguards are integral to cybersecurity, the role of well-structured policy is equally important, as it provides structured guidance to translate technical requirements into actionable protocols. This study reviews local governmentsâ€™ cybersecurity policies to provide a comprehensive assessment of how these policies align with NIST CSF, which is a widely adopted and commonly used cybersecurity assessment framework. The review offers local governments a mirror to reflect on their cybersecurity stance, identifying potential vulnerabilities and areas needing urgent attention. The study further extends to developing a cybersecurity policy framework, which local governments can use as a strategic tool. It provides valuable information on crucial cybersecurity elements that local governments must incorporate into their policies to protect confidential data and critical infrastructure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67efdb055fbf5584382e7419167cbce621f48f1f602b148ab80f84ce8176c242","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
