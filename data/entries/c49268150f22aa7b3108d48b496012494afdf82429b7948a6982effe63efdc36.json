{"title":"On Marxist Epochs and &ldquo;Late-Stage Capitalism&rdquo;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0170/v1","date":1725356784000,"content":"This article introduces a new interpretation to Socialism that approaches it via a heuristic study of Epochs. It is intended by this study that the intention of socialism (what it politically, socially, et cetera is proclaimed to be) is to be proposed to be indeterminate.The expectation of what Socialism is to be as a future entity is merely an interpretation that is predicated on Marx’s Capitalist Laws that have been since shown to be false. Its argument is suggested significantly by Engels’ discussions of human development and therein places an added focus on a historically based platform.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c49268150f22aa7b3108d48b496012494afdf82429b7948a6982effe63efdc36","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
