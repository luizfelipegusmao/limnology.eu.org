A total of 167 groundwater and 27 surface water samples were collected for constituents and isotopes (H<sup>2</sup> and O<sup>18</sup>). The hydrogeochemical characteristics showed that the major type is HCO<sub>3</sub>- CaÂ·Mg, with low total dissolved solids and a neutral to weak alkaline nature. Rock weathering processes govern the hydrochemical composition of groundwater. Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes analyses revealed that precipitation serves as the main water source. In alluvial areas, oxidative conditions lead to the enrichment of NO<sub>3</sub>-N concentrations, with sewage, manure, and fertilizers being the primary IN sources. In lacustrine areas, intensive rice cultivation results in reductive conditions and strong denitrification processes, causing the loss of NO<sub>3</sub>-N and leaving NH<sub>4</sub>-N as the dominant IN form. Organic matter mineralization is likely a more significant contributor to NH<sub>4</sub>-N concentrations than ammonium fertilizers. These findings provide valuable information for further research on natural sources and groundwater pollution in areas with similar hydrogeological conditions.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nRock weathering processes govern the hydrochemical composition of groundwater, and precipitation serves as the main water source.\nIn alluvial areas, oxidative conditions lead to the enrichment of NO<sub>3</sub>-N.
