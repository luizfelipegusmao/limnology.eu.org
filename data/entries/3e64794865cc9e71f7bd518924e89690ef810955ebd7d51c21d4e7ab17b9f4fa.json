{"title":"The Technical and Economic Aspects of Integrating Energy Sectors for Climate Neutrality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1897/v1","date":1724769388000,"content":"With the development of the energy sector based on renewable primary sources, structural changes are emerging for the entire national energy system. Initially, it was estimated that energy generation based on fossil fuels would decrease until its disappearance. However, the evolution of CO2 capture capacity leads to a possible coexistence for a certain period with the renewable energy sector. The paper develops this concept of coexistence of the two systems, with the positioning of green hydrogen not only within the renewable energy sector but also as a transformation vector for carbon dioxide captured in the form of synthetic fuels such as CH4 and CH3OH. The paper also analyzes the economic aspects related to price differences for energy produced in the two sectors, as well as their interconnection. The technical aspect, as well as the economic one, for storage through various other solutions besides hydrogen, has been highlighted. The development of the renewable energy sector and its demarcation from the fossil fuel energy sector, even with the transcendent vector represented by green hydrogen, leads to the deepening of dispersion aspects between the electricity sector and the thermal energy sector, a less mentioned aspect in current works but of great importance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e64794865cc9e71f7bd518924e89690ef810955ebd7d51c21d4e7ab17b9f4fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
