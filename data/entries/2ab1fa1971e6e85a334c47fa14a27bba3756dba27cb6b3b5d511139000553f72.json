It is essential to develop a good understanding of the thermal behaviour of specimen to tackle challenges like inaccurate reconstruction, thermal tailing, and re-crystallization (bio-samples) in APT characterization [<a href=\"#ozae044.038-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.038-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2ab1fa1971e6e85a334c47fa14a27bba3756dba27cb6b3b5d511139000553f72","category":"Environment"}
