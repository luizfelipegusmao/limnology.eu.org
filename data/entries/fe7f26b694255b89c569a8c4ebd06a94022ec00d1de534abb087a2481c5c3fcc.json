Differences in timing between male and female flowering can be highly sensitive to environmental variation—and with widespread evidence of shifts in seasonal timing of flowering (i.e., phenology) due to anthropogenic warming—climate change may alter the sequences of male and female flowering for a diversity of taxa around the globe. However, we currently lack a broad understanding of both the extent to which climate change may alter patterns of dichogamy and the potential implications of these shifts for plant reproduction. Here I present evidence that links variation in dichogamy to variation in temperature for a variety of plant taxa. I synthesize the limited number of studies that have investigated shifts in dichogamy specifically in the context of climate change, and detail the physiological, genetic, and developmental factors that control the relative timing of male and female flowering. The literature indicates that dichogamy is highly plastic and sensitive to temperature variation. Plasticity in dichogamy is observed across species with different sexual systems and growth habits, and in both female-first and male-first flowering taxa, but at present, no clear patterns of dichogamy shifts related to these associated traits are discernible. Together, these lines of evidence suggest that sequences of male and female flowering are likely to shift with climate change. However, more research is needed to better understand and predict the ecological consequences of shifting patterns of dichogamy in the context of global change.</p>","author":"D. M.
