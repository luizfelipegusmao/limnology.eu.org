Anti-resorptive and anabolic drugs have been applied to prevent and cure osteoporosis and are linked with a variety of adverse effects. <i>Antrodia cinnamomea</i> extracts (ACE) are highly renowned for their anticancer, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties. However, whether ACE-enriched anti-osteoporosis functions are largely unknown. In a preclinical animal model, we found that ovariectomy significantly decreased bone volume in the ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Administration of ACE antagonized OVX-induced bone loss. In addition, ACE reversed OVX-reduced biomechanical properties. The serum osteoclast marker also showed improvement in the ACE-treated group. In the cellular model, it was indicated that ACE inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast formation. Taken together, ACE seems to be a hopeful candidate for the development of novel anti-osteoporosis treatment.</p>","author":"Chang Po‐Chun, \nHui‐Kan Su, \nShan‐Chi Liu, \nLe Huynh Hoai Thuong, \nYang‐Chang Wu, \nHsien‐Te Chen, \nTung‐Ying Wu, \nChih‐Hsin Tang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"4c4cab653aa38bda63d7b172bf56a26aa5b0c8b829aa7f1cf33fb538470137bd","category":"Environment"}
