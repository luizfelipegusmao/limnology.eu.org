{"title":"The SMXL8-AGL9 module mediates crosstalk between strigolactone and gibberellin to regulate strigolactone-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4404/7698914?rss=1","date":1719273600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Although the strigolactone (SL) signaling pathway and SL-mediated anthocyanin biosynthesis have been reported, the molecular association between SL signaling and anthocyanin biosynthesis remains unclear. In this study, we identified the SL signal transduction pathway associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis and the crosstalk between gibberellin (GA) and SL signaling in apple (<span>Malus</span> Ã— <span>domestica</span>). ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) acts as a key node integrating SL signaling and anthocyanin biosynthesis, and the SL-response factor AGAMOUS-LIKE MADS-BOX9 (AGL9) promotes anthocyanin biosynthesis by activating <span>HY5</span> transcription. The SL signaling repressor SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE8 (SMXL8) interacts with AGL9 to form a complex that inhibits anthocyanin biosynthesis by downregulating <span>HY5</span> expression. Moreover, the E3 ubiquitin ligase PROTEOLYSIS1 (PRT1) mediates the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of SMXL8, which is a key part of the SL signal transduction pathway associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis. In addition, the GA signaling repressor REPRESSOR-of-ga1-3-LIKE2a (RGL2a) mediates the crosstalk between GA and SL by disrupting the SMXL8-AGL9 interaction that represses <span>HY5</span> transcription. Taken together, our study reveals the regulatory mechanism of SL-mediated anthocyanin biosynthesis and uncovers the role of SL-GA crosstalk in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"7c69064784320aa414bb320d749df3d7221cfc12ecc8e628aea71e750186fc85","category":"Environment"}
