{"title":"The Therapeutic Target of SGLT2 Inhibitors and GLP-1 Agonists Is Superoxide Induced Diuretic Resistance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1354/v1","date":1726652274000,"content":"Diuretic resistance is a servomechanism involving superoxide that results from the\n use of escalating doses of diuretics in the treatment of heart failure. Without intervention this\n may lead to increased heart failure mortality. Recent heart failure studies involving the use of\n SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists have shown reductions in the need for loop diuretics\n along with reductions in hospitalizations for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality.  Multiple\n mechanisms have been proposed to explain the benefits of both these drug classes but this\n paper is the first to explain and propose superoxide induced diuretic resistance as a therapeutic\n target for the treatment of heart failure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e45e8cee4019c7fb83b77cedaa7ac2fece090009d1876a4bd91b5bb05aed783f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
