Precise and efficient measurement of probe aberrations facilitates live aberration correction when a crystal specimen of interest is inserted and provides better initial guess of the probe function for phase retrieval techniques like ptychography. While diagnostic methods using Ronchigrams have been proposed for crystalline specimens [<a href=\"#ozae044.194-B1\">1</a>], their widespread implementation is hindered by the complexity and long acquisition time required for a focal series of Ronchigrams and adaptation to various crystal lattices. We have developed AberrationNet, a deep neural network based on a residual neural network and attention mechanism [<a href=\"#ozae044.194-B2\">2</a>], which provides rapid first and second-order aberration coefficient estimation from two Ronchigrams of a zone-axis crystalline specimen at different defocus.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4cb4d39ad080d246272d4052790c734e151dab4ee4049a5f31c6c71f1ec8b00c","category":"Environment"}
