{"title":"Amplitude of Accommodation in young Greek adults, 18 - 28 years old","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1291/v1","date":1711090083000,"content":"Introduction: Accommodation is the ability of the eye to change its refractive power (by altering the curvature of the crystalline lens) with the aim of focusing on different distances. In modern times, close working distances require good accommodation to ensure quality work without vision problems. However, dysfunction in accommodation is not uncommon. Specifically, accommodation insufficiency is the most common dysfunction associated with accommodation that can be observed at any age. Accommodation insufficiency is characterized by the eye's inability to reach its maximum potential for accommodation (amplitude of accommodation) based on age, with many individuals experiencing deviations equal to or greater than 2 diopters (2D) from the theoretically normal range. Finally, measuring the amplitude of accommodation and near vision tests should be established in routine eye examinations, as life now involves a variety of different distances.\nObjective: To record the rates of accommodative insufficiency in young Caucasian adults.\n\nMethods: The method used was minus to blur, and the comparison charts were based on Donder's and Hofstetter's values. Depending on the result, they were categorized as \"normal,\" which refers to deviations from zero to 1 diopter (1D) (due to the fact that minus lenses underestimate  or  are  quite  strict  regarding  the  range  of  accommodation  compared  to  other methods in free space (e.g., push-up); \"borderline,\" which refers to deviations from 1.25D to 1.75D or 2D with at least one eye deviating by less than 1.75D; and \"accommodation insufficiency,\" which refers to deviations greater than 2D from the expected values, as proposed in other studies.\nResults: The results show a significant percentage of accommodation insufficiency in these age groups, with the percentage exceeding 50%. Additionally, men had significantly lower rates of normal accommodation amplitude compared to women. Further research is needed to study the role of refractive errors in accommodation problems. \n\n\nConclusions: In a broader context, accommodation insufficiency appears to be a significant issue in young age groups, and additional studies should be conducted to analyze the problem in depth and determine its prevalence. Furthermore, a universal system for measuring the range of accommodation should be established to obtain safer results. Additionally, it would be interesting to observe the role and contribution of the ciliary muscle in the accommodation process in young adults,  as  theoretically,  the  crystalline  lens  is  almost  transparent,  the  issue  with  adaptation primarily concerns the majority's inability of the ciliary muscle to function effectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"219dd4f4fe231cbc3e34bfbae3f10d884c0f9a0cd620b23f946ab18a68be07e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
