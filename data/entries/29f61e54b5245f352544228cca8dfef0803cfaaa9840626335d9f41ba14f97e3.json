{"title":"Purchases dominate the carbon footprint of research laboratories","link":"https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/article?id=10.1371/journal.pstr.0000116","date":1721656800000,"content":"<p>by Marianne De Paepe, Laurent Jeanneau, Jerôme Mariette, Olivier Aumont, André Estevez-Torres</p>\r\n\r\nDespite increasing interest for the carbon footprint of higher education institutions, little is known about the carbon footprint associated to research activities. Air travel and attendance to conferences concentrate recent data and debates but purchases have attracted little attention. Here we develop a hybrid method to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated to research purchases. To do so, we combine macroeconomic databases, research-centered companies footprints and life-cycle assessments to construct a public database of monetary emission factors (EF) for research purchases. We apply it to estimate the purchases emissions of a hundred of research laboratories in France, belonging to the Labos 1point5 network and gathering more than 20000 staff, from all disciplines. We find that purchases dominate laboratory emissions, accounting for more than 50% of emissions, with a median of 2.7 t CO<sub>2</sub>e/pers, which is 3 to 4-fold the separate contribution from travel, commutes and heating. Median electricity emissions are 5-fold lower in our dataset of laboratories using low carbon electricity but they become preponderant for high carbon electricity mixes (3.5 t CO<sub>2</sub>e/pers). Purchases emissions are very heterogeneous among laboratories and are linearly correlated with budget, with an average carbon intensity of 0.31 ± 0.07 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e/€ and differences between research domains. Finally, we quantify the effect of a series of demand-driven mitigation strategies obtaining up to −20% in total emissions (−40% in purchases emissions), suggesting that effectively reducing the carbon footprint of research activities calls for systemic changes.","author":"Marianne De Paepe","siteTitle":"PLOS Sustainability and Transformation","siteHash":"5acd099bb614e5ebff1e724af0cad6ab2b3ef1c50ce1616dc0b5d51f3d4a8e96","entryHash":"29f61e54b5245f352544228cca8dfef0803cfaaa9840626335d9f41ba14f97e3","category":"Environment"}
