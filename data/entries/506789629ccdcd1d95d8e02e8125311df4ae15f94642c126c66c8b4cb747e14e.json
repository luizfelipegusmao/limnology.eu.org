{"title":"The H1/H5 domain contributes to OsTRBF2 phase separation and gene repression during rice development","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3787/7709385?rss=1","date":1720396800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Transcription factors (TFs) tightly control plant development by regulating gene expression. The phase separation of TFs plays a vital role in gene regulation. Many plant TFs have the potential to form phase-separated protein condensates; however, little is known about which TFs are regulated by phase separation and how it affects their roles in plant development. Here, we report that the rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) single Myb TF TELOMERE REPEAT-BINDING FACTOR 2 (TRBF2) is highly expressed in fast-growing tissues at the seedling stage. TRBF2 is a transcriptional repressor that binds to the transcriptional start site of thousands of genes. Mutation of <span>TRBF2</span> leads to pleiotropic developmental defects and misexpression of many genes. TRBF2 displays characteristics consistent with phase separation in vivo and forms phase-separated condensates in vitro. The H1/H5 domain of TRBF2 plays a crucial role in phase separation, chromatin targeting, and gene repression. Replacing the H1/H5 domain by a phase-separated intrinsically disordered region from <span>Arabidopsis</span> (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) AtSERRATE partially recovers the function of TRBF2 in gene repression in vitro and in transgenic plants. We also found that TRBF2 is required for trimethylation of histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27me3) deposition at specific genes and genome wide. Our findings reveal that phase separation of TRBF2 facilitates gene repression in rice development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"506789629ccdcd1d95d8e02e8125311df4ae15f94642c126c66c8b4cb747e14e","category":"Environment"}
