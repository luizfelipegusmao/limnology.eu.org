{"title":"Effects of Dietary Bacillus licheniformis and Combined Herbs Extracts Supplementation on Physiological and Immune Characteristics, Microbial Community, and Vibriosis Resistance of Apostichopus japonicus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/5500386?af=R","date":1684825200000,"content":"<p>This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i> and combined herbs extracts on the physiological and immune characteristics, intestinal microbiota, and vibriosis resistance of sea cucumber <i>Apostichopus japonicus</i>. The sea cucumbers were fed with basal diets supplemented with <i>B. licheniformis</i> (B group), combined herbs extracts (C group), or both (BC group). The BC group exhibited the better growth performance and higher digestive and immune enzyme activities, whereas the lowest parameters appeared in the control group. This revealed that dietary <i>B. licheniformis</i> and combined herbs extracts in combination could improve digestion, food intake, phosphatase-responsiveness, and oxidation resistance more efficiently compared with the other groups. The BC group was also more capable of regulating intestinal flora balance of sea cucumbers by increasing the beneficial bacteria related to energy synthesis and metabolic conversion, and inhibiting the potential pathogens associated with organic damage and metabolic disorders. Furthermore, the BC group showed greater ability of improving disease resistance by reducing the cumulative mortality rates and the counts of <i>Vibrio splendidus</i>. These results collectively demonstrated that dietary <i>B. licheniformis</i> and combined herbs extracts could improve the physiological and immune parameters, optimize the microbial community, and enhance the resistance to vibriosis of sea cucumbers, and the health-promoting effects were more obvious by supplying them in combination.</p>","author":"Xuda Wang, \nShilei Li, \nYing Dong, \nRui Mi, \nJingwei Jiang, \nXiaoyan Guan, \nBo Ye, \nGuiying Liu, \nZhenjun Zhao, \nDanni Liu, \nZhong Chen, \nXuewen Gao, \nChenyu Zhang, \nZunchun Zhou, \nLiqiao Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"acf6574bd2dab7fecff0f425e0190d2261d54dbe48e7da79ffa0c5c96051da76","category":"Environment"}
