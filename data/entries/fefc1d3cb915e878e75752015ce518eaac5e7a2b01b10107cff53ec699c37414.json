{"title":"Arylboronic Acid Pinacol Esters as Stable Boron Sources for Dihydrodibenzoborepin Derivatives and a Dibenzoborole","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1789/v1","date":1721735483000,"content":"The general synthesis of boron-containing cyclic compounds (boracycles) necessitates toxic organotin precursors or highly reactive boron halides. Here we report the synthesis of seven- and five-membered boracycles utilizing arylboronic acid pinacol esters (ArBpins) as stable boron sources. Grignard reagents generated from 2,2′-dibromodibenzyl or 2,2′-dibromobiphenyl reacted with ArBpins, where Ar = 9-anthryl (Anth), 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl (Mes), 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl (Tip), to give 10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,f]borepins or dibenzoborole derivatives. This Bpin-based method was successfully applied to a one-shot double boracycle formation, providing a dihydrodibenzoborepin–anthracene–dihydrodibenzoborepin triad molecule in a good yield. The dihydrodibenzoborepin bearing the Anth group was directly converted to the unsaturated borepin by NBS/AIBN. All products were characterized by NMR, HRMS, and in some cases, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Additionally, the photophysical properties of the products are also reported.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fefc1d3cb915e878e75752015ce518eaac5e7a2b01b10107cff53ec699c37414","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
