{"title":"Developing a Symbiotic Fermented Milk Product with Microwave-Treated Hawthorn Extract","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0273/v1","date":1719977177000,"content":"The rising interest in functional foods has increased the use of probiotics and prebiotics in fermented dairy products to enhance gut health. This study focuses on developing a symbiotic fermented milk product using Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum activated with hawthorn extract as a prebiotic. Three versions of the product were tested: a control, and two variants with B. bifidum activated with 10-5 g/cm³ and 10-10 g/cm³ hawthorn extract, respectively. Key characteristics such as microbiological safety, sensory properties, amino acid profile, vitamin and mineral content, antioxidant capacity, and nutritional values were evaluated. Results showed that products enriched with hawthorn extract had favorable sensory properties and sustained high levels of lactic acid bacteria while being free of pathogens. Product 1 demonstrated significant increases in L. acidophilus (24.1%) and B. bifidum (14.7%) after 7 days compared to the control. Both enriched products exhibited slower titratable acidity increases and higher viscosities over 14 days, indicating better preservation and texture stability. Product 1 was notably enriched with essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, alongside enhanced antioxidant properties due to increased flavonoid content. The technology developed ensures probiotic viability at 109 - 1010 CFU/cm³ after 14 days, making it viable for dairy production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"13cb0cb949ff3c2517e8a64a6201c984ab91106b4f346bd830dee654d3cb58ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
