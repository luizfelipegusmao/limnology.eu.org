{"title":"The chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of two Gomphonema parvulum (Bacillariophyta) environmental isolates from South Carolina (United States) and Virginia (United States)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13415?af=R","date":1709532273000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Gomphonema parvulum</i> is a cosmopolitan freshwater diatom that is used as an indicator in water quality biomonitoring. In this study, we report the culturing of two geographically separated isolates from southeastern North America, their morphology, and the sequencing and assembly of their mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes. Morphologically, both strains fit <i>G</i>. <i>parvulum</i> sensu lato, but the frustules from a protected habitat in South Carolina were smaller than those cited in the historic data of this species from the same location as well as a second culture from Virginia. Phylogenetic analyses using the <i>rbc</i>L gene placed both within a clade with <i>G</i>. <i>parvulum</i>. Genetic markers, including full chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes and the nuclear small subunit rRNA gene region were assembled from each isolate. The organellar genomes of the two strains varied slightly in size due to small differences in intergenic regions with chloroplast genomes of 121,035 bp and 121,482 bp and mitochondrial genomes of 34,639 bp and 34,654 bp. The intraspecific pairwise identities of the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of these two isolates were 97.9% and 95.4%, respectively. Multigene phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a close relationship between <i>G</i>. <i>parvulum</i>, <i>Gomphoneis minuta</i>, and <i>Didymosphenia geminata</i>.</p>","author":"A.
