{"title":"Differences in shrimp pond bottom soil properties and bacterial load between acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND)‐infected ponds and AHPND‐free ponds and their relation to AHPND","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13071?af=R","date":1712818800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study investigated the disparities in soil characteristics and pathogenic bacteria prevalence between shrimp ponds affected by acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) and unaffected ponds, alongside examining the spatial distribution of soil attributes in flat-oriented pond soil strata. Using Pearson correlation and logistic regression analyses, relationships among variables and indicators associated with AHPND prevalence were discerned, leading to the formulation of a predictive model for AHPND occurrence. Soil samples were collected from distinct locations and depths within ponds across three southern provinces of Thailand's Andaman Seaboard. The analysis revealed significantly higher concentrations of several variables, including SOD, TIC, NO<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>−</sup>-N, Ca, Mn, Cu, Zn, and specified Vibrio strains, in AHPND-afflicted ponds, especially at 0–5 cm depth. A prominent differentiation was the escalated concentration of easily decomposable organic matter (EDOM) within infected ponds, implicating potential soil and water quality deterioration alongside heightened shrimp susceptibility to AHPND. Correlational analysis showed links between bacterial densities and organic matter groupings, trace elements, exchangeable bases, and soil pH, in AHPND-infected ponds. The logistic regression model encapsulated three soil variables (TOC, Mg, and Mn) and one pathogen variable (<i>V. parahaemolyticus</i>) and furnished an equation to estimate the log (odds) of AHPND occurrence, facilitating better understanding and potential forecasting of AHPND prevalence in shrimp cultivation environments.</p>","author":"Suwanit Chainark, \nPitchaya Chainark, \nPatcharee Soonsan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"5bb71a92826903c2e18ef015e943d51434241cfb2e7ad0ea810f4ef0dcc72bbe","category":"Environment"}
