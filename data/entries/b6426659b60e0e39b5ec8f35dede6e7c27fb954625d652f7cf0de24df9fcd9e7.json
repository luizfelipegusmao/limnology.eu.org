{"title":"Trichoderma: A Review of Its Mechanisms of Action in Plant Disease Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1378/v1","date":1716286873000,"content":"Trichoderma has been widely studied for its potential as a biocontrol agent against plant pathogenic organisms. Trichoderma's biological control mechanisms include competition, modification of environmental conditions, antibiosis, induction of plant defensive mechanisms, and mycoparasitism. Trichoderma species are known to produce a variety of secondary metabolites that have antifungal activity. These metabolites include peptaibols, gliotoxin, and trichokonins. Trichoderma also produces chitinases and β-1,3-glucanases that can degrade the cell walls of fungal pathogens. In addition to direct antagonism against fungal pathogens, Trichoderma can also induce systemic or localised resistance in plants, which is achieved through the production of elicitors such as chitin oligosaccharides and β-glucans that activate plant defence responses. Trichoderma can also form mutualistic associations with plants. In these associations, Trichoderma colonises the roots of plants and promotes plant growth by increasing nutrient uptake and inducing systemic resistance. Using Trichoderma as a biocontrol agent has several advantages over conventional crop protection techniques based on applying synthetic pesticides.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6426659b60e0e39b5ec8f35dede6e7c27fb954625d652f7cf0de24df9fcd9e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
