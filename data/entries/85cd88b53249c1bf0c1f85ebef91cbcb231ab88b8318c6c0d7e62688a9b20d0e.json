{"title":"Environmental enrichment improves behaviors rather than the growth and physiology of rock bream Oplegnathus fasciatus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15604?af=R","date":1710504692000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Environmental enrichment has the potential to improve the welfare and post-release survival of hatchery fish stocked for conservation purposes. However, the effectiveness of environmental enrichment is partly dependent on the fish species, life stage, and specific enrichment structure used. To enhance the effectiveness of environmental enrichment, it is crucial to focus on characteristic differences in enrichment structures, such as type and level. This study investigated how differences in enrichment type and level affected physiological and behavioral aspects of the welfare of pre-release juvenile rock bream <i>Oplegnathus fasciatus</i> by evaluating growth performance, basal and stressed cortisol levels, antioxidant enzyme activities, and exploratory behaviors regarding anxiety and flexibility. Fish were reared for 4â€‰weeks in different enrichment treatments: barren, low-level cover structure, high-level cover structure, low-level interference structure (LI), and high-level interference structure (HI). The results revealed that fish reared with the LI treatment showed less anxiety and greater flexibility with respect to exploratory behaviors, without oxidative damage being detected. Despite exhibiting less anxiety as well, fish reared in the HI treatment had oxidative damage, indicated by lower superoxide dismutase activity, compared to those in the barren treatment. In addition, none of these enrichment structures enhanced growth performance or mitigate chronic and acute stress responses. Overall, the low-level interference structure may be more favorable in promoting the behavioral welfare of the fish. Application of this type and level of enrichment may increase the survival of the hatchery fish after release, which is critical to stocking success.</p>","author":"Zhe Li, \nShanshan Zhou, \nJingjing He, \nJie Ying, \nKaida Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"85cd88b53249c1bf0c1f85ebef91cbcb231ab88b8318c6c0d7e62688a9b20d0e","category":"Environment"}
