{"title":"Anti-aging Effects of Low Molecular Weight Collagen Peptides Supplementation on Facial Wrinkles and Skin Hydration: Outcomes from a Six-Week Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1363/v1","date":1721204681000,"content":"In recent decades, there has been a rising demand for anti-aging interventions aimed at postponing or potentially reversing indicators of skin aging. The use of collagen-based nutraceutical supplements has gained popularity as they have shown promise in enhancing skin health and reducing signs of aging. The aim of this randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded study was to investigate the effects of 2.5 g COLLinstant® LMW, a novel cosmeceutical containing low molecular weight (≤ 1000 Da) collagen peptides, on skin aging and health. The trial was conducted in 80 healthy women aged 30 years and older. They received a daily oral dose of either the food supplement (n = 40) or placebo (n = 40) for six weeks. Skin assessment was performed based on validated objective methods, such as Visioface 1000D (skin wrinkling), cutometry (elasticity and fatigue) and corneometry (skin hydration) at baseline (T0), and at week 6 (T6). After 6 weeks, participants that received collagen had significant improvements in biometric skin wrinkle parameters from baseline, with a reduction in volume by 46%, in area by 44%, and in depth by 9%, along with a greater increase in skin moisturization (by 34%) than those in the placebo group (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The food supplement did not significantly modify skin firmness or fatigue and had only slight beneficial effects on skin elasticity. The investigational product was well tolerated. The observed effects aligned closely with the subjective assessments reported by study participants. The study provides substantiated evidence supporting the efficacy of low molecular weight collagen peptides in restoring altered skin biometric parameters, as objectively assessed. Thus, regular supplementation with this nutraceutical may contribute to achieving smoother and more radiant skin.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7b8c4dcf6072e6b4949885422fcf07ceddb92d8e703d3da86429619c54e0445","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
