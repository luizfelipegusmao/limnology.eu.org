Additionally, previous research has indicated that small titanium substitutions can enhance coercivity within a high-temperature range. Our efforts aimed to elucidate the underlying microscopic mechanism for the enhanced coercivity through the application of electron energy-loss magnetic chiral dichroism (EMCD) â€“ a technique proposed in 2003 as an electron analogy to XMCD [<a href=\"#ozae044.508-B1\">1</a>]. Despite EMCD has a high potential for the magnetic moment mapping with up to atomic resolution, the attainment of atomic resolution measurements remains elusive due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. In this study, we conducted classical EMCD measurements to analyze the magnetic moments arrangements at each crystal site of BH. The schematic figure of the classical EMCD setup is shown in Fig. 1B.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2d172118c8ad4ffd33feabfecf013cae0bcdf4d58dc36433aa2ea1358ac1e8b4","category":"Environment"}
