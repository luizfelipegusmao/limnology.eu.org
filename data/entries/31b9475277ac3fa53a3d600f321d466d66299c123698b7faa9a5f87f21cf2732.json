In addition, explores the moderating effect of the implementation of Generalized Audit Software (GAS) and whistleblowing system on the relationship between accounting and auditing skills and auditor self-efficacy, as well as its role in enhancing fraud detection. Methodology– A cross-sectional survey was developed and distributed to 537 external auditors working in Indonesia. This study uses a multiple linear regression analysis method with multiple linear moderation models using WarpPLS 8.0 software. Findings – The study results indicate a significant direct relationship between practical communication skills, psychosocial skills, accounting and auditing skills, and auditor self-efficacy. However, technical and analytical factors do not affect auditor self-efficacy. The study's results indicate a significant direct relationship between auditor self-efficacy and fraud detection. It is revealed that implementing GAS moderates the relationship between auditor self-efficacy and fraud detection. In contrast, the study's results do not show a significant relationship between technical and analytical skills and auditor self-efficacy. Novelty– This research paper's originality lies in exploring the role of forensic accounting skills by using GAS and Whistleblowing systems to enhance auditor self-efficacy toward fraud detection in Indonesia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31b9475277ac3fa53a3d600f321d466d66299c123698b7faa9a5f87f21cf2732","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
