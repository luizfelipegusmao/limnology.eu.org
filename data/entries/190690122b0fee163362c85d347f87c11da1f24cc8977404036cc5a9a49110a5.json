{"title":"Assessment of Chemical Properties of Groundwater Quality of Larkana City","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0549/v1","date":1728375885000,"content":"Groundwater is the most important source of drinking water in the Sindh Province of Pakistan. However, the quality of this crucial element of life is deteriorating day by day throughout Pakistan, particularly in its Sindh province. Thus the study was carried out to determine the chemical contamination in the groundwater of the Larkana city of Sindh province. A total of 40 samples were collected randomly from various locations in Larkana city. The chemical parameters like pH, Calcium, Magnesium, Total hardness (TH), Arsenic, Chloride, Sodium, Iron, Nitrites, and Nitrates were determined in the laboratory and were compared with WHO permissible limits. The results revealed that 26% of samples had chloride beyond the permissible limit, and 32% of samples had a concentration of Total Hardness (TH) above the desirable limits. Moreover, 6%, 23%, 29%, 92%, and 80%, of samples had a concentration of Nitrates, Nitrites, Sulfate, calcium, and magnesium respectively beyond the permissible limit. However, the concentration of pH, Iron, Sodium, and Arsenic in groundwater was found within the permissible limit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"190690122b0fee163362c85d347f87c11da1f24cc8977404036cc5a9a49110a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
