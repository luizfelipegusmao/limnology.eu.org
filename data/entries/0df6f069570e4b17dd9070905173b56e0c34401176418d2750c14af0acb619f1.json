{"title":"Importance of Energy, Dietary Protein Sources and Amino Acids Composition in the Regulation of Metabolism: An Indissoluble Dynamic Combination for Life","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0642/v1","date":1718087470000,"content":"Purpose. This paper aims to present a unique perspective that emphasizes the intricate interplay between energy, dietary proteins, and amino acid composition, underscoring their mutual dependence for health-related considerations. Energy and protein synthesis are fundamental to biological processes, crucial for the sustenance of life and growth of organisms. Methods and Results. We explore the intricate relationship between energy metabolism, protein synthesis, regulatory mechanisms, protein sources, amino acid availability, and autophagy, in order to elucidate how these elements collectively maintain cellular homeostasis. We underscore the vital role this dynamic interplay has in preserving cell life. Conclusion. A deeper understanding of the link between energy and protein synthesis is essential to comprehend fundamental cellular processes. This insight could have wide-ranging impact in several medical fields, such as nutrition, metabolism, and disease management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0df6f069570e4b17dd9070905173b56e0c34401176418d2750c14af0acb619f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
