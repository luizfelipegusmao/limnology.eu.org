{"title":"Electron Screening in Laboratory Nuclear Reactions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0669/v1","date":1725883512000,"content":"A thorough understanding of nuclear reaction rates at low energies is essential for improving our understanding of energy generation in stars and primordial and stellar nucleosynthesis. At low energies, fusion reactions between charged particles are strongly suppressed by the presence of the Coulomb barrier which classically inhibits the penetration of one nucleus into another. The barrier penetration causes the cross section to have a steep energy dependence at low energies, making cross section measurements very challenging. Furthermore, little is known about the impact of surrounding electrons in stellar plasmas that are currently beyond the reach of experiments. As a result, measuring the bare cross sections as accurately as possible is essential. Reaction rate measurements at very low energies have been made possible in recent years by the development of high-current low-energy accelerators as well as enhanced target and detection methods. Nevertheless, the presence of atomic electrons, which alter the Coulomb barrier by screening the nuclear charge and increase the cross section at low energies compared to the case of bare nuclei, complicates these observations. A review of the experimental and corresponding theoretical work on laboratory electron screening performed so far will be presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fbf97d9c7fc84bd784665ab49dc9bfe68c7858706e7d707de03023fd6e226c10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
