A primary care providerâ€™s personal smoking status has been identified as a potential barrier to tobacco treatment delivery. The aim of this qualitative study is to explore the experiences and perspectives of primary care providers regarding their role in, delivering smoking cessation interventions to patients based on their personal smoking status.\nMaterials and methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 primary care providers from 6 public primary care units in Central Macedonia Region, Greece. Thematic analysis was used to analyze data.\nResults: Healthcare providers who are current smokers may face unique challenges in effectively counseling patients on smoking cessation. On the contrast, non-smoking and especially previous smoking healthcare providers were noted to exhibit greater confidence and efficacy in delivering cessation support, often serving as role models for patients aiming to quit smoking. Participation in structured cessation training programs often catalyzed personal reflection among healthcare professionals regarding their own smoking behaviour.\nConclusions: Personal smoking status of primary care providers impacts the delivery of tobacco treatment, affecting their credibility and effectiveness in providing cessation support. Understanding the complex factors that influence the delivery of smoking cessation interventions in primary care is crucial, as these settings represent a vital point of contact for reaching individuals who smoke and providing them with the necessary support to quit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a98aac48e219fd46f498731adb8e2d7a5685159a523ddea5fea7e3c8af2ae7d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
