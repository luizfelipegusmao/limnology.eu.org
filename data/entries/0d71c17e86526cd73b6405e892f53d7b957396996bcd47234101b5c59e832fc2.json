{"title":"Airway Management and General Anesthesia in Pediatric Patients with Disabilities Undergoing Dental Surgery: A Retrospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0046/v1","date":1714535187000,"content":"The definition of patients with Special Needs (SN) is used in the literature to refer to individuals with mental and physical disorders for whom the usual perioperative pathways are not applicable due to lack of cooperation, regardless of age. Studies in the literature recognize the appropriateness of general anesthesia for performing day surgery dental care in this type of patient. The present retrospective, single-center, observational study involved 41 uncooperative patients aged between 3 and 17 undergoing dental surgery under general anesthesia.   The main objective was to assess the possible incidence of difficult airway management, understood as difficulty ventilating and/or intubating the patient. A secondary objective was to highlight the influence of general anesthesia on patient outcomes by testing the incidence of perioperative complications. Tracheal intubation was successfully completed in all of the patients considered, and in no case did the patient have to be woken up because of difficulty in airway management. No perioperative complications attributable to anesthesia were found in any patients. From the present experience, it can be concluded that general anesthesia is a suitable option for performing dental care in pediatric subjects with special needs, and that although the peculiar peri-operative management of these patients might increase the risk of possible anesthesia-related side effects, no complications have been encountered in any case.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d71c17e86526cd73b6405e892f53d7b957396996bcd47234101b5c59e832fc2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
