Results indicate that the discharge at East Humber River near Pine (ON) exhibits the highest statistically significant sensitivity, with 0.304 and 0.394 monthly units to the Dipole Mode Index (DMI) and Tropical North Atlantic (TNA), respectively. Monthly significance analysis also highlights the diverse influence of large-scale climate oscillations on river flow across the three locations. Wavelet analysis reveals significant active multidecadal oscillations for the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) at East Humber River near Pine, with high spectral power. We confirmed that stations within ON demonstrate sensitivities in a similar direction to the large-scale climate oscillations, contrasting with those observed at NL. The observed inconsistency in the relationship between large-scale climate oscillations and, for instance, NAO at various locations suggests that the impacts of climate oscillations may manifest differently in different regions. Overall, while inland stations exhibit similar sensitivity patterns, the coastal station demonstrates distinct responses, highlighting the importance of geographical context in understanding the impacts of large-scale climate oscillations on river flow dynamics.</p>","author":"Adeyemi Olusola, \nSamuel Ogunjo, \nChristiana F.
