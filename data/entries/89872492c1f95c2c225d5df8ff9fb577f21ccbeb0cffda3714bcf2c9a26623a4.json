This study systematically estimated the prevalence of compassion fatigue among healthcare professionals before and during COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa. A systematic review was conducted using keywords in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and grey literature, covering all literature published between 2012 and December 30, 2023. The search team independently conducted study selection, quality assessments, data extractions, and analysis of all included studies. The systematic review, reported following PRISMA guidelines, included 11 studies. The results show that the pooled overall prevalence of compassion fatigue in Sub-Saharan Africa was 70% (95% CI: 57–82, I<sup>2</sup> = 88.37%). The highest prevalence was found in Eastern Africa at 74% (95% CI: 55–93, I<sup>2</sup> = 94.40%), compared to 64% in Southern Africa (95% CI: 49–79, I<sup>2</sup> = 59.01%). Nurses reported the highest rates of compassion fatigue at 80% (95% CI: 57–100, I<sup>2</sup> = 34.77%), followed by general healthcare professionals at 59% (95% CI: 22–97, I<sup>2</sup> = 94.11%) and nursing students at 50% (95% CI: 35–64, I<sup>2</sup> = 0.00%). Before COVID-19, the overall prevalence of compassion fatigue was 66% (95% CI: 41–91, I<sup>2</sup> = 27%). During COVID-19, this increased to 74% (95% CI: 63–85, I<sup>2</sup> = 88.73%). Our results indicate that nearly 3 in 4 healthcare professionals in Sub-Saharan Africa experience compassion fatigue, and this prevalence increased due to the pandemic. The high prevalence underscores the importance of addressing and mitigating compassion fatigue to support the mental health and emotional well-being of healthcare professionals dedicated to helping others in challenging circumstances.\r\nSystematic registration: PROSPERO.
