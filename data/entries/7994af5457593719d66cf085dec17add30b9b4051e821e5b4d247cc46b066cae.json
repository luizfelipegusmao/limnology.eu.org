An innovate nutrient-efficient catfish-based (<i>Clarias gariepinus</i>) aquaponics system was implemented for producing two cultivars of two leafy vegetables largely consumed worldwide: lamb's lettuce (<i>Valerianella locusta</i> var. Favor and <i>Valerianella locusta</i> var. de Hollande) and arugula (<i>Eruca vesicaria</i> var. sativa and <i>Eruca sativa</i>). Different growing treatments (4 × 2 factorial design) were applied to plants of each cultivar, grown at two light intensities (120 and 400 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). During growth, several morphological characteristics (root length, plant height, leaf number, foliage diameter and biggest leaf length) were measured. At harvest, plants were weighed and examined qualitatively in terms of greenness and health status. Additionally, leaf extracts were obtained and used to determine total phenolic contents, antioxidant capacities, and levels of cytotoxicity to Caco-2 intestinal model cells.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>After a 5-week growth period, both lamb's lettuce cultivars presented high levels of greenness and health status, at both light intensities, particularly the var. de Hollande that also showed higher average performance in terms of plant morphology. In turn, arugula cultivars showed lower levels of greenness and health status, especially the cultivar <i>E. vesicaria</i> var. sativa submitted to direct sunlight during growth. In addition, plant specimens submitted to higher levels of light intensity showed higher contents in antioxidants/polyphenols. Cultivars with a higher content in antioxidants/polyphenols led to higher Caco-2 cell viability.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For successful industrial implementation of the aquaponics technology, different and optimized acclimatizing conditions must be applied to different plant species and cultivars. © 2024 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Fernando Sebastião, \nDaniela C Vaz, \nCristiana L Pires, \nPedro F Cruz, \nMaria João Moreno, \nRui M M Brito, \nLuis Cotrim, \nNelson Oliveira, \nAna Costa, \nAndré Fonseca, \nMaria Rodrigues, \nKirill Ispolnov, \nRaul Bernardino, \nJudite Vieira","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"7994af5457593719d66cf085dec17add30b9b4051e821e5b4d247cc46b066cae","category":"Environment"}
