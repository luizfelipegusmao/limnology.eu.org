These storms alter ocean currents, affecting how coral larvae and diseases spread. By modeling Hurricane Irma's impact in 2017, we found it increased long-distance coral larval exchanges but reduced overall larval supply. This created new connections, potentially not only aiding coral resilience but also speeding up the spread of coral diseases by a month. As hurricanes grow stronger, their dual effects will intensify, causing more variability in coral ecosystems and faster changes in their health and composition.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Climate change poses an existential threat to coral reefs. A warmer and more acidic ocean weakens coral ecosystems and increases the intensity of hurricanes. The wind–wave–current interactions during a hurricane deeply change the ocean circulation patterns and hence potentially affect the dispersal of coral larvae and coral disease agents. Here, we modeled the impact of major hurricane Irma (September 2017) on coral larval and stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) connectivity in Florida's Coral Reef. We coupled high-resolution coastal ocean circulation and wave models to simulate the dispersal of virtual coral larvae and disease agents between thousands of reefs. While being a brief event, our results suggest the passage of hurricane Irma strongly increased the probability of long-distance exchanges while reducing larval supply. It created new connections that could promote coral resilience but also probably accelerated the spread of SCTLD by about a month. As they become more intense, hurricanes' double-edged effect will become increasingly pronounced, contributing to increased variability in transport patterns and an accelerated rate of change within coral reef ecosystems.</p>","author":"Thomas Dobbelaere, \nApolline Dekens, \nAntoine Saint‐Amand, \nLauranne Alaerts, \nDaniel M.
