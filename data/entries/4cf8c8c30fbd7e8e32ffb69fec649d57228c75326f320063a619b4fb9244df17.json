{"title":"RNA-directed DNA methylation mutants reduce histone methylation at the paramutated maize booster1 enhancer","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1161/7608885?rss=1","date":1707955200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Paramutation is the transfer of mitotically and meiotically heritable silencing information between two alleles. With paramutation at the maize (<span>Zea mays</span>) <span>booster1</span> (<span>b1</span>) locus, the low-expressed <span>B</span>′ epiallele heritably changes the high-expressed <span>B-I</span> epiallele into <span>B′</span> with 100% frequency. This requires specific tandem repeats and multiple components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (encoded by <span>mediator of paramutation1</span>, <span>mop1</span>), the second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase IV and V (NRP(D/E)2a, encoded by <span>mop2</span>), and the largest subunit of RNA Polymerase IV (NRPD1, encoded by <span>mop3</span>). Mutations in <span>mop</span> genes prevent paramutation and release silencing at the <span>B′</span> epiallele. In this study, we investigated the effect of mutations in <span>mop1</span>, <span>mop2</span>, and <span>mop3</span> on chromatin structure and DNA methylation at the <span>B′</span> epiallele, and especially the regulatory hepta-repeat 100 kb upstream of the <span>b1</span> gene. Mutations in <span>mop1</span> and <span>mop3</span> resulted in decreased repressive histone modifications H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 at the hepta-repeat. Associated with this decrease were partial activation of the hepta-repeat enhancer function, formation of a multi-loop structure, and elevated <span>b1</span> expression. In <span>mop2</span> mutants, which do not show elevated <span>b1</span> expression, H3K9me2, H3K27me2 and a single-loop structure like in wild-type <span>B′</span> were retained. Surprisingly, high CG and CHG methylation levels at the <span>B′</span> hepta-repeat remained in all three mutants, and CHH methylation was low in both wild type and mutants. Our results raise the possibility of MOP factors mediating RNA-directed histone methylation rather than RNA-directed DNA methylation at the <span>b1</span> locus.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"4cf8c8c30fbd7e8e32ffb69fec649d57228c75326f320063a619b4fb9244df17","category":"Environment"}
