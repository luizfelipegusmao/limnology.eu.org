{"title":"Resources optimization using Pareto analysis for sea water desalination plants.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2463/v1","date":1722376485000,"content":"This study examines the potential of implementing a systematic approach to piloting desalination plants, with the objective of evaluating energy improvements in water desalination processes. The global scarcity of freshwater resources has significantly influenced the development of desalination technologies, with reverse osmosis emerging as one of the most prevalent and highly regarded methods. Pilot tests with the latest generation of reverse osmosis membranes in large desalination plants are becoming increasingly common. This is due to the fact that small-scale experiments are being carried out on the operation of new generation membranes with better salt rejection and lower energy consumption. The objective of this approach is to achieve the optimal water quality standard at the lowest possible cost. In this manner, pilot tests are being conducted prior to the determination of whether to alter the reverse osmosis membranes, as this represents a substantial investment. The objective of these tests is to minimise the risk of making an erroneous decision and to ensure optimal results in terms of energy consumption, operating costs and reduction of environmental impact, while complying with the requisite water quality standards. In this case, the Pareto analysis is employed to identify the two or three most significant causes whose treatment affects more than 80% of the potential energy savings to be implemented. This article introduces a novel approach to studying a total of 180 desalination plants at the territorial level in the Canaries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e9bda44a3dbf4499fc1e4b69e254118a86c9bbcb2ca90320941ed480056c7cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
