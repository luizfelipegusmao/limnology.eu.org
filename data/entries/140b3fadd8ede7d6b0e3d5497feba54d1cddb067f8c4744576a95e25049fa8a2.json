{"title":"Community-Based View on Diagnostic Imaging at the End of COVID-19 Pandemic: Online Survey-Assisted Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0087/v1","date":1711967265000,"content":"Background: Online survey-based observational cross-sectional study aimed at elucidating experience and attitudes of unstructured population regarding diagnostic imaging. Methods: Invitations to participate were distributed using mixed-mode design to deidentified residents aged 18 years and older. Main outcome measures included morbidity structure and incidence of diagnostic imaging administrations. Results: Respondents (n = 1069) aged 44.3 Â± 14.4 years; 32.8% suffered from cardiovascular diseases (CVD); 9.5% had chronic respiratory pathology; 28.9% considered themselves healthy. Respondents with COVID-19 history (49.7%) reported higher rates of computed tomography (CT) (p &amp;lt; .0001), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (p &amp;lt; .001), and ultrasound (p &amp;lt; .05). COVID-19 history in CVD respondents shifted imaging administrations towards CT and MRI (p &amp;lt; .05). Every tenth respondent received MRI, CT, and ultrasound on paid basis; 29.0% could not pay for diagnostic procedures; 13.1% reported unavailable MRI. Professional status significantly affected the pattern of diagnostic modalities (p &amp;lt; .05). MRI and CT availability differed between respondents in urban and rural areas (p &amp;lt; .0001). History of technogenic events predisposed responders to overestimate diagnostic value of fluorography (p &amp;lt; .05). Conclusions: Preparedness to future pandemics requires development of community-based outreach programs focusing on people's awareness regarding medical imaging safety and diagnostic value.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"140b3fadd8ede7d6b0e3d5497feba54d1cddb067f8c4744576a95e25049fa8a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
