{"title":"Simulation of Fidelity in Entanglement-Based Networks with Repeater Chains","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1071/v1","date":1728910042000,"content":"We implement a simulation environment on top of NetSquid that is specifically designed for estimating the end-to-end fidelity across a path of quantum repeaters or quantum switches. The switch model includes several generalizations which are not currently available in other tools, and are useful for gaining insight into practical and realistic quantum network engineering problems: an arbitrary number of memory registers at the switches, simplicity in including entanglement distillation mechanisms, arbitrary switching topologies, and more accurate models for the depolarization noise. An illustrative case study is presented, namely a comparison in terms of performance between a repeater chain where repeaters can only swap sequentially, and a single switch equipped with multiple memory registers, able to handle multiple swapping requests.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5901a41e73f8d5be6dd408cf4bcbdd3ecf9846f30b116875b782c3c4cc12b8c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
