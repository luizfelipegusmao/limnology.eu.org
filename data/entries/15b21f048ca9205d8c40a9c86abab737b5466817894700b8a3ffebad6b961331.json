{"title":"The Effects of Service Quality on an Online Shopping Mall on Consumption Behavior of Sporting Goods Consumers: Moderating Effects of Positive Emotion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2338/v1","date":1727682085000,"content":"The purpose of this study was to examine how factors that contribute to the service quality (responsiveness, product diversity, price fairness, and tangibles) offered by a sporting goods store on an online shopping mail affect shopping value. We also explore the moderating effects of positive emotions on the relationship between service quality and shopping value. A total of 654 respondents participated in the survey. The SPSS statistical package and smartPLS 4.0 were used to test the research hypotheses as well as to confirm the moderating effect. The study finds that the abovementioned factors that contribute to the quality of service provided by the online sportswear store had a significant effect on shopping value. Shopping value was in turn found to have a significant effect on customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction was in turn found to have a significant effect on shopping mall loyalty. The study finds that positive emotions do not have a moderating effect when responsiveness and tangibles affect shopping value. When product diversity and price fairness affect shopping value, however, the moderating effect of positive emotions was found. The results provide implications for practitioners who are concerned about improving the quality of service on online shopping malls. The results of this study contribute valuable guidance to marketers seeking to establish delivery-platform service-marketing strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15b21f048ca9205d8c40a9c86abab737b5466817894700b8a3ffebad6b961331","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
