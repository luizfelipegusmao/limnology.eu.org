{"title":"Evaluating the effects of benzoic acid on nursery and finishing pig growth performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae049/7640573?rss=1","date":1712188800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Three studies were conducted evaluating the use of benzoic acid in swine diets. In experiment 1, 350 weanling barrows (DNA 200 × 400; initially 5.9 ± 0.04 kg) were allotted to one of the five dietary treatments with 14 pens per treatment. Diets were fed in three phases: phase 1 from weaning to day 10, phase 2 from days 10 to 18, and phase 3 from days 18 to 38. Treatment 1 contained no benzoic acid throughout all three phases (weaning to day 42). Treatment 2 included 0.50% benzoic acid throughout all three phases. Treatment 3 contained 0.50% benzoic acid in phases 1 and 2, and 0.25% benzoic acid in phase 3. Treatment 4 contained 0.50% benzoic acid in phases 1 and 2, and no benzoic acid in phase 3. Treatment 5 contained 0.50% benzoic acid in phase 1, 0.25% benzoic acid in phase 2, and no benzoic acid in phase 3. For the overall period, pigs fed 0.50% in the first two phases and 0.25% benzoic acid in the final phase had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) average daily gain (average daily gain) than pigs fed no benzoic acid through all three phases, or pigs fed 0.50% in the first two phases and no benzoic acid in the final phase, with pigs fed the other treatments intermediate. Pigs fed 0.50% in the first two phases and 0.25% benzoic acid in the final phase had improved (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) compared with pigs fed no benzoic acid throughout all three phases, pigs fed 0.50% in the first two phases and no benzoic acid in the third phase, or pigs fed 0.50%, 0.25%, and no benzoic acid, respectively. For experiment 2, a 101-d trial was conducted using two groups of 1,053 finishing pigs (2,106 total pigs; PIC 337 × 1,050; initially 33.3 ± 1.9 kg). Dietary treatments were corn–soybean meal-dried distillers grains with solubles-based with the addition of none, 0.25%, or 0.50% benzoic acid. Overall, pigs fed increasing benzoic acid had a tendency for increased average daily feed intake (linear, <span>P</span> = 0.083) but decreased G:F (linear, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). In experiment 3, 2,162 finishing pigs (DNA 600 × PIC 1050; initially 31.4 ± 2.2 kg) were used in a 109-d trial. Dietary treatments were formulated with or without 0.25% benzoic acid. For the overall experimental period, pigs fed benzoic acid had increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) G:F. In summary, feeding benzoic acid elicits improved growth performance when fed throughout the entire nursery period while improved G:F in growing-finishing pigs was observed in one experiment, but not in the other.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"c4ee5dd20487d54cd65e1c0e086c8038ca21e974a41438ad50df842a6cd41622","category":"Environment"}
