This study aimed to investigate whether socioeconomic factors, namely educational attainment, household income, marital status, and employment status, were associated with pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) categories, including severe-moderate underweight (BMI ≤ 16.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), mild underweight (BMI, 17.0–18.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overweight (BMI, 25.0–29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and obese (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) among Japanese pregnant women using data from the Japan Environment and Children’s Study (JECS). In total, pregnant women were included 96,751. Age- and parity-adjusted multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses assessed socioeconomic factors and smoking associations with falling within abnormal BMI categories (normal BMI as the reference group). Lower education and lower household were associated with overweight and obesity, and, especially, lowest education and household income had relatively higher point estimate relative ratios (RRs) of 3.97 and 2.84, respectively. Regarding the risks for underweight, however, only junior high school education had a significantly higher RR for severely to moderately underweight. Regarding occupational status, homemakers or the unemployed had a higher RR for severe-moderate underweight, overweight, and obesity. Unmarried, divorced, or bereaved women had significantly higher RRs for mildly underweight status. Quitting smoking early in pregnancy/still smoking had higher RRs for all four not having normal BMI outcomes; however, quitting smoking before pregnancy had a higher RR only for obese individuals. Lower educational attainment and smoking are essential intervention targets for obesity and severe-moderate underweight prevention in younger women. Lower household income is also a necessary target for obesity.","author":"Yasuaki Saijo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e9cb06017c0ddb9c24ed1564f806c2ee8e17cc98f32e0dc3b51ef14f7ec6d9da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
