{"title":"Anuran swingers: misdirected mating attempts occurred early during anuran diversification","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/141/4/529/7257491?rss=1","date":1693440000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Promiscuity, explosive breeding and male-biased operational sex-ratios can affect the strength of male selectivity and may play major roles in the expression of misdirected matings (with conspecific males, other species, corpses or objects) in anuran amphibians. Yet, misdirected amplexus occur in multiple species diverging from these reproductive traits, suggesting that the expression of such behaviour is widespread, and may have occurred early during anuran diversification. Using two methods of ancestral-trait reconstruction which predict unknown states, we found a very high probability that most anuran genera express misdirected amplexus, suggesting that this by-product of anuran reproductive strategies is likely to have occurred early during anuran diversification. The persistence of misdirected amplexus suggests that its infrequent occurrence may outweigh individual costs of breeding attempts with unfit mates. We found a recent exponential increase in reported observations of misdirected amplexus, which, along with increased research effort and publication rate, may reveal an effect of environmental perturbations known to promote the occurrence of these behaviours.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"b0674419c83b244aab07e90dae6806968f38170e2d9e9fc410a4ef526828c1cb","category":"Environment"}
