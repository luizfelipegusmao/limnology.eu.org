{"title":"Phenotypic plasticity, and temporal and spatial variation in the relative abundance of lentic brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, across Ontario","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15761?af=R","date":1721274433000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Brook trout (<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>) are a highly prized species found in lakes and streams throughout Ontario. A broadscale monitoring program (BsM) has been conducted in lakes throughout the province, in 5-year cycles, which targets <i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i> populations. The objective of this study was to use the data gained from the BsM and establish a contemporary baseline on the variation of relative abundance and demographics of natural lake populations of <i>S</i>. <i>fontinalis</i> in Ontario. Additionally, given the variability in environmental conditions across the landscape, an objective was to assess the factors, abiotic and biotic, that influence relative abundance among waterbodies. Over the three BsM cycles (2008â€“2022), 273 <i>S</i>. <i>fontinalis</i> waterbodies were assessed, some multiple times, and 124 were unique populations. <i>S. fontinalis</i> were sampled in 112 of these unique lakes. In total, 7487 <i>S</i>. <i>fontinalis</i> were caught and 5372 were fully sampled (length, weight, and age assessed). The mean catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in all waterbodies was 1.4 (0.12 standard error) <i>S</i>. <i>fontinalis</i> per net gang. There was not a significant trend in CPUE over the three BsM cycles nor did CPUE vary significantly among BsM cycles at the provincial scale, but CPUE varied significantly among fisheries management zones (FMZs). Multiple variables were examined to explain the variation in CPUE across the province; a negative association with species diversity was the only variable considered significant. Furthermore, <i>S</i>. <i>fontinalis</i> were more associated with the relative abundance of small cyprinids (i.e., chubs and shiners) and negatively associated with centrarchids, smelt, and other game species. Mean growth potential was greater for males than females but not significantly, whereas longevity favored females. Growth potential and parameters were similar between sexes within FMZs but varied among FMZs. Mean survival among these populations was 25.7%, ranging from 15.2% to 45.6%, with a mean instantaneous mortality of 1.41. This study provided a contemporary assessment of the current range and variability in relative abundance population dynamics of <i>S</i>. <i>fontinalis</i> in lakes within Ontario. This provides a benchmark to assess changes with the pending stressors of climate change and human expansion across the landscape.</p>","author":"Tim Haxton, \nHelen Ball, \nMichael J.
