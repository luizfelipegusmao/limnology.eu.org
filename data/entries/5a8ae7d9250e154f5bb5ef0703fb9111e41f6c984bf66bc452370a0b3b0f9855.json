{"title":"Geometric Interpretation of the Minkowski Metric","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/201809.0417/v4","date":1716156183000,"content":"In this article it is shown, first, that a change of basis in Minkowski space is equivalent to a change of basis in Euclidean space if a basis element is replaced by its dual element, constituting a mixed basis set. Second, that such mixed bases can be interpreted as a measurement system used by local, flat observers whose direct distance measurements are restricted to an (nâˆ’1)-dimensional submanifold in an n-dimensional Euclidean space. Combining these steps, it is concluded that a local, flat observer in a four-dimensional Euclidean space measures a Minkowski spacetime. This interpretation could be useful for theories in special relativity and related fields that rely on spacetime concepts, as it offers a more intuitive geometric understanding of the Minkowski metric.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a8ae7d9250e154f5bb5ef0703fb9111e41f6c984bf66bc452370a0b3b0f9855","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
