{"title":"Bridging Biological and Materials Research Through Cryo-EM","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.1067/7720315?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Lena’s seminal contributions to both biology and materials research has generated significant impact on the scientific community and inspired researchers to think beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. For example, her pioneering cryo-STEM work [<a href=\"#ozae044.1067-B1\">1</a>] revealed the first nanoscale details of the liquid-solid interfaces present in battery materials, encouraging future studies on the swelling behavior of these sensitive and difficult-to-access interfaces [<a href=\"#ozae044.1067-B2\">2</a>]. In this talk, I will share my unique perspective on the development of cryo-EM for battery research, starting from my time as a graduate student and now as an independent researcher. I will highlight key innovations and new findings enabled by cryo-EM that have transformed how we understand battery operation and failure modes. Motivated by Lena’s careful and rigorous tests of dose tolerance at cryogenic temperatures, we place an emphasis on cryo-EM best practices to avoid experimental artifacts. Finally, I will present preliminary cryo-EM innovations that go beyond current limitations of the technique as used in structural biology, offering insights and approaches that can better bridge and strengthen the connection between biological and materials research.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2ac802cd57b462bc0f7f774366fb1f28f7947db9ec9aaa5ddc581e66c243880d","category":"Environment"}
