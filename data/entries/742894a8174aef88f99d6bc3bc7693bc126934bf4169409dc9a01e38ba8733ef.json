{"title":"Imaging Spectroscopy for the Mining Life Cycle: A Guide for Drone Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1430/v1","date":1711352860000,"content":"Hyperspectral imaging data holds great potential for the different stages of the mining life cycle in active and post-mining environments. However, the technology has yet to reach the stage of large-scale industrial implementation and acceptance. While hyperspectral satellite imagery can achieve high spectral resolution, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and global availability with break-through satellite systems like EnMAP, EMIT and PRISMA, limited spatial resolution poses chal-lenges for sectors like mining, which require decimetre to centimetre scale resolution for applica-tions such as reconciliation, ore/waste estimates, geotechnical assessments and environmental monitoring. Hyperspectral imaging from drones (referred to herein as Uncrewed Aerial Systems; UASs) offers high spatial resolution data relevant to the camp/ mine scale, with the capability for frequent, user-defined re-visit times. This has been made possible by the miniaturization of hy-perspectral imaging systems. Collection of data in the visible to near and shortwave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) wavelength regions enables the detection of different minerals and surface altera-tion patterns potentially revealing crucial information for exploration, extraction, re-mining, waste remediation, and rehabilitation. In this paper, we provide a review of relevant studies de-ploying hyperspectral imaging in or applicable to the mining sector, especially for the use of hy-perspectral VNIR-SWIR Uncrewed Aerial Systems. Where required, we draw on previous in-sights derived from satellite or ground-based systems. We also discuss UAS survey planning, and sampling considerations for validation and interpretation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"742894a8174aef88f99d6bc3bc7693bc126934bf4169409dc9a01e38ba8733ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
