{"title":"Spermidine supplementation in honey bees: Autophagy and epigenetic modifications","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306430","date":1719842400000,"content":"<p>by Danijela Kojić, Jelena Spremo, Srđana Đorđievski, Tatjana Čelić, Elvira Vukašinović, Ivan Pihler, Jelena Purać</p>\r\n\r\nPolyamines (PAs), including putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd), and spermine (Spm), are essential polycations with wide-ranging roles in cellular functions. PA levels decline with age, making exogenous PA supplementation, particularly Spd, an intriguing prospect. Previous research in honey bees demonstrated that millimolar Spd added to their diet increased lifespan and reinforced oxidative resilience. The present study is aimed to assess the anti-aging effects of spermidine supplementation at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mM in honey bees, focusing on autophagy and associated epigenetic changes. Results showed a more pronounced effect at the lower Spd concentration, primarily in the abdomen. Spd induced site-specific histone 3 hypoacetylation at sites K18 and 27, hyperacetylation at K9, with no change at K14 in the entire body. Additionally, autophagy-related genes (ATG3, 5, 9, 13) and genes associated with epigenetic changes (<i>HDAC1</i>, <i>HDAC3</i>, <i>SIRT1</i>, <i>KAT2A</i>, <i>KAT6B</i>, <i>P300</i>, <i>DNMT1A</i>, <i>DNMT1B</i>) were upregulated in the abdomens of honey bees. In conclusion, our findings highlight profound epigenetic changes and autophagy promotion due to spermidine supplementation, contributing to increased honey bee longevity. Further research is needed to fully understand the precise mechanisms and the interplay between epigenetic alterations and autophagy in honey bees, underscoring the significance of autophagy as a geroprotective mechanism.","author":"Danijela Kojić","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"940f14d6f5fdb2d852471eb2bb9a2cff699a031ca41d3f327fa518dec97b9ddd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
