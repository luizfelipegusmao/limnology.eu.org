{"title":"Sharp Coefficient Bounds for Starlike Functions Associated with Cosine Function","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0065/v1","date":1717460897000,"content":"Let $\\mathcal{\\mathcal{S}}_{\\cos}^{\\ast}$ denote the class of normalized analytic functions $f$ in the open unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ satisfying the subordination $\\dfrac{zf^{\\prime}(z)}{f(z)}\\prec\\cos z$. In the second section of this article we find the sharp upper bounds for the initial coefficients $a_{3}$, $a_{4}$ and $a_{5}$ and the sharp upper bound for module of the Hankel determinant $|H_{2,3}(f)|$ for the functions from the class $\\mathcal{S}_{\\cos}^{\\ast}$. The first result of the next section deals with the sharp upper bounds of the logarithmic coefficients $\\gamma_{3}$ and $\\gamma_{4}$ and we found in addition the sharp upper bound for $\\left|H_{2,2}\\left(F_{f}/2\\right)\\right|$. For obtaining these results we used the very useful and appropriate Lemma 2.4 of N.E. Cho et al. [Filomat 34(6) (2020), 2061--2072], and the technique for finding the maximum value of a three variable function on a closed cuboid. All the maximum found values were checked by using MAPLE\\texttrademark{} computare software, and we also found the extremal functions in each cases. All of our present results are the best ones and give sharp versions of those recently published in [Hacet. J. Math. Stat. 52, 596--618, 2023].","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"faab1857136635d00475c253f95f2df4d5ca7597ebecc9e8e0397efdbe90c334","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
