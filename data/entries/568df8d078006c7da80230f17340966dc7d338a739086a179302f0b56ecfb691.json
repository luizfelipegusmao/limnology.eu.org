{"title":"Multiscalar Imaging: a Workflow for Combining Large Scale Context and High Resolution Imaging in Fixed Biological Samples","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.411/7719696?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Many diseases manifest as a result of cellular damage. Microscopy serves as a vital tool for visualizing these cellular alterations. Only electron microscopy (EM) provides sufficient resolution and the dense visualization required for examination of complete subcellular changes in cells and tissues. Over the past decade, EM sample preparation techniques have surpassed previous sample size limitations, however, imaging time, dataset size, and large scale three-dimensional data acquisition remain limitations. Even comparatively low resolution (e.g. 1um/voxel), large scale context, specifically in three dimensions, can provide critical insight to diagnose and assess tissue conditions. Micro-computed tomography (microCT) is helpful for large-scale imaging in three dimensions, but limited in resolution. Electron microscopy, by contrast, is limited in the volume size of an imageable region of interest, but provides unsurpassed high-context image resolution. Here we explore the use of multiscalar imaging techniques, combining microCT and EM to analyze various sample types across scales. Sample preparation through heavy metal staining and resin embedding is not only compatible between the two types of instruments, but enhances contrast in both. Our research explores the usefulness of the combination of these techniques, and the development of associated workflows and sample preparation methods, specific to the examination of biological tissues.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"568df8d078006c7da80230f17340966dc7d338a739086a179302f0b56ecfb691","category":"Environment"}
