{"title":"&ldquo;Quantum Jumps&rdquo; as Bifurcations in Non-Linear Soliton-Type Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1319/v1","date":1729186029000,"content":"Non-linear superposition of solitons provide almost linear branches as well as ``quantum jumps\" to stable particle-like cores. Can the quest for possible non--linearity of quantum mechanics and the ``collapse paradox\" of the wave function in (non-)linear quantum mechanics be resolved by transitions between different quasi-linear branches of the corresponding Whitney surface?","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb9259f3d416df4c4d499bb8b2dbe5bea7c15a5625de1d9f20f496e106532841","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
