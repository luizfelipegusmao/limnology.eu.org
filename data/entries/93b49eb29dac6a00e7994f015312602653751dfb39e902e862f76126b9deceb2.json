{"title":"Exogenous application of the apocarotenoid retinaldehyde negatively regulates auxin-mediated root growth","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1659/7730214?rss=1","date":1723161600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Root development is essential for plant survival. The lack of carotenoid biosynthesis in the <span>phytoene desaturase 3</span> (<span>pds3</span>) mutant results in short primary roots (PRs) and reduced lateral root formation. In this study, we showed that short-term inhibition of PDS by fluridone suppresses PR growth in wild type, but to a lesser extent in auxin mutants of <span>Arabidopsis</span> (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). Such an inhibition of PDS activity increased endogenous indole-3-acetic acid levels, promoted auxin signaling, and partially complemented the PR growth of an auxin-deficient mutant, the <span>YUCCA 3 5 7 8 9</span> quadruple mutant (<span>yucQ</span>). The exogenous application of retinaldehyde (retinal), an apocarotenoid derived from Î²-carotene, complemented the fluridone-induced suppression of root growth, as well as the short roots of the <span>pds3</span> mutant. Retinal also partially complemented the auxin-induced suppression of root growth. These results suggest that retinal may play a role in regulating root growth by modulating endogenous auxin levels.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"93b49eb29dac6a00e7994f015312602653751dfb39e902e862f76126b9deceb2","category":"Environment"}
