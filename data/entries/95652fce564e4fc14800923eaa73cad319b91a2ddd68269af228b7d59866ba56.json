{"title":"Silicon Induces Salt Stress Amelioration in Sunflower Plants by Improving Photosynthetic Pigments and Mineral Status","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1532/v1","date":1729504456000,"content":"This research aimed to explore the effects of Silicon (Si) on managing hydrogen peroxide levels, photosynthetic pigment content, nutrient accumulation, and the production of root and shoot dry biomass in salt-stressed sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) plants. Conducted in a glasshouse, the experiment followed a completely randomized block design in a factorial arrangement (2 Ã— 2) and five replicates. Pots were divided into two groups: non-salt stressed, and salt stressed (100 mM NaCl), both with Si (2 mM as stabilized sodium and potassium silicate) and without Si. The study found that Si effectively reduced hydrogen peroxide concentration and enhanced photosynthetic pigments, nutrient status, and plant growth. The results showed that Si alleviated salt stress effects in sunflower plants by significantly lowering hydrogen peroxide levels and increasing photosynthetic pigments and nutrient accumulation, leading to greater root and shoot dry biomass. These findings indicate that adding Si to the growth medium is crucial for enhancing resistance to salt-induced ionic and osmotic stress, making it a promising strategy for improving crop growth and management in saline conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95652fce564e4fc14800923eaa73cad319b91a2ddd68269af228b7d59866ba56","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
