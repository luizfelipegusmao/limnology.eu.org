{"title":"Perception of the Sustainable Cattle Ranching Concept in Producers, Extension Agents and Officials of Oaxaca, Mexico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1805/v1","date":1724653677000,"content":"The sustainability concept has acquired a variety of meanings according to different currents of thought and the context in which it is used. The aim of this research was to characterize the perception of producers, extension agents and officials regarding sustainable cattle ranching (SCR) in an area where tropical cattle ranching is practiced. A survey was applied to producers chosen through stratified random sampling, and to extension agents and officials selected using the snowball technique. The perception of SCR was determined under two contexts: 1) the idea or interpretation of the individual and 2) the assessment (positive or negative) of this type of cattle ranching (net perception index, NPI). The extension agents oriented their perception of SCR mainly in economic (52.2%) and environmental (47.8%) aspects, similar to the producers (48.4% and 21.3% respectively), while the officials related it more to an environmental dimension (71.4%). It is concluded that the perception of SCR in general is positive, but its conceptualization is differentiated, according to the role the individuals play in the activity, their academic training and their expectations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b92a79719a4d71811e252cbae7dd3ca75eef81ec6dfc4f2497cb6194adc7f92","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
