{"title":"Comparison of Superselective Renal Artery Embolization versus Retroperitoneal Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy in Ruptured Hemorrhagic Renal Angiomyolipoma: A Single-Center Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1266/v1","date":1721111224000,"content":"Purpose: To analyze the clinical efficacy of superselective renal artery embolization and retroperitoneal laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for the treatment of ruptured hemorrhagic renal angiomyolipoma and to provide a reference for the selection of treatment methods for ruptured hemorrhagic renal angiomyolipoma. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 24 patients who were diagnosed with ruptured hemorrhagic renal angiomyolipoma at the Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University between January 2019 and December 2021. Among them, 10 patients were treated with superselective arterial embolization (SAE), and 14 patients were treated with retroperitoneal laparoscopic part nephrectomy (RLPN). The differences between the two treatment methods in terms of hospital stay, hospital costs, anesthesia method, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative bed rest time, antibiotic dosage, postoperative complication rate, tumor diameter changes, creatinine value changes, hemoglobin value changes, tumor recurrence rate, and reoperation rate were compared. Results: All patients completed the treatment and were discharged. There were no significant differences in length of hospital stay, hospital costs, creatinine change values, or postoperative complication rates between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). However, there were statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) in surgical time (85.50±19.94 min vs. 141.07±76.33 min), intraoperative blood loss (21.50±14.72 ml vs. 153.57±97.00 ml), postoperative bed rest time (22.7±1.56 h vs. 41.21±3.57 h), preoperative hemoglobin levels (94.7 ±23.62 g/L vs. 113.79 ±17.83 g/L), and hemoglobin changes (-6.60 ±10.36 g/L vs. -15.21 ±8.79 g/L) between the two groups. Both groups of patients had an average follow-up period of 22 months, and patients in the SAE group had a mean reduction of 3.33 cm in tumor diameter within the follow-up period compared with the preembolization period (P &lt; 0.05). None of the patients in the SAE group experienced rebleeding, and there was no tumor recurrence in either group. Conclusion: SAE and RLPN are effective treatments for ruptured renal angiomyolipoma with good outcomes. Furthermore, compared to RLPN, SAE offers advantages such as simplicity of operation, minimal trauma, shorter surgical time, minimal impact on hemoglobin levels, shorter bed rest time, faster postoperative recovery, and maximal preservation of renal units.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f6a5b903d17a6e319cebba150a360a66672bc9fbff5390c9b6715ab82d3b4f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
