The use of 2D sheets, heterogeneous interfaces, and moir√© structures has emerged as a promising method to induce exotic quantum effects. However, studying these materials using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has been limited by stage instability. Achieving stable atomic-scale imaging at cryogenic temperatures, particularly in techniques like atomic-scale 4D-STEM imaging and monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), is expected to provide valuable information for probing key parameters in quantum materials. Recent improvements in stage designs by manufacturers offer opportunities for related research. In this presentation, I will delineate our ongoing research endeavors employing atomic-scale cryogenic STEM and EELS techniques to delve into lattice-spin-charge coupling in 2D van der Waals materials. I will provide two illustrative examples: firstly, the investigation of phase transitions in thin-flake trichlorides for potential spintronics applications, and secondly, the exploration of magnetic phase transitions in Fe<sub>5</sub>GeTe<sub>2</sub>, notable for its remarkable high-temperature stability of magnetism.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"88b0e589686a2227dadd62627d3c644b924c282ed34e44aab50e27343ae02c29","category":"Environment"}
