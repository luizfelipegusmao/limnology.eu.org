{"title":"Exact Unlearning with Convex and Non-Convex Functions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2061/v1","date":1727362754000,"content":"Machine unlearning, the process of selectively forgetting or removing the influence of specific data points from a machine learning model, is increasingly important for privacy and compliance with regulations like the GDPR. This paper explores the concept of exact unlearning, focusing on its implementation in models trained using convex and non-convex functions. Convex functions, due to their well-behaved optimization landscapes, lend themselves to efficient unlearning through methods such as inverse optimization, duality-based approaches, and incremental learning. In contrast, non-convex functions, common in deep learning models, present more complex challenges due to their multiple local minima and high-dimensional parameter spaces. Techniques like checkpoint-based retraining, gradient inversion, and meta-learning are discussed as viable, though computationally expensive, methods for non-convex exact unlearning. The paper also highlights real-world applications in fields such as finance and healthcare, where exact unlearning can enhance privacy and security without compromising model performance. Finally, it outlines key challenges and future research directions, particularly the need for more efficient unlearning algorithms in non-convex settings and the development of secure, adversarial-resistant methods for sensitive data removal.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e054bcf6a1a47b4a643e93896497bbd8d66a28454ff322cce2ed937bea4fc7e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
