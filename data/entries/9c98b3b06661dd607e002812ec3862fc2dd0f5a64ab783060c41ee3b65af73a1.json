{"title":"Depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and health-related quality of life in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: A population-based study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308079","date":1722348000000,"content":"<p>by Johanna Andersson, Martin Maripuu, Mathilda Sj√∂vill, Anna Lindam, Katarina Laurell</p>\r\nBackground <p>Maximising quality of life is a central goal for all healthcare, especially when dealing with dementing disorders. In this study we aimed to compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL), depressive symptoms and functional impairment between individuals with and without idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) from the general population.</p> Methods <p>A total of 122 individuals, 30 with iNPH (median age 75 years, 67 females) underwent neurological examinations and computed tomography of the brain with standardised rating of imaging findings and clinical symptoms. The participants completed the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and the HRQoL instrument EQ5D-5L. In addition, the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used to evaluate functional impairment.</p> Results <p>Compared with participants without iNPH, those with iNPH reported a higher score on GDS-15 (median 3 <i>vs</i> 1) and mRS (median 2 <i>vs</i> 1) (p &lt; 0.05). Further, those with iNPH rated lower on EQ5D-5L (index 0.79, VAS 70) than those without iNPH (index 0.86, VAS 80) (p &lt; 0.05). In logistic regression models, low HRQoL was associated with more depressive symptoms, a higher degree of iNPH symptoms, and lower functional status.</p> Conclusions <p>In this population-based sample, those with iNPH had more depressive symptoms, lower functional status, and worse quality of life compared to those without iNPH. The strongest association with low HRQoL was found for depressive symptoms, functional level, and degree of iNPH symptoms. These results underline the value of shunt surgery because of its potential to reduce symptoms and disability in iNPH and therefore improve HRQoL.</p>","author":"Johanna Andersson","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9c98b3b06661dd607e002812ec3862fc2dd0f5a64ab783060c41ee3b65af73a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
