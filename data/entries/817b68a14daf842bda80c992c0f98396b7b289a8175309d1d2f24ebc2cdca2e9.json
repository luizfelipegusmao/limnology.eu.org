{"title":"Two structurally different oomycete lipophilic microbe-associated molecular patterns induce distinctive plant immune responses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/479/7686355?rss=1","date":1717372800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants recognize a variety of external signals and induce appropriate mechanisms to increase their tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Precise recognition of attacking pathogens and induction of effective resistance mechanisms are critical functions for plant survival. Some molecular patterns unique to a certain group of microbes, microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), are sensed by plant cells as nonself molecules via pattern recognition receptors. While MAMPs of bacterial and fungal origin have been identified, reports on oomycete MAMPs are relatively limited. This study aimed to identify MAMPs from an oomycete pathogen <span>Phytophthora infestans</span>, the causal agent of potato late blight. Using reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and phytoalexin production in potato (<span>Solanum tuberosum</span>) as markers, two structurally different groups of elicitors, namely ceramides and diacylglycerols, were identified. <span>P. infestans</span> ceramides (Pi-Cer A, B, and D) induced ROS production, while diacylglycerol (Pi-DAG A and B), containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as a substructure, induced phytoalexins production in potato. The molecular patterns in Pi-Cers and Pi-DAGs essential for defense induction were identified as 9-methyl-4,8-sphingadienine (9Me-Spd) and 5,8,11,14-tetraene-type fatty acid (5,8,11,14-TEFA), respectively. These structures are not found in plants, but in oomycetes and fungi, indicating that they are microbe molecular patterns recognized by plants. When Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) was treated with Pi-Cer D and EPA, partially overlapping but different sets of genes were induced. Furthermore, expression of some genes is upregulated only after the simultaneous treatment with Pi-Cer D and EPA, indicating that plants combine the signals from simultaneously recognized MAMPs to adapt their defense response to pathogens.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"817b68a14daf842bda80c992c0f98396b7b289a8175309d1d2f24ebc2cdca2e9","category":"Environment"}
