{"title":"Metabolic Periparturient Diseases in Small Ruminants: An Update","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2196/v1","date":1727427654000,"content":"Metabolic diseases are major diseases affecting animal welfare, health and production of small ruminants´ flocks for dairy and meat purposes. In breeding females, they mainly occur from six to eight weeks before and after parturition, respectively. The pregnancy toxemia and lactational ketosis are manifestations of hyperketonemia, primarily due to energetic deficit. Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia are related to the metabolic availably of calcium and magnesium, respectively. This review aimed to identify and discuss the current and most relevant aspects related to individual and herd heath management of these interrelated metabolic diseases with impact in the sheep and goats´ farm sustainability. These diseases are primarily due to nutritional deficit, but homeostatic and homeorhetic disruptions are responsible for clinical signs and forms. Currently, their clinical diagnosis and monitoring are mainly supported by biochemistry from animal fluids, and bromatological evaluation of the feed. Epidemiological studies, measuring risks factors, also contributes for their prevention. Nevertheless, research on specific biomarkers and composite indexes related to these diseases, in a context of herd health management and precision medicine, are new pathways driven to a suitable and efficient animal production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"763d0e7ea11e493b2391627886fdc0d154156f324d9e96d6c07567562c22191a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
