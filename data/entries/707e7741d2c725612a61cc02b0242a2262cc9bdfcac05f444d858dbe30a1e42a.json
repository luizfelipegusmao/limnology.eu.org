{"title":"A cornucopia of diversityâ€”Ranunculales as a model lineage","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/7/1800/7477764?rss=1","date":1702857600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The <span>Ranunculales</span> are a hyperdiverse lineage in many aspects of their phenotype, including growth habit, floral and leaf morphology, reproductive mode, and specialized metabolism. Many <span>Ranunculales</span> species, such as opium poppy and goldenseal, have a high medicinal value. In addition, the order includes a large number of commercially important ornamental plants, such as columbines and larkspurs. The phylogenetic position of the order with respect to monocots and core eudicots and the diversity within this lineage make the <span>Ranunculales</span> an excellent group for studying evolutionary processes by comparative studies. Lately, the phylogeny of <span>Ranunculales</span> was revised, and genetic and genomic resources were developed for many species, allowing comparative analyses at the molecular scale. Here, we review the literature on the resources for genetic manipulation and genome sequencing, the recent phylogeny reconstruction of this order, and its fossil record. Further, we explain their habitat range and delve into the diversity in their floral morphology, focusing on perianth organ identity, floral symmetry, occurrences of spurs and nectaries, sexual and pollination systems, and fruit and dehiscence types. The <span>Ranunculales</span> order offers a wealth of opportunities for scientific exploration across various disciplines and scales, to gain novel insights into plant biology for researchers and plant enthusiasts alike.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"707e7741d2c725612a61cc02b0242a2262cc9bdfcac05f444d858dbe30a1e42a","category":"Environment"}
