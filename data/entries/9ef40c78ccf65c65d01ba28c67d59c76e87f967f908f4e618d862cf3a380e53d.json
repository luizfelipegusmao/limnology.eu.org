{"title":"Detrimental Effects of Abiotic Stress on Wheat and Its Management Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0715/v1","date":1725965688000,"content":"Worldwide the severity of abiotic stress like heat, drought, salinity, cold, waterlogging, etc. are being increased because of global warming. Wheat crops must adapt to harsh environments through physiological, molecular, and genetic manipulation. Because of abiotic stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced in wheat plants break down DNA and RNA bases, protein, lipid, and other macro- and micromolecules, resulting in stunted growth and yield decline. Abiotic stress also induces the crop's molecular functions, physiological, biological, and cellular processes, and their compositions. Different stressors like high light intensity, heat, drought, and salinity also impair photosynthesis damaging various pigments. Antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), etc. synthesized in harsh environments can ameliorate ROS/RNS produced in oxidative stress. Under abiotic stress, heat shock proteins (HSPs) heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) in heat stress, and dehydration-responsive element binding proteins (DREBs) in drought stress are activated to synthesize proteins to mitigate the deleterious effects of those stressors. Na+ exclusive genes (NAX1, NAX2) and Na+/H+ (K+) antiporter genes (NHX1, NHX2) hinder those ions from uptake into leaf sheaths and blades of wheat resulting in the declination of salinity in plants. Exogenous hormones like gibberellic acid, salicylic acid, and melatonin, etc., and osmoprotectants like proline, and gene manipulation in plants through genetic engineering are being employed to mitigate the toxic effects of abiotic stress on plants, as portrayed in many literatures. The review depicts how abiotic stress affects phenotypic, physiological, and molecular structures and functions of wheat crops, and their mitigation strategies to lessen their noxious effects on wheat.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ef40c78ccf65c65d01ba28c67d59c76e87f967f908f4e618d862cf3a380e53d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
