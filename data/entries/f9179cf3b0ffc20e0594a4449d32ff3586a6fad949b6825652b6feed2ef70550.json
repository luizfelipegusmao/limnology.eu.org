{"title":"Find your way: Building an atlas from transcription factor activities in the Marchantia gemma","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2053/7614884?rss=1","date":1708992000000,"content":"<span>Liverworts are often found in moist places worldwide, especially in humid tropical regions, in damp wooded areas on tree trunks, damp soil and rocks, and in gardens. At first glance, their organs resemble root- and leaf-like structures of vascular plants. But in contrast to vascular plants, which have a dominant diploid (sporophytic) life form, liverworts are mostly haploid (gametophytic) throughout their life cycle (<a href=\"#koae061-B2\">Kohchi et al. 2021</a>). The haploid spores divide and form a leaf-like lobe, the thallus. On its surface, the thallus forms gemma cups that contain gemmae, small discs with lateral, slightly indented apical notches (<a href=\"#koae061-F1\">Fig. 1, A and B</a>) (<a href=\"#koae061-B2\">Kohchi et al. 2021</a>). Similar to the shoot apical meristem of vascular plants, liverworts maintain a stem cell population in the vegetative gametophyte meristem, but to date we do not know much about its regulatory networks.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"f9179cf3b0ffc20e0594a4449d32ff3586a6fad949b6825652b6feed2ef70550","category":"Environment"}
