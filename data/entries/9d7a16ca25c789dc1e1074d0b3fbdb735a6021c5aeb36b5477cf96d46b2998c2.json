{"title":"Camouflaged Object Detection using 3 Yolo","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1559/v1","date":1719215252000,"content":"Real time camouflaged object detection so far using CAMO or COD10K datset has been able to achieve mAP50 less than 64%. We present a fourier transfom and Milkyway filament extraction based method extracting shape and edges of camouflaged object, achieving 88%+ mAP50 while continuing to deliver real time detection using YOLOv8s based models. This allows for search and rescue of wilelife and humans in smoke, fog, natural disasters possible by combining low compute Yolov8s model on headup display for rescue workers such as firefighters, first reponders etc.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d7a16ca25c789dc1e1074d0b3fbdb735a6021c5aeb36b5477cf96d46b2998c2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
