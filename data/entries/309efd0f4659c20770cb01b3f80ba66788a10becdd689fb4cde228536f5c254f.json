{"title":"Pyramiding of transgenic immune receptors from primary and tertiary wheat gene pools improves powdery mildew resistance in the field","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/7/1872/7468510?rss=1","date":1702166400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Introgression of resistance genes from wild or related species is a common strategy to improve disease resistance of wheat cultivars. <span>Pm17</span> is a gene that confers powdery mildew resistance in wheat. It encodes an NLR type of immune receptor and was introgressed from rye to wheat as part of the 1RS chromosome arm translocation several decades ago. So far it has not been possible to separate <span>Pm17</span> from its co-introgressed rye genes due to suppressed recombination. Here we tested in the field transgenic Bobwhite wheat overexpressing <span>Pm17</span> without any other rye genes. Four transgenic events showed high levels of PM17 protein accumulation, strong powdery mildew resistance, and no pleiotropic effects during three field seasons. We used a combined approach of transgene insertion and cross-breeding to generate lines co-expressing <span>Pm17</span> and <span>Pm3</span>, or <span>Pm17</span> and <span>Pm8</span>. <span>Blumeria graminis</span> f. sp. <span>tritici</span> infection tests confirmed additive, race-specific resistance of the two pyramided transgenes in lines Pm17+Pm3b and Pm17+Pm8. Furthermore, pyramided lines showed strong powdery mildew resistance during three field seasons. We conclude that the combination of overexpressed <span>NLR</span> genes from the extended gene pool broadens and diversifies wheat disease resistance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"309efd0f4659c20770cb01b3f80ba66788a10becdd689fb4cde228536f5c254f","category":"Environment"}
