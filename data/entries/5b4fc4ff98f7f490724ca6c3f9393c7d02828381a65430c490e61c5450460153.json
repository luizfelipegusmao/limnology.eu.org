{"title":"A New NDSA (Normalized Differential Spectral Attenuation) Measurement Campaign for Estimating Water Vapor along a Radio Link","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1829/v1","date":1724719805000,"content":"The Normalized Differential Spectral Attenuation (NDSA) technique was proposed years ago as an active method for measuring Integrated Water Vapor (IWV) along a Ku/K-band radio link immersed (totally or partially) in the troposphere. The approach is of the active kind, as it relies on the transmission of a couple of sinusoidal signals, whose power is measured at the receiver, thus providing the differential attenuation measurements from which IWV estimates can be in turn derived. In 2018, a prototype instrument providing such differential attenuation measurements was completed and set up for a first measurement campaign aimed at demonstrating the NDSA method. By the end of June 2022, the instrument was profoundly modified and upgraded so that a second measurement campaign could be carried out from August 1 to November 30, 2022. The transmitter was placed on the top of Monte Gomito (44.1277째lat, 10.6434째lon, 1892 m a.s.l.) and the receiver on the roof of the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Florence (43.7985째lat, 11.2528째lon, 50 m a.s.l.). The resulting radio link length was 61.15 km. Four ground weather stations of the regional weather service were selected among those available. In this paper, we describe the upgraded instrument and present the outcomes of the new measurement campaign, whose purpose was mainly to compare the IWV estimates provided by the instrument with the ground sensors measurements of air temperature, air humidity, barometric pressure, and rainfall.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b4fc4ff98f7f490724ca6c3f9393c7d02828381a65430c490e61c5450460153","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
