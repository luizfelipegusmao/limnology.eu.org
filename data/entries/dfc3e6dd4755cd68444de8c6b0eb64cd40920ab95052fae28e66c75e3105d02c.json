{"title":"Improving the Giant Armadillo Optimization Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1784/v1","date":1714133380000,"content":"Global optimization is widely adopted nowadays in a variety of practical and scientific problems. In this context, a group of techniques that is widely used is that of evolutionary techniques. A relatively new evolutionary technique in this direction is that of Giant Armadillo Optimization, which is based on the hunting strategy of giant armadillos. In this paper, a number of modifications to this technique are proposed, such as the periodic application of a local minimization method as well as the use of modern termination techniques based on statistical observations. The proposed modifications have been tested on a wide - series test functions, available from the relevant literature and it was compared against other evolutionary methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dfc3e6dd4755cd68444de8c6b0eb64cd40920ab95052fae28e66c75e3105d02c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
