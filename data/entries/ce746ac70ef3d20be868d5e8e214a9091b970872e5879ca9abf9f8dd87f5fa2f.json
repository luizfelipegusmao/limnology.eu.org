{"title":"Caribbean red snapper fishing performance indicators in Brazilian amazon shelf: Is it the beginning of the end of a fishing system?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300820","date":1714572000000,"content":"<p>by Niedja Mescouto, Ualerson Iran Peixoto, Diego Gomes Trindade, Hanna Moura, Bianca Bentes</p>\r\n\r\nRed snapper fishing (<i>Lutjanus purpureus</i>) is an important fishing activity for the Brazilian economy due to its export. The scarcity of up-to-date information on this systemâ€™s ecology, economy, and social characteristics contributes to inefficient management. We analyze whether the commercial snapper fishery on the Amazon continental shelf is socioecologically sustainable. For this, an assessment tool was used that can be applied to fishing systems with little data, the Fisheries Performance Indicators (FPI). The results showed that the critical points of this activity are mainly related to the Ecological indicator (2.3) and the Economic indicator (2.8). The best indicator was the Community (3.8). The problems that put at risk the permanence of the activity and its maintenance are: (i) fishing for juveniles; (ii) illegal vessels; (iii) lack of collaboration of the fishing sector with science, and (iv) unreliability of data supplied. All the points mentioned make the snapper fishery on the north coast of Brazil socio-ecologically unsustainable in the long term.","author":"Niedja Mescouto","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ce746ac70ef3d20be868d5e8e214a9091b970872e5879ca9abf9f8dd87f5fa2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
