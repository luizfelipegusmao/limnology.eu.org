While this romantic display is entertaining for our eyes, it is part of a critical phenomenon for plant life known as senescence. Plant senescence is the last stage of plant development. Although most of us are familiar with the tissue-level senescence, for example leaf senescence, certain plant species go through an entire-plant senescence at the end of their life cycle, known as monocarpic senescence. During monocarpic senescence, the vegetative organs of the plants and their photosynthetic machinery systematically die, followed by massive remobilization of nutrients from senescing organs to developing seeds (<a href=\"#kiae250-B4\">Distelfeld et al. 2014</a>). The nutrient remobilization rate and efficiency from senescing organs to developing grains significantly impact grain quality and yield in cereal crops, making plant senescence a central process for world agriculture (<a href=\"#kiae250-B5\">Gregersen et al. 2008</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"eee3d2d5adf246d433ae1be7c7ec56591012d4da17311408a31e5c94b48ce41f","category":"Environment"}
