Since then, the buffaloes have become feral, posing a threat to the populations, communities, and natural ecosystems of the region. In the last decade, there has been no study or monitoring of the invasive population and its potential impacts. We utilized systematic flights and multitemporal remote sensing analysis to address (i) What is the distribution range, abundance and density of Asian buffalo in the protected area? (ii) How has this species changed the land scape in the protected area over the past 34 years? The population survey resulted in 4.782 ± 533.27 buffaloes within 966.22 km<sup>2</sup>, population density of 4.9 ± 0.55 buffaloes per km<sup>2</sup>. The study also identified a 51% expansion of occupied areas within the Guaporé Reserve over the last 10 years. The multitemporal remote sensing analysis revealed significant environmental changes over the years, resulting in 48% loss of naturally flooded areas in the region occupied by buffalo. The government must take urgent measures to develop and implement a plan to control and eradicate this invasive species.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"9f61950ed8dd40109fc5e3a7e6295562fbdbbea8fd48b775458523e7680277bd","category":"Environment"}
