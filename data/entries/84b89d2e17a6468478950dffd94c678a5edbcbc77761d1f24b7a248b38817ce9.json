Unlike proper ferroelectrics, in which the polarization is usually deteriorated by depolarization at nanoscale dimensions, polar <span>Pca</span>2<sub>1</sub>-HfO<sub>2</sub> demonstrates robust ferroelectricity down to the unit-cell scale [<a href=\"#ozae044.556-B2\">2</a>]. However, several fundamental questions pertaining to the harnessing of ferroelectricity in HfO<sub>2</sub>, and related materials, remain open. These unresolved questions include: the switching mechanism of the ferroelectric domain, the nature of the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition, and pathways to stabilize films with only the ferroelectric phase [<a href=\"#ozae044.556-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.556-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.556-B4\">4</a>]. However, atomic-scale characterization of HfO<sub>2</sub> and its domains have been hindered by the polycrystalline and mixed-phase nature of HfO<sub>2</sub> thin films [<a href=\"#ozae044.556-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.556-B4\">4</a>]. Stabilizing HfO<sub>2</sub> with only single polar <span>Pca</span>2<sub>1</sub> phase is essential to resolve above questions unambiguously.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"84b89d2e17a6468478950dffd94c678a5edbcbc77761d1f24b7a248b38817ce9","category":"Environment"}
