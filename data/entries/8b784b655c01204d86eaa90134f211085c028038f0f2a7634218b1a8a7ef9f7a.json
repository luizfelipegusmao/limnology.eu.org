{"title":"Utilizing High-Resolution Imaging and Artificial Intelligence for Accurate Leaf Wetness Detection for the Strawberry Advisory System (SAS)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0096/v1","date":1719885874000,"content":"In strawberry cultivation, precise disease management is crucial for maximizing yields and reducing unnecessary fungicide use. Traditional methods for measuring Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), a critical factor in assessing the risk of fungal diseases such as botrytis fruit rot and anthracnose, have been reliant on sensors with known limitations in accuracy and reliability and difficulties with calibrating. To overcome these limitations, this study introduced an innovative algorithm for leaf wetness detection systems employing high-resolution imaging and deep learning technologies, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Implemented at the University of Florida's Plant Science Research and Education Unit (PSREU) in Citra, Florida, USA and expanded to three additional locations across Florida, USA, the system captured and analyzed images of a reference plate to accurately determine the wetness and, consequently, the LWD. The comparison of system outputs with manual observations across diverse environmental conditions demonstrated the enhanced accuracy and reliability of the artificial intelligence-driven approach. By integrating this system into the Strawberry Advisory System (SAS), this study provided an efficient solution to improve disease risk assessment and fungicide application strategies, promising significant economic benefits and sustainability advances in strawberry production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b784b655c01204d86eaa90134f211085c028038f0f2a7634218b1a8a7ef9f7a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
