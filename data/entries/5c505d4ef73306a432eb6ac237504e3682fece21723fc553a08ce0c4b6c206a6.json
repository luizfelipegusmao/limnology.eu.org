{"title":"Ant3D &ndash; a Fisheye Multi-camera System to Survey Narrow Spaces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1466/v1","date":1716383609000,"content":"Although the field of geomatics has seen multiple technological advances in the recent years which enabled new applications and simplified the consolidated ones, some tasks remain challenging, inefficient, and time- and cost-consuming. This is the case of accurate tridimensional surveys of narrow spaces. Static laser scanning is an accurate and reliable approach but impractical for extensive tunnel environments; portable laser scanning is on the other hand time-effective and efficient but not very reliable without ground control constraints. This paper describes the development process of a novel image-based multi-camera system meant to solve this specific problem: delivering accurate, reliable, and efficient results. The development is illustrated from the system conceptualization and initial investigations to the design choices and requirements for accuracy. The resulted working prototype has been put to the test to verify effectiveness of the proposed approach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c505d4ef73306a432eb6ac237504e3682fece21723fc553a08ce0c4b6c206a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
