{"title":"Fast Green FCF Improves Depiction of Extracellular Matrix in Ex Vivo Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1670/v1","date":1724394960000,"content":"Rapid microscopic analysis of tissue is an essential diagnostic tool in oncological surgery. The gold standard for intraoperative histological tissue evaluation are frozen sections. However, frozen sections are prone to a variety of artefacts and require skilled staff and specialized lab equipment. A potential method for rapid intraoperative tissue evaluation that does not require fixation, freezing nor sectioning of the tissue, is ex vivo fluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM). The visualization of the structurally important extracellular matrix (ECM) in conventional ex vivo FCM lags behind the standards of conventional histology. The objective of this study was to find a stain that will improve the depiction of the ECM to resemble FFPE H&amp;amp;E sections as closely as possible.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4d616207e67144dde952103803682959973c31c9bf09fd8df1a7bd6fb594fd5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
