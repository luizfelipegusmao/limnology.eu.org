{"title":"Impact of mutations in the <i>mtrR</i>, <i>rpdlVD</i> and <i>rrl</i> genes on azithromycin resistance in <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306695","date":1721138400000,"content":"<p>by Florian Mauffrey, Fabrice Poncet, Damien Jacot, Gilbert Greub, Patrice Nordmann, Dominique S. Blanc</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) pose a major public health problem. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> represents a serious threat to successful treatment and epidemiological control. The first extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains (ceftriaxone-resistant and high-level azithromycin-resistant [HLR AZY]) have been reported.</p> Aims <p>To identify molecular mechanisms implicated in azithromycin resistance in strains isolated from patients over a three-year period in a university hospital in Switzerland.</p> Material and methods <p>From January 2020 to December 2022, 34 isolates (one per patient) were recovered from samples analyzed at the University Hospital of Lausanne. Eight genes involved in azithromycin resistance were sequenced: <i>mtrR</i> repressor (mtrCDE operon repressor) and his promotor <i>mtrR-pr</i>, <i>rplD</i> gene (L4 ribosomal protein), <i>rplV</i> gene (L22 ribosomal protein) and the four alleles of the <i>rrl</i> gene (23S rRNA).</p> Results <p>With a cutoff value of 1 mg/L, 15 isolates were considered as being resistant to azithromycin, whereas the remaining 19 were susceptible. The C2597T mutation in 3 or 4 of the <i>rrl</i> allele confer a medium-level resistance to azithromycin (MIC = 16 mg/L, N = 2). The following mutations were significantly associated with MIC values â‰¥1 mg/L: the three mutations V125A, A147G, R157Q in the <i>rplD</i> gene (N = 10) and a substitution A-&gt;C in the <i>mtrR</i> promotor (N = 9). Specific mutations in the <i>mtrR</i> repressor and its promotor were observed in both susceptible and resistant isolates.</p> Conclusions <p>Resistance to azithromycin was explained by the presence of mutations in many different copies of 23S RNA ribosomal genes and their regulatory genes. Other mutations, previously reported to be associated with azithromycin resistance, were documented in both susceptible and resistant isolates, suggesting they play little role, if any, in azithromycin resistance.</p>","author":"Florian Mauffrey","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ea88824c0fe7028a7547dd2911c05306133e0ae0041a922d23b41ce1d6b94a21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
