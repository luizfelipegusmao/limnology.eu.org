Here, we sought to differentiate these effects through microorganism reciprocal transplant and aggregate disruption experiments using soils collected from seven sites along a 5000-km latitudinal transect encompassing a wide range of climatic conditions and from a 4-year laboratory incubation experiment. We found direct microbial regulation of <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub>, with a higher <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> being associated with greater fungal:bacterial ratios. However, no significant direct effects of physicochemical protection and substrate were observed on the variation in <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> along the latitudinal transect or among different incubation time points. These findings highlight that we should move forward from physicochemical protection and substrate to microbial mechanisms regulating soil carbon decomposition temperature sensitivity to understand and better predict soil carbon–climate feedback.</p>","author":"Junmin Pei, \nChangming Fang, \nBo Li, \nMing Nie, \nJinquan Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"d79b3f3df0ff4676cc2f4f422c4270b8b346f969bd27bcfe715947e3532e961f","category":"Environment"}
