{"title":"Preclinical evaluation of Tc-99m p5+14 peptide for SPECT detection of cardiac amyloidosis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301756","date":1712325600000,"content":"<p>by Stephen J. Kennel, Joseph W. Jackson, Alan Stuckey, Tina Richey, James S. Foster, Jonathan S. Wall</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Amyloid deposition is a cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Patients who present with cardiac disease can be evaluated for transthyretin (TTR)-associated cardiac amyloidosis using nuclear imaging with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labeled pyrophosphate (PYP); however, light chain-associated (AL) cardiac amyloid is generally not detected using this tracer. As an alternative, the amyloid-binding peptide p5+14 radiolabeled with iodine-124 has been shown to be an effective pan-amyloid radiotracer for PET/CT imaging. Here, a <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labeled form of p5+14 peptide has been prepared to facilitate SPECT/CT imaging of cardiac amyloidosis.</p> Method <p>A synthesis method suitable for clinical applications has been used to prepare <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labeled p5+14 and tested for peptide purity, product bioactivity, radiochemical purity and stability. The product was compared with<sup>99m</sup>Tc-PYP for cardiac SPECT/CT imaging in a mouse model of AA amyloidosis and for reactivity with human tissue sections from AL and TTR patients.</p> Results <p>The <sup>99m</sup>Tc p5+14 tracer was produced with &gt;95% yields in radiopurity and bioactivity with no purification steps required and retained over 95% peptide purity and &gt;90% bioactivity for &gt;3 h. In mice, the tracer detected hepatosplenic AA amyloid as well as heart deposits with uptake ~5 fold higher than <sup>99m</sup>Tc-PYP. <sup>99m</sup>Tc p5+14 effectively bound human amyloid deposits in the liver, kidney and both AL- and ATTR cardiac amyloid in tissue sections in which <sup>99m</sup>Tc-PYP binding was not detectable.</p> Conclusion <p><sup>99m</sup>Tc-p5+14 was prepared in minutes in &gt;20 mCi doses with good performance in preclinical studies making it suitable for clinical SPECT/CT imaging of cardiac amyloidosis.</p>","author":"Stephen J.
