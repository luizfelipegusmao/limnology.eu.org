{"title":"Molecular Biology of ACL Graft Healing: Early Mechanical Loading Perspective.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1117/v1","date":1723754723000,"content":"The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) is a crucial stabilizing ligament in the knee, essential for maintaining knee joint stability and proper biomechanical function. ACL rupture is one of the most common injuries, especially prevalent among athletes participating in high-demand sports that involve pivoting, cutting, and jumping. Such injuries not only lead to immediate functional impairment but also predispose individuals to long-term consequences, including osteoarthritis if left untreated. ACL reconstruction using a graft, whether autograft or allograft, has become the gold standard treatment method aimed at restoring knee stability and function. However, the postoperative healing process of the graft within the bone tunnel presents significant challenges due to its complexity. This healing involves a coordinated sequence of molecular and cellular events, including inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling phases. These phases are governed by a myriad of molecular signals, growth factors, and cellular interactions that ultimately determine the success of the graft integration and the restoration of ligamentous function. The review article \"Molecular Biology of ACL Graft Healing: Early Mechanical Loading Perspective\" delves deeply into these intricate biological processes. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms that facilitate graft healing. Furthermore, it emphasizes the critical role of early mechanical loading in this context. Mechanical loading, when applied appropriately, has been shown to positively influence graft healing by enhancing cellular responses, collagen fiber alignment, and overall biomechanical properties of the graft. By exploring the impact of early mechanical loading, the review sheds light on how mechanical stimuli can be optimized to improve clinical outcomes. This understanding is vital for developing effective rehabilitation protocols that promote faster and more robust graft healing. The article offers valuable insights for clinicians and researchers, aiming to bridge the gap between molecular biology and practical rehabilitation strategies in ACL reconstruction. Overall, this review underscores the importance of an integrated approach that considers both the biological and mechanical aspects of ACL graft healing. Such an approach holds promise for advancing patient care and improving the success rates of ACL reconstruction surgeries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea98eefced605f19932e7652ea498848b94305da5554f6082dac3944835c36dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
