{"title":"Humanization of pan-HLA-DR mAb 44H10 Hinges on Critical Residues in the Antibody Framework","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1417/v1","date":1716381985000,"content":"Reducing the immunogenicity of animal-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for use in humans is critical to maximize therapeutic effectiveness and preclude potential adverse events. While traditional humanization methods have primarily focused on grafting antibody Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs) on homologous human antibody scaffolds, framework regions can also play essential roles in antigen binding. Here, we describe the humanization of the pan-HLA-DR mAb 44H10, a murine antibody displaying significant involvement of the framework region in antigen binding. Using a structure-guided approach, we identify and restore framework residues that directly interact with the antigen or indirectly modulate antigen binding by shaping the antibody paratope and engineer a humanized antibody with affinity, biophysical profile, and molecular binding basis comparable to that of the parental 44H10 mAb. As a humanized molecule, this antibody holds promise as a scaffold for the development of MHC class II-targeting therapeutics and vaccines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8ba4a5241223f21c5da5bf213d42f5cb54493cbfbdc9299a115e016c9a8c0ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
