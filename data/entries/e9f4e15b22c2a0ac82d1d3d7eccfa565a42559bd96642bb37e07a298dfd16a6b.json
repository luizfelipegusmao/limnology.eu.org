{"title":"The Effectiveness of Nutritional Interventions Implemented Through Lady Health Workers on the Reduction of Stunting in Children under 5 in Pakistan; The Difference‐in‐Difference Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1536/v1","date":1713887517000,"content":"In Pakistan, 2018 National Nutrition Survey reported 40% of under five children were stunted. This study assesses the effectiveness of nutritional supplementation in reducing stunting among under-five children in two rural districts in Sindh, Pakistan. This was a mixed-method quasi-experimental study with intervention and control population. 3397 and 3277 under-five children participated in the baseline and end-line surveys. Both study areas were matched for demographic and economic circumstances. The participants received nutrient supplements underpinned by nutrition behaviour change communication for appropriate complementary feeding practices and hand hygiene targeted at primary caregivers during the first 1000 days of an infant's life. The impact was assessed using the difference in difference analysis with kernel propensity score matching to adjust the differences among control and intervention populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9f4e15b22c2a0ac82d1d3d7eccfa565a42559bd96642bb37e07a298dfd16a6b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
