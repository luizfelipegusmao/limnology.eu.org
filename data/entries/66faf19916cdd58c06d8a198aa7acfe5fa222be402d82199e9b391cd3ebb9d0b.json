{"title":"Solid State Gas Sensors with Ni-based Sensing Materials for Highly Selective Detecting NOx","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1837/v1","date":1729693716000,"content":"Precise monitoring of NOx concentrations in nitric oxide delivery systems is crucial to ensure the safety and well-being of patients undergoing inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Currently, NOx sensing in commercialized iNO instruments predominantly relies on chemiluminescence sensors, which not only drives up costs but also limits their portability. Herein, we developed solid state gas sensors utilizing Ni-based sensing materials for effectively tracking the level of NO and NO2 in NO delivery system. These sensors comprised of NiO-SE or (NiFe2O4+30 wt.% Fe2O3)-SE vs. Mn-based RE demonstrated high selectivity towards 100 ppm NO under the interference of 10 ppm NO2 or 3 ppm NO2 under the interference of 100 ppm NO, respectively. Meanwhile, excellent stability, repeatability, and humidity resistance were also verified for proposed sensors. Sensing mechanisms were thoroughly investigated through assessments of adsorption capabilities and electrochemical reactivity. It turns out that the superior electrochemical reactivity of NiO towards NO, alongside with the NO2 favorable adsorption characteristics of (NiFe2O4 + 30 wt.% Fe2O3), is the primary reason for the high selectivity to NOx. These findings indicate a bright future for the application of these NOx sensors in innovative iNO treatment technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"66faf19916cdd58c06d8a198aa7acfe5fa222be402d82199e9b391cd3ebb9d0b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
