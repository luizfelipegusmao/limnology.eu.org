{"title":"Postoperative Organ Dysfunction Risk Stratification Using Extracellular Vesicles-derived circRNAs in Pediatric Congenital Heart Surgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1123/v1","date":1721012046000,"content":"Breakthroughs in surgical and medical techniques have significantly improved outcomes for children with congenital heart disease (CHD), but research continues to address the ongoing challenge of organ dysfunction after surgery. Our study explored circular RNAs (circRNAs) within plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in children undergoing CHD surgery. Post-surgery EV circRNAs showed dramatic expression changes between organ dysfunction (OD) and control groups. Tissue injury-related pathways were consistent across pre- and post-surgery in OD. The top two significant predicted tissue sources of these circRNAs originated from the respiratory system, aligning with the major organ dysfunction type (respiratory failure). Five of these circRNAs, namely circ-CELSR1, circ-PLXNA1, circ-OBSL1, circ-DAB2IP, circ-KANK1, significantly correlated between PELOD (Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction), supporting the potential of circRNAs as prognostic markers. These findings pave the way for EV circRNAs as promising tools for managing post-surgical organ dysfunction and potentially guiding therapeutic strategies in children with CHD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ce3a3df3c75e640509bf6eeba0c64f563d8ad21230371d0ec5067643212bfe1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
