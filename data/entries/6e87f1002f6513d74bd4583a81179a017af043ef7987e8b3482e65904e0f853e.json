A previous study using the 1998–2009 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) found HBOT to be associated with decreased mortality in NSTI. Given the argument of advancements in critical care, we aimed to investigate the continued role of HBOT in NSTI.</p> Methods <p>The 2012–2020 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried for NSTI admissions who received surgery. 60,481 patients between 2012–2020 were included, 600 (&lt;1%) underwent HBOT. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included amputation, hospital length of stay, and costs. A multivariate model was constructed to account for baseline differences in groups.</p> Results <p>Age, gender, and comorbidities were similar between the two groups. On bivariate comparison, the HBOT group had lower mortality rate (&lt;2% vs 5.9%, p&lt;0.001) and lower amputation rate (11.8% vs 18.3%, p&lt;0.001) however, longer lengths of stay (16.9 days vs 14.6 days, p&lt;0.001) and higher costs ($54,000 vs $46,000, p&lt;0.001). After multivariate analysis, HBOT was associated with decreased mortality (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 0.22, 95% CI 0.09–0.53, P&lt;0.001) and lower risk of amputation (AOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55–0.96, P = 0.03). HBO was associated with longer stays by 1.6 days (95% CI 0.4–2.7 days) and increased costs by $7,800 (95% CI $2,200-$13,300), they also had significantly lower risks of non-home discharges (AOR 0.79, 95%CI 0.65–0.96).</p> Conclusions <p>After correction for differences, HBOT was associated with decreased mortality, amputations, and non-home discharges in NSTI with the tradeoff of increase to costs and length of stay.</p>","author":"William Toppen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6e87f1002f6513d74bd4583a81179a017af043ef7987e8b3482e65904e0f853e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
