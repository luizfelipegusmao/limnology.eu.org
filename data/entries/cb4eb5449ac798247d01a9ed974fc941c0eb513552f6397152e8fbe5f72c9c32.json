{"title":"Unraveling athletic performance: Transcriptomics and external load monitoring in handball competition","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299556","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by Pol Ezquerra Condeminas, Milos Mallol, Roger Font, Victor Tremps, Jose Antonio Gutiérrez, Gil Rodas, Alexandre Perera Lluna, José Manuel Soria</p>\r\nObjective <p>This study aims to comprehend the impact of handball practice on sub-elite athletes by investigating transcriptomic changes that occur during a match. The primary focus encompasses a dual objective: firstly, to identify and characterize these transcriptomic alterations, and secondly, to establish correlations between internal factors (gene expression), and external loads measured through Electronic Performance and Tracking Systems (EPTS variables). Ultimately, this comprehensive analysis seeks to evaluate both acute and chronic responses to exercise within the context of handball training.</p> Methods <p>The study included sixteen elite male athletes from the FC Barcelona handball second team. Blood samples were extracted at three different time points: before the match at baseline levels (T1), immediately upon completion (T2), and 24 hours after completion (T3). Differential gene expression, Gene Ontology Term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were conducted in two comparisons: Comparison 1 (T1 vs T2) and Comparison 2 (T1 vs T3). Further, the correlation between gene expression levels and training variables (external load) was conducted.</p> Results <p>In T1 vs T2, 3717 of the 14632 genes detected were differentially expressed (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05), and enrichment of terms related to the immune system, mitochondria, and metabolic processes was found. Further, significant linear correlations were obtained between High-Speed running (HSR) and high-intensity variables such as acceleration ACC and deceleration DEC values with amino acids, and inflammatory and oxidative environment-related pathways, both in chronic and acute response.</p> Conclusions <p>This research highlights the effects of external workload on elite athletes during a handball match and throughout the season. The study identifies deregulation in the immune system, mitochondrial functions, and various metabolic pathways during the match. Additionally, it establishes correlations between the external load and pathways associated with amino acids, inflammation, oxidative environment, and regulation. These findings offer insights into the immediate and chronic responses of athletes to physical effort.</p>","author":"Pol Ezquerra Condeminas","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cb4eb5449ac798247d01a9ed974fc941c0eb513552f6397152e8fbe5f72c9c32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
