{"title":"Influence of Cement Thickness on Stress Distribution for Two Dental Implants Restored With Zirconia Crowns","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0706/v1","date":1718098447000,"content":"The purpose of this finite element analysis (FEA) was to evaluate the stress experienced by both the prosthetic components and the bone in relation to varying cement thicknesses ranging from 20 to 60 μm, utilized in the attachment of a zirconia crown on a conometric cap. The study focused on two distinct types of implants (Cyroth and TAC, AoN Implants, Grisignano di Zocco, Italy) featuring a Morse cone connection. Detailed three-dimensional (3D) models were created to repre-sent the bone structure (cortical and trabecular) and the prosthetic components, encompassing the crown, cement, cap, abutment, and the implant. The two implants were placed in a 1.5 mm sub-crestal position and subjected to an inclined load of 200 N at 45° on the crown. The results re-vealed that an increase in cement thickness resulted in a reduction of von Mises stress on the cor-tical bone for both Cyroth and TAC implants, while the decrease in stress on the trabecular bone was relatively less pronounced. However, the TAC implant exhibited a higher stress field and de-formation in the apical area compared to the Cyroth implant. In summary, this study investigated the impact of cement thickness on stress transmission across prosthetic components and peri-implant tissues by means of FEA analysis, indicating that the 60 μm cement layer manifested higher stress values nearing the material strength limit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95cff35aac9bdf1f271ab1100ac51d01651fdce88384c79589ba2528b82f58cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
