{"title":"The effects of feeding frequency on the growth performance, body composition, health status and histology of juvenile meagre (Argyrosomus regius)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16151?af=R","date":1668758400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study evaluated how the feeding frequency impacts growth performance, haematological parameters, fatty acid profile and liver histology in meagre (<i>Argyrosomus regius</i>). Fish (15.48 ± 0.11 g) were fed to satiation with a diet formulated according to the nutritional requirements of the species (48% crude protein and 18% crude lipid) for 12 weeks in six different feeding frequencies; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 times in 24 h (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5) and 2F1 as one day feeding-one day fasted. The final mean weight (FMW) and specific growth rate (SGR) of the F3, F4 and F5 were significantly higher than the F1 and 2F1 groups. Viscerosomatic index (VSI) of the F1 and F3 groups was markedly different from the 2F1. Moreover, packed cell volume (PCV) and haemoglobin (Hb) counts in the F3 and F5 groups were higher than in the 2F1 group. The liver lipid vacuolization was found at more than moderate and also high levels for the groups of F3, F4 and F5 compared to the other groups in histological analysis. The fish in the 2F1 feeding frequency application was negatively impacted by growth performance, feed conversion, condition factor and haematological parameters. Although more feed is consumed in the F4 and F5 groups, the F3 group has a higher economic profit index (EPI). It has been concluded that a higher growth rate and improved health status can be achieved by feeding three times a day (F3) in the practice of mariculture of meagre.</p>","author":"Derya Güroy, \nOnur Karadal, \nSerhan Mantoğlu, \nBetül Güroy, \nOlcay Şimşek, \nKamil Çelebi, \nOrhan Tufan Eroldoğan, \nM.
