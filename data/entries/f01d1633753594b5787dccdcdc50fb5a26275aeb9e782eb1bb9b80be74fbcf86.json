Our objective was to determine if older adults identified as at risk for loneliness by a Medicare Advantage health plan could benefit from a proactive telephone support program. We conducted a mixed-methods pilot efficacy study of outbound calls from an established community-based telephone program to support older adults identified as at risk for loneliness. One hundred and twenty-one older adults were enrolled and completed surveys at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Outcomes included loneliness (3-item UCLA loneliness scale), depression (PHQ-2 screen), anxiety (GAD-2 screen), and unhealthy physical and mental health days (CDC Healthy Days Measure). Quantitative data were analyzed using multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression, and open-ended responses were analyzed thematically. Over 6 months, participants had reductions in loneliness (46% to 28%, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001), depression (36% to 25%, <i>p</i> = 0.07), anxiety (63% to 43%, <i>p</i> = 0.004), unhealthy mental days (14 to 8, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001), and unhealthy physical days (15 to 11, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001). Participants reported high satisfaction with calls, and many felt the calls improved overall mood or health. Findings can inform trials to address loneliness through telephone support and partnerships between community-based organizations and payors.</p>","author":"Katrina A.
