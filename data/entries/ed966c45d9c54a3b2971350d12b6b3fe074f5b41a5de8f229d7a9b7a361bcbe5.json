The spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique is proposed since it allows working with much shorter times and lower temperatures than conventional sintering techniques [<a href=\"#ozae044.464-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ed966c45d9c54a3b2971350d12b6b3fe074f5b41a5de8f229d7a9b7a361bcbe5","category":"Environment"}
