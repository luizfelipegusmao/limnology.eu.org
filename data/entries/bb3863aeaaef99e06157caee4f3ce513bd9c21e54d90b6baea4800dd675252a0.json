{"title":"Performance Prediction of Centrifugal Norm Pumps Operating as Turbines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1249/v1","date":1718758559000,"content":"Pump-as-turbines (PAT) have been widely used during the last decade as one of the most interesting technologies in the field of energy recovery. A large number of studies and papers have been published in which the performance of the pumps in the turbine operating regime are analysed. Since horizontal single stage centrifugal norm pumps are most commonly used as PATs, their performances are analysed in this paper. Most of the research was related to individual pump aggregates or smaller groups and to obtaining their performance curves in turbine random mode. In this work, extensive experimental, numerical and theoretical investigations are conducted to obtain complete dimensionless performance characteristics of the single stage centrifugal norm pumps operating as turbines. The main goal of this research was to form a simple analytical expression that will, for this type of aggregate, map the pump operating characteristic to the appropriate turbine operating regime. By using the expressions obtained and presented in the work, engineers are enabled to make the appropriate choice of pump aggregate for operation in the turbine random mode for potential locations. This can allow us to quickly make selection of potential locations and to carry out appropriate techno-economic analyses and analyses of possible energy savings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb3863aeaaef99e06157caee4f3ce513bd9c21e54d90b6baea4800dd675252a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
