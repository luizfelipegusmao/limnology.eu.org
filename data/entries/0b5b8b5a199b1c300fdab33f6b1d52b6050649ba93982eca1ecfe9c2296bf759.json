{"title":"Gastric Perforation from Bag-Valve-Mask Ventilation Resulting in Tension Pneumoperitoneum and Arterial Insufficiency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1428/v1","date":1713864447000,"content":"We report the case of a 44-year-old woman who suffered gastric perforation after receiving bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation in the setting of alcohol intoxication. She had a markedly distended abdomen and cold, dusky lower extremities upon arrival to the emergency department. Imaging revealed a large volume intraabdominal accumulation of air with compression of the aorta. Needle decompression relieved symptoms of lower extremity arterial insufficiency. However, the patient quickly decompensated and subsequent exploratory laparotomy confirmed gastric rupture. A subtotal gastrectomy was performed but the patient ultimately passed on post-operative day two due to multi-organ dysfunction. Although BVM ventilation is commonplace in both the hospital and field, there is a lack of awareness of the serious complications of abdominal air accumulation due to their rareness in the adult population. Checking for abdominal distention during resuscitation ought to be routine in all patients. Signs of arterial insufficiency accompanying abdominal distention, once confirmed by diagnostic imaging that shows extensive pneumoperitoneum, are indicators of having reached a life-threatening level of air accumulation, calling for immediate needle decompression and exploratory laparotomy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b5b8b5a199b1c300fdab33f6b1d52b6050649ba93982eca1ecfe9c2296bf759","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
