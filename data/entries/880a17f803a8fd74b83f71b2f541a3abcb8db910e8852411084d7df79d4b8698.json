{"title":"In vitro Photodynamic Therapy in the Treatment of Endometrial Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2165/v1","date":1717161095000,"content":"Background Endometrial cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in the world. Due to the prevalence and high morbidity, it is of key importance to make a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective therapy. The use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of endometrial cancer is a significant challenge in conducting clinical trials. PDT is non-invasive, with few side effects, damaging only neoplastic tissue, leaving healthy adjacent structures intact. Thanks to numerous experiments (also in vitro), PDT is gaining more and more recognition as a potential tool in endometrium cancer treatment.\nObjective The aim of the study was to analyze the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy on endometrial cancer tissue samples\nMethods In the in vitro experiment of PDT, sections of endometrial cancer tissue taken from female patients were subjected to. Rose Bengal was used as a photosensitizer in order to assess the usefulness of the applied PDT and to introduce these solutions into the in vivo test procedure.\nResults Changes on the cellular substrate, such as: chromatin condensation, disturbed structure and shape of cell nuclei were observed in all tissues subjected to PDT.\nConclusions The PDT experiment in vitro offers opportunities and hopes for using the chosen procedure also in vivo.\nKeywords endometrial cancer; photodynamic therapy; in vitro; treatment; rose bengal","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"880a17f803a8fd74b83f71b2f541a3abcb8db910e8852411084d7df79d4b8698","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
