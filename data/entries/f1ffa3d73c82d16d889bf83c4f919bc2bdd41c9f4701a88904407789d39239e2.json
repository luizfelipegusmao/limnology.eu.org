A single exposure to swing leg perturbations can temporarily strengthen this modulation. The objective of this parallel, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was to investigate whether repeated perturbations cause sustained increases in step modulation (NCT02964039; funded by the VA). 54 PwCS at the Medical University of South Carolina were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: Control (n = 18), with minimal forces; Assistive (n = 18), pushing the swing leg toward a mechanically appropriate location; Perturbing (n = 18), pushing the swing leg away from a mechanically appropriate location. All intervention groups included 24 training sessions over 12-weeks with up to 30-minutes of treadmill walking while interfaced with a novel force-field and a 12-week follow-up period, with five interspersed assessment sessions. Our primary outcome measure was paretic step width modulation, the partial correlation between step width and pelvis displacement (ρ<sub>SW</sub>). Secondarily, we quantified swing and stance leg contributions to step modulation, clinical assessments of walking balance and confidence, and real-world falls. Outcomes were analyzed for participants who completed all assessment sessions (n = 44). Only the Perturbing group exhibited significant increases in paretic ρ<sub>SW</sub>, which were present after 4-weeks of training and sustained through follow-up (t = 2.42–3.17). These changes were due to improved control of paretic swing leg positioning. However, perturbation-induced changes in step modulation were not always significantly greater than those in the Control group, and clinical assessments were similar across intervention groups. Participants in the Perturbing group experienced a lower fall rate than those in the Control group (incidence rate ratio = 0.53), although our small sample size warrants caution. The present results indicate that perturbations can cause sustained modifications of targeted biomechanical characteristics of post-stroke gait, although such changes alone may be insufficient to change more complex clinical assessments.","author":"Alexa A.
