{"title":"The Intersection of ADHD and Autism: Neurodevelopmental Disorders with Shared Origins and Distinct Trajectories","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0160/v1","date":1725352516000,"content":"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct diagnostic criteria but significant overlap in symptoms and comorbidity. This article explores the relationship between ADHD and ASD, examining their common neurodevelopmental origins, shared features, and distinct trajectories. Both disorders are highly heritable, with genetic studies identifying shared genetic variants and neurobiological abnormalities. Environmental factors, including prenatal and perinatal exposures, also contribute to their etiology. Despite these commonalities, ADHD and ASD exhibit distinct developmental trajectories, cognitive profiles, and long-term outcomes. Understanding the interplay between these disorders is crucial for developing effective diagnostic and treatment strategies. Future research should focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms and developing targeted interventions for individuals with comorbid ADHD and ASD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"225f47ee88b0770dba30bcd7584d3eff39e6e5909fbb1adb068c93b8ba194881","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
