{"title":"Using Embroidered Interdigitated Electrodes (IDTs) to Monitor Biomarkers Present in Human Sweat","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1727/v1","date":1711605399000,"content":"The rapid growth of the global wearable technologies market is projected to reach $61.30 billion by 2030 which reflects a shift towards personalised health monitoring embedded in everyday activities. This paper explores the potential of embroidered interdigitated transducer (IDT)-based sensors for non-invasive, continuous monitoring of human biomarkers, particularly glucose levels, in human sweat. The study employs innovative embroidery techniques to create flexible fabric-based sensors with gold-coated IDTs. Experimental results demonstrate the sensorâ€™s capability to detect water droplets and glucose concentrations, showcasing promising applications for health monitoring. The embroidered IDT-based sensors offer a unique approach for seamless integration into clothing, paving the way for personalised, continuous health data capture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c5a03969c86e7cde0e1ab976c8676458144d8713274c53acc0d6d81a58a6c8d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
