{"title":"Prophylactic effects of Tibetan goat kefir on depression‐like behaviors in chronic unpredictable stress model through the gut–brain axis","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13825?af=R","date":1724416165000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Depression is a common psychological disorder, and traditional therapeutic drugs often result in side effects such as emesis, dry mouth, headache, dysentery and constipation. Probiotics and goat milk have garnered widespread attention for their ability to modulate immune function and regulate the endocrine system, and for their anti-inflammatory effects. In this work, the effects of Tibetan goat kefir on the behavior, immune status, neuroendocrine response and gut microbiological composition of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse models were evaluated.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results indicated that Tibetan kefir goat milk significantly alleviated behavioral despair in mice. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that Tibetan kefir goat milk mitigated the inflammatory response in the mice and moderated the hyperactivity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Meanwhile, chronic stress-induced gut microbial abnormalities were restored. In addition, the correlation between gut microbiota and nervous system was evaluated.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These results explained the potential mechanism of Tibetan kefir in the antidepressant effect on the CUMS model and enriched diets for depressed patients. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yuhan Sun, \nHongfan Zhao, \nMengjia Chang, \nTianli Yue, \nYahong Yuan, \nYiheng Shi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"b37faf3b322ac3564665c152abebc3aee2dcc25b92bca1201cced14ed6b6a821","category":"Environment"}
