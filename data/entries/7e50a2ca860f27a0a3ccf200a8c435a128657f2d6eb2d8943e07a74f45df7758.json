However, the mechanism enabling such rich magnetic behaviors in a single system remains elusive. It has been hypothesized that the complex magnetic structures in Fe<sub>5-x­</sub>GeTe<sub>2</sub> are linked to local structural order and disorder induced by the Fe deficiency within an average structure of R3¯m [<a href=\"#ozae044.752-B1\">1</a>].To investigate the correlation between local structure and chemistry, we systematically characterized Fe<sub>5-x</sub>GeTe<sub>2</sub> using a combination of (4D)-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and core-loss electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) at the atomic level.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7e50a2ca860f27a0a3ccf200a8c435a128657f2d6eb2d8943e07a74f45df7758","category":"Environment"}
