{"title":"Heat stress and sexual reproduction in maize: unveiling the most pivotal factors and the greatest opportunities","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/14/4219/7512234?rss=1","date":1704499200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The escalation in the intensity, frequency, and duration of high-temperature (HT) stress is currently unparalleled, which aggravates the challenges for crop production. Yet, the stage-dependent responses of reproductive organs to HT stress at the morphological, physiological, and molecular levels remain inadequately explored in pivotal staple crops. This review synthesized current knowledge regarding the mechanisms by which HT stress induces abnormalities and aberrations in reproductive growth and development, as well as by which it alters the morphology and function of florets, flowering patterns, and the processes of pollination and fertilization in maize (<span>Zea mays</span> L.). We identified the stage-specific sensitivities to HT stress and accurately defined the sensitive period from a time scale of days to hours. The microspore tetrad phase of pollen development and anthesis (especially shortly after pollination) are most sensitive to HT stress, and even brief temperature spikes during these stages can lead to significant kernel loss. The impetuses behind the heat-induced impairments in seed set are closely related to carbon, reactive oxygen species, phytohormone signals, ion (e.g. Ca<sup>2+</sup>) homeostasis, plasma membrane structure and function, and others. Recent advances in understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying HT stress responses during maize sexual reproduction have been systematically summarized.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"aaf83d75868ca0ce5398773adc8e94ed1c2183a5898fbb192e010fc2ca7845d4","category":"Environment"}
