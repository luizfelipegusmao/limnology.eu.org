{"title":"Morphology Behavior of Polysulfone Membranes Made from Sustainable Solvents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2010/v1","date":1714489745000,"content":"In a previous study we could show a change of membrane morphology and gas separation performance by varying the recipe of a casting solution based on polysulfone in a determined solvent system. Although all results were very reproducible, all used solvents were harmful and not sustainable. In this study therefore, the solvents tetrahydrofuran (THF) and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) are replaced by the more sustainable solvents 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran (2M-THF), N-butyl pyrrolidinone (NBP) and cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME). The gas permeation performance and for the first time morphology of the membranes before and after solvent replacement were determined and compared by single gas permeation measurements and SEM microscopy. It is shown, that THF can be replaced by 2M-THF and NBP without decreasing the gas permeation performance. With CPME replacing THF no membranes were formed. Best gas permeation results showed systems with 2M-THF as THF alternative. Permeances for the tested gases oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) were 2.66·10-4, 3.89·10-5, 1.53·10-3 and 4.52·10-5 mL(STP)/cm²·min·bar, respectively. permselectivities of those membranes for the gas pairs O2/N2, CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 were 6.7, 38.3 and 34.0, respectively. When additionally replacing DMAc in the solvent system no or only porous membranes were obtained, even if the precipitation procedure was adjusted. These findings indicate that a complete replacement of the solvent system without affecting the membrane morphology or gas permeation performance is not possible. By varying the temperature of the precipitation bath an easy adjustment to mechanically stable PSU membranes is possible, if just THF was replaced by 2M-THF.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05f4c8ec62a964c734207bc889f8ab4f58abcacfd2685e7924c4c2fcdb14862b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
