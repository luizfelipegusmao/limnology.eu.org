{"title":"Effects of Herbicides on Soil and Their Correlation with Calcium Deficiency: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0103/v1","date":1725325878000,"content":"Herbicides are widely used in agriculture to control weeds and enhance crop productivity. However, their application can have significant impacts on soil health and nutrient dynamics. This paper reviews the effects of herbicides on soil properties, microbial communities, and nutrient availability, with a particular focus on calcium deficiency. The review synthesizes findings from peer-reviewed journals and reports, including research conducted in Australia. The correlation between herbicide application and calcium deficiency is explored, highlighting both positive and negative impacts. The paper concludes with recommendations for sustainable herbicide use and alternative weed management strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4648593c653a4b942badfa3988130e36741061c379991790a6d10dca7ab3261b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
