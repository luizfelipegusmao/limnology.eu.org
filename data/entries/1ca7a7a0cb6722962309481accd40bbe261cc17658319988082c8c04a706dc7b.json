{"title":"Overwintering site selection and associated microclimates for the redbanded stink bug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), a non-native pest of soybean","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/2/277/7604296?rss=1","date":1707436800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cold winter temperatures govern the distribution and abundance of many insect species, but refugia that provide microclimates can moderate temperature-driven mortality. Winter temperatures have been implicated in limiting the survival and range of <span>Piezodorus guildinii</span> (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae; redbanded stink bug), an economically damaging invasive pest in the southeastern United States, but the role of refugia in overwintering survival of this pest is poorly understood. We conducted 2 studies in successive years to evaluate how leaf litter from hardwoods, pines, and soybeans modulate overwintering site selection and survival of <span>P. guildinii</span>. In the second-year study, we also quantified the buffering effect of the 3 leaf litter types compared to ambient conditions and assessed diapause. In the first-year study, we found that stink bugs preferentially dispersed into leaf litter compared with remaining unsheltered on bare soil; no clear preference among leaf litter types was found. In the second year, however, no clear differences were found among leaf litter types and bare soil. Means of daily minimum temperatures under leaf litter were at least 3.0 ± 0.9 °C (SE) warmer and generally less variable than ambient conditions. While high mortality in both studies illustrates that more work must be done to fully understand overwintering survival, limited survival through potentially lethal conditions in the first-year study nonetheless emphasizes the possibility of populations persisting and rebounding in the following spring. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential for stink bugs to persist in areas with lethal ambient temperatures by dispersing into widely available substrates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"1ca7a7a0cb6722962309481accd40bbe261cc17658319988082c8c04a706dc7b","category":"Environment"}
