{"title":"Partial Reversal of Coronary Stenosis with Intravenous Hydrogen and Oxygen Nanobubble Administration: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1488/v1","date":1718947462000,"content":"Background. Coronary artery disease (CAD) with extensive stenosis presents significant clinical challenges. This case report details the management and outcomes of a 61-year-old male with a notable history of CAD, initially treated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), followed by an innovative intravenous hydrogen and oxygen nanobubble therapy due to recurrent symptoms.Case Presentation. Mr. BH was diagnosed with significant stenosis in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and left circumflex (LCx) artery, initially managed by CABG. Recurring symptoms led to the adoption of a novel treatment involving hydrogen and oxygen nanobubbles. Following treatment initiation, Mr. BH experienced substantial improvements in physical capacity and symptomatic relief, with an ability to climb 22 flights of stairs and resolution of previous symptoms such as dyspnea and cough. Despite these improvements, subsequent imaging revealed in-stent restenosis and progression of graft disease.Discussion. The application of hydrogen and oxygen nanobubbles as a therapy in CAD is explored, highlighting potential mechanisms such as reduction of oxidative stress and improvement in endothelial function. This case contrasts the effects of conventional surgical and pharmaceutical interventions with the novel nanobubble therapy, illustrating both the benefits and complexities of managing advanced CAD with innovative treatments.Conclusion. While Mr. BH showed clinical improvement with nanobubble therapy, the development of new severe stenosis and restenosis underscores the need for further research to understand the long-term efficacy and mechanisms of nanobubble therapy in complex CAD cases. This case suggests that while innovative therapies may provide symptomatic relief and functional improvement, they do not obviate the need for ongoing surveillance and possibly further intervention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d66a1501bd2c40650a2e7d7ec6c8b014f7f5654a0a124258ddfedc0b244d40f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
