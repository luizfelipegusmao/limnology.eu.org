{"title":"Metabolomics analysis of bioactive compositions of Michelia macclurei Dany and its antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13860?af=R","date":1725451475000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p><i>Michelia macclurei</i> Dandy is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, but little is understood about the bioactive compositions and biological potential of its different parts, limiting their applications. This study aims to identify the bioactive compositions and analyze differences in accumulation patterns from different parts of <i>Michelia macclurei</i> (heartwood, sapwood, bark, root, leaf, and fruit) using metabolomics. It also seeks to explore their biological potential and analyze the relationship between the bioactive compositions and biological potential.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A total of 63 volatile metabolites (VMs) were identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) in six parts, and the VMs in each part were dominated by sesquiterpenes and their derivatives (71.40–88.32%). Six parts of <i>Michelia macclurei</i> contained structurally diverse non-volatile metabolites (NVMs) with a total of 207 bioactive compounds, including 92 alkaloids, 30 flavonoids, 19 lignans, and 18 organic acids, utilizing ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS) analysis. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that the accumulation patterns of bioactive compositions differed significantly among the different parts, and the 25 VMs and 72 NVMs could be considered potential markers for distinguishing the different parts of <i>Michelia macclurei</i>. The excellent antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory capacity of extracts of all six parts was indicated by <i>in vitro</i> bioactivity assays. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the bioactive compositions in the six parts were significantly correlated with antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study offers helpful information on the distribution of bioactive compositions in different parts of <i>Michelia macclurei</i> and confirms the excellent antioxidant, and enzyme inhibitory potential of its extracts, which could provide scientific evidence for its potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry, cosmetics, and functional foods. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Shixiang Chen, \nBochen Wei, \nLili Wen, \nPenglian Wei, \nYunlin Fu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"56b6f62f27b1b55e811c523705c6d98c7051d2aa8de78e3883f8192e4fc2eeef","category":"Environment"}
