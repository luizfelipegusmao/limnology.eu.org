{"title":"An All-in-One Device for a Rapid and Simple Genetic Detection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0665/v1","date":1728469260000,"content":"Diagnostics often require specialized equipment and trained personnel in laboratory settings, creating a growing need for point-of-care tests (POCT). Among genetic testing methods, Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) offers a viable solution for developing genetic POCT due to its compatibility with simplified devices. This study aimed to create a genetic test that integrates all steps from sample processing to results while minimizing the complexity, handling, equipment, and time required. Several challenges were addressed to achieve this goal: 1) Developing a buffer for bacterial DNA extraction that is compatible with both LAMP and immunochromatographic tests; 2) Adapting the LAMP protocol for its use with the device; and 3) Optimizing the detection protocol for specific test conditions, with a lateral flow immunoassay format selected for its POCT compatibility. Following these developments, the test was validated using Escherichia coli and non-E. coli strains. A portable heating station was also developed to enable amplification without costly equipment. The resulting genetic POCT achieved 100% sensitivity and 85% specificity, with results available in 60 to 75 minutes. This study demonstrated that our closed-method POCT efficiently performs DNA extraction, amplification, and detection for bacterial identification. The testâ€™s simplicity and cost-effectiveness will support its implementation in various settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c14d2ddd4112deaf43d7798c439db4c155e198f82515ebcddda9efb8b422ee96","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
