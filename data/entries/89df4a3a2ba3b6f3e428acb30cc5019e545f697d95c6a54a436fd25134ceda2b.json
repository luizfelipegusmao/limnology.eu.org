{"title":"Active Learning with Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks on Unstructured Meshes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0922/v1","date":1720666327000,"content":"This paper investigates the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in active learning cycles. We defined two scenarios: one semi-supervised and the other fully supervised. PINNs emphasize the integration of physical laws into neural networks to improve the predictive performance of vanilla neural networks and to enhance the efficiency of traditional methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Key contributions include adapting existing computational frameworks to enable the use of Graph Neural Networks for solving problems that require the calculation of gradients on unstructured triangle meshes, a query strategy focusing on the physical loss, and a comparative analysis of this strategy against random sampling across both defined scenarios. This work establishes a foundation for future research aimed at expanding the application of Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks (PIGNN) using active learning and addressing real-world problems in fluid dynamics and electrodynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"89df4a3a2ba3b6f3e428acb30cc5019e545f697d95c6a54a436fd25134ceda2b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
