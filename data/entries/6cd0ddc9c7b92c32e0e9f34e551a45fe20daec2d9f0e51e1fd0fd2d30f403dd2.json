{"title":"Identification of a novel signature based on M6a modification regulators related LncRNA for stratification of the prognosis of prostate cancer","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24114?af=R","date":1709898124000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Prostate cancer emerges as a life-threatening disease that affects approximately 1.3 million patients of male population globally. Various studies established lncRNAs as a critical role in prostate cancer progression by regulating multiple epigenetic pathways. Therefore, it is imperative to disclose the involvement of lncRNAs in prostate cancer and their usability as prognostic markers for the disease. The model was constructed using Cox and LASSO analysis. The accuracy of model was evaluated using various cohorts. Furthermore, the study assessed the correlative relationship of the model with tumor immunity, immunotherapy, SNV mutation, and drug sensitivity, among other factors. We developed an accurate and stable prognostic model for prostate cancer patients by screening out 11 m6A regulators related lncRNAs and integrating pathological features and age through a nomogram model. The model had satisfactory accuracy and stability in stratification of clinical outcomes of prostate cancer patients, as demonstrated by AUC values (higher than 0.7) at 3, 5, and 7 years in both internal and external cohorts. Moreover, we performed PCA analysis to confirm m6A-related lncRNAs as the best modeling strategy. We developed a prognosis predicting model based on 11 selected m6A modification related lncRNA, which displayed satisfactory potency in multiple cohorts.</p>","author":"Sheng‐xiong Wang, \nXiang‐hui Xie","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"6cd0ddc9c7b92c32e0e9f34e551a45fe20daec2d9f0e51e1fd0fd2d30f403dd2","category":"Environment"}
