In contrast, the association between ambient air pollution levels and SGA or LGA births has not been investigated in Japan; hence, the purpose of our study is to investigate this association.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Methods</h3>\n                      <p>We used birth data from Vital Statistics in Japan from 2017 to 2021 and municipality-level data on air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), photochemical oxidants, and particulate matter 2.5 (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). Ambient air pollution levels throughout the first, second, and third trimesters, as well as the whole pregnancy, were calculated for each birth. The association between SGA/LGA and ambient levels of the air pollutants was investigated using crude and adjusted log-binomial regression models. In addition, a regression model with spline functions was also used to detect the non-linear association.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Results</h3>\n                      <p>We analyzed data from 2,434,217 births. Adjusted regression analyses revealed statistically significant and positive associations between SGA birth and SO<sub>2</sub> level, regardless of the exposure period. Specifically, the risk ratio for average SO<sub>2</sub> values throughout the whole pregnancy was 1.014 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.009, 1.019) per 1Â ppb increase. In addition, regression analysis with spline functions indicated that an increase in risk ratio for SGA birth depending on SO<sub>2</sub> level was linear. Furthermore, statistically significant and negative associations were observed between LGA birth and SO<sub>2</sub> except for the third trimester.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Conclusions</h3>\n                      <p>It was suggested that ambient level of SO<sub>2</sub> during the pregnancy term is a risk factor for SGA birth in Japan.</p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"ceaad01576f8e0701c1d05a8563bad631c473b4d0890f5728e16ed3f15b51b82","category":"Environment"}
