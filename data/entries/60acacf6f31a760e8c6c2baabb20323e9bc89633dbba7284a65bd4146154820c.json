{"title":"Streak Imaging in a Dynamic Transmission Electron Microscope","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.704/7719839?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>A suite of high-speed electron microscopy instruments and methods have been developed in the past few decades to watch nanomaterial excitation and dynamics in real time [<a href=\"#ozae044.704-B1\">1-3</a>]. The most widespread is the ultrafast transmission electron microscope (UTEM), which has been used to study light-induced excited states of materials with femtosecond time resolution. As a single pulse does not contain sufficient electrons to form an image, a UTEM image is collected stroboscopically, and capturing one single frame can require an exposure of more than a minute [<a href=\"#ozae044.704-B1\">1</a>]. A time series of 20 frames can then take 30 minutes to collect, requiring stable microscope operation, no sample degradation, and its reversible response on this time scale. Alternatively, the dynamic transmission electron microscope (DTEM) has been developed for snapshot imaging of transient and irreversible processes such as phase transformations. The DTEM relies on the generation of high-charge electron pulses (∼10<sup>7</sup>–10<sup>8</sup> electrons per pulse) to form an image in a single shot [<a href=\"#ozae044.704-B4\">4</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.704-B5\">5</a>], while the movie-mode DTEM (MM-DTEM) can film a transient event utilizing a train of such pulses [<a href=\"#ozae044.704-B6\">6</a>]. At this high-charge limit, electron-electron interactions play a significant role in defining many properties of the pulses. For example, the maximum photoemitted current density is governed by the Child-Langmuir limit [<a href=\"#ozae044.704-B7\">7</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.704-B8\">8</a>], the pulse energy distribution is broadened by the Boersch effect [<a href=\"#ozae044.704-B1\">1</a>], and the pulse also suffers from longitudinal and transverse broadening at beam crossovers as it propagates in the column [<a href=\"#ozae044.704-B1\">1</a>]. Despite all these effects, no measurements of the temporal profile of high-charge electron pulses in a DTEM have been previously reported.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"60acacf6f31a760e8c6c2baabb20323e9bc89633dbba7284a65bd4146154820c","category":"Environment"}
