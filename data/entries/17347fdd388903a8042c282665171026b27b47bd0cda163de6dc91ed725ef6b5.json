{"title":"Novel Spectrometer Designs for Laser Driven Ion Acceleration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0963/v1","date":1715677617000,"content":"We propose novel spectrometer designs that aim to enhance the measured spectral range 1\nof ions on a finite-sized detector. In contrast to the traditional devices that use uniform magnetic 2\nfield, in which the deflection of particles increases inversely proportional to their momentum, in a 3\ngradient magnetic field, the deflection of particles will be decreased due to the reduction of the 4\nmagnetic field along their propagation. Low energy ions are particularly impacted, as they are 5\ndeflected less and are more likely to reach the detector compared to being driven out of it while 6\nusing a uniform magnetic field. By the means of a gradient magnetic field, the nonlinear dispersion 7\nof ions in a homogeneous magnetic field can approach a nearly linear dispersion. Nonetheless, 8\nthe dispersion of low energy ions in a homogeneous magnetic field remains unnecessarily high. 9\nIn this article, we explore linear, quadratic, and higher-order field profiles in comparison to the 10\nhomogeneous field case. We discuss the employed methodology and present simulation results of 11\nthe spectrometer with an extended ion spectral range, focusing on the minimum detectable energy 12\n(energy dynamic range) and energy resolution","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17347fdd388903a8042c282665171026b27b47bd0cda163de6dc91ed725ef6b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
