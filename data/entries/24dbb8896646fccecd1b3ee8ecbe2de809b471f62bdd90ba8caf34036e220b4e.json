{"title":"Inclusive Strategies for AI-Driven Employment in Malaysia: Decentralization, Policy Interventions, and Collaborative Governance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1671/v1","date":1714124003000,"content":"The abstract summarizes the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on employment in Malaysia, highlighting the need for comprehensive strategies to ensure inclusivity and equitable access to AI-driven opportunities and digital skills training. It addresses the research problem of potential inequalities and marginalization among vulnerable populations due to uneven distribution of AI-related employment opportunities and training. The research objectives focus on developing decentralized strategies tailored to rural communities and marginalized groups, alongside evaluating policy interventions for equitable access. The literature review provides theoretical frameworks emphasizing skill development, understanding structural shifts, fostering inclusive innovation, and promoting collaborative governance. Future research directions include implementing and evaluating strategies in real-world contexts, exploring technological solutions, conducting qualitative research on individuals' experiences, and adopting interdisciplinary approaches. Overall, a multidimensional approach combining theoretical insights, empirical evidence, and stakeholder engagement is essential for developing inclusive and sustainable solutions to harness AI's potential for the benefit of all Malaysians.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24dbb8896646fccecd1b3ee8ecbe2de809b471f62bdd90ba8caf34036e220b4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
