Increased oxidative stress and inflammation have detrimental effects on gut health. The present study aimed to investigate the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory response in a piglet model challenged with ETEC and to evaluate whether the chosen probiotic could improve intestinal function in piglets. A total of 24 weaned piglets susceptible to ETEC F4 infection were randomly divided into four groups: Group 1 (control), Group 2 (<span>E. coli infection</span>), Group 3 (<span>E. coli</span> infection received antibiotic avilamycin), and Group 4 (<span>E. coli</span> infection received <span>B. licheniformis</span> HG76). Group 2, Group 3 and Group 4 were infected with <span>E. coli</span> by an oral gavage of ETEC F4 (5 mL, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL). Five days after infection, piglets in all groups were euthanized. The blood and intestine samples (a mid-jejunum segment) were collected, and serum was prepared. ETEC infection significantly increased serum and jejunal malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations and serum diamine oxidase (DAO) activity (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). ETEC infection also significantly decreased tight-junction proteins (ZO1, occludin), superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, ETEC infection significantly increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interlueken (IL) -6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α] in the intestine (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Antibiotic or probiotic supplementation mitigated oxidative stress and inflammation, as evidenced by decreased oxidative stress biomarkers, increased expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, HO-1) and downregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Antibiotic or probiotic supplementation also improved intestinal integrity, as demonstrated by decreased DAO activity and increased tight-junction proteins expression (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammatory response can improve piglet gut integrity after ETEC infection.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"3f964f9d71e8d8b71592eee64ddb4738103aa8ef6687221beacfb4d67e926d7a","category":"Environment"}
