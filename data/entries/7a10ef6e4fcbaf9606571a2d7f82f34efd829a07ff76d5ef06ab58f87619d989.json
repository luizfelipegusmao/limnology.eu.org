This was achieved in several steps, including usage of Suzuki reaction for functionalization of 2-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)quinoline moiety. The new compound exhibits blue fluorescence. Its structure was confirmed with 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy, IR-spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry and X-ray analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a10ef6e4fcbaf9606571a2d7f82f34efd829a07ff76d5ef06ab58f87619d989","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
