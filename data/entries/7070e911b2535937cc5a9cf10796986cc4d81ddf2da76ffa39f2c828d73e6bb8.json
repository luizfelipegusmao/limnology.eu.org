{"title":"A Comparative Analysis of the Phytochemical Profiles of Lonicera japonica Thunb. Flos Thunb. Species Native to the Mountainous and Coastal Regions of Romania","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1494/v1","date":1716453929000,"content":"This study aimed to examine the chemical makeup and antioxidant properties of hydroalcoholic extracts obtained from Lonicera japonica Thunb. Thunb. (honeysuckle) flowers collected from two geographically distinct regions of Romania: a mountainous region (Făgăraș Mountainous, Brașov) and a coastal region (Black Sea, Constanța). Our research revealed that the extracts from these two regions differed significantly in terms of their total polyphenol, flavone, and phenolic carboxylic acid content, as well as their antioxidant activity. These results suggest that climatic factors play a crucial role in shaping the phytochemical profile and antioxidant activity of Lonicera japonica Thunb. Thunb. extracts. Therefore, these findings could potentially contribute to the development of standardized herbal preparations and nutraceutical products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7070e911b2535937cc5a9cf10796986cc4d81ddf2da76ffa39f2c828d73e6bb8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
