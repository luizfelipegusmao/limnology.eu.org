{"title":"Recent Advances in Ammonia Synthesis Modeling and Experiments on Metal Nitrides and Other Catalytic Surfaces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0774/v1","date":1723459509000,"content":"In this review we explore the recent progress in catalytic materials for ammonia synthesis that are based on metal nitrides and other catalytic surfaces. It comprises a detailed overlook of various techniques used in ammonia synthesis research and the state-of-the-art modeling techniques employed to investigate new reaction mechanisms and more efficient processes for sustainable ammonia synthesis production. The review is discussed in the context of reaction mechanisms developed and recent progress that has been made with respect to thermal, electrochemical and photocatalytic ammonia synthesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a8df8aeec6b8a8761aaef6f63e493a17bde3efaba239017b7bf93b674f3c659","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
