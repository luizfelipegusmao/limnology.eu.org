{"title":"Prescribed fire regimes influence responses of fungal and bacterial communities on new litter substrates in a brackish tidal marsh","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311230","date":1727791200000,"content":"<p>by Viet Q.

Differences in chemical composition and dynamics of litter should arise from fire histories that generate pyrodiverse plant communities, tropical cyclones that deposit wrack as litter, tidal inundation that introduces and alters sediments and microbes, and interactions among these different processes. The resulting diversity and dynamics of available litter compounds should affect microbial (fungal and bacterial) communities and their roles in litter substrate dynamics and ecosystem responses over time. We experimentally examined effects of differences in litter types produced by different fire regimes and litter loads (simulating wrack deposition) on microbial community composition and changes over time. We established replicated plots at similar elevations within frequent tidal-inundation zones of a coastal brackish Louisiana marsh. Plots were located within blocks with different prescribed fire regimes. We deployed different measured loads of new sterilized litter collected from zones in which plots were established, then re-measured litter masses at subsequent collection times. We used DNA sequencing to characterize microbial communities, indicator families, and inferred ecosystem functions in litter subsamples. Differences in fire regimes had large, similar effects on fungal and bacterial indicator families and community compositions and were associated with alternate trajectories of community development over time. Both microbial and plant community compositional patterns were associated with fire regimes, but in dissimilar ways. Differences in litter loads introduced differences in sediment accumulation associated with tidal inundation that may have affected microbial communities. Our study further suggests that fire regimes and tropical cyclones, in the context of frequent tidal inundation, may interactively generate substrate heterogeneities and alter microbial community composition, potentially modifying fine fuels and hence subsequent fires. Understanding microbial community compositional and functional responses to fire regimes and tropical cyclones should be useful in management of coastal marsh ecosystems.","author":"Viet Q.
