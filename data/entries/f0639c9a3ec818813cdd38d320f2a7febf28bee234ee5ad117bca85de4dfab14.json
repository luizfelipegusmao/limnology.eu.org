{"title":"Glioblastoma Standard of Care: Effects on Tumor Evolution and Reverse Translation in Preclinical Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1373/v1","date":1718846991000,"content":"Glioblastoma (GBM) presents a significant public health challenge as the deadliest and most common malignant brain tumor in adults. Despite standard-of-care treatment, which includes surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, mortality rates are high, underscoring the critical need for advancing GBM therapy. Over the past two decades, numerous clinical trials have been performed, yet only a small fraction demonstrated benefit, raising concerns about the predictability of current preclinical models. Traditionally, preclinical studies utilize treatment-na√Øve tumors, failing to model the clinical scenario where patients undergo standard-of-care treatment prior to recurrence. Recurrent GBM generally exhibits distinct molecular alterations influenced by treatment selection pressures. In this review, we discuss the impact of treatment - surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy - on GBM. We also provide a summary of treatments used in preclinical models, advocating for their integration to enhance the translation of novel strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes in GBM.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0639c9a3ec818813cdd38d320f2a7febf28bee234ee5ad117bca85de4dfab14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
