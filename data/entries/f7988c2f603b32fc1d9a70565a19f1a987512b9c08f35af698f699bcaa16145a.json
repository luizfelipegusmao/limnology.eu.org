He exhibits low solubility in metals, resulting in the formation of helium bubbles that originate from a cluster of vacancies [<a href=\"#ozae044.879-B1\">1</a>], and, by the nature of their associated strains, they can impede plasticity by acting as obstacles to dislocations [<a href=\"#ozae044.879-B2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.879-B3\">3</a>]. Locally, the He bubble is hypothesized to exert outward pressure on the surrounding metal matrix and, due to sharp changes in the density of the material, can cause macroscopic changes to the elastic modulus [<a href=\"#ozae044.879-B4\">4</a>]. Recent developments in 4D-STEM with high-speed direct electron detectors [<a href=\"#ozae044.879-B5\">5</a>] and atomic resolution STEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.879-B6\">6</a>] provide an opportunity to map defect distributions, and their associated strains, at the nanoscale which has far-reaching implications for detailed analysis of complex irradiation damage.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f7988c2f603b32fc1d9a70565a19f1a987512b9c08f35af698f699bcaa16145a","category":"Environment"}
