{"title":"Comparison of Luting Cement Solubility: A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1540/v1","date":1729504444000,"content":"Dental restoration success relies on the physical properties of luting cements. Luting cements fill the space between teeth and restoration, provide retention and protection from occlusal forces, and act as a barrier to microleakage in the oral environment. This review aims to evaluate and compare the solubility of the three most used dental luting cements: glass ionomer (GI), resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI), and resin cement (RC). Studies selected for review compared solubilities of combination of GI, RMGI and RC in solutions with different pH levels to replicate acidic oral pH. Review of the studies concluded that resin cement had the overall lowest degree of solubility in all pH values and all ranges of storage periods, followed by RMGI and GI cement. Success of restoration is dependent upon luting cements. Results of the studies reviewed show that all dental luting cements showed some degree of dissolution. Resin cement overall demonstrated the least amount of solubility, followed by RMGI and GI cement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0db00d2e197b740c2748b511dd19243e84233e071091bab6ec1984b7cc711618","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
