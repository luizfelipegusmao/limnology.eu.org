{"title":"An integrative biology approach to understanding keratinocyte collective migration as stimulated by bioglass","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ib/article/doi/10.1093/intbio/zyae008/7633175?rss=1","date":1710979200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A critical phase of wound healing is the coordinated movement of keratinocytes. To this end, bioglasses show promise in speeding healing in hard tissues and skin wounds. Studies suggest that bioglass materials may promote wound healing by inducing positive cell responses in proliferation, growth factor production, expression of angiogenic factors, and migration. Precise details of how bioglass may stimulate migration are unclear, however, because the common assays for studying migration in wound healing focus on simplified outputs like rate of migration or total change in wound area. These outputs are limited in that they represent the average behavior of the collective, with no connection between the motion of the individual cells and the collective wound healing response. There is a need to apply more refined tools that identify how the motion of the individual cells changes in response to perturbations, such as by bioglass, and in turn affects motion of the cell collective. Here, we apply an integrative biology strategy that combines an <span>in vitro</span> wound healing assay using primary neonatal human keratinocytes with time lapse microscopy and quantitative image analysis. The resulting data set provides the cell velocity field, from which we define key metrics that describe cooperative migration phenotypes. Treatment with growth factors led to faster single-cell speeds compared to control, but the migration was not cooperative, with cells breaking away from their neighbors and migrating as individuals. Treatment with calcium or bioglass led to migration phenotypes that were highly collective, with greater coordination in space compared to control. We discuss the link between bioglass treatment and observed increases in free calcium ions that are hypothesized to promote these distinct coordinated behaviors in primary keratinocytes. These findings have been enabled by the unique descriptors developed through applying image analysis to interpret biological response in migration models.<div><strong>Insight Box/Paragraph Statement</strong>: Bioglasses are important materials for tissue engineering and have more recently shown promise in skin and wound healing by mechanisms tied to their unique ionic properties. The precise details, however, of how cell migration may be affected by bioglass are left unclear by traditional cell assay methods. The following describes the integration of migration assays of keratinocytes, cells critical for skin and wound healing, with the tools of time lapse microscopy and image analysis to generate a quantitative description of coordinated, tissue-like migration behavior, stimulated by bioglass, that would not have been accessible without the combination of these analytical tools.</div></span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"08ec31a93e0a3f830088f3051f0870206dac7048d685312e4717ea0a4882ca75","entryHash":"43e99238e75a42bbcf1e1cf1556f461f741b9ba9f0baeef49a707a6a969692c3","category":"Environment"}
