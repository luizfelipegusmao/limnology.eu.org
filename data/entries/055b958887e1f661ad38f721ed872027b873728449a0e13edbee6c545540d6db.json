{"title":"ROS 2 Key Challenges and Advances: A Survey of ROS 2 Research, Libraries, and Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1204/v1","date":1728991555000,"content":"This study presents a comprehensive systematic review that addresses the critical transi- 1\ntion from ROS 1 to ROS 2, spotlighting the significant enhancements and the pressing need for a 2\ndetailed exploration of ROS 2 within the robotics community. Despite the extensive deployment 3\nand adaptations of ROS in varied robotics applications, literature lacks a cohesive synthesis that 4\ndelineates the advancements, limitations, and broader impacts of ROS 2 compared to its predecessor, 5\nROS 1. Our contribution bridges this gap by assembling the largest database of ROS-related research, 6\nencompassing 7,498 articles, with a focused analysis in this survey on 431 ROS2-specific publications. 7\nWe categorize these into i.) articles that discuss and analyze core ROS 2 concepts, ii.) articles that 8\npropose frameworks or tools for ROS 2, and iii.) articles utilizing ROS 2. Furthermore, we summarize 9\nliterature findings of ROS 2 challenges, advancements, and future direction in the fields of a.) security, 10\nb.) real-time, c.) middleware, d.) embedded and distributed systems, e.) communication reliability 11\nand QoS, and f.) multi-robot systems. The methodology involved meticulous data collection and 12\ncategorization from multiple databases, facilitating an in-depth online accessible resource. Results 13\nunderscore ROS2’s enhancements in modularity, real-time capabilities, and security, extending its 14\napplicability across various robotic platforms and industries. However, challenges in scalability and 15\nreliability persist, signaling avenues for future enhancements. This review not only deepens the 16\nunderstanding of ROS2’s contributions but also charts a path for ongoing improvements in robotic 17\nsystems design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"055b958887e1f661ad38f721ed872027b873728449a0e13edbee6c545540d6db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
