{"title":"Structure and Function of Auxin Transporters","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-arplant-070523-034109?TRACK=RSS","date":1721606400000,"content":"<div><p>Auxins, a group of central hormones in plant growth and development, are transported by a diverse range of transporters with distinct biochemical and structural properties. This review summarizes the current knowledge on all known auxin transporters with respect to their biochemical and biophysical properties and the methods used to characterize them. In particular, we focus on the recent advances that were made concerning the PIN-FORMED family of auxin exporters. Insights derived from solving their structures have improved our understanding of the auxin export process, and we discuss the current state of the art on PIN-mediated auxin transport, including the use of biophysical methods to examine their properties. Understanding the mechanisms of auxin transport is crucial for understanding plant growth and development, as well as for the development of more effective strategies for crop production and plant biotechnology.</p></div>","author":"Ulrich Z.
