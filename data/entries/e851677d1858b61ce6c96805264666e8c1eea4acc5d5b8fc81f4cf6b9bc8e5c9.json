{"title":"Evaluation of Muscle Synergy Flexibility Induced by a Muscle Nerve Block in Chronic Stroke Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0490/v1","date":1720437403000,"content":"Background : Drug treatments for gait disorders in post-stroke patients aim to reduce muscular hyperactivity. Analysis of muscle activity is essential to help clinicians understand these disorders. The aim of this study was to quantify changes in muscle synergies before (PRE) and after (POST) rectus femoris nerve block.\nMethods : Gait analysis of 8 post-stroke patients before and immediately after nerve block. Muscle synergies were quantified from electromyographic signals. We have selected: the account for variance indicating the robustness of the synergies, the recruitment selectivity index indicating the degree of multiplexing of the synergies, and the recruitment consistency index indicating the variability of the synergies.\nResults : A decrease in VAF is observed, suggesting a reduction in gait pattern robustness. We also note that spatial and temporal primitives are slightly different (IRC, IRS) in PRE vs. POST, and that their activation is more nested in POST than in PRE. \nConclusions : The motor nerve block has not created new muscle synergies of the paretic limb during gait, but indicates that there is flexibility in motor organization. This method of quanti-fication may enable clinicians to assess the motor adaptation potential of their post-stroke patient.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e851677d1858b61ce6c96805264666e8c1eea4acc5d5b8fc81f4cf6b9bc8e5c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
