However, the contamination of groundwater by heavy metals (HMs) has profound implications for public health. Industrialization, urbanization, and agricultural activities are turning out to be major causes for the increasing concentration of HMs in rapidly industrializing areas like Rohtak district, Haryana, India. The current study aimed at evaluating and predicting the health hazards associated with the radical rise of HMs in the groundwater of Rohtak district. For this purpose, 45 seasonal-based groundwater samples were collected from five blocks in Rohtak district, namely Kalanaur, Meham, Lakhan Majra, Rohtak City, and Sampla, both during pre- and post-monsoon seasons. Besides physicochemical analysis, these groundwater samples were analyzed for the contamination of HMs. The findings revealed that groundwater samples were relatively more contaminated during the post-monsoon period rather than pre-monsoon. The water quality index (WQI), devised to classify water quality into specific classes, depicted the Kalanaur region as “very poor.” Another index named the HM pollution index (HPI) denoted the levels of HMs and categorized Kalanaur as most deteriorated, followed by Meham, Lakhan Majra, Sampla, and Rohtak City. Additionally, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed that showed a significant variation in the distribution pattern of HMs, with the major load being attributed to PC1 and PC2 for both seasons. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated a significant association of pH (<i>R</i>\n<sup>\n   <i>2</i>\n</sup> = 0.917) with HMs (specifically for Cd and Cr). In terms of health risk assessment, carcinogenic human health risk due to Pb and Cr was found to be higher in children than adults. Non-carcinogenic risk, indicative of harmful human health effects, apart from cancer, was calculated in terms of hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI). Results of the same, designated “children” as a vulnerable category compared with “adults,” especially in the Kalanaur, Sampla, and Rohtak City blocks of the study area. The results thus reiterated that Kalanaur is the most contaminated block among the five blocks chosen and should be given urgent attention. The study holds importance as it provides a framework regarding the methodology that should be adapted for the evaluation, management, and protection of groundwater at a regional level, which could further be replicated by environmentalists and hydrogeologists across the world.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nWater logging is one of the most common problems in Kalanaur block of Rohtak district, responsible for causing groundwater pollution.\nCadmium and lead pollution was prevalent in Rohtak due to electroplating industries, paint industry, automobile sector, and industrial discharge.\nBioremediation is one of the suitable techniques that can be used for the treatment of groundwater that involves the use of microorganisms.\nEfficient use of groundwater resources is necessary for sustainable development.\n</p>","author":"Nishita Narwal, \nDeeksha Katyal, \nAastha Malik","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"62d1735169e5b86d66afe4662ea9a61cf228af6a7a700e30a2de1e4877456e5e","category":"Environment"}
