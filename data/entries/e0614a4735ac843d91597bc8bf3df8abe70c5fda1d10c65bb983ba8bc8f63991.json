{"title":"Fuzzy Decision Making and Statistical Analysis of Key Factors Affecting Claim Management Process Groups in Construction Projects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1856/v1","date":1714354090000,"content":"In the realm of construction industry, the management of claims constitutes a pervasive and multifaceted issue, with potential repercussions extending to project delays, cost overruns, work suspensions, and, in extreme cases, project termination. This challenge is a significant and unavoidable hurdle due to the unique features of construction projects, which are complex, involve many stakeholders and come with inherent risks. To address this complex issue, it becomes imperative to undertake a comprehensive appraisal of the claims management procedures employed within the industry, culminating in the presentation of findings within a risk-based framework. The overarching objective of this endeavour is threefold: firstly, to discern the pivotal attributes that affect each category of construction claims; secondly, to establish a coherent decision-making paradigm for the effective administration of such claims; and finally, to provide data that can be harnessed to either address concerns related to claims or enhance the effectiveness of the claims administration process. Keeping this in mind, this study serves to evaluate the factors associated with claim management gathered from a wide overview of literature, encompassing a range of construction projects, varying in terms of types, sizes/capacities and contractual arrangements. Hence, it advanced a refined method within the domain of fuzzy group decision-making, denoted as the Modified Fuzzy Group Decision-Making Approach (FGDMA) in addition to extensive statistical analysis using SPSS.V.25 software. They were applied to assess, analyze and prioritize claim about 108 claim management factors based on the responses obtained from the comprehensive questionnaire survey involving 104 industry professionals. This multi-faceted approach, which combines the insights from previous publications, along with the collective experience of the surveyed professionals with the analytical capabilities of the FGDMA- Statically Factor Analysis, reinforces the robustness and practical applicability of proposed methodology within the context of construction claims management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0614a4735ac843d91597bc8bf3df8abe70c5fda1d10c65bb983ba8bc8f63991","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
