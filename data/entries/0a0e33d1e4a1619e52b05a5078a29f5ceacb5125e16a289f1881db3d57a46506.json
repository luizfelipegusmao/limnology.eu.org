{"title":"Improving the robustness of the Sequentially Optimized Reconstruction Strategy (SORS) for visual field testing","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301419","date":1712239200000,"content":"<p>by Runjie Bill Shi, Moshe Eizenman, Yan Li, Willy Wong</p>\r\n\r\nPerimetry, or visual field test, estimates differential light sensitivity thresholds across many locations in the visual field (e.g., 54 locations in the 24â€“2 grid). Recent developments have shown that an entire visual field may be relatively accurately reconstructed from measurements of a subset of these locations using a linear regression model. Here, we show that incorporating a dimensionality reduction layer can improve the robustness of this reconstruction. Specifically, we propose to use principal component analysis to transform the training dataset to a lower dimensional representation and then use this representation to reconstruct the visual field. We named our new reconstruction method the transformed-target principal component regression (TTPCR). When trained on a large dataset, our new method yielded results comparable with the original linear regression method, demonstrating that there is no underfitting associated with parameter reduction. However, when trained on a small dataset, our new method used on average 22% fewer trials to reach the same error. Our results suggest that dimensionality reduction techniques can improve the robustness of visual field testing reconstruction algorithms.","author":"Runjie Bill Shi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0a0e33d1e4a1619e52b05a5078a29f5ceacb5125e16a289f1881db3d57a46506","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
