It explores how these systems streamline operations, improve workflow automation, and support real-time communication, helping SMEs overcome resource limitations and enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, the review considers how these integrated technologies, particularly when combined with advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), contribute to better resource allocation, strategic planning, and long-term business performance.
