{"title":"A 'Turing Test' for Self-Awareness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0359/v1","date":1712213473000,"content":"In this paper, I propose a test for machine self-awareness inspired by the Turing test. While my test is plain and simple, it offers a much-needed alternative to ungrounded speculation while still capturing the essence of self-awareness. I discuss how to apply the test to Large Language Models and conduct experiments on GPT-3.5 that suggest it is not self-aware. I discuss the implications of machine self-awareness and relate it to questions about meaning and understanding. Finally, I present some next steps for studying self-awareness in machines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb7a8e59556c4f6fa8e3b54b0727057df987acb9ccaaa2b65b44fa9d91305b2a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
