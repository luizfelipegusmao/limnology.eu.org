{"title":"Whole‐Genome Analyses Reveal the Distinct Taxonomic Status of the Hainan Population of Endangered Rucervus eldii and Its Conservation Implications","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.70010?af=R","date":1726469903000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Eld's deer <i>Rucervus eldii</i> (McClelland, 1842) is an ungulate that lives in tropical lowland forests in several countries of Indochina and Hainan Island of China. Its remaining population is small and scattered, and the species is listed as an Endangered species on the IUCN Red List. The debate over the taxonomic status of the Hainan population has persisted for over a century—as an island-endemic subspecies <i>R. e. hainanus</i>, or an insular population of the subspecies <i>R. e. siamensis</i>, would have significant conservation implications. And, given the Hainan population had experienced both population bottleneck and multiple translocations in the past, conservation genomics would be a powerful tool to evaluate the genetic impacts of these events. In this study, we used conservation genomics assessment to study population differentiation and genetic diversity of <i>R. e. siamensis</i> in Cambodia and three Eld's deer subpopulations on Hainan Island. Based on the unique genetic profile and demographic analysis, this study corroborated previous studies using genetic markers that the Hainan Eld's deer warrants the taxonomic status of a distinct subspecies. The Hainan population exhibits a reduction in genetic diversity and an increase in the level of inbreeding when compared to the population of Cambodia. The signs of purifying selection were found against homozygous loss-of-function mutations to decrease the deleterious burden in the Hainan population. However, there was an accumulation of more deleterious missense mutations. Furthermore, significant differences in genetic diversity and level of inbreeding found among the three Hainan subpopulations indicated population isolation and suboptimal translocation strategies, which calls for urgent, coordinated, and science-based genetic management to ensure the long-term viability of the endemic subspecies <i>hainanus</i>. This study provides guidance for the conservation and management of Eld's deer.</p>","author":"Chenqing Zheng, \nQing Chen, \nMichelle Hang Gi Wong, \nNick Marx, \nThananh Khotpathoom, \nHesheng Wang, \nFeng Yang, \nXiaodong Rao, \nBosco Pui Lok Chan, \nYang Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Evolutionary Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"df2df3df25f90ba55fdf535f13dd2e89e7355c6f34118f20800f9e7201897f76","entryHash":"b6a1870fe49b7ebc0cdf63fdd5fcaf3cf118194edbfae921497d97e4b49a6c6e","category":"Environment"}
