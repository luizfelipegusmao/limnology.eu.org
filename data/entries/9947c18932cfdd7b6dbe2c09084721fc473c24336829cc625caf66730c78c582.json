{"title":"The COVID-19 pandemic and food insecurity in households with children: A systematic review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308699","date":1723125600000,"content":"<p>by Anna Williams, Nisreen A. Alwan, Elizabeth Taylor, Dianna Smith, Nida Ziauddeen</p>\r\nBackground <p>Food insecurity is defined as not having safe and regular access to nutritious food to meet basic needs. This review aimed to systematically examine the evidence analysing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food insecurity and diet quality in households with children &lt;18 years in high-income countries.</p> Methods <p>EMBASE, Cochrane Library, International Bibliography of Social Science, and Web of Science; and relevant sites for grey literature were searched on 01/09/2023. Observational studies published from 01/01/2020 until 31/08/2023 in English were included. Systematic reviews and conference abstracts were excluded. Studies with population from countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development were included. Studies were excluded if their population did not include households with children under 18 years. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood institute (NIH) tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies was used for quality assessment. The results are presented as a narrative review.</p> Results <p>5,626 records were identified and 19 studies were included. Thirteen were cross-sectional, and six cohorts. Twelve studies were based in the USA, three in Canada, one each in Italy and Australia and two in the UK. Twelve studies reported that the COVID-19 pandemic worsened food insecurity in households with children. One study reported that very low food security had improved likely due to increase in benefits as part of responsive actions to the pandemic by the government.</p> Conclusion <p>Although studies measured food insecurity using different tools, most showed that the pandemic worsened food security in households with children. Lack of diversity in recruited population groups and oversampling of high-risk groups leads to a non-representative sample limiting the generalisability. Food insecure families should be supported, and interventions targeting food insecurity should be developed to improve long-term health.</p>","author":"Anna Williams","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9947c18932cfdd7b6dbe2c09084721fc473c24336829cc625caf66730c78c582","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
