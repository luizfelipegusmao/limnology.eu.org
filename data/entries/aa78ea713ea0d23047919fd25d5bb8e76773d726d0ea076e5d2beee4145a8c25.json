{"title":"Gold Recovery from Smelting Copper Sulfide Concentrate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1473/v1","date":1726737418000,"content":"Gold is a significant revenue source for custom copper smelters facing profitability challenges due to low treatment and refining charges, stricter regulations, and rising costs. Gold is also often blended with copper concentrates, but precise recovery rates from smelting processes are poorly documented despite gold critical economic importance. This paper aims to provide the first comprehensive estimates of gold first-pass recovery across various operational units within the copper sulfide concentrate processing flowsheet. It evaluates the effectiveness of different copper smelting and converting technologies in recovering gold. Optimizing gold first-pass recovery is especially important to enhance immediate financial returns and responsiveness to market dynamics, allowing companies to capitalize on favorable gold prices without delays. Given the absence of direct measurements for gold recovery rates, this research develops an estimation method based on understanding gold loss mechanisms during smelting. The study identifies and analyzes key input and output parameters by examining data from various copper producers. By correlating these parameters with gold loss, the research estimates gold first-pass recovery rates within the copper smelting process. Among integrated smelting-converting routes, the flash smelting to Peirce-Smith converting route achieves the highest gold first-pass recovery (98.8–99.5%), followed by the Mitsubishi continuous smelting and converting process (94.3–99.8%), bottom-blowing smelting to bottom-blowing converting (95.8%), flash smelting to flash converting (95.5%), Teniente smelting to Peirce-Smith converting (95.2%), and the Noranda continuous smelting and converting process (94.8%). The final recovery rates are expected to be higher considering the by-products internal recirculation and post-processing within the copper flowsheet. Additionally, superior gold recoveries are attributed to advanced metallurgical practices and control systems, which vary even among companies with similar technologies. The research demonstrates that copper smelting can effectively recover over 99% of gold from sulfide concentrates. Gold accumulates up to 1000 times its original concentration in anode slime during electrolytic refining, generating 5-10 kilograms of slime per ton of copper, which is further processed to recover gold and other by-products. Major smelters operate precious metal plants where recovering gold from highly concentrated anode slime is both cost-effective and efficient.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa78ea713ea0d23047919fd25d5bb8e76773d726d0ea076e5d2beee4145a8c25","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
