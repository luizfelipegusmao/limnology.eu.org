{"title":"Modelling and Analysis of the Transverse Surface Roughness in Hollow Core Fibers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1615/v1","date":1729558059000,"content":"The corrugation of the interfaces of the cross-section of hollow core fibers based on the inhibited coupling waveguiding mechanism is modeled and the impact on propagation loss is analyzed. The proposed model is based on a combined use of coupled mode theory and azimuthal decomposition. It shows that such transverse roughness causes coupling between the core modes and the dielectric modes of the cladding and consequently an increase of the fiber loss. The model is validated by comparing theoretical and numerical results obtained by applying both deterministic and stochastic corrugations to tube lattice and nested fibers. Scaling laws and impact of fiber parameters are discussed. The model shows that the loss increase is not directly correlated to the root mean square of the stochastic roughness, but only to the value of the power spectral density in specific spatial frequency ranges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"849987ad1918410958b427e377748bf07b3c4d38a950f70fcc717ebcd7b527b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
