{"title":"Effects of Different Feeding Regimes on Growth Performance, Survival Rate, Carcass Composition, Fatty Acids Profile, and Digestive Enzyme Activities of Great Sturgeon (Huso huso Linnaeus, 1758) Larvae","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/9936622?af=R","date":1687935600000,"content":"<p>Six different feeding regimes (FR) were tested from 7 to 38 days post hatching (dph). Five thousand four hundred larvae (7 dph, 0.048 g) were randomly stocked in 18 fiberglass tanks contained 100 L fresh water (300 larvae per each tank). In larvae fed with FR-B, includes <i>Artemia</i> nauplii (AN) + <i>Artemia</i> biomass (AB) + microdiet (MD), the body weight (BW) at the end of trail (38 dph) similar the FR-D (AN + CHL + AB + MD), and E (AN + CHL + AB), was at high level. Survival rate was higher in larvae fed FR-A includes AN + chironomid larvae (CHL) + MD, but had a lower BW (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Moderate BW and survival rate were detected in larvae fed FR-C (AN + DP + MD). Larvae fed only MD (FR-F), had the lowest survival and the highest BW (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Different FR had a significant effect on crude protein (CP), crude fat (CF), ash, and dry weight (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The larvae fed FR-C and D had the highest CP (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The highest CF and ash in larvae were detected in FR-F and C, respectively (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Larvae from FR-A and B had higher levels of <i>n</i>−3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in comparison with others FR (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The use of AB and CHL can increased the weight and survival rate of larvae, respectively. At the end of trail, the activity of pepsin, trypsin, lipase and <i>α</i>-amylase enzyme levels were lower in FR-B and F than others FR. Totally, by using a combination of AN + CHL + AB + MD had better results than others and ordered to <i>H. huso</i> larvae feeding. Using MD alone, can cause lesser development of the digestive system and little attractiveness, therefore it can cause starvation, and the empty digestive tract of larvae.</p>","author":"Reza Ghorbani Vaghei, \nAyoub Yousefi Jourdehi, \nZabihollah Pajand, \nMaryam Monsef Shokri, \nMahmoud Mohseni, \nZhitao Qi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"45cf26dee2993f17f56c29a14dcd0e63428bcac36791775940a2619eb1108df9","category":"Environment"}
