{"title":"Fish know no borders—Implications of the genetic structure and mixed‐stock composition to cross‐border management of adfluvial brown trout","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12663?af=R","date":1709729842000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Effective management of migrating fish stocks requires an understanding of population structure and each stock's contribution to the fishery. Water bodies spanning across national borders pose a particular challenge. We investigated the genetic structure of 13 adfluvial brown trout populations from natal rivers and conducted a genetic mixed-stock analysis of brown trout from the cross-border Lake Pyaozero Basin in eastern Fennoscandia, using 16 microsatellite loci. Our analysis revealed a clear genetic structure of three distinct geographic groups, consisting of river-specific populations. The Western and Southern groups, which included 11 rivers, contributed over 90% to the mixed stock in the lacustrine rearing area. This mixed stock of several river-specific subpopulations renders poorly managed fishing in the area a significant threat to the entire native adfluvial brown trout population complex.</p>","author":"Ari Huusko, \nRaisa Nikula, \nPirjo Tanhuanpää, \nMarja‐Liisa Koljonen, \nTuomas Leinonen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"dc6c1722385867c0b6c48389b2441ecde4d557624148bec5f3429a1b9731f9f0","category":"Environment"}
