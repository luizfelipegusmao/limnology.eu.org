Magnetic skyrmions have drawn significant research attention for their novel physics and their potential applications in spintronics and logic devices [<a href=\"#ozae044.507-B1\">1-4</a>]. However, their practical potential has not been fully realized due to the difficulty of creating stable skyrmions in ambient conditions, and of achieving efficient current-driven mobility. Multilayer thin films have provided a solution to the former issue, allowing for a tunable skyrmion phase and leading to skyrmion lattices which are stable at room temperature and remanence [<a href=\"#ozae044.507-B1\">1</a>]. However, the latter issue remains. This is in part because while magnetic skyrmions are fundamentally 2-dimensional, the materials that host them are 3-dimensional, and the resulting skyrmions are not necessarily uniform through the thickness of the material. In multilayer thin films, the helicity of the skyrmions’ domain walls (DWs) twists from Bloch-type in the bulk of the film to Néel-type at the surfaces [<a href=\"#ozae044.507-B4\">4</a>] as a result of surface-volume stray field interactions (see Fig. 1). These Bloch DWs in the bulk combined with Néel caps create a structure known as a hybrid skyrmion which can significantly affect the response to a driving current [<a href=\"#ozae044.507-B5\">5</a>]. In addition, the topology of this structure is novel and non-trivial, with a Hopf index – a 3-dimensional analog to the skyrmion index – of ±1/2.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2614484ebdd2d9b782dae9da2314a1aa1f1ed33b7b5316d206e65e134ef9b944","category":"Environment"}
