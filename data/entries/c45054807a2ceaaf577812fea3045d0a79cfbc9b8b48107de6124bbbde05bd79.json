The extract can be used for various purposes including for larviculture development, immune booster and consequently growth promoter.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>High-intensity aquaculture may cause the aquatic animals to experience elevated stress levels, which in turn will increase their susceptibility to illness and result in substantial losses. Farmers frequently use chemical and antibiotic treatments for fish diseases, which have led to drug-resistant and hazardous residues in farmed fish and the environment. Consequently, finding substitutes for chemicals and antibiotics is crucial for disease management in aquaculture. <i>Terminalia catappa</i> L. or commonly called Indian almond is well known for its medicinal properties and widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions. <i>T. catappa</i> contains chemical compounds such as tannin and flavonoid that play an important role in antibacterial, anti-allergy, anti-inflammation, and anti-cancer. Numerous studies have been conducted on leaves, bark, fruits, and seed of <i>T. catappa</i> for their applications, including medicinal, bioremediation (dye absorption), and aquaculture use. Much research can be found on the utilization of <i>T. catappa</i> leaves to improve fish well-being, mostly in the ornamental fish industry. Extract of <i>T. catappa</i> has been found to improve fish survival, growth rate, inhibit bacterial infection, improve water quality, enhance fish colouration, and boost the immune response. Although <i>T. catappa</i> leaves have undergone substantial research, it has not been systematically described in connection to fish species used in aquaculture. This review will systematically discuss the biotoxicity of <i>T. catappa</i> evaluation of growth-promoting properties, eggs and larviculture performance, and enhancement of fish resistance to various bacteria, fungi, and parasites. In addition, the article also highlights the future perspectives of using <i>T. catappa</i> to improve fish culture.</p>","author":"Xu Wang, \nNorhidayah Mohd Taufek, \nNorhafiza Mohd Arshad","siteTitle":"Wiley: Reviews in Aquaculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e603512385355dc11b8c11c7000aba80fad3ae9faea7a2537d8e3609c19b97a1","entryHash":"c45054807a2ceaaf577812fea3045d0a79cfbc9b8b48107de6124bbbde05bd79","category":"Environment"}
