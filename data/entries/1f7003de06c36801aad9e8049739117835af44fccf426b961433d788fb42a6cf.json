{"title":"Trajectories of State-Level Sepsis-Related Mortality by Race and Ethnicity Group in the United States","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1462/v1","date":1711361477000,"content":"Background: Recent reports on the national temporal trends of sepsis-related mortality in the United States (US) suggested outcome improvement in several race and ethnicity groups. However, it is unknown whether national data reflect state-level trajectories. \nMethods: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research Multiple Cause of Death dataset to identify all decedents with sepsis in the US during 2010-2019. Negative binomial regression models were fit to estimate national and state-level trends of age-adjusted sepsis-related mortality rates within race and ethnicity groups.\nResults: There were 1,852,610 sepsis-related deaths in the US during 2010-2019. Nationally, sepsis-related mortality rates decreased among Blacks and Asians, were unchanged among Hispanics and Native Americans, and rose among Whites. The percent of states with similar trends were 30.0% among Blacks, 32.1% among Asians, 74.3% among Hispanics, 75.0% among Native Americans, and 66.7%% among Whites, while trending in opposite direction from 3.6% among Asians to 15.0% among Blacks. \nConclusions: National trends in sepsis-related mortality in the US did not represent state-level trajectories in race and ethnicity groups. Gains in sepsis outcomes among race and ethnicity groups at the national level were not shared equitably at the state level.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f7003de06c36801aad9e8049739117835af44fccf426b961433d788fb42a6cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
