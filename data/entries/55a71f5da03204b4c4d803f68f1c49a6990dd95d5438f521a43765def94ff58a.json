{"title":"DWARF TILLER1 regulates apical–basal pattern formation and proper orientation of rice embryos","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/309/7697067?rss=1","date":1718928000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Body axis establishment is one of the earliest patterning events in plant embryogenesis. Asymmetric zygote division is critical for apical–basal axis formation in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). However, how the orientation of the cell division plane is regulated and its relation to apical–basal axis establishment and proper position of embryos in grasses remain poorly understood. By characterizing mutants of 3 rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) <span>WUSCHEL HOMEOBOX9</span> (<span>WOX9</span>) genes, whose paralogs in Arabidopsis play essential roles in zygotic asymmetric cell division and cell fate determination, we found 2 kinds of independent embryonic defects: topsy-turvy embryos, in which apical–basal axis twists from being parallel to the longitudinal axis of the seed to being perpendicular; and organ-less embryos. In contrast to their Arabidopsis orthologs, OsWOX9s displayed dynamic distribution during embryo development. Both DWT1/OsWOX9A and DWL2/WOX9C play major roles in the apical–basal axis formation and initiation of stem cells. In addition, <span>DWT1</span> has a distinct function in regulating the first few embryonic cell divisions to ensure the correct orientation of the embryo in the ovary. In summary, DWT1 acts in 2 steps during rice embryo pattern formation: the initial zygotic division, and with DWL2 to establish the main body axes and stem cell fate 2 to 3 d after pollination.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"55a71f5da03204b4c4d803f68f1c49a6990dd95d5438f521a43765def94ff58a","category":"Environment"}
