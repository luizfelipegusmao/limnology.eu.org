The triple allylated curcumin was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a923af371b743ef645bba13c9285c181ae380ec9d098f11b4b9db7dac039d37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
