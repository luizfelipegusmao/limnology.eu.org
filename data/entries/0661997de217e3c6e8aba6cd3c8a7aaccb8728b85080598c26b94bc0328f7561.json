{"title":"Riparian wetlands of low-order streams in Brazil: extent, hydrology, vegetation cover, interactions with streams and uplands, and threats","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-022-05056-8","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Low-order streams and riparian wetlands are important contributors to the drainage network in the landscape. However, there has been little research into the nature of these ecosystems in Brazil. Our estimates show that riparian wetlands of low-order streams and other small associated wetlands cover at least 25% of the forested part of the Amazon basin and about 10% of the Cerrado region. Information on the semi-arid Caatinga is lacking, but ~ 3% of the area may be occupied by riparian wetlands and other small wetland types, many of which are periodically dry. Riparian vegetation includes a very large richness in tree species. The amount and species richness of herbaceous plants depend on light availability. In-streams of the semi-arid region of Brazil, hydrophytes are restricted by unpredictable flash floods and periodic drought. Aquatic food webs are largely based on the organic matter produced by the riparian vegetation. Large-scale agriculture and cattle ranching pose a serious threat to riparian wetlands, their biodiversity, and their function as a buffer in the hydrological cycle of the landscape. A nation-wide screening program would provide a more detailed picture and allow the elaboration of a national conservation and restoration program for the Brazilian riparia.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"0661997de217e3c6e8aba6cd3c8a7aaccb8728b85080598c26b94bc0328f7561","category":"Environment"}
