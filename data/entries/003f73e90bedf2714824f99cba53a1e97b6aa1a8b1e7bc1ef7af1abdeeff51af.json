{"title":"Multiple Natural Approaches of Salix alba","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1840/v1","date":1711705143000,"content":"Abstract: The Willows, belonging to the genus Salix, encompass a vast array of species and hybrids, totaling between 330 to 500 species along with approximately 200 hybrids. These plants are found across continents such as Africa, North America, Europe, and Asia, exhibiting diverse forms ranging from trees to shrubs and prostrate plants. Traditionally, Willows have been utilized in folk medicine due to their rich reservoir of biologically active compounds, with salicin being a notable example, serving as a prodrug for salicylic acid.The chemical composition of Willows is highly diverse, with 322 secondary metabolites identified thus far. These include various classes such as flavonoids (94 types encompassing flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, flavan-3-ols like catechins and procyanidins, chalcones, dihydrochalcone, anthocyanins, and dihydroflavonols), phenolic glycosides (76), organic acids (28), non-phenolic glycosides (17), sterols, and terpenes (17), simple phenolics (13), lignans (7), as well as volatiles and fatty acids (69). This rich chemical di-versity underpins the various pharmacological activities exhibited by Willows.\nThe pharmacological properties attributed to Willows are extensive and include analgesic, an-ti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, cytotoxic, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antiobesity, neuroprotective, and hepatoprotective effects. These properties make Willows a subject of con-siderable interest in the fields of medicine and pharmacology.\nIn summary, Willows represent a valuable natural resource with a diverse chemical composition and a wide range of pharmacological activities. This study aimed to enhance our comprehension of the medicinal characteristics of willow bark extract, focusing on its antimicrobial properties. This investigation holds significance in validating the traditional usage of willow bark and investi-gating its potential utility in contemporary medicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"003f73e90bedf2714824f99cba53a1e97b6aa1a8b1e7bc1ef7af1abdeeff51af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
