{"title":"Mass mortality event of round sardinella Sardinella aurita Valenciennes associated with Glugea Thélohan, 1891 microsporidian infection off the southern Italian coast","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13995?af=R","date":1719908666000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Intracellular parasites of the genus <i>Glugea</i> Thélohan, 1891 (Microsporidia) comprise about 34 putative species capable of causing high morbidity and mortality in freshwater and marine teleost fishes. In this study, we report on the first mass mortality event associated with <i>Glugea</i> sp. infecting free-ranging round sardinella <i>Sardinella aurita</i> in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy). Here, we describe the ultrastructure of mature spores of this microsporidian and characterize it molecularly, as well as report its phylogenetic position. Most of the affected fish showed an irregular swelling of its abdomen. At necropsy, a variable number of xenomas, spherical to ellipsoidal in shape, were found in the peritoneal cavity strongly attached to the viscera of all fish. Histological analysis revealed varying severity of chronic inflammation along with occasional necrosis in visceral organs associated with multiple xenoma proliferation. These pathological findings were considered the main cause of this mass mortality event. Morphologically, the present material was closely related to <i>G. sardinellesis</i> and <i>G. thunni</i>. The phylogenetically closest taxa to the newly SSU rDNA sequence were <i>G. thunni</i> and an erroneusly identified  <i>G. plecoglossi</i>, which were very closely related to each other, also suggesting that all these sequences might belong to the same species.</p>","author":"Alejandro López‐Verdejo, \nFlavia Occhibove, \nBarbara degli Uberti, \nFrancisco E.
