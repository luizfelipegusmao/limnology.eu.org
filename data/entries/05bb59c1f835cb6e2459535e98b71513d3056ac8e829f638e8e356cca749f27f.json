{"title":"Investigating Arctic Permafrost Dynamics Using Electrical Resistivity Imaging and Borehole measurement in Svalbard","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0527/v1","date":1723065098000,"content":"This study utilized electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) to investigate subsurface characteristics near Nicolaus Copernicus University Polar Station on the western Spitsbergen-Kaffiøyra Plain, island in the Svalbard archipelago. Surveys along two lines, LN (148 meters) collected in 2022 and 2023 and ST (40 meters) collected in 2023, were conducted to assess resistivity and its correlation with ground temperatures. The LN line revealed a 1 to 2 meters thick resistive unsaturated outwash sediment layer, potentially indicative of permafrost. Comparing LN resistivity result between 2022 and 2023, a 600 Ohm-m decrease in the unsaturated active layer in 2023 was observed, attributed to a 5.8℃ temperature increase, suggesting a link to global warming. ERI along the ST line depicted resistivity reaching its minimum at approximately 1.6 meters, rising to over 200 Ohm-m at 4 meters, and slightly decreasing to around 150 Ohm-m at 7 meters. Temperature measurements from the ST line's monitoring well confirmed permafrost at a depth of 1.6 to 2 meters. Additionally, water content distribution in the ST line was estimated after temperature correction, revealing a groundwater table depth of approximately 1.06 meters, consistent with measurements from the S4 borehole on the ST line. This study provides valuable insights into Arctic subsurface dynamics, emphasizing the sensitivity of resistivity patterns to climate change and offering a comprehensive understanding of permafrost behavior in the region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05bb59c1f835cb6e2459535e98b71513d3056ac8e829f638e8e356cca749f27f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
