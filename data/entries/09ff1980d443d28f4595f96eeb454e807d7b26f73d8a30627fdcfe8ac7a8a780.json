{"title":"130 Effect of an appeasing substance application on growth, stress, handling quality and reproduction of Bos indicus beef heifers synchronized to fixed-time AI","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/62/7617973?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This experiment evaluated the effects of an analogue of bovine appeasing substance (BAS) on growth, stress, handling quality, and reproduction of Nellore heifers. Twenty-nine heifers [body condition score (BCS) = 4.84 ± 0.13; body weight (BW) = 371 ± 0.77 kg; 23 ± 2 months of age)] were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: 1) Saline solution (0.9 NaCl; n = 14) or BAS (Secure Cattle, IRSEA Group, Quartier Salignan, France; n = 15). Both solutions were applied topically in the nuchal skin area (5 mL/heifers) at the beginning (d -9) of the fixed-time artificial insemination protocol (FTAI). Heifers were allocated in two different pastures according to the treatment (one pasture per treatment) for 15 d (time of action of BAS) and then combined in a single group (both treatments in the same pasture). Heifers were inseminated on d 0, and BW and BCS were collected on d -9 and 40. The temperament in the squeeze chute (entry and exit scores; scale 1 – 3; chute score; scale 1 – 5; greater values mean more reactive heifers) and blood samples were collected on d -9, 0, 7, 14 and 30. The percentual of aggression, accident, and dirtiness in the perineal region were evaluated on d 0 along with time to inseminate, estrus expression scores (scale 1 – 3; 1 = no expression, 2 = low expression, 3 = greater expression), and dominant follicle size. The corpus luteum size was measured on d 7 and 14, and the pregnancy and embryo size on d 40. The BAS vs. Saline-treated heifers tended to have greater BW change (23.6 vs. 20.8 ± 1.03 kg; P = 0.09) and had greater BCS change (0.05 vs. -0.21 ± 0.05; P &lt; 0.01). The BAS vs. Saline-treated heifers tended to have lesser entry scores (1.42 vs. 1.67 ± 0.09; P = 0.09) and percentual of dirtiness in the perineal region (48.3 vs. 71.1 ± 8.67 %; P = 0.06), and no effects of treatment were detected (P ≥ 0.39) for chute score, exit score, aggression, accident and time to inseminate. The BAS vs. Saline-treated heifers had greater estrus scores (2.00 vs. 1.27 ± 0.21; P = 0.03), and no effects were detected (P ≥ 0.11) for ovarian variables, pregnancy rate, and conceptus size. Furthermore, no treatment effects were detected (P ≥ 0.25) for serum concentration of cortisol and plasma concentration of haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin, and progesterone. Therefore, BAS application at the beginning of the FTAI protocol could decrease the temperament and dirtiness in the perineal region and increase the growth and estrus expression of beef heifers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"09ff1980d443d28f4595f96eeb454e807d7b26f73d8a30627fdcfe8ac7a8a780","category":"Environment"}
