{"title":"Resolving abrupt frontal gradients in zooplankton community composition and marine snow fields with an autonomous Zooglider","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12642?af=R","date":1721803473000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>An autonomous <i>Zooglider</i> navigated across the California Current Front into low salinity, minty waters characteristic of the California Current proper in both summers of 2019 and 2021. Diving to 400 m depth, <i>Zooglider</i> transited another near-surface frontal gradient somewhat inshore. These frontal gradients were generally associated with changes in intensity, size composition, and Diel Vertical Migration responses of acoustic backscatterers. They were also associated with pronounced changes in zooplankton community composition, as assessed by a shadowgraph imaging Zoocam. Zoocam detected a decline in concentrations of copepods, appendicularians, and marine snow in the offshore direction, and an overall shift in community structure to a higher proportion of carnivorous taxa (and, in 2019, of planktonic rhizaria). No taxon was consistently elevated at all the peak frontal gradients, but appendicularians, copepods, and rhizarians sometimes showed front-related increases in concentration. Such frontal gradient regions represent relatively abrupt transitions to different communities of planktonic organisms and suspended marine snow particles, with consequences for predator–prey relationships and the dominant vectors of particle export into subsurface waters.</p>","author":"Sven Gastauer, \nMark D.
