{"title":"Tungsten Disulfide-Based Materials and Their Conjugates for Cancer Photothermal Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1155/v1","date":1728966529000,"content":"Cancer remains one of the most critical global health issues. Conventional treatments, such as radiotherapy, surgery, or chemotherapy, have limitations, especially concerning side effects, resistance, and recurrence. Consequently, new innovative treatments to overcome these problems are needed. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising alternative that uses photothermal agents that convert near-infrared light (NIR) into heat to kill cancer cells. Nanoparticles can be used as photothermal agents and also as drug delivery platforms, improving the drugsâ€™ stability, allowing for targeted delivery, and reducing toxicity. Due to its broad absorption band, high surface area, and versatility for surface functionalization, tungsten disulfide (WS2) has high potential in this context. This paper presents the state-of-the-art on the use of WS2-based materials to achieve effective and biocompatible anti-anticancer new treatment strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa4376d1f29802d482537c3197bc1ca7fa1447c016eceb9646e5b50aff2d1325","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
