{"title":"Visions and Paradigms of Transport and Cities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1527/v1","date":1711434625000,"content":"Cars are a highly inefficient mode of urban transport with significant negative impacts. Electric \nvehicles make it possible to eliminate direct CO2 emissions (though the total over a vehicle’s \nentire life cycle greatly offsets the advantages) but leave unchanged – or even aggravate – all \nthe other negative effects on the quality of urban environments. Three visions for urban \ntransport were presented: automobility, multimodality and accessibility. The first dominates \nNorth American cities, the second European one. The anomalies of these two visions have been \nexamined. The automobility cities cannot manage the congestion and the attempts are self-\ndefeating. The anomalies of multimodality city are related to the public space consumption for \nmobility and the impossibility to plan spatial proximity. The sustainable vision, that resolve the \nanomalies, is represented by the accessibility city in the Triple Access System (TAS) version \nwhich, however, still has a long way to go to be accepted and implemented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab40b66d56361231363cc42b975c2ee029ab8966ec00036ee2e63d596f4da5ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
