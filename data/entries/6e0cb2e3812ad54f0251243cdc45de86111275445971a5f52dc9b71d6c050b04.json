{"title":"A Hybrid Text Summarization Technique of Student Open-Ended Responses to Online Educational Surveys","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0426/v1","date":1723032720000,"content":"This study investigates the effectiveness of a text summarization method applied to open-ended student evaluations at the Hellenic Open University, aiming to improve the analysis of qualitative feedback from online educational surveys. To address the challenges of processing large volumes of student feedback, an automated summarization technique utilizing advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining is proposed. Using the TextRank and the Walktrap algorithms, student comments on positive aspects, study challenges, and improvement suggestions were analyzed. The analysis revealed that while some students expressed satisfaction with tutor-student interactions and the organization of educational material, there were also negative comments about outdated content in some modules and scheduling issues. The findings highlight the importance of qualitative feedback for education quality, providing actionable insights for improving curricula and teaching effectiveness. This research responds to the growing need for effective qualitative data analysis in higher education and contributes to ongoing discussions about student satisfaction in distance learning environments. By effectively summarizing open-ended responses, university staff can better understand student experiences and make informed decisions to enhance the educational process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e0cb2e3812ad54f0251243cdc45de86111275445971a5f52dc9b71d6c050b04","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
