{"title":"It Is Not Always Bad, Positive Experiences of Guardians Utilizing Vhembe Primary Health Care Facilities for Under-Five Child Health Services: An Interpretative Phenomenology Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0582/v1","date":1718111013000,"content":"Introduction: Guardians play a pivotal role in the management of childhood illness. Their responsibilities include home managing childhood illnesses and supporting continuity of care following healthcare facility treatment. Evidence has shown that guardians' negative experience in health care facilities when accessing under-five childcare services impacts their utilization of such facilities. Exploration of guardians' experiences is important in providing the evidence base necessary for quality childcare and reducing under-five morbidity and mortality. The study aimed to explore the experiences of guardians of children under five regarding the care received in Vhembe healthcare facilities.\nMethods: A qualitative approach using an interpretative phenomenology analysis (IPA) was used for this study. The study was conducted in eight primary healthcare facilities in the Vhembe district, with the highest headcount for children under five. Sixteen guardians were purposefully sampled for the study. Data analysis was done following the IPA steps of data analysis. Trustworthiness criteria were followed: credibility, confirmability, dependability, authenticity, and transferability. Ethical approval was obtained from the university and the province, followed by permission from the district and the operational managers before data collection.\nResults: The three emerging themes are associated with participants' positive experiences as they interfaced within the healthcare system: quality care, healthcare environment, support, and empowerment. The ten sub-themes were: timely service provision, availability of medicines, perceived nursing competence and professionalism, person-centred care, welcoming environment, effective communication, positive attitude of healthcare providers, guardiansâ€™ satisfaction with care received, guardians' involvement in childcare and community support. \nConclusion: It is indeed not always bad. The participants in this study had positive care experiences, which is crucial in the optimal utilization of health care services, resulting in improved health outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95e4f058ca1c8787ee6c8bbd556e28837a76668eebe087bd91fe29298b6a1d54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
