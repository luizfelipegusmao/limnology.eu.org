{"title":"Advances in Encapsulating Marine Bioactive Compounds Using Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLC) and Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) for Health Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1622/v1","date":1729558026000,"content":"With increased life expectancy and improved modern lifestyles, there has been a growing concern for health, including the prevention of disease and the improvement of physical appearance. Consumers are increasingly aware of the benefits of using natural ingredients in healthcare products and at the same time are concerned about the challenges of sustainability. In this sense, the use of marine bioactive compounds as cosmetic ingredients and in food supplements has become increasingly popular due to the benefits derived from their various properties. However, some of these compounds have limited use, mainly due to their low stability and poor aqueous solubility, and solutions need to be developed to overcome these limitations. In this sense, the use of lipid nanoparticles, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), has been explored as these carriers show ability to protect and enhance the absorption of molecules. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of encapsulating these compounds and incorporating them into cosmetics and food supplements. However, there is still no global legislation and safety concerns have been raised. Further clinical studies in animals and humans are needed to clarify safety issues.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"167b6cfea1ecfe451df43a713fddf97abe1017c891a244c22d3234a85bd07870","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
