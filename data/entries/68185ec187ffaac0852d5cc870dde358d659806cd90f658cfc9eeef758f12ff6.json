Materials and methods: The methodology used was to analyze the Excel database of the Clinic, in such a way that it would allow comparing the pre-PROA and post-PROA data of 4 antibiotics, ceftriaxone3, ciprofloxacin4, meropenem5 and vancomycin6, measured in Daily Dose. defined. Results: According to the DDD values obtained for the 4 antibiotics, a reduction in DDD was identified in the post-Proa period. On the other hand, considering the DDD reported by the WHO for each of the antibiotics, significant differences were verified compared to the DDD obtained in the clinic in the hospitalization and ICU services. Conclusions: In conclusion, in the clinic there was evidence of a reduction in DDD in the post-ASP2 period compared to the pre-PROA period, both in hospitalization and in the ICU, as well as a slight to large effect with Cohen's D.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68185ec187ffaac0852d5cc870dde358d659806cd90f658cfc9eeef758f12ff6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
