{"title":"Evaluate the Impact of the Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) System on Older Adults in Japan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0819/v1","date":1710411072000,"content":"Objective: The long-term care insurance (LTCI) system was introduced in 2000 to provide financial support for long-term care services to older adults. What is known on this topic report focuses on a comparative analysis of how the LTCI system has affected older people in Japan. Methods: We obtained data from the literature about the LTCI system, compared and analysed the collected articles, and concluded. Results: The LTCI system has improved access to long-term care services, with more older adults receiving care than before the system’s implementation. This service has improved the quality of life for many elderly individuals who require assistance with daily activities. Furthermore, the LTCI system has alleviated the financial burden of long-term care services since the insurance covers a large portion of the costs. It has made older adults maintain their independence and dignity, as they can afford the necessary care without relying solely on their savings or burdening their families. Conclusions: Japan’s LTCI system has positively impacted older adults by improving access to long-term care services and alleviating financial burdens. However, challenges such as increasing demand and variations in service quality need to be addressed to ensure the system effectively supports older people in Japan.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ae4c859061feb2ffd7057e3c7e8018f366935b0884861fffd03e9b1bd03057c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
