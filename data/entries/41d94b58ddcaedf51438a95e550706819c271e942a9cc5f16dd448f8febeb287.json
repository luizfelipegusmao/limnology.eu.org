{"title":"Accuracy of Anti-SARS-CoV2 Antibody in Comparison with Surrogate Viral Neutralization Test in Person Living with HIV, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Chronic Kidney Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0348/v1","date":1712202827000,"content":"The presence of anti SARS-CoV2-RBD antibody (Anti-RBD) prevents severe COVID-19. We aimed to determine the accuracy of a point-of-care Anti-RBD test implemented in person living with HIV (PLWH), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We enrolled 182 non-comorbid subjects and 335 persons with comorbid (PLWH, SLE, CKD) to test anti-RBD assay compared to surrogate viral neutralization (SVNT) as the reference test. We performed linear correlation analysis between anti-RBD vs SVNT and a ROC analyses to ascertain anti-RBD cut-off at 30%, 60%, and 90% inhibition of SVNT to calculate accuracy. Correlations of anti-RBD to SVNT among all groups were excellent with R= 0.7903, R=0.7843, R=0.8153 among non-comorbid, SLE and CKD groups, respectively, with significantly higher correlation among the PLWH group (R=0.8877; p-value=0.0072) compared to non-comorbid group. The accuracy of the anti-RBD test among PLWH and CKD group was similar with the non-comorbid but showed lower sensitivity in the SLE group (p=0.000014). The specificity of the test remained high in all groups. In conclusion, the Anti-RBD test had excellent correlation to SVNT. The persistently high specificity in all groups suggests that this test can be reliably utilized to detect presence of low neutralization capacity, prompting additional vaccination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"41d94b58ddcaedf51438a95e550706819c271e942a9cc5f16dd448f8febeb287","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
