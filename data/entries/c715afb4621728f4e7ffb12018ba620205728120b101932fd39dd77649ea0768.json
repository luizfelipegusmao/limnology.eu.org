{"title":"Development of a Rapid Detection Method for Ethylene Glycol and Glycolic Acid in Feline Samples: A Response to Increasing Antifreeze Poisoning Incidents in Korea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1653/v1","date":1726892131000,"content":"Recently, cases of antifreeze poisoning in companion animals, particularly cats, have surged in the Republic of Korea. Ethylene glycol (EG), the toxic primary component of antifreeze, is metabolized into glycolic acid (GA), leading to severe conditions such as metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure. Traditional detection methods, although effective, are often time-consuming owing to complex sample preparation. This study involved a novel analytical method utilizing GC-MS for EG and LC-MS/MS for GA detection, which streamlined the detection process by eliminating the need for derivatization. The method was validated for accuracy and reliability, enabling the rapid and precise identification of EG and GA in biological samples. The study also included the successful application of this method in a case where initial exposure to antifreeze was not apparent, which highlighted the effectiveness of this method in diagnosing poisoning even in cases where clinical history is unclear. The development of this rapid diagnostic approach addresses the urgent need for the efficient detection of antifreeze poisoning, improving animal welfare and supporting forensic investigations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c715afb4621728f4e7ffb12018ba620205728120b101932fd39dd77649ea0768","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
