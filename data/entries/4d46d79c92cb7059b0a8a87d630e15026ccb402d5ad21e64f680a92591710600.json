Age-related decline in executive functions can therefore impact tasks like driving and social interactions, affecting overall life quality. It has been suggested that musical experience may benefit executive functions, counteracting cognitive aging. Our study compared executive functions in 122 amateur singers, instrumentalists, and people engaged in non-musical cognitive activities, revealing musicians' superior abilities in specific aspects of attention, inhibitory control, and working memory.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Despite the ubiquity of musical activities, little is known about the specificity of their association with executive functions. In this cross-sectional study, we examined this relationship as a function of age. Our main hypotheses were that executive functions would decline in older age, that this relationship would be reduced in singers and instrumentalists compared to nonmusician active controls, and that the amount of musical experience would be more strongly associated with executive functions compared to the specific type of activity. A sample of 122 cognitively healthy adults aged 20–88 years was recruited, consisting of 39 amateur singers, 43 amateur instrumentalists, and 40 nonmusician controls. Tests of auditory processing speed, auditory selective attention, auditory and visual inhibitory control, and auditory working memory were administered. The results confirm a negative relationship between age and executive functions. While musicians’ advantages were found in selective attention, inhibitory control, and auditory working memory, these advantages were specific rather than global. Furthermore, most of these advantages were independent of age and experience. Finally, there were only limited differences between instrumentalists and singers, suggesting that the relationship between music-making activities and executive functions may be, at least in part, general as opposed to activity-specific.</p>","author":"Marilyne Joyal, \nAlexandre Sicard, \nVirginia Penhune, \nPhilip L.
