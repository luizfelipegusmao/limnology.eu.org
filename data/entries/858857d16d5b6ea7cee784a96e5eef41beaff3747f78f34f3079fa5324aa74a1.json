These hematological malignancies result in the overproduction of mature blood cells and, if not treated, induce a risk of cardiovascular events and thrombosis. Pegylated IFN$\\alpha $ is commonly used to treat MPN, but no clear guidelines exist concerning the dose prescribed to patients. We applied a model selection procedure and ran a hierarchical Bayesian inference method to decipher how dose variations impact the response to the therapy. We inferred that IFN$\\alpha $ acts on mutated stem cells by inducing their differentiation into progenitor cells; the higher the dose, the higher the effect. We found that the treatment can induce long-term remission when a sufficient (patient-dependent) dose is reached. We determined this minimal dose for individuals in a cohort of patients and estimated the most suitable starting dose to give to a new patient to increase the chances of being cured.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Mathematical Medicine and Biology: A Journal of the IMA Current Issue","siteHash":"8e41cf2ed671fc83106bccd712981630d68940d521d41091ba0f730fc4a24554","entryHash":"858857d16d5b6ea7cee784a96e5eef41beaff3747f78f34f3079fa5324aa74a1","category":"Environment"}
