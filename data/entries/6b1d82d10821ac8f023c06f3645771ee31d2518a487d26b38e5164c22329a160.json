The position of a species along these axes can inform on their sensitivity to environmental change. For example, species with slow life histories are found to be less sensitive in their long-term population responses to environmental change than species with fast life histories.\n\nThis provides a tantalizing link between sets of traits and population responses to change, contained in a highly generalizable theoretical framework.\n\nLife history strategies are assumed to reflect the outcome of life history tradeoffs that, by their very nature, act at the individual level. Examples include the tradeoff between current and future reproductive success, and allocating energy into growth versus reproduction. But the importance of such tradeoffs in structuring population-level responses to environmental change remains understudied.\n\nWe aim to increase our understanding of the link between individual-level life history tradeoffs and the structuring of life history strategies across species, as well as the underlying links to population responses to environmental change.\n\nWe find that the classical association between lifehistory strategies and population responses to environmental change breaks down when accounting for individual-level tradeoffs and energy allocation.\n\nTherefore, projecting population responses to environmental change should not be inferred based only on a limited set of species traits.\n\nWe summarize our perspective and a way forward in a conceptual framework.\n</p>","author":"Mark Rademaker, \nAnieke van Leeuwen, \nIsabel M.
