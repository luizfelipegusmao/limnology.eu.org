{"title":"Wine, Polyphenols and the Matrix Effect: Is Alcohol Always the Same?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1345/v1","date":1721141350000,"content":"While the number of publications on wine and health is steadily increasing, ranging from molecular level to epidemiological studies, often with contradictory results, little attention has been given to an holistic approach. In this review some unusual concepts are considered, such as phytocomplex, vehicle and the Matrix effect. As an example, three mono/polyphenols present in wine, Tyrosol, Hydroxytyrosol and Resveratrol, have been selected and the consequences of respecting, disregarding or ignoring the Matrix effect are shown. Underestimation of the wine Matrix effect could lead to deceiving results, as in the case of de-alcoholized wine or wine-compound-based nutritional supplements,or in emphasizing a single component toxic activity, in this case alcohol, ignoring the specific protective action at molecular level of other compounds (polyphenols) present in the same Matrix. The dark side of Matrix effect is also discussed. It is suggested that specificity of wine should be always taken in consideration by public health Authorities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e51c51ba52cf2a90a8198c6f393666e84db04e5fe084a6ac5e14aceead6c9ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
