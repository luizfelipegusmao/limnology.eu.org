{"title":"VLC Applications for Market Penetration: Prospect, Challenges and the Future","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1610/v1","date":1716532707000,"content":"Visible light communication (VLC) has attracted much attention in recent years among industrial and academic researchers. The large scale use of energy efficient light emitting diodes (LEDs) in lighting applications offers a unique opportunity to use license free visible light as the carrier in wireless communications. It has many potentials to complement radio frequency (RF) based communication systems. Researchers working on VLC have mainly concentrated on improving the communication speeds to match with Wi-Fi though the latest generation Wi-Fi standards offer significantly higher capacity at longer communication distances. Thus, market penetration is challenging for VLC as Wi-Fi is already quite mature and ubiquitous. Commercialization of VLC can only be successful if VLC can offer applications where VLC is more advantageous over the existing RF-based solutions. Once VLC enters the market through specific applications and becomes more mature in the process, the ecosystem may gradually adopt VLC in broader applications. In this article, the state of the art of the three promising VLC applications, their issues, and possible solutions have been discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25a063c2f3712b8292784235863f48f64c294673af047b700378a733f14b4b30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
