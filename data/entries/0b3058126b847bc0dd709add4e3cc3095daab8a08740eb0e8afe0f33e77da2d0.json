{"title":"Irreversibility as a Measure of Loss of Working Capacity of a Chemical Reaction as a Thermodynamic Process: Definition With Partial Application of Extreme Values of Internal Energy and Entropy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0677/v1","date":1720504257000,"content":"Here, we consider a closed composite system consisting of a primary system where the chemical reaction occurs and is located in a p, T reservoir. In the ideal isentropic case (thermodynamic process), the change in the internal energy of the composite system (due to a chemical reaction) is wholly converted into useful work - maximum useful work. Irreversibility - a measure for the degradation of useful work - in a closed system generates entropy, i.e., the thermodynamic process is no longer isentropic. Applying the principle of maximum entropy and minimum internal energy to a part of the system's total volume and applying the elements of the system's volume for which the law of local equilibrium applies useful work and irreversibility can be defined. Suppose the primary system is viewed as a set of black box volume elements in which a chemical reaction occurs. In that case, the criterion of an isentropic process or a process with entropy generation becomes the Gibbs-Duham equation. It has been proven that De Donder's equation of entropy production of a chemical reaction is a particular form of Calen's equation â€“TdST = dUT where dST is the differential change of total entropy and dUT is the differential change of total internal energy of the composite system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b3058126b847bc0dd709add4e3cc3095daab8a08740eb0e8afe0f33e77da2d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
