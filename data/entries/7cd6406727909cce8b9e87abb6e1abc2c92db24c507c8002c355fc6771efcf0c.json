{"title":"Characterization and correlations of dominant microorganisms and volatile compounds in fermentation process of Yangjiang douchi","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13560?af=R","date":1722924325000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Yangjiang douchi (YD) is a traditional fermented soybean product, which is popular in Chinese cuisine for its unique flavor. However, due to its high salt content and unstable flavor, its competitiveness in the international market is gradually weakening. Microorganisms have a key role in the production process of YD because it is a fermented food but the effect of microorganisms on the volatile compounds of YD is also not currently clear.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this paper, aroma compounds and microbial diversity in different fermentation stages of YD were analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry/olfactometry (GC–MS/O) and IlluminaMiseq system sequencing. A total of 78 aroma-active compounds were detected throughout the fermentation process and they influenced the formation of flavor in YD. Fungi flora were relatively single in YD, and bacteria were rich and varied. A total of 418 species of bacteria were present during fermentation, with <i>unclassified_Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus_kloosii,</i> and <i>Bacillus_velezensis_Bacillus</i> predominating. There were 25 species of fungi at the species level, and <i>Aspergillus minisclerotigenes</i> (OTU 4) played a dominant role in the whole fermentation process.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p><i>Staphylococcus</i> and <i>Bacillus</i> in the bacterial genus were strongly correlated with most flavor compounds detected, and <i>A. minisclerotigenes</i> in the fungi were more relevant to flavor compounds. This research provides a theoretical basis for the enhancement of the flavor of traditional fermented douchi in China. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jing Zhang, \nZhuoxuan Han, \nHaitao Chen, \nShuqi Wang, \nJie Sun, \nNing Zhang, \nHuiying Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"7cd6406727909cce8b9e87abb6e1abc2c92db24c507c8002c355fc6771efcf0c","category":"Environment"}
