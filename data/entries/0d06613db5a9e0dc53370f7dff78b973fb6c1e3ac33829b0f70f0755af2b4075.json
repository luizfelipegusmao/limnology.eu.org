{"title":"A Reliable Multifaceted Solution against Foodborne Viral Infections: The Case of RiLK1 Decapeptide","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0877/v1","date":1713147396000,"content":"Food-borne transmission is a recognized route for many viruses associated with gastrointestinal, hepatic or neurological diseases. Therefore, it is essential to identify new bioactive compounds with broad-spectrum antiviral activity is needed to exploit innovative solutions against these hazards. Lately, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been recognized as promising antiviral agents. Indeed, while the antibacterial and antifungal effects of these molecules have been widely reported, their use as potential antiviral agents has not yet been fully investigated. Herein, the antiviral activity of previously identified or newly designed AMPs, was evaluated against the non-enveloped RNA viruses, Hepatitis A virus (HAV), and Murine Norovirus (MNV), a surrogate for human Norovirus. Moreover, specific assays were performed to recognize at which stage of the viral infection cycle the peptides could function. Results showed that almost all peptides displayed virucidal effects with about 90% of infectivity reduction on HAV or MNV. However, the decapeptide RiLK1 demonstrated, together with its antibacterial and antifungal properties, a notable reduction in viral infection for both HAV and MNV, possibly through direct interaction with viral particles or inhibition of the viral bonding to the cell receptors. Hence, RiLK1 could represent a versatile â€˜antimicrobial agent effective against various foodborne pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and fungi.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d06613db5a9e0dc53370f7dff78b973fb6c1e3ac33829b0f70f0755af2b4075","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
