{"title":"Cigarette smoke sustains immunosuppressive microenvironment inducing M2 macrophage polarization and viability in lung cancer settings","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303875","date":1716386400000,"content":"<p>by Francesca Bianchi, Valentino Le Noci, Giancarla Bernardo, Nicoletta Gagliano, Graziano Colombo, Michele Sommariva, Michele Palazzo, Isabella Dalle-Donne, Aldo Milzani, Serenella Pupa, Elda Tagliabue, Lucia Sfondrini</p>\r\nBackground <p>It is amply demonstrated that cigarette smoke (CS) has a high impact on lung tumor progression worsening lung cancer patient prognosis and response to therapies. Alteration of immune cell types and functions in smokersâ€™ lungs have been strictly related with smoke detrimental effects. However, the role of CS in dictating an inflammatory or immunosuppressive lung microenvironment still needs to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effect of <i>in vitro</i> exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) focusing on macrophages.</p> Methods <p>Immortalized murine macrophages RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in the presence of CS extract and their polarization has been assessed by Real-time PCR and cytofluorimetric analysis, viability has been assessed by SRB assay and 3D-cultures and activation by exposure to Poly(I:C). Moreover, interaction with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC1) murine cell models in the presence of CS extract were analyzed by confocal microscopy.</p> Results <p>Obtained results indicate that CS induces macrophages polarization towards the M2 phenotype and M2-phenotype macrophages are resistant to the CS toxic activity. Moreover, CS impairs TLR3-mediated M2-M1 phenotype shift thus contributing to the M2 enrichment in lung smokers.</p> Conclusions <p>These findings indicate that, in lung cancer microenvironment of smokers, CS can contribute to the M2-phenotype macrophages prevalence by different mechanisms, ultimately, driving an anti-inflammatory, likely immunosuppressive, microenvironment in lung cancer smokers.</p>","author":"Francesca Bianchi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1807dfe5df4353cbe3a0ab17f361797aa91b8b3fe814b0b3125b49e8dff7d19c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
