This study aimed to describe the demographic and pathogen characteristics of incident meningitis in children aged &lt;1 year in South Africa from 2014 through 2018, during a period when <i>Haemophilus influenzae type b</i> vaccine and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) were both included in the expanded program on immunization (EPI).</p> Methods <p>We conducted a cohort study of routine laboratory data in the National Health Laboratory Service Corporate Data Warehouse, which covers approximately 80% of the South African population. We defined a case of laboratory-confirmed bacterial meningitis as any person aged &lt;1 year with meningitis diagnosed by culture and identification of a pathogen documented as being a common cause of meningitis in CSF. The cause-specific incidence risks were calculated by dividing the number of positive specimens in each age group and year by the corresponding mid-year population for children under 1 year old and those in the post-neonatal period (≥ 28 days to 365 days old). For children under 28 days old, the annual numbers of registered livebirths were used. We used Poisson regression to compare the incidence of meningitis by year.</p> Results <p>We identified 3575 (1.5%) cases of culture-confirmed bacterial meningitis from the 232,016 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens tested from 2014–2018. The highest number of cases were recorded in children aged &lt;28 days (1873, 52.4%), male children (1800, 50.4%) as well as in the Gauteng Province (2014, 56.3%). <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (14.9%), <i>followed</i> by <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (13.5%), <i>and</i> group B streptococcus (GBS) (10.7%), were the most common pathogens detected. Overall, <i>A</i>. <i>baumannii</i> had the highest incidence risk, occurring at 9.8 per 100,000 persons in children aged &lt;1 year in 2018. Among neonates, <i>A</i>. <i>baumannii</i> peaked at 14.9 per 100,000 livebirths in 2018, while <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> was most common in the post-neonatal period (≥ 28 days to 365 days old), peaking at 9.8 per 100,000 persons in 2014. There was an increase in the annual incidence of most pathogens over the study period.</p> Conclusion <p>There was an increasing trend in the annual incidence of bacterial meningitis in infants caused by most pathogens, particularly <i>A</i>. <i>baumannii</i>, <i>K</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i> and GBS. In addition to increased uptake of vaccination, prevention measures to reduce nosocomial and mother-to-child transmission of bacteria could include antenatal screening for GBS in pregnant women, rigorous hygiene in the hospital environment as well as rational antibiotic use.</p>","author":"Yannick Nkiambi Kiakuvue","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"51b2bba1877b21a3a7b38de8123bcbf7251556c8baa2485e0fa4b1bb0e28ff46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
