{"title":"Electrochemical applications in RAS: A review","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/raq.12822?af=R","date":1702540257000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Electrochemical water treatment for recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) is a promising approach for replacing the biological water treatment methods and establishing a new RAS generation with improved cost-effectiveness, lower environmental footprint, and no start-up periods. On top of ammonia oxidation directly into N<sub>2(g)</sub>, electrochemical oxidation results in effective disinfection, and in the removal of organic matter, including specific organic constituents such as off-flavour agents. The paper provides an overview of incentives for the implementation of electrochemical methods in RAS. It covers the electrochemical principles relevant to aquaculture applications, the effects of physical and chemical parameters, as well as design considerations. In addition, the research performed to date for integrating electrochemical methods in RAS operation is reviewed and the variety of designs and operational configurations described. The electrochemical water treatment is perceived beneficial over biological water treatment especially in cold saline-seawater aquaculture (e.g., Atlantic salmon), where large nitrification reactors are required and the large water consumption for purging processes can be curtailed. It is also beneficial for the culturing of nitrate-sensitive species (e.g., <i>L. vannamei</i>). The paper points out the gaps to be overcome for allowing commercial breakthroughs based on electrochemical water treatment, including the need for expanding the practice and improving engineering practices by operating pilot systems for growing fish at both small and large scales; adjusting of electrochemical cell designs for reducing both capital and operational costs; developing full-proof malfunction-free dechlorination strategies, and evaluating and optimizing the disinfection abilities for inactivating typical pathogens in aquaculture.</p>","author":"Raz Ben‚ÄêAsher, \nYouri Gendel, \nOri Lahav","siteTitle":"Wiley: Reviews in Aquaculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e603512385355dc11b8c11c7000aba80fad3ae9faea7a2537d8e3609c19b97a1","entryHash":"d42f33fcec6321d738909c3e4e25e8d4cccbd1a86d9dc892be01fdac759c3811","category":"Environment"}
