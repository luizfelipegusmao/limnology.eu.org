{"title":"Innovative Matrix-Based Assessment of Non-Conventional Water Processes: A Strategic Approach for SustainableWater Management in Arid Environments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0060/v1","date":1727848276000,"content":"Water scarcity presents one of the greatest challenges of our time. Especially in naturally water scarce regions, the need of additional water resources is rising, requiring innovative and site-adapted technologies. In this review, selected non-conventional water technologies for sustainable water management are strategically evaluated. Focused on a matrix-based assessment incorporating key indicators, the study discusses the availability, applicability, environmental impact, scalability, and economic viability of the selected technologies. Based on a comprehensive literature review, the methodology involves a systematic comparison of technologies for desalination, water reuse, groundwater utilization, agricultural reuse, and unconventional approaches like cloud seeding, dew water, and fog water harvesting. The indicators covering the respective categories are presented in the results. On this basis, the different technologies are analyzed by matrix-based evaluation, highlighting various strengths and weaknesses and providing insights into technology selection based on regional needs. The discussion interprets the findings, deriving implications for dry environments, acknowledging limitations and suggesting pathways for future research. Through a rigorous analytical framework, this study contributes to the discourse on sustainable water solutions, offering valuable insights for policymakers, researchers and industries during a decision-making progress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"894352168282bb8f11c3a8408dbf07a1a7b73a849b2f72e8deb0ffb6bc382b1d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
