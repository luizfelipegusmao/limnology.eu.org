Such prototypes have high potential to lead to commercial solutions if it is possible to upscale their manufacturing. Here, I review our recent approaches to fabricating multi-functional surfaces with high potential for upscaling.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fdd7e4223b27273bf5435c1ce690aa611cde7a8a4acd1846a7e3228cc277d23c","category":"Environment"}
