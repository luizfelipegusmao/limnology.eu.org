{"title":"Small GTPase PvARFR2 interacts with cytosolic ABA receptor kinase 3 to enhance alkali tolerance in switchgrass","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1627/7727699?rss=1","date":1722816000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Soil alkalization has become a serious problem that limits plant growth through osmotic stress, ionic imbalance, and oxidative stress. Understanding how plants resist alkali stress has practical implications for alkaline-land utilization. In this study, we identified a small GTPase, PvARFR2 (ADP ribosylation factors related 2), that positively regulates alkali tolerance in switchgrass (<span>Panicum virgatum</span>) and uncovered its potential mode of action. Overexpressing <span>PvARFR2</span> in switchgrass and Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) conferred transformant tolerance to alkali stress, demonstrated by alleviated leaf wilting, less oxidative injury, and a lower Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio under alkali conditions. Conversely, switchgrass <span>PvARFR2-RNAi</span> and its homolog mutant <span>atgb1</span> in Arabidopsis displayed alkali sensitives. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that cytosolic abscisic acid (ABA) receptor kinase <span>PvCARK3</span> transcript levels were higher in <span>PvARFR2</span> overexpression lines compared to the controls and were strongly induced by alkali treatment in shoots and roots. Phenotyping analysis revealed that <span>PvCARK3-OE Ã— atgb1</span> lines were sensitive to alkali similar to the Arabidopsis <span>atgb1</span> mutant, indicating that <span>PvARFR2/AtGB1</span> functions in the same pathway as <span>PvCARK3</span> under alkaline stress conditions. Application of ABA on <span>PvARFR2-OE</span> and <span>PvCARK3-OE</span> switchgrass transformants resulted in ABA sensitivity. Moreover, we determined that PvARFR2 physically interacts with PvCARK3 in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that a small GTPase, PvARFR2, positively responds to alkali stress by interacting with the cytosolic ABA receptor kinase PvCARK3, connecting the alkaline stress response to ABA signaling.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"c4fd1470c3b0a1e937e36b4e29f7ab7bc402442beca7b6afabc9e387fbbabec5","category":"Environment"}
