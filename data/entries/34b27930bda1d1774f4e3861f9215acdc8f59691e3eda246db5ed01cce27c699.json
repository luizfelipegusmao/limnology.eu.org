Four ARGs conferring resistance to different classes of antibiotics (<i>ermB, sul</i>1, <i>tet</i>[W], and <i>bla</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>CTXM</i>\n</sub>) and a gene used as a proxy for ARG pollution (<i>intl1</i>) were quantified in two separate sampling campaigns covering two and half years of operation of the WWTP. First, a systematic monthly monitoring of multiple points in the inlet and the outlet revealed an absolute decrease in the concentration of all analyzed ARGs. However, the relative abundance of <i>sul</i>1 and <i>intl</i>1 genes relative to the total bacterial load (estimated using the universal marker 16S rDNA) increased in the outlet samples as compared to the inlet. To pinpoint the exact stage of removal and/or enrichment within the WWTP, a second sampling including the stages of the biological treatment was performed bimonthly. This revealed a distinct enrichment of <i>sul</i>1 and <i>intl</i>1 genes during the biological treatment phase. Moreover, the temporal and spatial variations in ARG abundance patterns within the WWTP underscored the complexity of the dynamics associated with the removal of ARGs during wastewater treatment. Understanding these dynamics is pivotal for developing efficient strategies to mitigate the dissemination of ARGs in aquatic environments.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner points</h2>\n<p>\nRegular monitoring of ARG markers in WWTPs is essential to assess temporal and spatial changes, aiding in the development of effective mitigation strategies.\nUnderstanding the dynamics of ARG abundance during biological treatment is crucial for optimizing processes and minimizing dissemination in aquatic environments.\nIncreased relative abundance of certain ARGs highlights potential enrichment during wastewater treatment, necessitating targeted interventions.\nSystematic monitoring of multiple points within WWTPs can provide valuable insights into the efficacy of treatment processes in reducing ARG levels over time.\nThe complexity of ARG abundance patterns underscores the need to develop holistic approaches to tackle antibiotic resistance in wastewater systems.\n</p>","author":"Guillaume Cailleau, \nThomas Junier, \nChristophe Paul, \nMathilda Fatton, \nAndrea Corona‐Ramirez, \nOphelie Gning, \nKarin Beck, \nJacques Vidal, \nHelmut Bürgmann, \nPilar Junier","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"34b27930bda1d1774f4e3861f9215acdc8f59691e3eda246db5ed01cce27c699","category":"Environment"}
