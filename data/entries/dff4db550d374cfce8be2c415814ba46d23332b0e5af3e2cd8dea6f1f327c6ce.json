{"title":"Growth and longevity of two imperilled mussel species from the Edwards Plateau of Central Texas and its implications for freshwater mussel conservation and management","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4224?af=R","date":1723096167000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nLife history information such as growth and longevity have been useful for understanding evolutionary relationships and predicting species responses to management and habitat alteration for aquatic species. For unionid mussels, which are globally imperilled, life history information remains unknown for a majority of unionid mussels and because of this has not been broadly used to guide mussel conservation efforts.\nTo address this knowledge gap, growth and longevity were estimated for <i>Cyclonaias petrina</i>, Texas pimpleback, and <i>Lampsilis bracteata</i>, Texas fatmucket, using thin-sectioning and validated using cross-dating. Both species are proposed for listing under the US Endangered Species Act.\nGrowth and longevity estimates differed between <i>C. petrina</i> (<i>K</i> = 0.065, 0.086, 0.101; <i>L∞</i> = 55.03, 76.44, 94.43) and <i>L. bracteata</i> (<i>K</i> = 0.187, 0.208; <i>L∞</i> = 61.40, 61.52), and growth for <i>L. bracteata</i> correlated to annual flow indices. Cross-dating revealed high interseries correlations (<i>R</i> = 0.400–0.573), indicating estimates can be viewed with some certainty.\nGrowth and longevity estimates indicate <i>C. petrina</i> is positioned near the <i>K</i> endpoint and <i>L. bracteata</i> near the <i>r</i> endpoint along the <i>r</i>/<i>K</i> life history continuum. This suggests <i>C. petrina</i> should be favoured in stable habitats where disturbance is minimal, whereas <i>L. bracteata</i> is expected to tolerate habitats with frequent and likely stochastic patterns of disturbance.\nKnowledge of growth and longevity along with life history position provides a qualitative basis to help scientists and practitioners better anticipate how species will respond to environmental change and management actions. Given the conservation status of <i>C. petrina</i> and <i>L. bracteata</i> the life history findings from this study are timely and should be useful in their conservation.\n</p>","author":"Michael de Moulpied, \nClinton R.
