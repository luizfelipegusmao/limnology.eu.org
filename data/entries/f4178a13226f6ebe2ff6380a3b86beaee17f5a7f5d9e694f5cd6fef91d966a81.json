{"title":"Comparing Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Sensibility and Specificity: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0839/v1","date":1710740480000,"content":"Introduction: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is a novel technique employed in breast cancer screening and detection. In this systematic review, we aim to compare the diagnostic performance of CESM with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the context of breast cancer diagnosis.\nMaterial and Method: We have searched for paper in Pubmed and Scopus from July 2023 to February 2024, finding 256 suitable papers according to our selection criteria (perspective or retrospective studies, women diagnosed with breast cancer, comparison of Contrast-enhanced Spectral Mammography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging, sensitivity and specificity metrics provided). Every paper was then checked for quality using the QUADAS 2 assesement score. Sensibility, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV) and accuracy were recorded.\nResults: 15 studies were selected for analysis. CESM demonstrated comparable sensitivity to MRI, with values ranging from 36.4% to 100% for CESM and 0% to 100% for MRI. Specificity varied between the modalities, with CESM showing specificity ranges of 17% to 100% compared to 23% to 92.31% for MRI. \nDiscussion and Conclusion: CESM has comparable diagnostic validity to MRI,  and is a valuable tool in detecting breast cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f4178a13226f6ebe2ff6380a3b86beaee17f5a7f5d9e694f5cd6fef91d966a81","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
