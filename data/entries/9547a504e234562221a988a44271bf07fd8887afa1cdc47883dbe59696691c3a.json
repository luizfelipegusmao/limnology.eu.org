{"title":"Development of a Multi-Motor Asynchronous Electric Drive with Changes in the Coordinated Rotation of the Supply Voltages of the Motors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1292/v1","date":1721112881000,"content":"In the proposed article, the issues of increasing the synchronizing ability of the system of coordinated rotation of asynchronous motors are considered. Based on the T-shaped equivalent circuit, electromechanical relationships were obtained with changes in the value of the total rotor resistance and the supply voltage of individual motors. An algorithm for calculating the torques, stator and rotor currents of the motors of the system has been compiled. Based on the calculations obtained, the mechanical characteristics of the system asynchronous motors are constructed for various values of total resistance, supply voltages and rotor positions. The obtained data and graphs confirm the adequacy of the theory obtained in an analytical way. Functional and structural diagrams in small scales have been compiled, which allow simulating transient operation modes of multi-motor asynchronous electric drives in the Matlab application package. Multi-motor asynchronous electric drives with adjustable supply voltages, as well as with preliminary synchronization and synchronous braking, have been developed. Compilation of a program for the stability of a nonlinear system of a multi-motor asynchronous electric drive (MAEDs) with a thyristor voltage converter (TVC) in Matlab. Also, the modes of soft start, load shedding and surge on the motor shaft are simulated, confirming the stability of the system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9547a504e234562221a988a44271bf07fd8887afa1cdc47883dbe59696691c3a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
