This imbibition behavior plays a crucial role in the development of this type of reservoir. The experimental devices for studying static imbibition behavior are generally susceptible to air pollution on the surface of the test core and a long testing period; the experimental devices for studying dynamic imbibition behavior are generally unable to eliminate the driving action. A dual-purpose experimental setup and an experimental method for dynamic or static imbibition that can avoid the above defects were designed. A method of fracture fluid flow rate calculation and motor speed conversion is proposed, and the method is used to assist in setting the parameters of dynamic imbibition experiments. The device was applied to compare the experimental effects with the static imbibition bottle and the dynamic replacement imbibition, respectively, and the effect of fracture width on the dynamic imbibition of repellent oil was investigated. The results show that: the static imbibition recovery rate of the dynamic/static imbibition experimental device is 1.55 percentage points higher than that of the imbibition bottle; the dynamic imbibition recovery rate is 3–6 percentage points lower than that of the driving dynamic imbibition method, and it can reflect the influence of a single flow rate condition on the imbibition; imbibition in low-permeability fractured reservoirs is more likely to take place in the fracture in the interval of 50–100 μm in the width.","author":"Leilei Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5f4032ada44d62eff7abb87c9025c401aecc347dc85e7ad36d7a675fc8e1ea3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
