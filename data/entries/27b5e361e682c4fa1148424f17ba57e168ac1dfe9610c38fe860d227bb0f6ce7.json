{"title":"Bacillus coagulans LMG S-24828 Impairs Candida Virulence and Protects Vaginal Epithelial Cells against Candida Infection In Vitro","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0161/v1","date":1722588422000,"content":"Probiotics are living microbes that provide benefits to the host. The increasing data on health promotion following probiotics administration triggered growing interest among researchers and pharmaceutical companies looking for novel therapeutic or preventive tools. Infections of the lower genital tract in females are caused by a wide range of pathogens, they are widespread, and represent one of the main areas for the use of probiotics and postbiotics. Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) affects 75% of women in their reproductive age at least once during their lifetime. Of these women 5-8% develop the recurrent form (RVVC). The disease onset is triggered by the overgrowth of Candida species on the vaginal mucosa. Here, we evaluated the beneficial properties of the Bacillus coagulans spore-producing LMG S-24828 against C. albicans and C. parapsilosis. Our results show that both alive B. coagulans and its Cell-Free-Supernatant (CFS) exerted antifungal activity against both fungi. Moreover, alive B. coagulans reduced hyphal formation, inhibited C. albicans adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells and showed co-aggregation capacity. Overall, B. coagulans LMG S-24828 exerted a protective effect on vaginal epithelial cells infected with C. albicans. These data suggest that B. coagulans LMG S-24828 may provide benefits in the context of Candida vaginal infections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"27b5e361e682c4fa1148424f17ba57e168ac1dfe9610c38fe860d227bb0f6ce7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
