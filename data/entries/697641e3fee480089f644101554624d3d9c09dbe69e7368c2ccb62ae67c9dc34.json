The study focuses on employing sophisticated techniques such as data augmentation, model optimization, and rigorous performance evaluation metrics to achieve high accuracy in multi-class classification tasks. Additionally, we integrate the concept of Self-Expanding Convolutional Neural Networks (SECNNs), which dynamically adjust model complexity during training. This approach ensures optimal performance while maintaining computational efficiency. The dataset used in this research comprises MRI images categorized into four distinct classes: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary tumor. Our method demonstrates a notable test accuracy of 93.98%","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"697641e3fee480089f644101554624d3d9c09dbe69e7368c2ccb62ae67c9dc34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
