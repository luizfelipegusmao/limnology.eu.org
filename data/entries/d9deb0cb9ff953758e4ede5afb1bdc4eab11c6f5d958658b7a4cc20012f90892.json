{"title":"Medioresinol from Eucommiae cortex improves myocardial infarction-induced heart failure through activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway: A network analysis and experimental study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311143","date":1727445600000,"content":"<p>by Xueting Qin, Xuan Liu, Can Guo, Li Huang, Qiyao Xu</p>\r\nObjective <p>This study aims to systematically analyze the potential active components of Eucommiae cortex in the treatment of post- myocardial infarction heart failure through network analysis and molecular docking methods. In vitro experiments were conducted to verify that medioresinol, a component of Eucommiae cortex, improves oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced cell failure through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacities.</p> Methods <p>Potential active components of Eucommiae cortex were screened using specific data. The targets of these components were predicted using Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics database and TargetNet, and key targets were identified by intersecting with the disease targets of myocardial infarction and heart failure. Protein-Protein Interaction analysis was performed on the key targets to screen for core targets. Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation and Human Protein Atlas were used to identify myocardial highly expressed targets. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses were conducted using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. Molecular docking was performed for the final components and target proteins. In vitro experiments were carried out using H9c2 cells subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation conditions to validate the effects of the screened potential active components.</p> Results <p>Network analysis revealed that Eucommiae cortex might exert its effects through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR), hypoxia-inducible factor 1, and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathways, which are crucial for myocardial contraction, vascular tone regulation, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress. Molecular docking indicated stable binding of the selected compounds to PI3K, AKT, and mTOR. Medioresinol was selected for further study and shown to significantly improve oxidative stress and inflammatory response in myocardial ischemia-hypoxia model cells by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.</p> Conclusion <p>This study confirms the role of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in the cardiovascular protective effects of Eucommiae cortex and provides evidence at the cellular level. Medioresinol demonstrated potential therapeutic effects on myocardial infarction induced heart failure by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. These findings offer a theoretical basis for the application of Eucommiae cortex in the treatment of heart failure and support the development of new therapeutic drugs for cardiovascular diseases. Future research should further validate these effects in animal models and explore the overall efficacy of Eucommiae cortex.</p>","author":"Xueting Qin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d9deb0cb9ff953758e4ede5afb1bdc4eab11c6f5d958658b7a4cc20012f90892","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
