{"title":"Research on Finance Risk Management based on Combination Optimization and Reinforcement Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0983/v1","date":1723619628000,"content":"The impact of financial risks extends beyond the normal operation and survival of industrial and commercial enterprises and financial institutions. They also have the potential to impede the stable development of a country's and even the world's financial economy. This is clearly demonstrated by the severe consequences of the frequent financial crises that have occurred in recent years. It thus follows that the prevention of financial risks has become one of the core tasks of the operation and management of industrial and commercial enterprises and financial institutions. Portfolio optimization techniques are employed in the construction of a variety of asset allocation models, with reinforcement learning algorithms used to dynamically adjust investment strategies with the objective of maximizing returns and minimizing risks. The preliminary construction of an asset allocation model is achieved through the utilization of a genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithms emulate the processes of natural selection and genetic variation to identify the optimal portfolio of assets that will yield the greatest returns at a pre-established level of risk. Subsequently, the Deep Q-Learning algorithm is introduced to facilitate dynamic adjustments and optimization of the asset allocation, based on the initial construction. Deep Q-learning employs deep neural networks to forecast the prospective returns of disparate investment strategies, thereby optimizing the decision-making process through continuous learning and updating. The combination of genetic algorithms and deep Q-learning enables the system to identify the optimal investment strategy under a diverse range of initial conditions and to adapt it in real-time to respond to market fluctuations and uncertainties. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed method exhibits an exemplary capacity for risk control and a robust ability to generate stable income growth across diverse market environments. In simulation experiments, portfolios constructed using this method demonstrate lower volatility and higher average returns than those generated through traditional methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aeff20380f79ace311c28d198e5daf7ddd4bd3e6b6eef8f150ab9d385d070181","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
