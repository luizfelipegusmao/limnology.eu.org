{"title":"Rosmarinic Acid: A Potential Therapeutic Agent in Gastrointestinal Cancers Management&mdash;A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2302/v1","date":1727597913000,"content":"Gastrointestinal cancers are still the leading cause of death worldwide. This is related, among other things, to non-specific symptoms, especially in the initial stages, and also to limited possibilities of treatment. Therefore, research is still being conducted to improve the detection of this type of cancer and increase the effectiveness of therapy. The potential application of natural compounds in cancer management deserves special attention. In the group of such products there are polyphenolic compounds which reveal e.g. anti-oxidative, anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and neuroprotective properties. One of such polyphenols is rosmarinic acid, commonly found in plants such as Boraginaceae and Nepetoideae subfamilies of the Lamiaceae (mint) family, including Origanum vulgare, Rosmarinus officinalis Thymus masticmasti chinaythia koreana, Ocimum sanctum, and Hyptis pectinate. A number of studies considers the positive effects of rosmarinic acid in the treatment of many cancers, including gastrointestinal ones such as oral, stomach, pancreas, colon, and liver. The main aim of this paper was to focus on the summarized mechanisms of the action of rosmarinic acid in gastrointestinal cancers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"edb7edf5afc7bcd59c14e1584ff4607db2e9ab9e1aeea4c6d54bcb516720eb93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
