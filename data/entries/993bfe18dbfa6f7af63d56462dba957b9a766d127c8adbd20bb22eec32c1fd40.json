{"title":"Effects of Melatonin on Human, Animal and Plant Metabolisms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1408/v1","date":1713833790000,"content":"Melatonin is an important hormone with a methoxy-indole structure. It is secreted regularly by the pineal gland of mammals. It takes part in many chemical, biological, and physiological activities of the body. Melatonin, acts as a basic hormone, and is responsible for circadian rhythm regulation and sleep control. It has been shown to occur in the highest concentration in organisms during the night times. In living organisms, many activities that have physiological, biological, hormonal, and psychological characteristics follows a certain rhythm. Body temperature, hormone levels, sleep-wakefulness, and some other cognitive functions in humans also change with the circadian rhythm. Its synthesis and release begin with darkness and end with light. This review aims to explore the functions of melatonin such as its stimulating effects on antioxidant enzymes, reducing lipid peroxidation, and protecting brain tissue from oxidative damage. It also has properties that stop the proliferation of cancer cells and prevent tumor growth. Melatonin, which was previously known only as an animal hormone, has been found to also exist in plants. Research has shown that melatonin is present in almost all plant species analyzed to date and that it performs functions similar to those in animals. In plants, it plays a vital role in dealing with various abiotic and biotic stresses. Melatonin acts as an important antioxidant in post-harvest technology and extends the post-harvest life of fruits and vegetables. It also takes part in the regulation of stress-specific genes and the activation of pathogenesis-related proteins and antioxidant enzymes. The most prominent roles of melatonin in plants include regulating circadian rhythm, growth, and development, and increasing tolerance to a wide range of environmental stress factors. The review reveals the effects of melatonin as an extremely important secondary metabolite, on human, animal, and plant metabolism. The use of PRISMA guidelines was used for reporting, search, selection, and synthesis. Information up to 2024 was searched from search engines for the occurrence, nature and function of melatonin. Key words such as structural function, hormonal function, secretion and metabolism were used in the search of publications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"993bfe18dbfa6f7af63d56462dba957b9a766d127c8adbd20bb22eec32c1fd40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
