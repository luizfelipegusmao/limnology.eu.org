{"title":"Embracing the Twists: Eco-Innovation Strategies in Greening Nigeria's Urban Soils to Combat Heavy Metal Contamination Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0765/v1","date":1720523220000,"content":"This study investigates the utilization of Eco-Innovation practices within Nigerian industries to mitigate urban soil contamination. Soil samples were collected from various urban land uses in Ijebu Ode town, specifically mechanic workshops (MW), roadsides (RD), industrial areas (IL), and market zones (MT). Ten composite soil samples were randomly gathered from each land use at a depth of 0-30cm and subjected to analysis for heavy metal concentrations (copper Cu, iron Fe, lead Pb, zinc Zn, cadmium Cd, manganese Mn) using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. This facilitated the calculation of contamination levels and pollution load index. The findings indicate that the concentration of Cu, Zn, Fe, and Mn is highest in soils from mechanic workshops, with the degree of soil contamination ranking as follows: Mechanic Workshop &gt; Industrial land use &gt; Roadside &gt; Market land use. The study concludes that elevated levels of heavy metals in the sampled urban soil are closely linked to improper land use practices and other human activities. It advocates for the promotion of sustainable environmental practices through comprehensive stakeholder engagement aimed at educating the populace on the management and preservation of urban soils against harmful practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8fe27dd34c5447c63ef94ccdd6d39f782738c05d83ff3a3c2228d4da12581d23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
