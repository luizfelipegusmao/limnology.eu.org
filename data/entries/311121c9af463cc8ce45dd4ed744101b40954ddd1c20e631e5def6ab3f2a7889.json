{"title":"Declining Tradeoff Between Resistance and Resilience of Ecosystems to Drought","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024EF004665?af=R","date":1715231691000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Resistance and resilience are widely used to characterize ecosystem drought stability. Tradeoff between resistance and resilience have been reported, but its long-term trends remain uncertain at global scale. Based on remotely sensed vegetation indices, we assessed the spatiotemporal dynamics of drought resistance and resilience. Result revealed that there was a significant decline in the tradeoff between resistance and resilience, corresponding to a substantial increase in the proportion of areas with high resistance-high resilience or low resistance-low resilience. In the South Sahel, South Africa and Central China, the increased precipitation and vegetation coverage contribute to enhanced drought stability constructed by resistance and resilience; while rising temperature, decreased water availability and deforestation lead to declined stability in northeastern North America, South America and the Congo region. Increases in the areas with low resistance-low resilience resulting from declining tradeoffs warn of increased regional ecosystem vulnerability.</p>","author":"Ying Yao, \nYanxu Liu, \nJiaxi Song, \nShengli Tao, \nYan Li, \nTianjing Wu, \nYijia Wang, \nShuai Wang, \nBojie Fu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Earth's Future: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2958dd76fb7907b9b5d9ef7cbca00ecda25efa9c5b75e193900a164a1ec3c84c","entryHash":"311121c9af463cc8ce45dd4ed744101b40954ddd1c20e631e5def6ab3f2a7889","category":"Environment"}
