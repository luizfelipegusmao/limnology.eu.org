This study aimed to evaluate whether waist circumference was connected with sleep disorder in the elderly. This cross-sectional study utilized data from the 2005–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) regarding waist circumference, sleep disorders, and confounding factors. Included in the study were participants older than 60 who completed sleep questionnaires and waist circumference measurements. Using a multivariate logistic regression model and subgroup analyses, the relationship between waist circumference and sleep disorder was evaluated. To explore the non-linear relationship, restricted cubic spline (RCS) with three knots coupled with a logistic regression model to assess the dose-response relationship between waist circumference (continuous variables) and sleep disorder. A total of 2,545 (Weighted 14,682,916.3) elderly participants with complete information were included in the analysis and 312 (Weighted 1,777,137.8) subjects met the definition of sleep disorder. Compared with participants without sleep disorder, those with sleep disorder had a higher waist circumference (100.80 cm <i>vs</i>. 108.96 cm, <i>P</i>&lt; 0.001). The results of the multivariable adjusted logistic regression model suggested that those in quartiles 4 (≥ 75th percentile) for their waist circumference had higher odds of sleep disorder [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.66–4.54, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001] compared with those in quartile 1. The RCS result showed that the OR of sleep disorder and waist circumference displayed a linear relationship (<i>P</i> &lt;0.001, Non-linear <i>P</i> = 0.642). Age and gender subgroup analysis revealed comparable relationships between waist circumference and sleep disorder among elderly individuals. Waist circumference was associated with sleep disorders in the elderly. There was a dose-response relationship between waist circumference and the likelihood of sleep disorder. Those with a larger waist circumference were more likely to have a sleep disorder than those with a smaller waist circumference.","author":"Yuting Zhong","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2467b2926b100f2ffe7d3a1585204e3b2b7dfa5152d6f346941245713cef303a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
