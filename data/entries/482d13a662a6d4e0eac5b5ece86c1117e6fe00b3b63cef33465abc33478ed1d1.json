{"title":"Platelet and epithelial cell interations can be modeled in cell culture, and are not affected by dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309125","date":1724767200000,"content":"<p>by Zitha Redempta Isingizwe, Laura F. Mortan, Doris Mangiaracina Benbrook</p>\r\n\r\nIncreasing evidence is implicating roles for platelets in the development and progression of ovarian cancer, a highly lethal disease that can arise from the fallopian tubes, and has no current method of early detection or prevention. Thrombosis is a major cause of mortality of ovarian cancer patients suggesting that the cancer alters platelet behavior. The objective of this study was to develop a cell culture model of the pathological interactions of human platelets and ovarian cancer cells, using normal FT epithelial cells as a healthy control, and to test effects of the anti-platelet dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) in the model. Both healthy and cancer cells caused platelet aggregation, however platelets only affected spheroid formation by cancer cells and had no effect on healthy cell spheroid formation. When naturally-formed spheroids of epithelial cells were exposed to platelets in transwell inserts that did not allow direct interactions of the two cell types, platelets caused increased size of the spheroids formed by cancer cells, but not healthy cells. When cancer cell spheroids formed using magnetic nanoshuttle technology were put in direct physical contact with platelets, the platelets caused spheroid condensation. In ovarian cancer cells, DGLA promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition at doses as low as 100 μM, and inhibited metabolic viability and induced apoptosis at doses ≥150 μM. DGLA doses ≤150 μM used to avoid direct DGLA effects on cancer cells, had no effect on the pathological interactions of platelets and ovarian cancer cells in our models. These results demonstrate that the pathological interactions of platelets with ovarian cancer cells can be modeled in cell culture, and that DGLA has no effect on these interactions, suggesting that targeting platelets is a rational approach for reducing cancer aggressiveness and thrombosis risk in ovarian cancer patients, however DGLA is not an appropriate candidate for this strategy.","author":"Zitha Redempta Isingizwe","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"482d13a662a6d4e0eac5b5ece86c1117e6fe00b3b63cef33465abc33478ed1d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
