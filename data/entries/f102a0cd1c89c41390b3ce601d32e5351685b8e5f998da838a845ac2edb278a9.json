{"title":"A Novel Noninvasive Murine Model of Neonatal Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy Demonstrates Developmental Delay and Motor Deficits with Activation of Inflammatory Pathways in Monocytes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2364/v1","date":1722307108000,"content":"Neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs in 1.5 per 1000 live births, leaving affected children with long-term motor and cognitive deficits. Few animal models of HIE incorporate maternal immune activation (MIA) despite the significant risk MIA poses to HIE incidence and diagnosis. Our non-invasive model of HIE pairs late gestation MIA with postnatal hypoxia. HIE pups exhibited a trend toward smaller overall brain size and delays in the ontogeny of several developmental milestones. In adulthood, HIE animals had reduced strength and gait deficits, but no difference in speed. Surprisingly, HIE animals performed better on the rotarod, an assessment of motor coordination. There was significant upregulation of inflammatory genes in microglia 24 hours after hypoxia. Single cell RNAseq revealed two microglia subclusters of interest following HIE. Pseudobulk analysis revealed increased microglia motility gene expression and upregulation of epigenetic machinery and neurodevelopmental genes in macrophages following HIE. No sex differences were found in any measures. These results support a two-hit noninvasive model pairing MIA and hypoxia as a model for HIE in humans. This model results in a milder phenotype compared to established HIE models; however, HIE is a clinically heterogeneous injury resulting in a variety of outcomes in humans. The pathways identified in our model of HIE may reveal novel targets for therapy for neonates with HIE.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f102a0cd1c89c41390b3ce601d32e5351685b8e5f998da838a845ac2edb278a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
