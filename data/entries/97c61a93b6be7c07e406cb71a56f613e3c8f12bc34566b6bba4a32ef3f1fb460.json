Upper thermal limits generally depend on an individual's thermal history, which molds plasticity. We examined how thermal acclimation affects thermal tolerance of brook trout (<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>) embryos using a novel method to assess CT<sub>max</sub> in embryos incubated under three thermal regimes. Warm acclimation was associated with an increase in embryonic upper thermal tolerance. However, CT<sub>max</sub> variability was markedly higher than is typical for juvenile or adult salmonids.</p>","author":"Emily R. Lechner, \nErin M. C. Stewart, \nChris C. Wilson, \nGraham D.
