This process is so standard that it is sometimes even automated. However, FIB preparation of samples with electrical connections has proven to be much more difficult, as beam-assisted milling and metal deposition can damage and contaminate the device. Here we discuss a method for preparing contacted cross-section samples which are electronically “alive”, in that their electronic properties after extraction are similar to the properties they had before. These devices can be operated in the TEM, and their <span>operando</span> electronic performance can be monitored <span>in situ</span> with scanning TEM electron beam-induced current (STEM EBIC) imaging.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c739a2422876863bee1f2fbba0748a07b67b7a70122e550e30c4c775d3b87cc6","category":"Environment"}
