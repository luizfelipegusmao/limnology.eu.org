However, catches of shrimps have been declining over the last decades, presumably due to poor recruitment. Climate change has been proposed as a potential cause of increased mesoscale eddy activity over the Mozambique Channel, which may have played a role in poor shrimp recruitment. Indeed, stronger eddies could transport matter, including increased numbers of shrimp larvae, from the coast to unfavourable offshore areas. In this study we used a biophysical model to investigate the influence of eddies on the dispersal of larvae of two commercial shrimp species (<i>Penaeus indicus</i> and <i>Metapenaeus monoceros</i>) from their spawning areas on the Sofala Bank. We found some 5 large events of offshore or southward transport loss (&gt;10% loss) from the Sofala Bank caused by eddies, occurring sporadically. The northern and central Sofala Bank areas were the most affected by larvae lost offshore. Simulations revealed that temperature-induced larval mortality, associated with cold-core cyclonic eddies, could also play a role in larval loss of up to 40%, which is greater than the larval transport loss associated with the eddy circulation. However, when they survived, larvae transported offshore could travel long distances (600â€“1600 km in 15 days), potentially promoting connectivity with other stocks in the region.","author":"Bernardino S.
