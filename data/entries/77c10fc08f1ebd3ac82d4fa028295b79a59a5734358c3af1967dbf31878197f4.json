{"title":"Use of fluoroquinolones and the risk of aortic and mitral regurgitation: A nationwide case-crossover study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307480","date":1721829600000,"content":"<p>by An-Hsun Chou, Chia-Pin Lin, Chun-Yu Chen, Victor Chien-Chia Wu, Yu-Ting Cheng, Yi‐Hsin Chan, Fu-Chih Hsiao, Dong-Yi Chen, Kuo-Chun Hung, Pao-Hsien Chu, Shao-Wei Chen</p>\r\nBackground <p>Recently, there have been conflicting results reporting an increased risk of AR or MR associated with oral fluoroquinolones (FQs).This study investigated whether the use of FQs increases the risk of mitral regurgitation (MR) or aortic regurgitation (AR).</p> Methods <p>A retrospective cohort study was conducted by using the Taiwan National Health Insurance research database. A unidirectional case-crossover design without selecting controls from an external population was adopted in this study. A total of 26,650 adult patients with new onset of AR or MR between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2012, were identified. The risk of outcomes was compared between the hazard period and one of the randomly selected referent periods of the same individuals.</p> Results <p>Before exclusion of pneumonia diagnosed within 2 months before the index date, patients who took FQs had a significantly greater risk of AR or MR (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30–1.77), any AR (combined AR and MR) (aOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.10–2.04), and any MR (combined AR and MR) (aOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.16–1.62). After exclusion of pneumonia, FQs exposure remained significantly associated with a greater risk of MR (aOR 1.38, 95% CI 1.17–1.62) and any MR (aOR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05–1.48).</p> Conclusions <p>The findings suggested that patients treated with FQs could be warned about the potential risk for MR even after considering the possibility of protopathic bias. Reducing unnecessary FQs prescriptions may be considered to reduce the risk of valvular heart disease.</p>","author":"An-Hsun Chou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"77c10fc08f1ebd3ac82d4fa028295b79a59a5734358c3af1967dbf31878197f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
