{"title":"The construction of Moringa oleifera seed protein emulsion: in vitro digestibility and delivery of β‐carotene","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13626?af=R","date":1718019217000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>β-Carotene (BC) is difficult to apply effectively in the food industry due to its low solubility and bioavailability. This work aimed to fabricate <i>Moringa oleifera</i> seed protein (MOSP) stabilized emulsions as delivery vehicles for BC and investigate the effect of aqueous phase conditions including pH and ionic strength on this system.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>All MOSP samples were positively charged and the particle size of MOSP increased with the increase of pH. At pH 5.0 and 0.2 mol L<sup>−1</sup> sodium chloride (NaCl), the MOSP emulsion demonstrated the highest stability coefficient and minimal creaming index, while exhibiting a lower release rate <i>in vitro</i> digestion. The rheological behavior of all MOSP emulsions within the frequency range of 0.1–10 Hz was dominated by viscoelasticity, forming an elastic network structure through dispersed droplets. Additionally, the MOSP emulsion loaded with BC prepared at pH 5.0 and 0.2 mol L<sup>−1</sup> NaCl displayed enhanced ultraviolet light stability (52.31 ± 0.03% and 51.86 ± 0.05%) as well as thermal stability (72.39 ± 8.67% and 86.78 ± 10.69%). Furthermore, the BC in the emulsion at pH 7.0 exhibited favorable stability (65.14 ± 0.02%) and optimal bioaccessibility (40.30 ± 0.04%) in vitro digestion.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The results provided reference data for utilizing MOSP as a novel emulsifier and broadening the application of BC in the food industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Fangjie Xiao, \nLiqiong Zhang, \nHexiang Xie, \nKefan Ouyang, \nWenyi Shi, \nHua Xiong, \nQiang Zhao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"3977021ff6cf3349abfa19fab9402f6d700f448703e3228d7ea04e32e50246ed","category":"Environment"}
