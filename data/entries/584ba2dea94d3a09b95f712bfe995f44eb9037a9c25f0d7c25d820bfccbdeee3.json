Our analysis is based on the application of the sequence of even integers 2,10,16,22,26,28… which is defined as follows:\nF(0) = 2, for i &gt; 0, F(i) = F(i − 1)+ l, where l is the smallest even integer that is valid for:\t\nF(i − 1)+ 2k − 1 ∈ P, for k = 1, 2, . . . l/2-1,  \t\nF(i − 1)+ 2k − 1 ∉ P, for k = 2l\t\nand P is the set of prime numbers.\t\nThe sequence F answers the question, which are the natural numbers that cannot be expressed as a\t\nsum of two primes. We prove that numbers expressed as j = F(i)+ 1 cannot be written as the sum of\ntwo primes, for i = 1, 2, ··· .","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"584ba2dea94d3a09b95f712bfe995f44eb9037a9c25f0d7c25d820bfccbdeee3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
