{"title":"The impact of metabolic syndrome severity on racial and ethnic disparities in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299836","date":1710511200000,"content":"<p>by Mohamed I.

Paskett</p>\r\nBackground &amp; aims <p>Previous studies have examined the effects of metabolic syndrome (MetS) rather than its severity on race and ethnic disparities in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). We used the MetS severity score, a validated sex-race-ethnicity-specific severity measure, to examine the effects of race/ethnicity on the association between MetS severity and MASLD.</p> Methods <p>This study included 10,605 adult participants from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The MASLD diagnosis was based on ultrasound findings in patients without excessive alcohol intake or other liver diseases. MetS severity Z-scores were calculated and stratified into four categories low (1<sup>st</sup>-50<sup>th</sup>), moderate (&gt;50<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup>), high (&gt;75<sup>th</sup>-90<sup>th</sup>), and very high (&gt;90<sup>th</sup>+)]. Multivariable adjusted logistic regression models with complex survey methods were used to test the effect of MetS severity on MASLD.</p> Results <p>The age-adjusted MASLD prevalence was 17.4%, 25.7%, 42.5, and 54.9% in adults with mild, moderate, high, and very high MetS severities, respectively (P-trend &lt;0.001). MetS severity was significantly higher in patients with MASLD than in those without [mean percentile 60<sup>th</sup> vs. 44<sup>th</sup>, P&lt;0.001]. Among patients with MASLD, Mexican-American and Black non-Hispanic females had significantly higher age-adjusted MetS severity (68<sup>th</sup> and 61<sup>st</sup>, respectively) than White non-Hispanic females 54<sup>th</sup>, while Black non-Hispanic males had significantly lower MetS severity (56<sup>th</sup>) than White non-Hispanic males (70<sup>th</sup>) (P-Interaction = 0.02). Adults with high and very high MetS severity had 2.27 (95% CI:1.70 to 3.03) and 3.12 (95% CI:2.20 to 4.42), respectively, higher adjusted odds of MASLD than those with mild MetS severity.</p> Conclusions <p>Racial/ethnic disparities in MetS severity play a pivotal role in the risk of MASLD. Our findings highlight the potential clinical utility of the MetS severity score in identifying at-risk individuals, which will help guide targeted prevention and tailoring management strategies to mitigate the MASLD burden.</p>","author":"Mohamed I.
