{"title":"Superhydrophobicity, Photocatalytic Self-Cleaning and Biocide Activity Combined in a Siloxane-ZnO Composite for the Protection of Limestone","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1202/v1","date":1721107970000,"content":"Wear phenomena on natural stone of the cultural heritage are induced from various sources. Consequently, the development of multifunctional protective materials which combine two or more useful properties is an effective strategy to address the synergistic effects of various wear mechanisms. A multifunctional coating, consisting of a silane-based precursor and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs), is produced and tested for the protection of limestone. The hybrid coating combines the following three properties: superhydrophobicity, including water-repellency, photocatalytic self-cleaning and biocidal activity. The relative concentration of the NPs (0.8% w/w), used for the suggested composite coating, is carefully selected according to wetting studies, colourimetric measurements and durability (tape peeling) tests. The non-wetting state is evidenced on the surface of the composite coating by the large contact angle of water drops (≈153°) and the small contact angle hysteresis (≈5°) which gives rise to the physical self-cleaning scenario (lotus effect). The photocatalytic chemical self-cleaning is shown with the removal of methylene blue, induced by the UV-A radiation. Moreover, it is shown that the suggested coating hinders the incubation of E. coli and S. aureus as the inhibition were 94.8 and 99.9 %, respectively. Finally, preliminary studies revealed the chemical stability of the suggested coating.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"01c24fc80f4fee7ffc89895c6d5a72e950bf5e2dacc6b1405df54bf726e5e753","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
