{"title":"The exogenous application of naringenin and rosmarinic acid modulates functional traits in Lepidium sativum","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13160?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Phenolic modulators have attracted attention for their potential in shaping functional traits in plants. This work investigated the impact of naringenin (Nar) and rosmarinic acid (RA) on the functional properties of <i>Lepidium sativum</i> leaves and roots.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Untargeted metabolomics identified a diverse phenolic profile, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, low molecular weight phenolics, lignans, and stilbenes. Cluster, analysis of variance multiblock orthogonal partial least squares (AMOPLS), and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) multivariate analyses confirmed tissue-specific modulation of bioactive compounds. The tissue was the hierarchically most influential factor, explaining 27% of observed variability, while the treatment and their interaction were statistically insignificant. Thereafter, various <i>in vitro</i> assays were employed to assess antioxidant capacity, including 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging activity, cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), metal chelating ability, and phosphomolybdenum (PMD) assays. Extracts were also tested for inhibitory effects on cholinesterase, amylase, glucosidase, and tyrosinase enzymes. RA application positively impacted antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities, holding valuable implications in shaping the health-promoting properties of <i>L. sativum</i>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The untargeted metabolomics analysis showed a significant tissue-dependent modulation of bioactive compounds, determining no synergistic effect between applying phenolic compounds in combination. Specifically, the sole application of RA increased anthocyanins and hydroxyphenyl propanoic acid content on leaves, which was strictly related to enhancing the biological activities. © 2023 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Hajar Salehi, \nLeilei Zhang, \nFatma Nur Alp‐Turgut, \nBusra Arikan, \nFevzi Elbasan, \nCeyda Ozfidan‐Konakci, \nMelike Balcı, \nGökhan Zengin, \nEvren Yildiztugay, \nLuigi Lucini","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"10c2340ce62e6d202900342390ee389077d5587e3749619bbf473feaf5217bab","category":"Environment"}
