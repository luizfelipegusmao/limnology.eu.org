{"title":"Radar False Alarm Suppression Based on Target Spatial-Temporal Stationarity for UAV Detecting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1907/v1","date":1724752161000,"content":"Due to the convenience of implementing without additional transmitter, radar communication integrated systems using conventional communication signals have become an effective means of monitoring unmanned aerial vehicles and other aircraft. However, the non-ideal radar signal form causes the strong signal to cover the weak signal, and the clutter suppression is required to expose the target. As the target signal is extremely low, and the performance of conventional clutter suppression methods is limited, the residual clutter remains after the time-varying clutter is suppressed, which leads to many false alarm points on the processed RD spectrum. The two-dimensional distribution of these false alarms in range-Doppler is very similar to the target and difficult to be distinguished, which seriously affects the target detection and tracking. To reduce false alarm points and improve the performance of target detection, the difference of spatial-temporal stationarity between target signal and clutter in a short time is discussed in this paper, a radar false alarm suppression method based on target spatial-temporal stationarity is proposed by using the difference of stationarity between target signal and false alarm points in range, Doppler, energy and azimuth. In this algorithm, to ensure the short-time stationarity of the target, the RD spectrum of sub-frames with short time interval is obtained by using the sliding matching filtering method and extract the peak points. Then, the Mahalanobis distance between the peak points of each sub-frame is used to eliminate false alarm points. Finally, false alarm points are further eliminated through the target tracking and retain the real target information, so as to improve the radar target detection performance. The simulation experiments show that this method can eliminate more than 90% false alarms points while maintaining the detection performance of the target. The processing of actual data in the field experiment shows that the after suppression false alarm by this algorithm can obtain more ideal target detection results, and realize the tracking of the UAV and other aircraft track.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf97c886a49a3c6e4efbf07eb2771612c1c95bc7e65800904ce98a710c798e41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
