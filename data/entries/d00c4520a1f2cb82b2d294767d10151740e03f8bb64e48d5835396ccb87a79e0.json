{"title":"Optimizing GLP-1R Agonist: A Computational Semaglutide Analogue with 112-fold Enhanced Binding Affinity to GLP-1R","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1032/v1","date":1718608374000,"content":"Drug-target binding is a crucial parameter in drug discovery and design, ensuring drug efficacy and specificity. Semaglutide, a potent GLP-1 receptor agonist, is widely used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus by regulating blood glucose levels and promoting weight loss. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing the concept of a general intermolecular binding affinity calculator (GIBAC) for designing semaglutide analogues with enhanced binding affinity to GLP-1R. For the first time, a Val27-Arg28 exchange was manually introduced to strengthen the semaglutide-GLP-1R binding affinity. A comprehensive structural and biophysical analysis was conducted to explore the semaglutide-GLP-1R sequence space, leading to the identification of promising analogues. Among these, one semaglutide analogue demonstrated a binding affinity to GLP-1R that is more than two orders of magnitude (113.3 times) higher than native semaglutide, achieving a Kd of 3.0 x 10-8 M compared to the Kd of 3.4 x 10-6 M for native semaglutide. This article proposes a promising structural biophysical approach for developing GLP-1 receptor agonists with improved efficacy. The prototype GIBAC, termed semaGIBAC, represents a paradigm shift in precise drug discovery and design, advocating for the construction of a full-scale GIBAC to be prioritized within the drug discovery and design community.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d00c4520a1f2cb82b2d294767d10151740e03f8bb64e48d5835396ccb87a79e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
