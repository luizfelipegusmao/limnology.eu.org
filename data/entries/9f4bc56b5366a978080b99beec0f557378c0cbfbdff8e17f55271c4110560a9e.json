{"title":"Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) increase pollination of Washington sweet cherry and pear crops","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/4/698/7705851?rss=1","date":1720051200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Apis mellifera</span> Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apis), honey bees, are the most widely used managed crop pollinators. However, their high rental cost and uncertain availability for North American orchard crops have motivated growers to explore alternative pollination options. We examined whether adding solitary, spring-flying <span>Osmia lignaria</span> Say (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), blue orchard bees, as co-pollinators with <span>A. mellifera</span> in Washington sweet cherry and pear orchards enhances fruit set and yield compared to the use of <span>A. mellifera</span> alone. We added managed <span>O. lignaria</span> to orchard sites where <span>A. mellifera</span> hives were already present. Fruit set, fruit yield, and <span>O. lignaria</span> reproduction at <span>O. lignaria</span>-supplemented sites were compared to nearby, paired sites pollinated only by <span>A. mellifera</span> (3 paired cherry and 3 paired pear sites). For both crops, the addition of <span>O. lignaria</span> significantly increased fruit set but did not yield at harvest. Microscopic inspection of pollen grains from <span>O. lignaria</span> nest cell provisions confirmed that <span>O. lignaria</span> primarily visited orchard flowers. Mean retention of <span>O. lignaria</span> in cherry orchards was slightly higher (65%) than <span>O. lignaria</span> retention reported in other orchard crops (30%–60%). However, retention in pear orchards was much lower (≤20%). These results show that supplementing hives with <span>O. lignaria</span> in Washington spring orchard crops can increase overall pollination, but that trees fail to bear developing fruit to maturity. The strategy of using co-pollinators, <span>O. lignaria</span> and <span>A. mellifera</span>, in US orchards may act as “pollination insurance” when <span>A. mellifera</span> hives are in low supply or when the weather is not amenable for <span>A. mellifera</span> flight during the bloom period.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"9f4bc56b5366a978080b99beec0f557378c0cbfbdff8e17f55271c4110560a9e","category":"Environment"}
