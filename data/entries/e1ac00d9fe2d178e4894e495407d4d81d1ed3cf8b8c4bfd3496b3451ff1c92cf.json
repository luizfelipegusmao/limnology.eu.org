{"title":"Spatial multi-omics characterizes GPR35-relevant lipid metabolism signatures across liver zonation in MASLD","link":"https://academic.oup.com/lifemeta/article/doi/10.1093/lifemeta/loae021/7685739?rss=1","date":1717113600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a metabolic disease that can progress to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), cirrhosis, and cancer. The zonal distribution of biomolecules in the liver is implicated in mediating the disease progression. Recently, G-protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) has been highlighted to play a role in MASLD, but the precise mechanism is not fully understood, particularly, in a liver-zonal manner. Here, we aimed to identify spatially distributed specific genes and metabolites in different liver zonation that are regulated by GPR35 in MASLD, by combining lipid metabolomics, spatial transcriptomics (ST), and spatial metabolomics (SM). We found that GPR35 influenced lipid accumulation, inflammatory and metabolism-related factors in specific regions, notably affecting the anti-inflammation factor ELF4 (E74 like E-twenty six (ETS) transcription factor 4), lipid homeostasis key factor CIDEA (cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor alpha (DFFA)-like effector A), and the injury response-related genes <span>SAA1/2/3</span> (serum amyloid A1/2/3), thereby impacting MASLD progression. Furthermore, SM elucidated specific metabolite distributions across different liver regions, such as C10H11N4O7P (3聞,5聞-cyclic inosine monophosphate (3聞,5聞-IMP)) for the central vein, and this metabolite significantly decreased in the liver zones of <span>GPR35</span>-deficient mice during MASLD progression. Taken together, GPR35 regulates hepatocyte damage repair, controls inflammation, and prevents MASLD progression by influencing phospholipid homeostasis and gene expression in a zonal manner.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Life Metabolism Current Issue","siteHash":"d3cf61b7d69b232b580c1102d6441106867080e8dca2814adef0cc08b7e63ed3","entryHash":"e1ac00d9fe2d178e4894e495407d4d81d1ed3cf8b8c4bfd3496b3451ff1c92cf","category":"Environment"}
