{"title":"Compression stress-strain curve of lithium slag recycled fine aggregate concrete","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302176","date":1713448800000,"content":"<p>by Xue-Bin Chen, Jiong-Feng Liang, Wei Li</p>\r\n\r\nAs one of the key materials used in the civil engineering industry, concrete has a global annual consumption of approximately 10 billion tons. Cement and fine aggregate are the main raw materials of concrete, and their production causes certain harm to the environment. As one of the countries with the largest production of industrial solid waste, China needs to handle solid waste properly. Researchers have proposed to use them as raw materials for concrete. In this paper, the effects of different lithium slag (LS) contents (0%, 10%, 20%, 40%) and different substitution rates of recycled fine aggregates (RFA) (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%) on the axial compressive strength and stress-strain curve of concrete are discussed. The results show that the axial compressive strength, elastic modulus, and peak strain of concrete can increase first and then decrease when LS is added, and the optimal is reached when the LS content is 20%. With the increase of the substitution rate of RFA, the axial compressive strength and elastic modulus of concrete decrease, but the peak strain increases. The appropriate amount of LS can make up for the mechanical defects caused by the addition of RFA to concrete. Based on the test data, the stress-strain curve relationship of lithium slag recycled fine aggregate concrete is proposed, which has a high degree of agreement compared with the test results, which can provide a reference for practical engineering applications. In this study, LS and RFA are innovatively applied to concrete, which provides a new way for the harmless utilization of solid waste and is of great significance for the control of environmental pollution and resource reuse.","author":"Xue-Bin Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ff7f334a43906c8de179dabdab4328edd0028328ddbdf19a08a0a334cd41bcc5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
