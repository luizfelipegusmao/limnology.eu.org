{"title":"A Study on the Site Selection of Central Refuges considering Social Vulnerability to Natural Hazards","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1269/v1","date":1721111247000,"content":": Based on fairness perspective, this paper combines the social vulnerability assessment of natural hazards with multi-objective site selection model to propose a new site selection planning model for central refuges. To begin with, the social vulnerability assessment system of regional natural disasters is founded through literature analysis, and the social vulnerability index of natural disasters is constructed; and based on the exponential differentiation of index to depict regional refuge demand, design vulnerability coverage function quantitive site selection fairness; then taking the shortest weighted evacuation distance, maximum vulnerability coverage and construction cost, the coverage population and refuge quantity as constraint conditions to construct multi-objective optimization model; finally, taking Zigong City, Sichuan Province as the object of empirical research, adapting NSGA-II algorithm to get the Pareto optimal solution set, and using TOPSIS method to get the optimal location scheme. The research results can provide a new method for the location layout of central refuge.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e867063c7dad8e94d080fc9aa2812c69fadb241e070980e0b730a2105ee4a9d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
