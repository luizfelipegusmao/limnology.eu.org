{"title":"Self-Adaptive Teacher-Student framework for colon polyp segmentation from unannotated private data with public annotated datasets","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307777","date":1724853600000,"content":"<p>by Yiwen Jia, Guangming Feng, Tang Yang, Siyuan Chen, Fu Dai</p>\r\n\r\nColon polyps have become a focal point of research due to their heightened potential to develop into appendiceal cancer, which has the highest mortality rate globally. Although numerous colon polyp segmentation methods have been developed using public polyp datasets, they tend to underperform on private datasets due to inconsistencies in data distribution and the difficulty of fine-tuning without annotations. In this paper, we propose a Self-Adaptive Teacher-Student (SATS) framework to segment colon polyps from unannotated private data by utilizing multiple publicly annotated datasets. The SATS trains multiple teacher networks on public datasets and then generates pseudo-labels on private data to assist in training a student network. To enhance the reliability of the pseudo-labels from the teacher networks, the SATS includes a newly proposed Uncertainty and Distance Fusion (UDFusion) strategy. UDFusion dynamically adjusts the pseudo-label weights based on a novel reconstruction similarity measure, innovatively bridging the gap between private and public data distributions. To ensure accurate identification and segmentation of colon polyps, the SATS also incorporates a Granular Attention Network (GANet) architecture for both teacher and student networks. GANet first identifies polyps roughly from a global perspective by encoding long-range anatomical dependencies and then refines this identification to remove false-positive areas through multi-scale background-foreground attention. The SATS framework was validated using three public datasets and one private dataset, achieving 76.30% on IoU, 86.00% on Recall, and 7.01 pixels on HD. These results outperform the existing five methods, indicating the effectiveness of this approach for colon polyp segmentation.","author":"Yiwen Jia","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a795652346f461366f1a05ac55938b86b573bba1c226f295c7caa6cf4e07729d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
