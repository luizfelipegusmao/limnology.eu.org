{"title":"The Relevance of &beta;-Thalassemia Heterozygosity in Pediatric Clinical Practice: Croatian Experience","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1110/v2","date":1716190225000,"content":"Thalassemia syndromes are common monogenic disorders that represent a significant global health issue. No systematic epidemiological and molecular investigations on thalassemias in Croatian population have been reported to date. This prospective study included 70 children with a presumptive diagnosis of thalassemia, and their 42 first-degree relatives. Molecular characterization was performed using direct sequencing and gap-PCR methods. We identified 46 (30 children and 16 first-degree relatives) β-thalassemia heterozygous carriers from 24 unrelated families, carrying eight different mutations and one hemoglobin variant. Five variants account for approximately 85% of all affected β-globin alleles: Hb Lepore-Boston-Washington (32,6%), HBB: c.93-21G&amp;gt;A (19,6%), HBB:c.315+1G&amp;gt;A (13,1%), HBB:c.92+1G&amp;gt;A (10,9%), and HBB:c.92+6T&amp;gt;C variant (8,7%). A need for more detailed genetic profiling of β-thalassemia carriers is emphasized since genetic modifiers can significantly impact their phenotype. Our study provides important new insights into the relevance of β-thalassemia heterozygosity in the pediatric clinical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa1385c478fe98d1eb623ede3ceb9b716f93d4dbc1519e5a7448c5096c554462","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
