{"title":"A Fair Contribution Measurement Method for Federated\nLearning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0127/v1","date":1717483904000,"content":"Federated learning is an effective approach for preserving data privacy and security, enabling machine learning to occur in a distributed environment and promoting its development. However, an urgent problem that needs to be addressed is how to encourage active client participation in federated learning. The Shapley Value, a classical concept in cooperative game theory, has been utilized for data valuation in machine learning services. Nevertheless, existing numerical evaluation schemes based on the Shapley Value are impractical as they necessitate additional model training, leading to increased communication overhead. Moreover, participantsâ€™ data may exhibit Non-IID characteristics, posing a significant challenge to evaluating participant contributions. Non-IID data weakens the marginal effects of participants, which in turn affects model accuracy and leads to underestimated contribution measurements. Current works often overlook the impact of heterogeneity on model aggregation. This paper presents a fair federated learning contribution measurement scheme that addresses the need for additional model computations. By introducing a noval aggregation weight, it enhances the accuracy of contribution measurement. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show that the proposed method can accurately compute the contributions of participants. Compared to existing baseline algorithms, the model accuracy is significantly improved, with a similar time cost.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45fd41d62ad126a01bd703bd90fd90677e4c44564823193983a911204ee1a367","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
