However, current assessments of wetland C balance mainly focus on vertical fluxes between the land and atmosphere, frequently neglecting lateral carbon fluxes and land-use effects. Here, we conduct a global synthesis of 893 annual net ecosystem C balance (NECB) measures that include net ecosystem exchange of CO<sub>2</sub>, along with C input via manure fertilization, and C removal through biomass harvest or hydrological exports of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, across wetlands of different status and land uses. We find that elevating water table substantially reduces net ecosystem C losses, with the annual NECB decreasing from 2579 (95% interval: 1976 to 3214) kg C ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> in drained wetlands to −422 (−658 to −176) kg C ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> in natural wetlands, and to −934 (−1532 to −399) kg C ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> in rewetted wetlands globally. Climate, land-use history, and time since water table changes introduce variabilities, with drainage for (sub)tropical agriculture or forestry uses showing high annual C losses, while the net C losses from drained wetlands can continue to affect soil C pools for several decades. Rewetting all types of drained wetlands is needed, particularly for those formerly agriculture-used (sub)tropical wetlands where net ecosystem C losses can be largely reduced. Our findings suggest that elevating water table is an important initiative to reduce C losses in degraded wetlands, which could contribute to policy decisions for managing wetlands to enhance their C sequestration.</p>","author":"Ning Liu, \nQuancheng Wang, \nRonglei Zhou, \nRuiyang Zhang, \nDashuan Tian, \nPaul P.
