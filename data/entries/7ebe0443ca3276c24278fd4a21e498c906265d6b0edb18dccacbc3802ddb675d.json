{"title":"Quantum Transport Through a Quantum Dot Coupled to Majorana Nanowire and Two Ferromagnets With Noncollinear Magnetizations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0348/v1","date":1720069192000,"content":"We study the electron tunneling (ET) and local Andreev reflection (AR) processes in a quantum dot (QD) coupled to the left and right ferromagnetic leads with noncollinear ferromagnetisms. In particular, we consider that the QD is also side-coupled to a nanowire hosting Majorana bound states (MBSs) at its ends. Our results show that when one mode of the MBSs is coupled simultaneously to both spin-up and spin-down electrons on the QD, the height of the central peak is quite different from that if the MBS is coupled to only one spin component electrons. The ET and AR conductances which are mediated by the dot-MBS hybridization strongly depend on the angle between the left and right magnetic moments in the leads, which result in sign change of the angle-dependent tunnel magnetic resistance. This result is very different from case when the QD is coupled to regular fermonic mode, and can be used for detecting the existence of MBSs, a current challenge in condensed matter physics under extensive investigations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ebe0443ca3276c24278fd4a21e498c906265d6b0edb18dccacbc3802ddb675d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
