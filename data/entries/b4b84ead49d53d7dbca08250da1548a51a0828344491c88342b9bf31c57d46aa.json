{"title":"Navigating the Evolving Landscape of COVID-19: Strategies to Increase Vaccine Confidence and Improve Vaccination Rates in the United States","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1990/v1","date":1717063489000,"content":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on every individual in the United States. The launch of the COVID-19 vaccines is estimated to have averted millions of deaths and reduced over 18 million COVID-19 related hospitalizations. In September 2023, the updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine that include a monovalent component that corresponding to the omicron variant XBB.1.5 reflecting the predominant circulating variant at the time of strain selection, was approved and was recommended for use in all people â‰¥ 6 months of age. Despite this recommendation, the US uptake of the updated COVID vaccines over the 2023-2024 season has been far from optimal, placing many people at unnecessary risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes.   This paper provides an overview of the current state of COVID-19 in 2023-2024, and barriers to vaccine uptake. With the continued evolution of the virus, the potential for more virulent variants and the lower public acceptance of vaccination, the potential barriers that contributed to low vaccine uptake are explored, as well as to provide solutions for improving COVID-19 protection for future seasons.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4b84ead49d53d7dbca08250da1548a51a0828344491c88342b9bf31c57d46aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
