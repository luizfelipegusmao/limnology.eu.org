The structure-to-sound-field metasurface design approach is a highly iterative process based on trial and error. The process is cumbersome and inefficient. Therefore, an inverse design method was proposed based on parallel deep neural networks. The method took the global and local target sound field feature information as input and the metasurface physical structure parameters as output. The deep neural network was trained using a kernel loss function based on a radial basis kernel function, which established an inverse mapping relationship between the desired sound field to the metasurface physical structure parameters. Finally, the sound field intensity modulation at a localized target range was achieved. The results indicated that within the regulated target range, this method achieved an average prediction error of less than 5 dB for 92.9% of the sample data.","author":"Huanlong Zhao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3472bac720686cc3d1e0f7ea9cb94c44753089f78f98b121b866df96dccc2c41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
