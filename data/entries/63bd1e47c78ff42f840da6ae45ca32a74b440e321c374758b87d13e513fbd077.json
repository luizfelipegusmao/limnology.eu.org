Bioengineering homologs of the Rcr3 protease to activate plant immunity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/2982/7698374?rss=1","date":1719446400000,"content":"<span>Plant immunity hinges on the host's ability to recognize microbial invaders and initiate an appropriate defense response. Phytopathologists have collectively developed a strong understanding of the many ways that plants can achieve this recognition through their repertoire of immune receptors (<a href=\"#koae187-B1\">Jones et al. 2024</a>). Armed with this information, we have more opportunities than ever before to translate our knowledge of the molecular basis of plant immunity into potent, tuneable, and durable disease resistance for the crop species that feed the planet.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"63bd1e47c78ff42f840da6ae45ca32a74b440e321c374758b87d13e513fbd077","category":"Environment"}
