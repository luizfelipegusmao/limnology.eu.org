{"title":"Applying the Multifractal Model of Asset Returns (MMAR) to Financial Markets: Insights and Limitations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1986/v1","date":1727259268000,"content":"This study presents an application of fractal mathematics to financial markets through the utilization of the Multifractal Model of Asset Returns (MMAR). The model is employed to analyse a 30-year dataset encompassing three distinct financial markets: the USD/NOK currency pair, the OMXS30 stock index, and the 12-month LIBOR rate. The MMAR model successfully captures essential stylized facts about financial markets, including high kurtosis, non-independent price movements, and clustered volatile days. Simulations generated by the model demonstrate realistic behaviour and multifractal characteristics. However, the model lacks a statistical method for assessing its accuracy and may underestimate kurtosis in high-kurtosis markets. Notably, the model is capable of producing simulations across a wide range of kurtosis values and can be instrumental in stress-testing portfolios. Despite its potential, the model is subject to limitations, such as the need for human judgment, ambiguous predictions, and interpretability issues. Furthermore, the model may become unreliable following a high-kurtosis event.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2fedc54ba0ffce1ac7150085cc26d00aa12b0262da8daaa5580cfcbd39c61c11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
