{"title":"Unveiling the Function and Evolutionary Significance of Carnotaurus Horns: A Morphological and Behavioral Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2099/v1","date":1721919120000,"content":"This literature review investigates the morphological and behavioral significance of the horns of Carnotaurus sastrei, a theropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous period. Through a comprehensive analysis of fossil specimens, comparative anatomy, and biomechanical modeling, this review explores the evolutionary adaptations and potential functions of these distinctive cranial structures. The horns of Carnotaurus are hypothesized to serve multiple roles, including species recognition, thermoregulation, and intraspecific combat. Our findings suggest that its cranial horns likely served a primary role in species recognition, intimidating rivals and signaling mating readiness. It also could have been used occasionally in head-butting contests, potentially as a display of dominance, but likely did not play a role in thermoregulation. Additionally, we examine the ecological context in which Carnotaurus lived, assessing how environmental factors could have influenced the development of such features. The implications of this study extend to broader discussions on the functional morphology and adaptive strategies of theropod dinosaurs, highlighting the complex relationship between form and function in the evolutionary history of predatory dinosaurs like Carnotaurus sastrei.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc49a22c72fd1eda5d68e1917b9337588e44121a79f200e6a8d28ff37e4de209","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
