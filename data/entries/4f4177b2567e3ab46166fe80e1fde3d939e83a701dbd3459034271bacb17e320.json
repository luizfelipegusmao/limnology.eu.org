To address this challenge, we developed a Multi-Tilt Nanoparticle-Aided Cryo-Electron Microscopy Sampling (MT-NACS) technique [<a href=\"#ozae044.390-B3\">3</a>]. This technique enables direct measurement of the three-dimensional distance distribution between two gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) attached to a protein by capturing cryo-electron microscopy images of AuNP-labeled proteins from multiple tilt angles (Fig. 1). To demonstrate the capabilities of MT-NACS, we selected calmodulin (CaM) as a model system and measured the structural changes of CaM under various sample conditions. We observed structural changes in CaM before (apo-CaM) and after Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding (holo-CaM) at different salt concentrations (Fig. 2A-F). Additionally, for the first time, we used MT-NACS to measure the structural changes in CaM before and after its binding with the amyloid-beta peptide (Fig. 2G-L). MT-NACS offers a new approach for understanding the conformational changes of small proteins, as detailed in the published paper [<a href=\"#ozae044.390-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4f4177b2567e3ab46166fe80e1fde3d939e83a701dbd3459034271bacb17e320","category":"Environment"}
