{"title":"Dual-band Passive Beam-Steering Antenna Technologies for Low Power Satellite Communication and Modern Wireless Systems: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0189/v1","date":1722906973000,"content":"Efficient beam steerable high-gain antennas enable high-speed data rates over long-distance networks, including wireless backhaul, satellite communications (SATCOM), and SATCOM On-the-Move. These characteristics are essential for advancing contemporary wireless communication networks, particularly within 5G and beyond. Various beam-steering solutions have been proposed in the literature, with passive beam-steering mechanisms employing planar metasurfaces emerging as cost-effective, power-efficient, and compact options. These attributes make them well-suited for use in confined spaces, large-scale production and widespread distribution to meet the demands of the mass market. Utilizing a dual-band antenna terminal setup is often advantageous for full duplex communication in wireless systems. Therefore, this article presents a comprehensive review of the dual-band beam steering techniques for enabling full-duplex communication in modern wireless systems, highlighting their design methodologies, scanning mechanisms, physical characteristics, and constraints. Despite the advantages of planar metasurface-based beam steering solutions, literature on dual-band beam steering antennas supporting full duplex communication is limited. This review article identifies research gaps and outlines future directions for developing economically feasible passive dual-band beam-steering solutions for mass deployment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4920ce9d981fc5bd77ef9c86e3f4799b1a61856cdf145100e04472d64d59344a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
