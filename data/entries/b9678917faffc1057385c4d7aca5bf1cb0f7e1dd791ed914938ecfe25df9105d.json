{"title":"Influenza vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in a Northeastern province in Thailand: Findings of a cross-sectional survey","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310761","date":1726754400000,"content":"<p>by Manash Shrestha, Penchan Pradubmook Sherer, Seung Chun Paek, Kriengkrai Prasert, Sutthinan Chawalchitiporn, Prabda Praphasiri</p>\r\nBackground <p>Healthcare workers (HCWs) are an important target group for influenza vaccination due to their increased risk of infection. However, their uptake remains a challenge. This study aimed to identify and measure influenza vaccine hesitancy among HCWs in Nakhon Phanom province, Thailand.</p> Methods <p>A representative cross-sectional survey was conducted during August–September 2020, among 350 HCWs at six hospitals in the province selected by a two-stage cluster sampling using a self-administered questionnaire. HCWs who either delayed getting influenza vaccines, accepted the vaccines but were unsure, or refused the vaccine with doubts were categorized as hesitant. HCWs who accepted the influenza vaccine without any doubts were classified as non-hesitant. Determinants of vaccine hesitancy were identified by a multivariable logistic regression analysis.</p> Results <p>A total of 338 participants (97%) filled the questionnaires. The mean age of the participants was 37.2 years. Most participants were female (280; 83%), nurses (136; 40%), working at district hospitals (238; 71%), with bachelor’s degree (223; 66%), and without any pre-existing chronic medical conditions (264; 78%). Influenza vaccine hesitancy was evident among nearly 60% of the participants (197/338), who had varying patterns of hesitancy. Significant factors of influenza vaccine hesitancy were found to be age above 50 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.2, 95% CI 1.3–8.5), fair knowledge of influenza and vaccination (aOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2–0.8), and negative influence of other HCW (High level–aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1–4.8; Moderate level- aOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1–4.4).</p> Conclusion <p>Influenza vaccine hesitancy was highly prevalent among the Thai HCWs in Nakhon Phanom province. Imparting updated information to the HCW, in combination with positive guidance from influential HCWs in the hospital, may help reduce hesitancy. These data may be useful to the National Immunization Program to design appropriate approaches to target hesitant HCWs in Thailand to improve influenza vaccine coverage.</p>","author":"Manash Shrestha","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b9678917faffc1057385c4d7aca5bf1cb0f7e1dd791ed914938ecfe25df9105d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
