{"title":"A Comprehensive Study on Flu Severity: Symptoms, Duration, and Management Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0251/v1","date":1727961703000,"content":"Background: Influenza is a highly contagious viral virus that affects millions of people globally each year, causing major morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences. Despite vaccine availability, seasonal flu outbreaks continue, exacerbated by virus mutations and varied transmission patterns. The Eastern Cape region of South Africa faces specific obstacles when it comes to flu management, such as limited healthcare access and dependence on traditional treatments. Methods: Patients from various backgrounds in the rural Eastern Cape who had flu and consented to be participants of the study were surveyed to assess symptom severity, duration, and management options. To compare the efficacy of medical treatments with home cures, data was analysed using descriptive statistics and independent t-tests. Results: Symptom severity ranged from mild to severe, and the average duration of symptoms varied according to the therapy approach chosen. Medical therapies, including antiviral drugs, were found to lessen symptom severity and duration, whereas home cures provided symptomatic relief but were less successful in severe cases. Symptom severity differed significantly between therapy methods (p &amp;lt; 0.05).Conclusions: The study emphasises the significance of prompt medical attention in managing influenza symptoms, especially in high-risk individuals. It also emphasises the importance of increasing access to healthcare in the Eastern Cape in order to improve outcomes for flu patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a4fc1329e518e6ab47155fa8f529e1c5c519556a1c4300eb40b26bca04aba73","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
