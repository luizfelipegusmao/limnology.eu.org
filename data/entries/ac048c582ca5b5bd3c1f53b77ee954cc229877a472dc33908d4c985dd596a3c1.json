{"title":"The Identification and Characteristics of Korea&#039;s Depressed Regions from a Sustainability Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2014/v1","date":1724824848000,"content":"This study was conducted to identify the actual degree of underdevelopment and spatial characteristics of rural areas in Korea, which are expected to face extinction due to population decline and aging. For this purpose, the spatial scope was set to Eup and Myeon areas classified as rural regions. To assess the degree of underdevelopment, previous studies were reviewed and analyzed to develop a comprehensive underdevelopment index, which was then applied to Eup and Myeon areas to classify them into growth regions, general regions, and depressed regions. Mapping the classified regions revealed that both growth and general regions were concentrated in the metropolitan area and southeastern regions, where Korea's population and resources are densely clustered. In contrast, depressed regions were found primarily in areas where agriculture is the main industry and in regions with unfavorable geographical conditions. This study is significant as it covers the entire nation of Korea, providing a method for identifying depressed regions and highlighting the regions that are developing. The findings can serve as fundamental data for the development of policies to address population decline in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac048c582ca5b5bd3c1f53b77ee954cc229877a472dc33908d4c985dd596a3c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
