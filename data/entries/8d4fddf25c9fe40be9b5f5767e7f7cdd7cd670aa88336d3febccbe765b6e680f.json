{"title":"Efficacy of Uromune® Autovaccine in Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection Management: A Unicenter Retrospective Study in Reus, Spain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1534/v1","date":1726753101000,"content":"Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant global health issue, especially among women, with growing concerns related to antibiotic resistance and adverse effects. The Uromune® vaccine, a sublingual bacterial lysate, represents a promising therapeutic alternative by enhancing immune responses against uropathogens. Methods: This retrospective study, conducted at Hospital Universitari de Sant Joan de Reus from January 2017 to August 2022, evaluated the effectiveness of Uromune® in treating recurrent UTIs (rUTIs). Patients received personalized autovaccines administered as two sublingual puffs daily for three months. Clinical, microbiological, and demographic data were analyzed to assess treatment outcomes and identify recurrence-associated factors. Results: Forty-nine patients (mean age, 61 years, and 59.2% women) were included in the study. Uromune® treatment decreased UTI episodes, from 3.73 ± 0.97 the year before to 0.98 ± 1.36 (P &amp;lt; 0.001) the year after its administration. The number of patients who suffered three or more episodes per year dropped from 43 (87.7%) before the intervention to 7 (14.3%) afterward. The maximum effectiveness of the autovaccine was observed three months post-administration, with 44 patients not experiencing any UTI episodes. Regression analysis identified having had a urostomy, chronic kidney disease, and being immunosuppressed as predictors of recurrence. Conclusion: The Uromune® autovaccine effectively reduced the frequency of rUTIs and associated hospitalizations, offering substantial relief to patients. These findings support the integration of Uromune® into routine clinical practice as a viable alternative to conventional antibiotic treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8d4fddf25c9fe40be9b5f5767e7f7cdd7cd670aa88336d3febccbe765b6e680f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
