{"title":"Perfusion Computed Tomography for Assessing Pancreas Graft Volumetric Perfusion after Simultaneous Pancreas and Kidney Transplantation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0081/v1","date":1722511418000,"content":"There is paucity of data in the available medical literature regarding the parameters of volumetric perfusion of pancreas grafts.\nMaterials and methods\nFrom February 5, 2016 to December 23, 2021, we performed perfusion computed tomography in 41 patients at different times after simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation. The study group consisted of 18 men (44%) and 23 women (56%) with a long history of type 1 diabetes complicated by terminal chronic renal failure. The results of perfusion computed tomography of the pancreas graft were studied, and the effects of post-transplantation timing and graft revascularization peculiarities on volumetric perfusion parameters were evaluated.\nResults\nThe median arterial blood flow, arterial blood volume, and permeability of the pancreas graft were 115.1 [99.7;130.3] mL/100 mL/min, 46.7 [37.4;56.9] mL/min and 8.6 [4.1;11.4] mL/100 mL/min, respectively. No statistically significant differences in the averaged perfusion values were found in the head, body, and tail of the pancreas graft. The post-transplantation timing and the number of arteries involved in graft revascularization did not have a significant effect on the volumetric perfusion of the graft.\nConclusion \nThe volumetric perfusion results of the pancreas graft correspond to those obtained in the study of pancreatic perfusion in healthy participants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bdae4c061c91fc84700dbe1c0d629c5062b44daeb0bd683d3556581bb033bf8f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
