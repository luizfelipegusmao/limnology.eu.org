To this day, a fast reconstruction method which utilizes the true potential of APT in terms of resolution does not exist. A model of its effective inverse, the field evaporation, which provides a physically accurate description of the ion trajectories, is a crucial component in reconstruction. The simulation of each individual evaporation, such as in TAPSim, while being able to model some cases accurately, has been time inefficient [<a href=\"#ozae044.017-B1\">1</a>]. Novel methods track surface meshes, achieving better time efficiency, although at the cost of spatial accuracy [<a href=\"#ozae044.017-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4c73dab57306af67ab0fad6ccc9f29b58a9b78d8c203e6648dcb3a125a53d6f3","category":"Environment"}
