{"title":"The Effect of Hardwood Veneer Densification on Plywood Density, Surface Hardness, and Screw Withdrawal Capacity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0401/v1","date":1717721316000,"content":"The increasing environmental awareness and carbon-storing capability of wood have amplified its relevance as a building material. The demand for high-quality wood species necessitates exploring alternative, underutilized wood sources due to limited forest areas and premium wood volume. Consequently, the veneer-based industry is considering lower-value hardwood species like grey alder, black alder, and aspen as substitutes for high-quality birch. Initially less appealing due to their lower density and mechanical properties, these species show promise through densification, which enhances their density, strength, and hardness. This study aims to enhance plywood screw withdrawal capacity and surface hardness by densifying low-density wood species and using them in plywood face veneer layers or all layers. The relationship between wood density, surface hardness, and screw withdrawal capacity of plywoods made of low-value species like aspen and black alder is examined. Experimental work with a pilot-scale veneer and plywood production line demonstrates improved surface hardness (65% and 93% for aspen and black alder, respectively) and screw withdrawal capacity (16% and 35% for aspen and black alder, respectively) in face veneer densified low-value hardwood plywood. This research highlights the potential of densified low-value wood species to meet construction requirements, expanding their practical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3e27b739e1ce733c08f267035ee1d12ad6234ecf22765e8ae739b698330c654","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
