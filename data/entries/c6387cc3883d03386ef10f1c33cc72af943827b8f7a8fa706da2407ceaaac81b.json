{"title":"The Existence of Gravitational Current: A Study of Gravitation and its Interaction with Matter","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1353/v1","date":1724117991000,"content":"It is commonly held that gravitation is a major force field influencing matter.  Existing models regard gravitational interaction as a singular weak force; the weakest among the four fundamental forces defined in physics.  Recent experimental findings, in both controlled laboratory experiments and natural occurrences, nevertheless, have unveiled the presence of a gravitational repulsion alongside gravitational attraction in the universe.  This series of studies reveals that the observed gravitational force results from two immensely powerful distinct forces—gravitational repulsion and attraction—nearly equal and opposing thus in a state of near equilibrium in nature.  While the theory of 'Universal Gravitation' established the proportionality of the gravitational force to mass, the recognition of gravitational repulsion force proportional to the temperature as a manifestation of thermal energy has only emerged from present experimental insights.  Furthermore, the imbalance between these two forces has been identified as the Newtonian force, initiating the motion of an object.  It provides a compelling explanation for the accelerating expansion of the universe: during atomic fusion in stars, a portion of mass is converted into energy.  This process increases the energy and decreases the mass of stellar objects.  The increase in energy enhances the repulsive force among them, while the reduction in mass diminishes their gravitational attraction, leading to the accelerating expansion of the universe.This paper introduces a model elucidating the characteristics of gravitational forces and the transmission of energy within matter through the concept of 'Gravitational Currents.' A set of postulates is formulated to elucidate the interaction of gravitational fields with matter and the presence of gravitational currents.  The discussion is supported by experimental evidence substantiating these concepts.In this series of experiments, a gyroscope - a standard apparatus in the scientific community with a spinning wheel mounted at one end of a freely pivoted rod having full degrees of freedom - is utilized.  When the wheel is set in rotation, the rod carrying the wheel precesses[1] around the vertical axis at the pivoted end, while levitating in free space defying the Earth's gravitational attraction.  This paper establishes that the conventional explanation involving the cross product of two vectors—the torque due to weight and the angular force (change of angular momentum) of the wheel—fails to account for the observed revolving and lifting forces.  Instead, it is demonstrated that these forces result from the upward shear force (which is the lifting force in this case) generated within the axis of the rod and the wheel itself.  This phenomenon is attributed to the flow of energy, conceptualized as gravitational current, within the axial rod in the Earth's gravitational field. The described process can be envisioned as a gravitational motor with gravitational current flowing through matter in a gravitational field.The results of the experiments substantiate the conclusion that there exist two fields defined as the intrinsic field and the natural force fields. The intrinsic gravity field is innate (linked) to every object, matter or entity in the universe, and it is dispersed in all directions in free space independent of other entities.  The actual force fields manifest between any two objects in the universe once they become cognizant of each other's existence through their intrinsic fields.The inherent force field exhibits a preference/tendency for existence within a medium rather than in free space, akin to the way a magnetic field runs within ferromagnetic materials rather than in open space.  If external force fields pass/runs through the medium, it affects the internal force fields of the medium, depending on the magnitudes and the directions of the external force fields and intrinsic force fields.  This implies that energy moves through the force field, and under the influence of the gravitational field, this energy flow can be conceptualized as a gravitational current.Gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves share similarities in their roles in transmitting energy through open space.  The potential for an analogy within a unified theoretical framework connecting electromagnetic fields and gravitational fields has surfaced, echoing Einstein's attempted unified theory proposed in 1916.  The paper delves into the parallels between electromagnetic motors and gravitational motors.Furthermore, alongside the concept of gravitational currents addressed in this paper, the research also elucidated a precise definition of the [Newtonian/mechanical] “force” and mechanism for its origination and function, termed: Intrinsic Energy Spin Force (IESpinF).  The analysis presented here demonstrates that the Newtonian/mechanical force arises from a perturbation or imbalance within the equilibrium of gravitational IESpinF, which includes both repulsion and attraction forces. [1] One of the main properties of gyroscopic action is “precession”.  Precession is a change in the orientation of the rotational axis of a rotating body.  If the axis of rotation of a body is itself rotating about a second axis, that body is said to be precessing about the second axis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6387cc3883d03386ef10f1c33cc72af943827b8f7a8fa706da2407ceaaac81b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
