{"title":"Material Flow Analysis of the Wood-Based Value Chains in a Rapidly Changing Bioeconomy: A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1365/v1","date":1729151648000,"content":"Material Flow Analysis (MFA) is a key tool in the circular bioeconomy, providing insight into the flow of materials within a system. Its use in the wood-based value chain is increasingly recognized and provides valuable information for policy making. Based on a comprehensive literature review, this article presents recent applications, challenges and research gaps related to MFA methodologies that are crucial for describing the expanding circular wood-based bioeconomy. Different MFA models and their methodologies are described and classified according to their scale and scope. The discourse on future research directions highlights the need to critically examine new material flows associated with bioeconomy development, including hidden by-product streams and end-use wood product recycling, as well as the role of regulators. The results of this study provide advice on data collection methods and the implementation of MFA models, offering valuable information for future research in the sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"42b4b59ca6a3a4a4c6cc420fc18798017123856505e70a718bea15a17e0c7924","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
