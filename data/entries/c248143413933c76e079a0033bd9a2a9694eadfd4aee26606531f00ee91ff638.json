{"title":"The Challenges of the Israeli Water Sector in Times of Emergency with the Application of Seawater Desalination","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0018/v1","date":1719826705000,"content":"Water supply policy is closely linked to sustainability as it directly influences the conservation and management of vital natural resources. This policy focuses on developing regulations and designing various activities related to the preser-vation of water resources, which can promote both ecological and economic sustainability. This study focuses on the Challenges of the Israeli Water Sector in Times of Emergency. In a time of growing climate crisis and despite the global warming trend, Israeli citizens routinely enjoy a regular constant supply of clean fresh water, thanks to local desalina-tion plants. Establishment of the desalination plants has become a model of water management for many countries in an era of growing climate crisis. At the same time, Israel’s water sector is faced with challenges and threats related to earthquakes and various states of warfare and security confrontations. In such times of emergency, Israel’s water sector is particularly vulnerable to disruptions of the water infrastructure and it’s adequate operation, by both contamination of the water sources and damage to the desalination plants. This study examines the challenges of the Israeli water sec-tor that require it to contend with these emergency situations in an era of reliance on desalination plants. The research method combines analysis of statistical data extracted from Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics, Government Water and Sewage Authority, and Meteorological Service, in addition to reading and analyzing primary documents generated by various government ministries and government organs related to Israel’s water policy. The research findings lead to the conclusion that public policy on managing the water sector, manifested in the development and establishment of water desalination plants, has resolved Israel’s water crisis, put an end to its dependency on the amount of precipitation and on natural water sources, and allowed an increase in water production to match the rise in consumption. Nonetheless, as successful as this public policy may be, it does not consider the possibility of extreme scenarios and does not develop the entire range of steps necessary to confront them, and thus undermines the ability of the Israeli water sector to provide its citizens with water in times of emergency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c248143413933c76e079a0033bd9a2a9694eadfd4aee26606531f00ee91ff638","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
