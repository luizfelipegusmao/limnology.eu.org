{"title":"The prevalence of using beta-blockers and its relationship with social anxiety among health profession students at Umm Al-Qura University","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307163","date":1723557600000,"content":"<p>by Baraa Sami Quronfulah, Ruyuf Saleh Alzahrani, Ebtesam Tariq Kattan, Hala Mamun Tamim, Taif Hazzaa Alharbi, Mariyyah Mohammed Alghamdi, Amal Mohammad Badawoud</p>\r\nBackground <p>Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive fear of scrutiny in social situations. Health students are more susceptible to SAD due to academic demands. They may resort to self-medication, particularly beta-blockers (BBs) for managing physical symptoms of SAD. The study aims to investigate the prevalence of beta-blocker use and its relationship with social anxiety disorder among health students at Umm Al-Qura University.</p> Methods <p>In this cross-sectional study, 461 undergraduate health students participated in a questionnaire with 30 questions divided into three sections: The Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), BBs usage behavior questionnaire, and demographic characteristics.</p> Results <p>The study found 56.2% had SAD. A total of 7.8% of the sample reported using BBs, and no significant correlation was found between the usage of BBs and the SAD score (P = 0.085).</p> Conclusion <p>The study revealed significant relationships between the presence of SAD with gender, history of mental conditions, and correlation between the use of BBs with history of mental conditions. Although BBs usage is low among health students, the prevalence of SAD is alarming. The results could raise awareness about the need for early detection of SAD among health students.</p>","author":"Baraa Sami Quronfulah","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"92d50af29404119c56e695b595d4d9c9f0526ff367eaee0abae8d1d3e76462a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
