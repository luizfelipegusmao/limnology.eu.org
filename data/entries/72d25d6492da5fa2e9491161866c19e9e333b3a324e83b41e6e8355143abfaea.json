{"title":"Modification of the Rheological Properties of a Polyamide by Adding a Copolymer Comprising an A-olefin and Maleic Anhydride","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1141/v1","date":1721034757000,"content":"The rheological properties of a polyamide (PA) resin with low crystallinity were modified by melt-mixing it with a small amount of an alternative a-olefin–maleic anhydride copolymer as a reactive compound. Because PA has a low melting point, rheological characterization was performed over a wide temperature range. Owing to the reaction between PA and the alternative a-olefin–maleic anhydride copolymer, the blend sample behaved as a long-chain branched polymer in the molten state. The thermo-rheological complexity was obvious owing to large flow activation energy values in the low modulus region. The primary normal stress difference under steady shear was greatly increased in the wide shear rate range, leading to a large swell ratio at capillary extrusion. Furthermore, strain hardening in the transient elongational viscosity, which is responsible for favorable processability, was clear. Because this is a simple modification method, it will be widely employed to modify the rheological properties of various polyamide resins.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72d25d6492da5fa2e9491161866c19e9e333b3a324e83b41e6e8355143abfaea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
