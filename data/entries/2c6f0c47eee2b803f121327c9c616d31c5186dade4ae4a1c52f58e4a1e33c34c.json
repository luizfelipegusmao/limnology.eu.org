{"title":"A Novel Method to Characterize the Damping Capacity of EPDM/CIIR Blends Using Vibrating Rubber Balls","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1439/v1","date":1713869464000,"content":"The rebound behaviors of rubber balls based on ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) / chlorinated butyl rubber (CIIR) blends were investigated systematically. A novel method was proposed to characterize the damping capacity of the EPDM/CIIR blends. The damping capacity can be represented by the rebound height of rubber balls, and lower rebound height corresponds to better damping capacity. A mathematical model expressed by an equation obtained through theoretical derivation has been proposed to predict the rebound height of the rubber balls. The energy dissipation rate (EDR) defined by the ratio of the height loss to the rebound time was proposed to further characterize the damping capacity. The EDR value shows the highest for the pure CIIR and lowest for the pure EPDM, showing a decrease trend with the increase of EPDM content in the rubber blends. By comparison one can obtain that the damping capacity of the EPDM/CIIR blends decreases with the decrease of external excitation, the conclusion of which plays a key role in the formulation design of viscoelastic damping rubber materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c6f0c47eee2b803f121327c9c616d31c5186dade4ae4a1c52f58e4a1e33c34c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
