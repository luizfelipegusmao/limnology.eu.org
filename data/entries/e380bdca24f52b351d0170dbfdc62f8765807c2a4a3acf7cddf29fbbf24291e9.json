{"title":"SemConvTree: semantic convolutional quadtrees for multi-scale event detection in Smart City","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1247/v1","date":1721097718000,"content":"The digital world is increasingly invading our reality, which leads to the formation of a significant reflection of the processes and activities taking place in the smart city. Such activities include well-known urban events, celebrations, and those with a very local character. Due to the mass occurrence, events have a comparable influence on the formation of the spirit and the urban atmosphere. This work presents an enhanced semantic version of the ConvTree algorithm - SemConvTree. It allows considering the semantic component of the data obtained by using semi-supervised learning of topic modeling ensemble (consisting of improved models BERTopic, TSB-ARTM, SBert-Zero-Shot). We also present an improved event search algorithm based on both statistical evaluations and semantic analysis of posts. This algorithm allows fine-tuning the mechanism of discovering the required entities with the specified particularity (such as a particular topic). Experimental studies were conducted within the area of New York City. They showed an improvement in the detection of posts devoted to events (about 40% higher f1-score) due to the accurate handling of events of different scales. These results lead in the long term to talk about the potential perspective in creating a semantic platform for the analysis and monitoring of urban events in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e380bdca24f52b351d0170dbfdc62f8765807c2a4a3acf7cddf29fbbf24291e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
