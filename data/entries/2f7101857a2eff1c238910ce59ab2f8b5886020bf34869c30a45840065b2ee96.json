{"title":"Balancing the Energy Efficiency Benefits of Glazed Surfaces. Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1768/v1","date":1719361930000,"content":"Daylighting design is not only a stage of dimensioning glazed surfaces to provide sufficient natural light to an occupied space, but also a method of analysing how this matter can be achieved without unwanted effects, such as: gains and losses of heat, glare, and variations of the daylighting intensity, at various indoor distances and levels. According to the international regulations in force, glazed surfaces must be designed with a careful balance between the admission of natural light and thermal performance, such as heat loss in winter and heat gain in summer. In a novel project, it is essential to determine the optimal ratio of window-to-wall surface area. This necessity arises because the materials constituting the glazed surfaces of windows typically exhibit lower insulation properties compared to those of the building's walls. This methodology could be applied to building renovations when envelope modifications are possible and suitable. The case study presented in the paper highlights the energy consumed due to a group of windows with a large glazed area in an existing building, located in a temperate continental climate area. The energy consumption results from supplementary artificial lighting required to maintain adequate illumination for indoor activities and that to counterbalance heat loss during colder periods are evaluated. The analysis performed by modifying the glazed surface led to the identification of an optimum value of windows dimensions for an energy consumed minimum.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f7101857a2eff1c238910ce59ab2f8b5886020bf34869c30a45840065b2ee96","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
