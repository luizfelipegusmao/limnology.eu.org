{"title":"Factors associated with oral health care behavior of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A hospital-based, cross-sectional study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303530","date":1716213600000,"content":"<p>by Kamonchanok Sairat, Nitikorn Phoosuwan</p>\r\nBackground <p>Oral healthcare behavior determines oral health status and the incidence of oral diseases. People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at-risk of having low oral healthcare behavior and disease-related oral health.</p> Objective <p>To investigate the oral health status and factors associated with oral healthcare behavior among people with T2DM in Thailand.</p> Methods <p>In total, 401 people with T2DM participated in the study based on their attendance at a non-communicable disease clinic at sub-district health promotion hospitals in Bueng Kan, a north-eastern province in Thailand. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain variables of interest. Linear regression analysis at the 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied.</p> Results <p>The majority of participants were female (73.8%). More than three-quarters had more than 20 permanent teeth (77.6%), a decay missing filling tooth index was 10.6 teeth/person. Many participants had four permanent occlusal pairs (69.6%), had tooth decay (74.6%), and some participants had tooth filling (32.2%). Statistically significant factors associated with oral healthcare behavior were: having complications associated with diabetes mellitus (Beta = -0.097, 95%CI = -1.653, -0.046), oral health literacy (Beta = 0.119, 95%CI = 0.009, 0.150), educational level (Beta = 0.123, 95%CI = 0.103, 0.949), oral healthcare attitude (Beta = 0.258, 95%CI = 0.143, 0.333), and oral health services (Beta = 0.430, 95%CI = 0.298, 1.408).</p> Conclusions <p>People with T2DM had good oral health status. People with T2DM with low oral health literacy, low attitude, and low level of oral health services were at a higher risk of poor oral healthcare behavior.</p>","author":"Kamonchanok Sairat","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9bdf61f02969cf098f72bd60b381bd1ea8581ffb289ab00914ed3d1cbc183695","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
