{"title":"223 Survey of veterinarians who use pentobarbital for euthanasia suggests knowledge gaps regarding animal disposal","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/239/7664767?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>To assess 1) knowledge and practices of veterinarians regarding disposal of euthanized animals, 2) the extent to which veterinarians communicate with their clients about potential risks of rendering pentobarbital-euthanized animals, and 3) the extent to which veterinarians communicate potential relay toxicosis and environmental risks of pentobarbital-euthanized animals to clients. Over a 3-wk period in early 2021, 16,831 of the 99,500 members of the AVMA were surveyed, with 2,093 responses (a 12% response rate). Respondents were assigned to 1 of 3 categories on the basis of their answers: veterinarians euthanizing only food-producing species, veterinarians euthanizing only non–food-producing species, and veterinarians euthanizing both food-producing and non–food-producing species (i.e., veterinarians euthanizing mixed species). Veterinarians responding to this survey appeared to be aware of the major methods of animal disposal, and about 89% reported communicating the method of euthanasia with clients to help ensure appropriate animal disposal. However, the need for additional education on local, state, and federal laws and rendering, as well as on risks of relay toxicosis including wildlife predation and environmental impacts, was reported. Survey results identified gaps in knowledge of veterinarian regarding animal disposal following pentobarbital euthanasia. Further education on this topic may be beneficial, particularly for early- and mid-career veterinarians who euthanize non–food-producing species and for veterinarians who euthanize mixed species in urban and suburban communities.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"feeb0cf5ad9e237d5023cb9c8827b94f47d40d656336a03f8b911e79df84e5a2","category":"Environment"}
