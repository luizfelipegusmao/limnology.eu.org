{"title":"Atherosclerosis and Bidirectional Relationship between Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease: From Bench to Bedside&mdash;Part 1","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1185/v1","date":1710927231000,"content":"Atherosclerosis, a complex metabolic-immune disease characterized by a chronic inflammation driven by the buildup of lipid-rich plaques within arterial walls, has emerged as a pivotal factor in the intricate interplay between cancer and cardiovascular disease. This bidirectional relationship, marked by shared risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms, underscores the need for a comprehensive understanding of how these two formidable health challenges intersect and influence each other. Cancer and its treatments can contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis while atherosclerosis with its inflammatory microenvironment can exert profound effects on cancer development and outcomes. Both cancer and cardiovascular disease involve intricate interactions between general and personal exposomes. In this review we want to summarize the state-of-the-art of translational data and try to show how oncologic studies on cardiotoxicity can broaden our knowledge of crucial pathways in cardiovascular biology with a positive impact on precision cardiology and cardioncology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24f6a458ffbc105ecc758c4a9afa3c11ee661b4ed665d9879b2a4f54fbd78a3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
