This study aimed to investigate the structural characterization of a purified polysaccharide (designated as PTP-3a) derived from <i>T. fuciformis</i> and explore its interaction with gut microbiota <i>in vitro</i>.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The findings revealed that PTP-3a had a molecular weight of 1.22 × 10<sup>3</sup> kDa and consisted of fucose, glucose, xylose, mannose and glucuronic acid in a molar ratio of 0.271:0.016:0.275:0.400:0.038. The primary linkage types identified in PTP-3a were 1,3-linked-manp, 1,4-linked-xylp and 1,2,3-linked-fucp, with corresponding ratios of 0.215:0.161:0.15. In addition, PTP-3a demonstrated notable thermal stability and exhibited a triple-helical structure. Moreover, following <i>in vitro</i> fermentation for 48 h, PTP-3a was efficiently utilized, resulting in a reduction in carbohydrate levels, the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and pH adjustment. Furthermore, during <i>in vitro</i> fecal microbial fermentation, PTP-3a decreased the relative abundance of Firmicutes while increasing the proportions of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, resulting in a significantly reduced Firmicutes/Bacteroidete<i>s</i> ratio. Additionally, PTP-3a stimulated the growth of beneficial bacteria such as <i>Parabacteroides merdae</i>, <i>Gordonibacter pamelaeae</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium pseudolongum</i> and <i>Parabacteroides distasonis</i>. Importantly, a strong correlation was observed between the production of SCFAs and specific microorganisms.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These findings suggested that PTP-3a has potential as a prebiotic for modulating the gut microbiota. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Haizhao Song, \nJing Lu, \nQiang Chu, \nRou Deng, \nXinchun Shen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"6d817026bad7db16c91493f37f97d93a3d02e1c519f54e03019bf16eb3acb8c4","category":"Environment"}
