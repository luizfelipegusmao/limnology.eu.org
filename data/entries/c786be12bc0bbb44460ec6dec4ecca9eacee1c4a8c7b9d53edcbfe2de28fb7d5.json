{"title":"Development and Design Perspective of a Model for Analyzing the Social Life Cycle of Public Organizations: Examination of Existing Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1303/v1","date":1721113232000,"content":"Background: This study aims to develop a research framework for the Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) of public services by conducting a systematic review of existing literature from 2013 to 2022. The research question focuses on how the results of the literature review can inform the advancement of S-LCA for public services. Methods: To answer this question, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of data from the Web of Science and Scopus databases was carried out. The quantitative analysis determined the total number of S-LCA and SO-LCA papers published by main journals, and main authors. The qualitative analysis highlighted the different themes and research objectives addressed in the work relating to the S-LCA of products/services and organizations. Results: The results show that 222 papers dealing with S-LCA were published in 94 journals and revealed a scarcity of work on public services, with most papers focusing on products/services and organizations. While there is a lack of direct scientific data, the study identified 17 actors, 74 impact sub-categories, and 178 indicators that could be considered for the S-LCA of public services. Conclusions: Due to the diverse nature of public services, it is crucial to develop specific stakeholder categories, sub-categories, and performance indicators for each public service. This will support the scientific community and S-LCA practitioners in applying assessing the social impacts of public services.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c786be12bc0bbb44460ec6dec4ecca9eacee1c4a8c7b9d53edcbfe2de28fb7d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
