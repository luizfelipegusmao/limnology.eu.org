Therefore, in this letter we report a convenient diastereoselective and practical strategy for the synthesis of chiral methyl 2-((4R)-3-acryloyl-4-phenyloxazolidin-2-yl)acetates starting from (R)-(â€“)-2-phenylglycinol and methyl propiolate which were obtained via simple two chemical and stereoselective reactions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ef845aff9e8ea2505975ec88098a9d9d2bf7539b70f4710bb827ee98e59b35f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
