{"title":"Comparative Analysis of Heat Transfer Performance of Heat Sinks with Lattice Geometry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1793/v1","date":1719387956000,"content":"This paper presents a comparative study of heat transfer performance of lattice structured heat sinks. 20 different unit cells were chosen and heat sinks were modelled in nTop with constant unit cell size. Al 6061 alloy was chosen for analysis due to its good thermal conductivity, low weight, low cost, and high strength. Steady state thermal analysis was performed using ANSYS with constant input parameters for all samples. Heat flux and temperature distribution within the heat sinks were analysed. The study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the thermal performance of lattice heat sink designs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39926a9d113a23d4c1d3ca3b67fb849e15fd84ceabd65567d97e19fd9b736cc4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
