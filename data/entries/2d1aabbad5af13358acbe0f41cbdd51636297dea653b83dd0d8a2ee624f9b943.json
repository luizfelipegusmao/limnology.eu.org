In 2021, Badr et al. reported the synthesis of TiO<sub>2</sub>-based one-dimensional (1D) Nano bundles, using a one pot, solution-reprecipitation for producing cost-effective, earth abundant materials in a highly scalable process [<a href=\"#ozae044.624-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2d1aabbad5af13358acbe0f41cbdd51636297dea653b83dd0d8a2ee624f9b943","category":"Environment"}
