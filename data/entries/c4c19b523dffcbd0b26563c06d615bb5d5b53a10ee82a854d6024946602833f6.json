Identifying recent TB infection (TBI) offers an avenue to targeted TB preventative therapy provision, and prevention to disease progression. However, detecting recent TBI remains challenging. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus assay (QFT-Plus) claims to have improved sensitivity in detecting recent TBI, by the addition of the TB2 antigen tube to the TB1 tube used in previous tests. TB2 detects CD8-mediated interferon gamma response, a potential marker of recent infection. We compared QFT-Plus TB1 and TB2 responses in individuals with recent and remote infection in high-burden settings. The Tuberculosis Reduction through Expanded Antiretroviral Treatment and TB Screening (TREATS) Project followed a cohort of adolescents and young people (AYP) aged 15–24 years in Zambia and South Africa to determine TBI incidence measured by QFT-Plus over 24 months. We categorised individuals with QTF-Plus positive result into recent and remote infection. We compared their TB1 and TB2 responses and the antigen tube differential [TB2-TB1], an indicator of CD8-activity, using logistic regression. At baseline, 3876 AYP, 1852/3876 (47.8%) were QFT-Plus positive whilst 2024/3876 (52.2%) QFT-Plus negative. Of the QFT-Plus baseline positives, 1069/1852 (57.7%) tested positive at both 12 and 24 months—remote infection. Of the QFT-Plus baseline negatives, 274/2024(13.3%) converted within a 12-month period- recent infection. TB1 and TB2 responses were higher in remote than recent infection. In recent infection, TB2 responses were greater than TB1 responses. The mean differential was 0.01 IU/ml in recent and -0.22 IU/ml in remote infection, (p = 0.145). The quantitative QFT-Plus results did not appear to reflect a marked distinction between recent and remote infection. Further analysis of the responses of infected individuals who developed disease is required to determine whether any signal in QFT-Plus results may predict progression to disease.","author":"Modupe Amofa-Sekyi","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"c4c19b523dffcbd0b26563c06d615bb5d5b53a10ee82a854d6024946602833f6","category":"Environment"}
