To date, larvae of this species have remained unknown; therefore, their biology is poorly understood. In the present study, the early developmental stages of <i>R. derzhavini</i> are described for the first time. In Peter the Great Bay, Japan Sea, this species is characterized by a spring spawning season (May) and a short pelagic period of larval development, usually from mid-May to the last 10â€‰days of June. Species identification of the described larvae was confirmed by incubation, rearing of larvae in captivity, and genotyping of a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (<i>COI</i>) gene. In addition, the development of pigmentation in larvae of this and related species was compared. Morphological analysis of both adults and larvae, together with complementary molecular genetics, confirms the previously obtained conclusions that the species of the genera <i>Radulinopsis</i>, <i>Radulinus</i>, <i>Asemichthys</i>, and <i>Astrocottus</i> form a natural group with monophyly by all types of data.</p>","author":"Irina V.
