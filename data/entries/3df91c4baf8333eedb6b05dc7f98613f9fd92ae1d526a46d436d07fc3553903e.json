{"title":"The New Paradigm Caused by Regulation(EU) 2024/1252 on the Upcycling of the Landfilled Ferrous Slags. Case Study: Iron and Steel Slag Dumps in Romania","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1737/v1","date":1724662913000,"content":"The production of a ton of steel in an integrated steel plant generates of approximately 1 ton of ferrous slag. A great part of ferrous slags is recycled in civil and road construction etc., but a huge amount is still dumped. Recycling ferrous slag as cement precursor was considered the upcycling route. Regulation (EU) 2024/1252 requires the Member States to provide information, until November 2026, on the critical raw materials (CRM) amount in their secondary resources and on quantification methods used for. This study addresses two synergic objectives: ensuring the reliability of XRFS results and screening for CRM in ferrous slags based on XRFS outcomes. The main novelty of the paper is the way of ensuring the reliability of the XRFS results based on weighted arithmetic mean and on the maximum likelihood approach. Secondly, the XRFS measurements carried on ferrous slags demonstrate that they contain significant amounts of CRM like Ba, Sr, Y, etc. XRFS cannot detect light CRM. Our preliminary LIBS measurements on ferrous slags disclosed the presence of Li and Be. The drawbacks of the XRFS technique impose further research to develop an integrated XRFS, LIBS and XRD procedure for comprehensive and trustworthy CRM screening in extractive waste piles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3df91c4baf8333eedb6b05dc7f98613f9fd92ae1d526a46d436d07fc3553903e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
