{"title":"Factors associated with glycaemic control and diabetes complications in patients at Bugando Medical Centre, Mwanza, Tanzania: A cross-sectional study design","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308659","date":1725026400000,"content":"<p>by Aneth H.

Mori, Eliangiringa Kaale</p>\r\nBackground <p>Glycaemic control is essential for improving the quality of life in patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Untreated hyperglycaemia can result in numerous severe and life-threatening complications, such as damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and peripheral vascular system. Appropriate glycaemic control and management is fundamental to prevent and delay diabetes complications. Therefore, this study aims to assess the prevalence of poor glycaemic control, its associated factors, and the prevalence of diabetes-related complications among DM patients.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional study was conducted among 340 DM patients treated at Bugando Medical Center from 4<sup>th</sup> - 30<sup>th</sup> April 2023 to determine the prevalence of poor glycaemic control and its predictors. Secondary data from 7952 DM patients treated between April 2022 and 30<sup>th</sup> May 2023 were used to determine DM-related complications. STATA 15 version …was used for analysis.</p> Results <p>Out of 340 patients, 66.4% had poor glycaemic control with HbA<sub>1c</sub> or Random Blood Glucose greater than 7% or 7mmol/L, respectively. Older age, duration of DM of more than 10 years, insulin therapy, and those unaware of glycaemic target goals were factors associated with poor glycaemic control. (AOR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.28–6.01, P = 0.03), (AOR: 3.15, 95% CI: 2.22–6.55, P = 0.016), (AOR: 3.07, 95% CI: 2.10–6.12, P = 0.022) and (AOR: 3.42, 95% CI: 2.17–5.97, P = 0.001), respectively. Of the 7952 patient records reviewed indicated that 44.5% had complications, of which 25.8% had neurological complications and 55.3% had multiple complications.</p> Conclusion <p>Two-third of DM patients failed to achieve good glycaemic control and about half of the patient’s records reviewed indicated they developed diabetic complications. Thus appropriate interventions are necessary to improve glycaemic control and prevent or control complications among DM patients.</p>","author":"Aneth H.
