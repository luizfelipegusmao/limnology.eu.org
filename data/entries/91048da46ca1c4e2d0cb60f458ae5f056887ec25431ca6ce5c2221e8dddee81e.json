This study aimed to investigate phenotypic and genetic capacity of biofilm formation by <i>Escherichia coli</i> isolated from supply water with their antibiotic susceptibility pattern. Altogether fifty water samples collected from a city supply water distribution scheme in Kathmandu were analyzed to assess the physicochemical and microbiological quality. Comparing Nepal's national drinking water quality standards 2022, conductivity (4%), turbidity (18%), iron (28%), and residual chlorine (8%) were found exceeding the values above the standards. Among total, 40% of water samples were contaminated with total coliform bacteria. <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Citrobacter</i> species were dominant and isolated from 20 (64.52%) and 11 (35.48%) water samples, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that <i>E. coli</i> isolates were resistant to ampicillin (20%), nitrofurantoin (10%), and cefotaxime (10%). <i>Citrobacter</i> spp. (54.54%) were found multidrug resistant (MDR) while none of the isolates of <i>E. coli</i> were MDR. Of total, 45% of the isolates developed biofilm while testing with the Microtiter plate method. Biofilm-forming genes <i>bcsA</i> and <i>csgD</i> in <i>E. coli</i> isolates were detected with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) employing specific primers. <i>bcsA</i> and <i>csgD</i> genes were detected in 55% and 45% of the isolates, respectively. This study confirms the occurrences of biofilm forming and antibiotic resistant bacteria like <i>E. coli</i> in the drinking water supply system in Kathmandu alarming its environmental circulation and possible public health threat. Although further study is warranted, this study suggests public health and drinking water treatment interventions to mitigate the biofilm forming antibiotic resistant potential pathogens from supply water in Kathmandu, Nepal.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nForty percent of tested drinking water samples in Kathmandu were contaminated with total coliform bacteria.\n<i>E. coli</i> and half of <i>Citrobacter</i> spp. isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics.\n<i>bcsA</i> and <i>csgD</i> genes were detected in biofilm producing <i>E.coli</i> isolates.\n</p>","author":"Saraswati Gaihre, \nKamil Prajapati, \nSujata Dhungel, \nPrabin Dawadi, \nDev Raj Joshi, \nTista Prasai Joshi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"91048da46ca1c4e2d0cb60f458ae5f056887ec25431ca6ce5c2221e8dddee81e","category":"Environment"}
