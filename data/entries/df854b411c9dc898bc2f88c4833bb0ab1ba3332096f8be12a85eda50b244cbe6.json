However, the relationship with macronutrients by eating occasions has not been explored deeply. \nObjective: Our aim was to estimate the association between chrono-nutrition, sleep quality, chronotype and the prevalence of T2DM. \nMethods: This cross-sectional study included a subset of 3465 middle-aged adults (2068 women) from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Spain cohort study. In the 2017-18 follow-up, we assessed chronotype, sleep quality, diet, and sociodemographic data by validated questionnaires. Further, we used blood samples to determinate serum levels of glucose. We defined a case of T2DM when serum glucose concentration was â‰¥126 mg/dl or when participants self-reported diabetes. \nResults: Higher prevalence of T2DM was associated with poor sleep quality (ORpoorvsgood=2.90, 95%CI=1.30, 6.28). Carbohydrate intake at breakfast was inversely associated with the prevalence of T2DM (OR=0.75, 95%CI=0.66, 0.85). Finally, lipid intake at breakfast were associated with a 13% higher the prevalence of T2DM (OR=1.13, 95%CI=1.01, 1.26) for each 1 standard deviation (1-SD) increase. We observed no associations between macronutrient intake at lunch or dinner and T2DM. \nConclusions: The study concludes that a breakfast with higher content in carbohydrate at breakfast is correlated with a reduced prevalence of T2DM. While higher lipids intake at breakfast was associated with higher prevalence of T2DM. Furthermore, poor sleep quality is as a potential factor associated with an elevated prevalence of T2DM. Our results emphasize the need for prospective studies to validate and strengthen these observed associations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df854b411c9dc898bc2f88c4833bb0ab1ba3332096f8be12a85eda50b244cbe6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
