{"title":"AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 senses continuous inductive photoperiod in the inflorescence meristem to promote anthesis in chrysanthemum","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4658/7736073?rss=1","date":1724025600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>During the floral transition, many plant species including chrysanthemum (<span>Chrysanthemum morifolium</span>) require continuous photoperiodic stimulation for successful anthesis. Insufficient photoperiodic stimulation results in flower bud arrest or even failure. The molecular mechanisms underlying how continuous photoperiodic stimulation promotes anthesis are not well understood. Here, we reveal that in wild chrysanthemum (<span>Chrysanthemum indicum</span>), an obligate short-day (SD) plant, floral evocation is not limited to SD conditions. However, SD signals generated locally in the inflorescence meristem (IM) play a vital role in ensuring anthesis after floral commitment. Genetic analyses indicate that the florigen FLOWERING LOCUS T-LIKE3 (CiFTL3) plays an important role in floral evocation, but a lesser role in anthesis. Importantly, our data demonstrate that AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (CiAGL24) is a critical component of SD signal perception in the IM to promote successful anthesis, and that floral evocation and anthesis are two separate developmental events in chrysanthemum. We further reveal that the central circadian clock component PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (CiPRR7) in the IM activates <span>CiAGL24</span> expression in response to SD conditions. Moreover, our findings elucidate a negative feedback loop in which CiAGL24 and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (CiSOC1) modulate <span>LEAFY</span> (<span>CiLFY</span>) expression. Together, our results demonstrate that the CiPRR7â€“CiAGL24 module is vital for sustained SD signal perception in the IM to ensure successful anthesis in chrysanthemum.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"898c6f805ab4ee6bffa978abe18f5bf65c9f2c481a3932de22c327c3da82766b","category":"Environment"}
