{"title":"Planning and implementing genetic rescue of an endangered freshwater fish population in a regulated river, where low flow reduces breeding opportunities and may trigger inbreeding depression","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.13679?af=R","date":1712818800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Augmenting depleted genetic diversity can improve the fitness and evolutionary potential of wildlife populations, but developing effective management approaches requires genetically monitored test cases. One such case is the small, isolated and inbred Cotter River population of an endangered Australian freshwater fish, the Macquarie perch <i>Macquaria australasica</i>, which over 3 years (2017–2019) received 71 translocated migrants from a closely related, genetically more diverse population. We used genetic monitoring to test whether immigrants bred, interbred with local fish and augmented population genetic diversity. We also investigated whether levels of river flow affected recruitment, inbreeding depression and juvenile dispersal. Fish length was used to estimate the age, birth year cohort and growth of 524 individuals born between 2016 and 2020 under variable flow conditions. DArT genome-wide genotypes were used to assess individual ancestry, heterozygosity, short-term effective population size and identify parent-offspring and full-sibling families. Of 442 individuals born after translocations commenced, only two (0.45%) were of mixed ancestry; these were half-sibs with one translocated parent in common. Numbers of breeders and genetic diversity for five birth year cohorts of the Cotter River fish were low, especially in low-flow years. Additionally, individuals born in the year of lowest flow evidently suffered from inbreeding depression for juvenile growth. The year of highest flow was associated with the largest number of breeders, lowest inbreeding in the offspring and greatest juvenile dispersal distances. Genetic diversity decreased in the upstream direction, flagging restricted access of breeders to the most upstream breeding sites, exacerbated by low river flow. Our results suggest that the effectiveness of translocations could be increased by focussing on upstream sites and moving more individuals per year; using riverine sources should be considered. Our results indicate that river flow sufficient to facilitate fish movement through the system would increase the number of breeders, promote individuals' growth, reduce inbreeding depression and promote genetic rescue.</p>","author":"Alexandra Pavlova, \nNadja M.
