{"title":"<i>SPOP</i> expression is associated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in pancreatic cancer","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306994","date":1722261600000,"content":"<p>by Xiao Juan Yang, Yong Feng Xu, Qing Zhu</p>\r\nBackground <p>Speckle Type POZ Protein (SPOP), despite its tumor type-dependent role in tumorigenesis, primarily as a tumor suppressor gene is associated with a variety of different cancers. However, its function in pancreatic cancer remains uncertain.</p> Methods <p>SPOP expression and the association between its expression and patient prognosis and immune function were evaluated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), The Tumor Immune Estimation Resource 2.0 (TIMER2.0) database, cBioportal, and various bioinformatic databases. Enrichment analysis of SPOP and the association between SPOP expression with clinical stage and grade were analyzed using the R software package. Then immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to estimate the correlation between SPOP and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patients with pancreatic cancer.</p> Results <p>As part of our study, we assessed that SPOP was anomalously expressed in kinds of cancers, associated with clinical stage and outcomes. Meanwhile, SPOP also played a crucial role in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The expression level of SPOP was significantly correlated to tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) in pancreatic cancer.</p> Conclusions <p>Our study uncovered the potential corrections in SPOP with TICs, suggesting that SPOP may act as a biomarker for immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer.</p>","author":"Xiao Juan Yang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0dc7b7c6c0f7c29a844f243d10132ae0b331d9b169341e543889c03a0a32970f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
