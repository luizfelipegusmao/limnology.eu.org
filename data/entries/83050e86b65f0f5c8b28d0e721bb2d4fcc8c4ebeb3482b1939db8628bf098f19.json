{"title":"Constructing a student development model for undergraduate vocational universities in China using the Fuzzy Delphi Method and Analytic Hierarchy Process","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301017","date":1711116000000,"content":"<p>by Qiaona Xing, Huey Pyng Tan, Su Wan Gan</p>\r\n\r\nAs the industrial structure changes, the severe shortage of high-quality technical and skilled talent in China is one of the most significant factors affecting the high-quality development of China’s economy. Bridging the gap between cultivating talent from new undergraduate vocational universities and the demand for industrial talent is regarded as an efficient strategy to address the talent shortage. In addressing the gap, China is hindered by a lack of clarity regarding student development goals and effective assessment instruments. Thus, this study aimed to use the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to overcome the above challenges. Specifically, we used the FDM to establish a five-level undergraduate vocational education student development model with two 2<sup>nd</sup>-level indicators, three 3<sup>rd</sup>-level indicators, eight 4<sup>th</sup>-level indicators, and 33 5<sup>th</sup>-level indicators to clarify student development goals. Then, the AHP was applied to determine the indicator weights, and a student development assessment instrument was developed to help universities acquire student development data and improve the matching degree between talent supply and demand. This study could help undergraduate vocational universities cultivate high-quality technical and skilled talent quickly to meet the demand for China’s new economic system and to promote industry independence and global competitiveness.","author":"Qiaona Xing","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"83050e86b65f0f5c8b28d0e721bb2d4fcc8c4ebeb3482b1939db8628bf098f19","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
