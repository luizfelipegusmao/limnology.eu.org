{"title":"Residual Disease in a Complicated Case of Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor of the Lung in a Young Adult","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2167/v1","date":1721993794000,"content":"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare soft tissue tumor of mesenchymal origin that most commonly presents in children. IMTs hold non-specific symptoms and radiological features, rendering diagnosis challenging. Presentation: We report a case of a 26-year-old man who was diagnosed at a different center with IMT of the right lower lobe. He underwent lobectomy with a positive gross margin, after which he was referred to our institution for further management, where we performed redo surgery with removal of residual tumor from the bronchial stump. The case presented here shows that interdisciplinary surgical planning is vital to ensure proper detection and successful tumor resection, while highlighting a unique case of recurrence necessitating a redo surgery.Conclusion: IMT is a rare entity in adults presenting with diverse, non-specific symptoms. IMTâ€™s usually follow a favorable prognosis, but behavior may be unpredictable. While uncommon in adults, strong clinical suspicion is warranted. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice and follow up is crucial given the potential for recurrence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"77a926b80f49b44899681c1a6d433cd479571413dac715781eabadf82a1d4266","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
