{"title":"Eddies over Spitsbergen Bank in the Barents Sea from Year-Round Sentinel-1 SAR Observations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0235/v1","date":1714978403000,"content":"Here we compile a detailed record of eddies and examine their intra-annual variability over the Spitsbergen Bank in the northwestern Barents Sea using spaceborne Sentinel-1 A/B synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired in 2018. Analysis of 3070 SAR images enabled to register 1758 eddy manifestations in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and 1631 signatures in the open water (OW). Submesoscale and small mesoscale eddies were observed within a range 0.2-40 km with the range of MIZ eddies being twice larger than that of OW eddies. We note a strong seasonal variability of eddy diameters and the ratio of cyclones to anticyclones. The eddies were present in all seasons showing an approximate parity in eddy generation intensity in the surface layer between winter and summer. The peak eddy activity is observed during the first (January to March) and third (July-September) quarters of the year. A well-pronounced seasonality of SAR-derived eddy intensity correlates with that of eddy kinetic energy in the surface layer of the Eurasian Arctic. Eddies were detected most frequently in Storfjorden, south of Edge Island, near Hopen Island and along the entire eastern flank of the Spitsbergen Bank. Very low eddy activity was observed in the central part of the bank. The MIZ eddies were recorded during eight months of the year peaking in February, and being spatially limited by a 200-m isobath. The OW eddies were widely dispersed across the study domain peaking in August and tending to accumulate in regions of relatively weak surface currents. In summer, about 20-25% of them were observed within the Barents Sea Polar Front.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"943a551ef98d0a2dfc9b635b3eff2fcab0bc5dbbdc8857b70d098fd97db09eb7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
