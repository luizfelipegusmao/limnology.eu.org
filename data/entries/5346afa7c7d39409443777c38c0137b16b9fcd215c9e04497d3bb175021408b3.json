{"title":"Tuberculous Pleural Effusion-Derived Exosomal miR-130-3p and miR-423-5p Promote the Proliferation of Lung Cancer Cells via Cyclin D1","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1198/v1","date":1723776289000,"content":"Epidemiologic studies have shown an association between tuberculosis and lung cancer. The al-tered tumor microenvironment after tuberculosis infection appears to contribute to cancer pro-gression. Pleural effusions are enriched in exosomes, which act as mediators of intercellular communication. We hypothesized that tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE)-derived exosomes mediate intercellular communication. Then we examined the interaction between TPE-derived exosomes and cancer cells. Exosomal miRNA profiling of TPE was performed using a microRNA array. An in vitro lung cancer cell experiment and an in vivo mouse xenograft tumor model were used to evaluate the effects of select exosomal microRNAs. TPE-derived exosome treatment en-hanced the growth of A549 cells both in vitro and in a nude mouse xenograft model. Neighboring cancer cells were observed to take up TPE-derived exosomes, which promoted cancer cell inva-sion. Exosome-mediated transfer of select microRNAs, including miR-130b-3p and miR-423-5p, to A549 lung cancer cells activated cyclin D1 signaling and increased the expression of phos-phorylated p65, a cyclin D1 transcription factor. Inhibitors of miR-130b and miR-423-5p sup-pressed the promotion of lung cancer by TPE derived exosomes and reduced the expression of p65 and cyclin D1. These results suggest that TBE-derived exosomal miRNAs can serve as a novel therapeutic target in tuberculous fibrosis-induced lung cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5346afa7c7d39409443777c38c0137b16b9fcd215c9e04497d3bb175021408b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
