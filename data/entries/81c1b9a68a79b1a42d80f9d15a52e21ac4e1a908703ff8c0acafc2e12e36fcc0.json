{"title":"Nanopatterns on silica scales of Mallomonas (Chrysophyceae, Stramenopiles): Unraveling UV resistance potential and diverse response to UVA and UVB radiation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13496?af=R","date":1726497283000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Mallomonas</i> thrive primarily in freshwaters and dominate plankton communities, especially in oligotrophic waters. The cells have a siliceous cell covering of regularly arranged scales. Despite their ecological importance, the intricate structure and evolutionary significance of their silica scales are still unexplored. We investigated the nanopatterns on the scales and hypothesized that they may play a role in UV shielding. UVA and UVB exposure experiments were performed with 20 <i>Mallomonas</i> species, categorized into four groups based on the nanopattern of the scales (plain-scaled, meshed, striated, and papilliferous group); a fifth group consisted of the species that have extremely thick, robust scales regardless of the nanopattern. We revealed that thick scales were associated with enhanced UVB resistance, suggesting a protective role. No significant differences in UVA response were observed among the groups, except for the meshed group, which showed lower resistance, likely due to the less regular pattern on the shield. In conclusion, the scale case, composed of sufficiently silicified scales, provides effective UV protection in freshwater environments, regardless of the particular nanopattern. In increased UVB radiation, the thickness of the scales plays role. Contrary to expectations, cell size and phylogeny do not strongly predict UV resistance. The study highlights the diverse UV responses of <i>Mallomonas</i>, but further studies are needed to understand the role of scales/nanopatterns in the ecological adaptations of the species.</p>","author":"Yvonne Nemcova, \nPetr Knotek, \nIva Jadrná, \nIvana Černajová, \nPavel Škaloud","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"81c1b9a68a79b1a42d80f9d15a52e21ac4e1a908703ff8c0acafc2e12e36fcc0","category":"Environment"}
