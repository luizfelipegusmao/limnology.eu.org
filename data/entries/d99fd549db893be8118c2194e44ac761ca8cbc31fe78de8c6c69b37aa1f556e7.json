The study aims to investigate SEBT indicators in female representatives of various types of single combats and to identify differences between them. The research was conducted at the Lviv State University of Physical Culture named after Ivan Bobersky, Ukraine in November-December 2023. Female university students aged 18-22 participated in the study: 10 representatives from Kyokushinkai karate, 6 from boxing, 8 from fencing (epee), and 7 from WKF karate. Research methods: analysis of literary sources and materials from the Internet; anthropometry; SEBT; methods of mathematical statistics. The hypothesis of this work is confirmed by the results of the conducted research, which indicates that engaging in a certain type of combat sport has its specific imprint (profile) on the SEBT indicators. The results of the correlations of SEBT indicators in boxing and fencing representatives indirectly indicate the asymmetric impact of these single combats on the arms and legs of a person's body. The SEBT results of Kyokushinkai karate representatives indicate the symmetry and uniform development of the left and right parts of the body. The indicators of the WKF karate representatives occupy an intermediate place in this comparison: the peculiarities of their SEBT indicators show that along with symmetrical manifestations, asymmetric ones are also observed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d99fd549db893be8118c2194e44ac761ca8cbc31fe78de8c6c69b37aa1f556e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
