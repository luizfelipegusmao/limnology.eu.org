{"title":"Utilisation of Liquefied Biomass in Water Co-Electrolysis for the Production of Synthesis Gas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1912/v1","date":1729758530000,"content":"Developed within the scope of a collaborative R&amp;DT project, a 1 kW pilot unit aimed to perform the recovery of previously liquefied biomass from lignocellulosic forest resi-dues, later used as a carbon source in a co-electrolysis process, intended for the pro-duction of synthesis gas (H2, CO, CO2), also known as syngas. The syngas will be trans-formed into other value-added products, namely synthetic biofuels such as methane, methanol or biodiesel. This paper presents the results of the research currently being carried out at ISEL with the objective of further advancing development on the pilot unit by the execution of optimization tests with and without the addition of two dif-ferent biomass types.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa2cec43d926fe13792dc9a7534ed44035cea35fece1d1ec80faf4ce916b5d2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
