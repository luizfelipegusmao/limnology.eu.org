Thus, researching the protein localization, interactions, and structure at the plasma membrane is a vital part of understanding cell biology and medicine. Cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) is uniquely able to study high-resolution protein structure within the cellular environment. One important technical hurdle in cryoET is that the sample needs to be thin (&lt;200 nm). Mammalian cells, usually over 2 Î¼m thick, are either imaged at their naturally thin projections or thinned using time-consuming and technically demanding cryo-sectioning or focused ion beam milling. Here, we develop an efficient correlative cryoET pipeline for studying protein structure and organization on isolated plasma membranes. Isolated plasma membranes are obtained with a technique known as cellular unroofing, where the plasma membrane is physically adhered to a surface and the rest of the cell is removed with sheering force. We optimize and characterize unroofing strategies to isolate both basal and apical plasma membranes on Quantifoil perforated carbon film covered grids. Using platinum replica electron microscopy to analyze the resulting isolated membranes, we quantify differences between the apical and basal preparations. Further, we describe correlative imaging schemes that complement cryoET of isolated plasma membranes. These allow localization of a protein of interest to within 20 nm. We also test the resolution capability of the system by performing subtomogram averaging on the well-characterized 80S ribosome, which is resolved to sub-nanometer resolution. The overall goal of this research is to present an efficient generalized tool that can be used to study the structure and organization of plasma membrane proteins [<a href=\"#ozae044.1032-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0525527844ab5940fc6a02744c8b00b577e253782c08941a486f398ca570bf74","category":"Environment"}
