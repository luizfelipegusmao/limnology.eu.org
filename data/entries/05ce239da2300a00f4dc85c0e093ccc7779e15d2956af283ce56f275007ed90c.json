{"title":"Epigenetic Landscape of DNA Methylation in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0155/v1","date":1725349117000,"content":"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, characterized by its aggressive progression and dismal prognosis. Advances in epigenetic profiling, specifically DNA methylation analysis, have significantly deepened our understanding of PDAC pathogenesis. This review synthesizes findings from recent genome-wide DNA methylation studies, notably those by Espinet et al. and Wang et al., which have delineated a complex DNA methylation landscape differentiating between normal and cancerous pancreatic tissues, as well as across various stages and molecular subtypes of PDAC. These studies identified specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that not only enhance our grasp of the epigenetic drivers of PDAC but also offer potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis, enabling the customization of therapeutic approaches. The review further explores how DNA methylation profiling could facilitate the development of subtype-tailored therapies, potentially improving treatment outcomes based on precise molecular characterizations. Overall, leveraging DNA methylation alterations as functional biomarkers holds promise for advancing our understanding of disease progression and refining PDAC management strategies, which could lead to improved patient outcomes and a deeper comprehension of the diseaseâ€™s underlying biological mechanisms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05ce239da2300a00f4dc85c0e093ccc7779e15d2956af283ce56f275007ed90c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
