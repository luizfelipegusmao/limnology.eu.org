{"title":"A 2‐Step Modified Delay and Doppler Profiler Based ICI Can‐Celing OFDM Receiver for Underwater Multi‐Path Channel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0480/v1","date":1720174505000,"content":"In 2023, we proposed the modified Delay and Doppler Profiler (mDDP) as an inter-carrier interference (ICI) countermeasure for underwater acoustic OFDM mobile communications in a multipath environment. However, the performance improvement in computer simulation and pool experiments was not significant. In a subsequent study, the accuracy of the Channel Transfer Function (CTF), which is the input for the mDDP channel parameter estimation, was considered insufficient. Then a 2-step mDDP was devised. This paper presents simulations of underwater OFDM communications using 1- to 3-step mDDPs. The simulation conditions are a two-wave multipath environment where the receiving transducer moves at a speed of 0.3 m/sec and is subjected to a Doppler shift in the opposite direction. As NumCOL, the number of taps in the multi-tap equalizer which removes ICI, was increased, Bit Error Rate (BER) of 0.016 at NumCOL = 1 was significantly reduced by a factor of approximately 40 to BER of 0.00041 at NumCOL = 41 for the 2-step mDDP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7abebe0821accedabe1dfdef2e1f06871f6489edb1d4f2a7f83b812698aa036","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
