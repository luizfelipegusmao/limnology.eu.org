{"title":"Building a more engaged scientist from the bottom up: The impact of public engagement training on undergraduate students","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302671","date":1714485600000,"content":"<p>by Nikole D. Patson, Laura Wagner</p>\r\n\r\nEngaging with the public is increasingly seen as an important role of scientists. Despite that, few opportunities exist for undergraduate students to receive training in engaging with the public about science. Thus, little is known about the impact of such training on students. The goal of the current study was to investigate the impact of public engagement training on participants in a summer program for undergraduates that provides training in both research and engagement activities. The results of our interviews suggest that providing opportunities for undergraduates to engage with the public (1) has many personal, academic, and career benefits for students; (2) increases participantsâ€™ interest in public engagement; and (3) may contribute to helping students develop and maintain an identity as scientists. Importantly, students from minoritized racial groups may be even more impacted by this experience. These data suggest that early experiences with public engagement may not only be an important way to increase the number of publicly engaged scientists but may also broaden participation in science.","author":"Nikole D.
