A positive climate response influences the adaptive capacity of farmers which was measured using the sustainable livelihood capitals as a standard base. Rural women are particularly important to this study due to the significant role they play in food security and livelihood sustenance especially at the grassroots. The study zoomed into two unique districts in two different agroecological zones in Ghana (East Gonja and Dormaa East). It was found that respondents possess a moderate scale adaptive capacity at 0.405. Distinctively, Dormaa East had a higher adaptive capacity (0.422) as compared with East Gonja (0.388); mostly due to geographical and socio-cultural dynamics that influence rights, access and ownership. Climate information mediums except the Television; and climate action (mitigation and adaptation) were found to have a significant drive on the adaptive capacity of rural women farmer at <i>p</i>-values less than 0.5. However, the integration of both traditional and modern Information Communication Technology mediums, addressing socio-cultural dynamics that limit access to women and harnessing co-benefit practices that incorporates both mitigation and adaption actions is recommended.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Gender-differentiated roles, responsibilities, access, rights, and knowledge gaps shape women's vulnerability to climate change. This is especially critical for women farmers whose livelihoods are climate-dependent. A key component in building women farmers’ resilience to climate change is deepening their adaptive capacity. Therefore, this research sought to measure the adaptive capacity of women farmers from two unique districts of Ghana using the sustainable livelihood capitals and investigate how access to climate information and the uptake of climate action can influence women's adaptive capacity. Rural women farmers (<i>n</i> = 497) were interviewed through a survey and supported with key informant interviews from six agricultural staff at the selected districts. The adaptive capacity of respondents was rated moderate at 0.405. Differences between the adaptive capacity of women from different agroecological zones (Dormaa East—0.422; East Gonja—0.388) were statistically insignificant (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). All climate information mediums except the TV medium had a significant prediction on women farmers’ adaptive capacity. The odds of a decreasing relationship of predictor variables, such as extension officer medium, radio, and adaptation action, require strategic structuring to accrue holistic benefit. The study thus recommends deepening women's benefit from extension services by attracting and retaining female extensionists, while training extensionists on tailored techniques for engaging female farmers. Again, extensionists who report high outreach to female farmers should be incentivized. Traditional and modern Information and Communication Technology mediums must be explored and integrated as alternatives. Co-benefit practices for both adaptation and mitigation should be encouraged among women farmers to deepen climate action.</p>","author":"Amma Birago Kantanka Gyimah, \nPhilip Antwi‐Agyei, \nGifty Adom‐Asamoah, \nFrank Baffour‐Ata","siteTitle":"Wiley: Climate Resilience and Sustainability: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e7509a6a763a901e53649c0568b0f7267c6e779cdc08f41bb80af5ed2bfb3753","entryHash":"c62b871f490f0fc9bbbd5f3a5801480129391eabf97ea023f098fe075a5b440b","category":"Environment"}
