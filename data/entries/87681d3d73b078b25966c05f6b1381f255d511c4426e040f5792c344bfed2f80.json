{"title":"Anatomical Characteristics of Cervicomedullary Compression on MRI Scans in Children with Achondroplasia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0453/v1","date":1728295998000,"content":"This retrospective study assessed anatomical characteristics of cervicomedullary compression in children with achondroplasia. Twelve anatomical parameters were analyzed (foramen magnum diameter and area; myelon area; clivus length; tentorium and occipital angles; brainstem volume outside the posterior fossa; and posterior fossa, cerebellum, supratentorial ventricular system, intracranial cerebrospinal fluid, and fourth ventricle volumes) from sagittal and transversal T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 37 children with achondroplasia aged ≤ 4 years (median [range] 0.8 [0.1–3.6] years) and compared with scans from 37 children without achondroplasia (median age 1.5 [0–3.9] years). Mann-Whitney U testing was used for between-group comparisons. Foramen magnum diameter and area were significantly smaller in children with achondroplasia compared with the reference group (mean 10.0 vs. 16.1 mm [p &amp;lt; 0.001] and 109.0 vs. 160.8 mm2 [p = 0.005], respectively). The tentorial angle was also steeper in children with achondroplasia (mean 47.6 vs. 38.1 degrees; p &amp;lt; 0.001), while the clivus was significantly shorter (mean 23.5 vs. 30.3 mm; p &amp;lt; 0.001). Significant differences were also observed in myelon area, occipital angle, fourth ventricle, intracranial cerebrospinal fluid and supratentorial ventricular volumes, and the volume of brainstem protruding beyond the posterior fossa (all p &amp;lt; 0.05). MRI analysis of brain structures may provide a standardized value to indicate decompression surgery in children with achondroplasia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"87681d3d73b078b25966c05f6b1381f255d511c4426e040f5792c344bfed2f80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
