{"title":"Soil Water Flow Affected by Vegetation Root Water Uptake in the Semiarid Region of Mu Us Sandy Land, China","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2715?af=R","date":1727235197000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Vegetation plays an important role in the management of water resources and of the terrestrial vegetation degradation in semiarid regions of China. Detailed descriptions of the actual hydrological process of vegetation root water uptake (<i>RWU</i>) are lacking, and the dynamics of interfaces involved in the process of <i>RWU</i> have not received enough attention. A field in situ experiment with bare land and vegetated land was implemented to investigate soil water flow in vadose zones affected by vegetation <i>RWU</i>. The results revealed that, with the influence of <i>RWU</i>, the soil moisture content was redistributed and impacted evaporation and infiltration; therefore, even the roots were driven to utilize groundwater under intense potential evapotranspiration and water stress. Notably, the thicker vadose zones were beneficial for preserving water resources for bare land, but <i>Salix</i> reduced soil water storage by 1191.13 L compared with bare land, which was adverse for water resource development in semiarid regions. The results provide the basis for the protection of the vegetation environment and water resource management in arid regions.</p>","author":"Ming Zhao, \nJiaqi Liu, \nYifan Ma, \nShuxuan Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"3376af8e8a2a04f09cc5cea42db9bfadc2187fc88477129dccdcdcea85336c83","category":"Environment"}
