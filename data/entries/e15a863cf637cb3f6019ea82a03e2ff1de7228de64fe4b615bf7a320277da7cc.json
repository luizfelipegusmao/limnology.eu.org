{"title":"Existence and Nonexistence of Positive Solutions for Semilinear Elliptic Equations Involving Hardy-Sobolev Critical Exponents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1680/v1","date":1711548458000,"content":"In this paper, a class of semi-linear elliptic equations involving\nHardy-Sobolev critical exponents has been investigated. This problem comes\nfrom the consideration of standing waves in the anisotropic Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation, also it is very important in the field of hydrodynamics,\nglaciology, quantum field theory and statistical mechanics. By a detailed\nestimation for the extremum function and using Mountain Pass Lemma with $%\n\\left( PS\\right) _{c}$ conditions, the existence of positive solutions has\nbeen obtained. On the other hand, by establishing Pohozaev-type identity and\nusing the properties of Bessel function, the nonexistence of positive\nsolution also has been obtained. These results are extensions of E.\nJannelli's research (\\cite[Theorem 1.A-1.C]{EJ}).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e15a863cf637cb3f6019ea82a03e2ff1de7228de64fe4b615bf7a320277da7cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
