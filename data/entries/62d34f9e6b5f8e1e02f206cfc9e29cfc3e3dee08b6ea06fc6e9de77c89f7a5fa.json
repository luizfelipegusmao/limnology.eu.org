{"title":"Nurturing Sustainability in Toddlerhood: Investigating Early Childhood Teachers&#039; Views and Daily Practices in a Swedish Preschool","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1744/v1","date":1729609542000,"content":"Background/Objectives: While studies suggest that young children can learn and think about sustainability, most research has focused on children aged three to five, leaving a significant gap in understanding how to engage toddlers (under three) in early childhood education for sustainability (ECEfS). This study aims to address this gap, a crucial and often overlooked area, by investigating early childhood teachers' perceptions of ECEfS and their pedagogical practices for nurturing sustainability in a toddler group in a Swedish preschool.\nMethods: The study employed a case study approach, incorporating observations, interviews, and document analysis for data collection. Qualitative techniques were used for data analysis. The research was conducted with a strong commitment to ethical considerations, including obtaining participants' consent, ensuring confidentiality and privacy, informing them of their right to withdraw, and maintaining anonymity.\nResults: The findings of this study bring hope. They indicate that teachers understand education for sustainability and can implement sustainability-related pedagogical practices in a toddler group. They can create suitable learning environments and establish connections between sustainability issues and daily life activities in the classroom, enhancing the children's overall learning experience.\nConclusions: The study's findings underscore the pivotal role of educators in shaping the mindsets and behaviors of future generations, thereby supporting the long-term goals of sustainable development. By nurturing toddlers' innate curiosity and harnessing their brain's plasticity, educators can effectively engage toddlers in ECEfS and promote sustainable development from an early age. The study's implications highlight the need to prioritize ECEfS during toddlerhood to realize the full potential of this critical investment in the future of our planet.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62d34f9e6b5f8e1e02f206cfc9e29cfc3e3dee08b6ea06fc6e9de77c89f7a5fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
