{"title":"Digestibility of starch","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0006/v1","date":1714527235000,"content":"Rapidly digestible starch can be obtained by gelatinization (cooking), cooking extrusion, use of small granule starch, breaking down starch granules, or by hydrolysis to maltodextrins. Resistant starch includes five groups: the first group is physically encapsulated starch within a food/polymer matrix, the second one is some native starch, the third one is recrystallized starch, the fourth one is chemically modified starch, and the fifth one is starch-lipid complexes. Starch digestion in the human body is also influenced by the degree of chewing, activity of Î±-amylase in the intestine, and transit time through the stomach and small intestine. \nResistant starch or dietary fiber (DF) enriches specific bacterial groups located in the large intes-tine. They produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and gases, causes the lowering of the pH, and inhibits pathogens. SCFAs are considered endogenous signaling molecules, acting through their free fatty-acid receptors 2 and 3 which can trigger the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide PYY, being released together following a meal to mediate postprandial satiety. A sufficient intake of DF reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, hyperten-sion, colorectal cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Gluten matrix or phenolic compounds can lead to a low digestion rate of starch.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd15e51e97e4443a9ecc8d2d0beaee1c61c68b7a114af81aadc87f616fd01f3a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
