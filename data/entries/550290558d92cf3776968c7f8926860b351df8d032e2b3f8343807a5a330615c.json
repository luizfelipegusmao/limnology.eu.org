{"title":"Prevalence of Lower Back Pain and Risk Factors in Equestrians: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0544/v1","date":1728375897000,"content":"This systematic review assessed the prevalence of lower back pain (LBP) in equestrian athletes (EA), using PRISMA guidelines. Observational studies published between 2004 and 2024 in English, Portuguese, Spanish, and German were included. The review identified relevant studies through EBSCO, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS (last search 30 August 2024), yielding 14 studies with a total of 4,527 participants. PEO of included studies: population comprised EA, exposure was equestrian sports (ES), and the outcome was LBP. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Observation Study Quality Evaluation tool, and six studies were deemed high-quality. LBP prevalence in EA was higher than in the general and athlete population, with point prevalence ranging from 27.9% to 87.9%. Sport-specific factors, including workload and stable duties, were significant risk factors. Methodological inconsistencies, such as varying definitions of LBP and a lack of standardized exposure assessment, and overall low quality of studies, limited the comparability of findings. This review underscores the need for more high-quality research and tailored interventions addressing both riding and off-horse activities in EA. The review was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024568577), and the study was funded by the Comprehensive Health Research Centre, Ã‰vora University.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"550290558d92cf3776968c7f8926860b351df8d032e2b3f8343807a5a330615c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
