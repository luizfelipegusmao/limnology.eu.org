Adjusted killer whale stable isotope (SI) values primarily overlapped with several species of North Atlantic baleen whales or tuna. Amino acid (AA)-specific δ<sup>15</sup>N values indicated the ECA killer whales fed primarily on marine mammals, having similar glutamic acid δ<sup>15</sup>N–phenylalanine δ<sup>15</sup>N (δ<sup>15</sup>N<sub>Glx-Phe</sub>) and threonine δ<sup>15</sup>N (δ<sup>15</sup>N<sub>Thr</sub>) as mammal-eating killer whales from the eastern North Pacific (ENP) that served as a comparative framework. However, one ECA whale grouped with the fish-eating ENP ecotype based δ<sup>15</sup>N<sub>Thr</sub>.\n\nDistinctive essential AA δ<sup>13</sup>C of ECA killer whale groups, along with bulk SI similarity to killer whales from different regions of the North Atlantic, indicates different populations converge in Arctic waters from a broad source area. Generalist diet and long-distance dispersal capacity favour range expansions, and integration of these insights will be critical for assessing ecological impacts of increasing killer whale predation pressure on Arctic-endemic species.\n</p>","author":"Cory J.
