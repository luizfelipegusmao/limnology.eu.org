{"title":"Long-Term Effects of Nitrogen Sources on Yields, Nitrogen Use Efficiencies, and Soil of Tilled, Irrigated Corn","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1237/v2","date":1729234684000,"content":"Although corn is the most important and nitrogen (N)-fertilized crop, there is a lack of long-term data on the effects of organic and inorganic N fertilizer on N balance and losses for corn systems under different tillage systems. From 2012 to 2023 we assessed the effects of N sources on grain yields from cultivated continuous corn receiving irrigation at a site with minimal erosion in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA, and compared these effects to no-till (NT) and strip till (ST) systems receiving inorganic N. An N balance accounting for N and carbon (C) sequestration found a system nitrogen use efficiency (NUESys) for organic N fertilizer (manure) with tillage of 86.3%, which was higher than the NUESys of 60.2% with inorganic N fertilizer (enhanced efficiency fertilizer, EEF). Conventional tillage with manure use is a good management practice that contributed to higher grain yields (2 of 11 yr.), C sequestration (P&lt;0.05), soil organic N content (P&lt;0.05), and soil phosphorus (P) content than inorganic N fertilizer with tillage (P&lt;0.05). Tilled systems, whether receiving organic or inorganic N fertilizer, had higher yields and grain N content than NT and ST systems receiving inorganic N fertilizer (P&lt;0.05). The grain production of the cultivated system receiving organic N fertilizer did not decrease with time, while the yields of the cultivated system receiving inorganic N fertilizer decreased with time (P&lt;0.05), suggesting that cultivated systems receiving organic N fertilizer may be more sustainable and better able to adapt to a changing climate. Additionally, a combination of manure (30% of N input) with EEF (70% of N input) contributed to a synergistic effect that increased agronomic productivity (harvested grain yields).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e675eefb861882c22864fbb41148e1a53cbec4ea89e053a2fc76346a1fe7767","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
