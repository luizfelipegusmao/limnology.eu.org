{"title":"Plant Transcriptomic Responses in a Diverse Organ and Stress Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1654/v1","date":1711523838000,"content":"Plant transcriptomes are an extremely dynamic entities shaped spatially and temporally by many intracellular and environmental cues. In this review, we first summarize the complexity and diversity of plant genomes and transcriptomes as a start point for the multitude of transcriptomic responses. Numerous alterations within various tissue and organ-specific transcriptomes as well as the most relevant transcriptomic responses associated with plant acclimation to selected abiotic and biotic stress conditions, from the current studies employing high-throughput transcriptomic analysis are widely discussed. Understanding changes within plant transcriptomes, revealed by in silico functional analysis, allows for the characterization of stress-affected genes and stress acclimatory mechanisms, as well as allows to perform plant metabolic engineering. The latter allow cultivars to produce more secondary metabolites in the future, which are often desirable substances in the biomedical industry. Accordingly, in this review special attention was also paid to characterize the potential of transcriptomic analyses of medicinal species, particularly to search for new cultivars. Extensive characterization of transcriptomic responses in stress would also result in the development of new cultivars that display physiological and molecular mechanisms that allow them to cope with adverse environmental conditions more adequately.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4060ab89e3030530efb47417722e6be4150cead47d080cc1b591b319a83b0c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
