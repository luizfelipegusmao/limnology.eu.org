{"title":"On proving an Inequality of Ramanujan using Explicit Order Estimates of the Mertens Function","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0759/v1","date":1720534932000,"content":"This research article provides an unconditional proof of an inequality proposed by \\textit{Srinivasa Ramanujan} involving the Prime Counting Function $\\pi(x)$,      \\begin{align*}             (\\pi(x))^{2}&lt;\\frac{ex}{\\log x}\\pi\\left(\\frac{x}{e}\\right)     \\end{align*} for every real $x\\geq \\exp(1486)$, using specific order estimates of the \\textit{Mertens Function}, $M(x)$. The proof primarily hinges upon investigating the underlying relation between $M(x)$ and the \\textit{Second Chebyshev Function}, $\\psi(x)$, in addition to applying the meromorphic properties of the \\textit{Riemann Zeta Function}, $\\zeta(s)$ with an intention of deriving an improved approximation for $\\pi(x)$.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e1434fc1a1875d2a7d20c6ea45101d7e60b37b9008de8ca9013080459ef59539","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
