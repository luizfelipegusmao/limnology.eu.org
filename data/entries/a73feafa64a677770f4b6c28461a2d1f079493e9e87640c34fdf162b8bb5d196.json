The different techniques differ in scale and resolution, but may also yield significantly different strain values. This study, for example, clearly established that high-resolution electron backscattered diffraction (HR-EBSD) and high-resolution transmission Kikuchi diffraction (HR-TKD) [sensitive to changes in interplanar angle (Δθθ)], provide quantitatively higher residual strains than micro-Laue XRD and transmission electron microscope (TEM) based precession electron diffraction (PED) [sensitive to changes in interplanar spacing (Δdd)]. Even after correcting key known factors affecting the accuracy of HR-EBSD strain measurements, a scaling factor of ∼1.57 (between HR-EBSD and micro-Laue) emerged. We have then conducted “virtual” experiments by systematically deforming an ideal lattice by either changing an interplanar angle (<span>α</span>) or a lattice parameter (<span>a</span>). The patterns were kinematically and dynamically simulated, and corresponding strains were measured by HR-EBSD. These strains showed consistently higher values for lattice(s) distorted by <span>α</span>, than those altered by <span>a</span>. The differences in strain measurements were further emphasized by mapping identical location with HR-TKD and TEM-PED. These measurements exhibited different spatial resolution, but when scaled (with ∼1.57) provided similar lattice distortions numerically.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a73feafa64a677770f4b6c28461a2d1f079493e9e87640c34fdf162b8bb5d196","category":"Environment"}
