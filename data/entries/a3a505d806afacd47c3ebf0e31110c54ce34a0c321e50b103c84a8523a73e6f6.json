These reports led to the theory that a loss of function on the language side of the brain can result in changes of ability to draw and/or to paint. Further, the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (l-pMTG) has been revealed to contribute to the higher control semantic mechanisms with objects recognition and integration of visual information, within a widely distributed network of the left hemisphere. Nevertheless, the theory has not been fully studied in neural bases. The aim of this study is to examine role of the l-pMTG on shape recognition and its reconstruction within drawing behavior, by using a combining method of the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Eighteen healthy participants received a low frequency inhibitory rTMS to their l-pMTG during the drawing task of the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT). There was a significant decrease of the mean accuracy of reproductions in the Complex designs of the BVRT, compared to the Simple and Medium designs. The fNIRS data showed strong negative correlations with the results of the BVRT. Though our hypothesis had a contradiction that rTMS would have inhibited the brain activity in the stimulated site, the results suggest that shape recognition and its reconstruction such as the BVRT require neural activations of the l-TL as well as that of the l-pMTG.","author":"Nakako Okamoto","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a3a505d806afacd47c3ebf0e31110c54ce34a0c321e50b103c84a8523a73e6f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
