{"title":"Stakeholder Engagement and its Impact on Supply Chain Sustainability in the Context of Renewable Energy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0080/v1","date":1717409486000,"content":"This study explores the role of stakeholder engagement in enhancing supply chain sustainability within the renewable energy sector. Through a qualitative research approach, including in-depth interviews with key stakeholders such as government agencies, industry associations, renewable energy companies, community groups, and environmental organizations, the research reveals the complexity and significance of effective stakeholder engagement. Stakeholders highlighted diverse motivations, including environmental, social, economic, and regulatory concerns, driving their participation. The study underscores the importance of tailored engagement strategies that recognize stakeholder heterogeneity and address specific needs and expectations. Collaborative approaches, such as public-private partnerships and multi-stakeholder initiatives, were identified as crucial for pooling resources, sharing knowledge, and addressing common challenges. However, challenges related to power imbalances, conflicting interests, and communication barriers were also noted. Government policies and regulatory frameworks were found to play a pivotal role in shaping stakeholder engagement practices and sustainability outcomes. Regulatory uncertainty and inconsistency were cited as significant concerns that could undermine sustainability initiatives. Community engagement emerged as a critical factor, with local communities often directly impacted by renewable energy projects. Meaningful engagement, including consultation and benefit-sharing mechanisms, is essential for building trust and securing social acceptance. Emotional intelligence and marketing strategies were recognized as important tools for effective stakeholder engagement, emphasizing the role of empathy, active listening, and clear communication. The findings of this study highlight the need for a holistic and integrated approach to stakeholder engagement and supply chain sustainability in the renewable energy sector. By addressing diverse stakeholder needs, fostering collaboration, and aligning policies with sustainability goals, stakeholders can work together to accelerate the transition towards a more sustainable energy future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c423bed8326649c11732cb48e89ac30074ab10a936c128913aff2ee6ef37bd2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
