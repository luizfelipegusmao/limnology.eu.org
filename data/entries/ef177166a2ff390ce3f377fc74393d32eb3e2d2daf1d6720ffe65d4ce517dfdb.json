{"title":"Investigating the Spatial Pattern of White Oak (Quercus alba L.) Mortality across the Eastern United States","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2034/v1","date":1724840145000,"content":"White oak mortality is a significant concern in forest ecosystems due to its impact on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Understanding the factors influencing white oak mortality is crucial for effective forest management and conservation efforts. In this study, we aimed to investigate the spatial pattern of white oak mortality rates at different locations of the eastern US and explore the underlying processes involved with the spatial distribution patterns. Multicycle Forest Inventory and Analysis data were compiled to capture white oak plots across the eastern US. White oak mortality data were collected across plot systems that utilized Diameter at Breast Height between two periods. Ripleyâ€™s K function was used to study the spatial pattern of white oak mortality rate. Results found clustered patterns at both local and broad scales and random patterns at broad scales only across the southern and northern regions. However, the central region indicated both clustered and random patterns at local scale only. We found uniform patterns at a broad scale across all regions. Our findings demonstrated the importance of the spatial pattern of the white oak mortality rate and the underlying factors associated with it. This research can inform forest management practices for the conservation of white oak populations at varying scales. Future research is needed for a comprehensive assessment of biotic and abiotic factors for forest management strategies at various spatial scales aimed at mitigating white oak mortality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef177166a2ff390ce3f377fc74393d32eb3e2d2daf1d6720ffe65d4ce517dfdb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
