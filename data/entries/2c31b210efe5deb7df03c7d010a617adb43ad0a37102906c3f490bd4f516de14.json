{"title":"Factors Associated With Complications of Snakebite Envenomation in Health Facilities in the Cascades Region of Burkina Faso, 2016 to 2021","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0577/v1","date":1718088530000,"content":"Snakebite envenomation remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in rural populations. This study aimed to identify factors associated with complications from snakebite envenomation reported in health facilities in the Cascades region of Burkina Faso. This cross-sectional study used routine data of patients admitted for snakebite envenomation in five health facilities between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2021. Data were collected on sociodemographic, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics of patients showing signs of envenomation. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with complications. Among the 846 patients with envenomation, 355 (42%) experienced complications. Local complications at the bite site included wounds (21.5%) and skin necrosis (12.5%). Systemic complications included hemorrhage (30.5%), shock (16.3%), and coma (4.3%), with a mortality rate of 3.2%. Factors significantly associated with complications were rural residence (AOR: 4.80; 95% CI: 2.21-11.4), incision at the bite site (AOR: 4.31; 95% CI: 2.51-7.52), tourniquet application (AOR: 5.52; 95% CI: 1.42-30.8), bleeding (AOR: 14.2; 95% CI: 8.80-23.4), abnormal vital signs (AOR: 14.3; 95% CI: 9.22-22.7), and non-administration of antivenom serum (AOR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.8-4.8). These findings highlight the importance of antivenom availability and public awareness to reduce complications from snakebite envenomation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c31b210efe5deb7df03c7d010a617adb43ad0a37102906c3f490bd4f516de14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
