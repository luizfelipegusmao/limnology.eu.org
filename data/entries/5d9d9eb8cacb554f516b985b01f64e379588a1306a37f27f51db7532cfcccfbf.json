{"title":"Understanding the Structural Ballet of Cellulose Formation – Using CryoEM to Reveal the Role of Protein Flexibility on Higher-order Oligomer Formation, Glucan Catalysis, and Cellulose Microfibril Extrusion","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.341/7720441?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Cellulose microfibrils constitute a major scaffolding component in plant cell walls. These microfibrils are formed by cellulose synthase complex (CSC) rosettes that are a hexamer of cellulose synthase (CesA) trimers. CesA is a membrane-embedded protein that utilizes UDP-glucose as a substrate to catalytically form β-1,4-glucan linkages [<a href=\"#ozae044.341-B1\">1</a>]. Two areas of cellulose formation are not well understood. First, the mechanism of CesA self-assembly into CSC rosettes and, second, the integration of glucan catalysis with chain extrusion and microfiber coalescence. It is believed both are mediated by an interplay of flexible regions, two of which are the class-specific region (CSR) and the N-terminal region (NTD). This work uses moss CesA protein (<span>Physcomitrium patens –</span> PpCesA5) to shed light on rosette formation and the linkage/extrusion phenomenon. We are the first to show a ‘strand-turn-strand’ motif, originally predicted by AlphaFold2 [<a href=\"#ozae044.341-B2\">2</a>] and verified in the 3Å cryoEM structure, in the initial 20 residues of the typically disordered NTD (Figure 1). This motif is predicted for other cellulose synthase proteins in plants (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span> – CesA1, CesA6, CesA7) and bacteria (<span>Komagataeibacter hansenii</span> – CesD), which suggests a conserved structural feature. We will present data that shows the NTD could act as a tethering pin to promote the assembly of CesA lobes, rosettes, and planar arrays (Figure 2). We will also show how SPA cryoEM data and motion-based deep neural network models for data processing (3DFlex) [<a href=\"#ozae044.341-B3\">3</a>] reveal the inherent flexibility throughout the CesA trimer structure critical for function and ion coordination for complex stability (Figure 3). Furthermore, this flexibility throughout the CesA trimer plays a role in glucan chain catalysis and extrusion (Figure 3). Finally, we will show the power of coupling orthogonal structural methods (analytical ultra-centrifugation – AUC and small angle x-ray/neutron scattering -SAX/NS) to understand the function of large, dynamic macromolecular machines (Figure 4). Given that cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer on the planet, this work on cellulose microfibril formation could impact areas of research as diverse as biofuel feedstocks to environmentally conscious construction [<a href=\"#ozae044.341-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5d9d9eb8cacb554f516b985b01f64e379588a1306a37f27f51db7532cfcccfbf","category":"Environment"}
