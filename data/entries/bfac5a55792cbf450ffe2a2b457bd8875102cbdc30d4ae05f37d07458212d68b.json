{"title":"Exploring correlations: Human seminal plasma and blood serum biochemistry in relation to semen quality","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305861","date":1719237600000,"content":"<p>by Sylwia Płaczkowska, Kamil Rodak, Agnieszka Kmieciak, Iwona Gilowska, Ewa Maria Kratz</p>\r\n\r\nMale infertility is a pressing global issue, prompting the need for biomarkers correlating with seminal parameters for diagnosis. Our study investigated 10 biochemical and energetic parameters in the seminal plasma and blood sera of fertile (25 subjects) and infertile (88 subjects) Polish men, correlations between their levels in seminal plasma and semen quality, and correlations between blood sera and seminal plasma levels of examined parameters. Infertile men displayed elevated seminal plasma glucose and fructose but reduced HDL levels compared to fertile men. We observed also weak negative correlations between seminal plasma triglycerides and sperm concentration in both groups. Moreover, infertile men exhibited positive correlations between seminal plasma HDL/LDL concentrations and sperm concentration. Fertile men showed moderate negative correlations between glucose/triglycerides concentrations and sperm count and between seminal plasma triglycerides levels and sperm vitality. Semen volume correlated with triglycerides (negative) and fructose (positive) concentrations in infertile men. Sperm motility correlated negatively with total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides concentrations in fertile men, and weakly with AMP-activated protein kinase in infertile men. Weak negative correlations between seminal plasma fructose/AMP-activated protein kinase concentrations and sperm progressive motility were observed in infertile men, whereas in fertile men seminal plasma AMP-activated protein kinase levels were positively correlated with progressive motility. Correlation analysis between blood serum and seminal plasma parameters revealed intriguing connections, notably regarding LDL, AMP-activated protein kinase, and carnitine, suggesting systemic influences on seminal plasma composition. These findings emphasize the complex interplay between metabolic factors and sperm parameters, offering promising directions for future research in male infertility diagnostics and therapeutics.","author":"Sylwia Płaczkowska","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bfac5a55792cbf450ffe2a2b457bd8875102cbdc30d4ae05f37d07458212d68b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
