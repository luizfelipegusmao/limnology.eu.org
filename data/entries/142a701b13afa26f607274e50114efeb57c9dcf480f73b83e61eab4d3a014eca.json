{"title":"Biodegradable microplastics interaction with pollutants and their potential toxicity for aquatic biota: a review","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10311-024-01703-9","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The global plastic production has steadily increased from 1.7 million tons in 1950 to over 400 million tons in 2022, with about 60% of plastic ultimately ending up in landfills and oceans. There is also growing evidence that microplastics exert negative effects on biota and ecosystems. Biodegradable plastics may represent a safe alternative, yet their potential adverse effects have not been comprehensively analyzed. Here, we reviewed biodegradable plastics, with focus on their conversion into microplastics, their interactions with pollutants, and their combined toxicity for aquatic biota. Biodegradable plastics include polylactic acid, polyhydroxyalkanoates, polybutylene succinate, poly(butylene adipate-<em>co</em>-terephthalate), and poly(ε-caprolactone). We found that some biobased plastics are hardly biodegradable. Some biobased plastics are compostable but require specific environmental conditions for their biodegradation. Biobased plastics can generate microplastics when released into the environment, which can impact biota. Contrary to the common public belief, biodegradable plastics may not only originate from biosources but can be synthesized from fossil fuels. Microplastics originating from biodegradable plastics can interact with pollutants, adsorbing and transporting these pollutants, resulting in synergistic or antagonistic effects on exposed organisms. Biofilm formation on microplastics impacts their degradation and pollutant interactions.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"142a701b13afa26f607274e50114efeb57c9dcf480f73b83e61eab4d3a014eca","category":"Environment"}
