{"title":"Automatic Spraying Modulated Rumen Fermentation and Microbiota and Alleviated Adverse Effects of Heat Stress on Cows","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1215/v1","date":1718700995000,"content":"(1) Background: Heat stress detrimentally restricted the economic in dairy farming production, therefore, this study was designed to investigate how automatic spraying method on alleviating heat stress on cows. (2) Methods: A total of 1208 multiparous dairy cows were randomly allocated into 6 barns, three barns were equipped with automatic sprinklers (SP), each barn was considered as a replicate. The other three barns were considered as control treatments (CON). Each barn was considered as a replicate. (3) Results: body temperature and milk somatic cell count were significantly decreased, while DMI, milk yield, and milk fat content significantly increased with spraying treatment. ICR was improved from 30% to 35%. Rumen fermentation was enhanced by the increased levels of total VFA, acetate, propionate, and butyrate with the spraying treatment. Rumen microbiota results showed at the phylum level, rumen Fibrobacters abundance significantly increased by the spraying treatment. At the genus level, Eubacterium, Shuttleworthia, Saccharofermentans, Lachnospira, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Selenomonas, and Succinivibrio abundance were significantly increased, while Ruminococcaceae and Rikenellaceae abundance were significantly decreased in the rumen with spraying treatment. (4) Conclusion: this study demonstrated automatic spraying modulated the rumen microbiota composition and fermentation function, and effectively meliorated side-effects of heat stress on dairy cows.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd1195e1a191a5f965f7325c229d89e0d3709f191afa60fb50da9d4ab4cc1201","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
