{"title":"Enhancing Performance And Reducing Injury Risk: Integrating Resistance And Flexibility Training For Hamstring Injury Prevention In Rural-based Soccer Players&ndash; A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1669/v1","date":1716796100000,"content":"Hamstring injuries present a notable challenge to the performance and durability of soccer athletes, particularly those situated in rural areas where access to specialized training facilities may be scarce. This literature review delves into the amalgamation of resistance and flexibility training as a holistic strategy for averting hamstring injuries among rural-based soccer athletes. Utilizing existing scholarly works, this review underscores the significance of resistance training in enhancing hamstring strength, power, and stamina, while flexibility training augments muscle pliability and range of motion, thus diminishing the likelihood of injuries. Furthermore, it scrutinizes a range of resistance and flexibility routines customized to meet the specific requirements of soccer and the limitations of rural settings. Through the amalgamation of evidence-based methodologies, this review puts forth the mechanisms of injury and pragmatic suggestions for coaches, trainers, and athletes to implement efficient injury prevention protocols. Highlighting the collaborative advantages of resistance and flexibility training, this methodology strives to enhance performance and shield against hamstring injuries in rural-based soccer athletes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"afa1fbd2197c205ecdac15c9cc90e6989ddc8849ebd9fb83eadaea68893ab1e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
