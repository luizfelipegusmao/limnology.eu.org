It is identified as <i>C. affinis</i> hitherto known only from two juvenile type specimens collected by HMS <i>Challenger</i> off Uruguay in 1876. The diagnosis of the species is revised to include the discovery of considerable ontogenetic changes in squamation. Spinulation on the body scales are reduced or lost with size, while the armament of the head scales become amplified. The larger of the syntype specimens is designated as the lectotype. All three known specimens of <i>C. affinis</i> were collected in the southwestern Atlantic at depths between 3500 and 4000 m. A key for identification for the species of the subgenus <i>Nematonurus</i> is provided.</p>","author":"Artem M.
