{"title":"Safflower protein as a potential plant protein powder: optimization of extraction and spray‐drying process parameters and determination of physicochemical and functional properties","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13561?af=R","date":1722924325000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The research about sustainable and alternative plant protein sources has accelerated with the increasing need for protein. Safflower meal has a potential to be used in protein production due to its high protein content. This research aimed to produce an alternative plant-based protein powder using safflower meal. Both extraction and spray-drying parameters of safflower protein powder production were optimized using response surface methodology to achieve maximum yield. Moreover, the physicochemical and functional properties of safflower protein were determined and compared with those of commercial protein powders (soy, sunflower, pea, fava bean, and rice).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The optimum extraction conditions were found to be 33.06:1 mL<sup>−1</sup> g solvent-to-meal ratio, pH 11.00, 23.34 °C extraction temperature, and 30.86 min extraction time, which were achieved with a protein yield response of 75.21%. The highest powder yield (51.28%) was recorded for drying conditions of inlet air temperature of 160.11 °C, aspiration rate of 54.17 m<sup>3</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>, and feed flow rate of 16.01 mL min<sup>−1</sup>. According to the amino acid profile of safflower protein, the glutamic acid content (14 475 mg (100 g)<sup>−1</sup>) was highest, while the methionine content (96 mg (100 g)<sup>−1</sup>) was lowest. Moreover, safflower protein can be regarded as a high-quality protein due to its high essential amino acid ratio (41.55%). The experiments showed that safflower protein had high solubility and good foam and emulsifying properties.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Safflower protein could be a nutritional and functional protein source for the food industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Fatma Korkmaz","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a24a877073a44b5a8ab9aacf0f6015eb44727bbeb370fc3cfc2ede570bfe29a6","category":"Environment"}
