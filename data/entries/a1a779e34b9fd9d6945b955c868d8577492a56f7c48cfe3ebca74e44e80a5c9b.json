{"title":"Endoscopic Management of Post-Esophagectomy Delayed-Gastric-Conduit-Emptying (DGCE): Results from a Cohort Study in a Tertiary Referral Center with Comparison between Procedures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1373/v1","date":1726795581000,"content":"Delayed Gastric Conduit Emptying (DGCE) occurs in 15-39% of patients who underwent esophagectomy. Intra-Pyloric Injection of Botulinum Toxin (IPBT), Pneumatic Balloon Dilation (PBD), and the same session combination (BTPD), represent the main endoscopic procedures, but comparative data are currently unavailable. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data on all consecutive patients with DGCE treated endoscopically with IPBT, PBD, or BTPD. ISDE Diagnostic Criteria were used for DGCE diagnosis and classification. Gastric Outlet Obstruction Score was used for clinical staging. All patients undergoing IPBT received 100 UI of toxin, while those undergoing PBD were dilated up to 20mm. Clinical success (CS) was defined as the resolution of symptoms/resumption of feeding at discharge or expanding dietary intake at any rate. Recurrence was defined as symptom relapse after more than 15 days of well-being requiring endoscopic/surgical intervention. 64 patients (81.2% male, 90.6% Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy, 77.4% adenocarcinoma), median age 62 years (IQR 55-70), were enrolled: 18 (28.1%) in the IPBT group, 24 (37.5%) in the PBD group and 22 (34.4%) in the BTPD group. No statistically significant differences were found in the baseline characteristics, surgical techniques, and median follow-up among the three groups. BTPD showed a higher CS rate (100%) compared to the PD and BTPD groups (p=0.02) and Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test revealed that the BTPD group was associated both with a significatively shorter mean time to refeed of 1.16 days (95% CI 0.8-1.5; p=0.001) and a shorter median time to discharge of 1 day (95% CI 1-3; p=0.0001). Endoscopic management of DGCE remains challenging. Waiting for further strong evidence, BTPD can offer patients a higher clinical efficacy rate and a shorter time to refeed and be discharged.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1a779e34b9fd9d6945b955c868d8577492a56f7c48cfe3ebca74e44e80a5c9b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
