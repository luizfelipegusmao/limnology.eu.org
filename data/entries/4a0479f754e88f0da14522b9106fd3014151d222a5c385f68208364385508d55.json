A key to understanding continental dynamics is recognizing that differences in gravitational potential energy per unit area between high and low terrain govern much of large-scale continental deformation. Removal of mantle lithosphere, not just crustal thickening, plays a crucial, but difficult-to-test, role in changes in surface elevation. Although measuring past surface heights remains a challenge, indications of such processes suggest that surface uplift associated with such removal can affect relative plate motion. Climate change, from a warmer to cooler climate, and associated changes in erosion and sedimentation introduce further complications to determining past elevations. The phenomena that led to such cooling include a number of possibilities, but I favor the emergence of islands in the Maritime continent, which transformed the Pacific Ocean from one with a warm eastern tropical Pacific, as during El Niño events, to the present-day La Niña–like background state. Teleconnections from the eastern tropical Pacific to Canada affect the duration of summers and the potential of high-latitude ice to accumulate.\n</p><ul>\n<li><span>▪ \n</span>Lateral gradients in gravitational potential energy per unit area (GPE), a force per unit length, govern large-scale continental dynamics.\n</li>\n<li><span>▪ \n</span>Removal of mantle lithosphere and thickening of crust raise GPE; knowledge of mean surface elevations provides a test of these processes.\n</li>\n<li><span>▪ \n</span>Climate change from a warmer to cooler climate and from one with less to more erosion can give the false impression of elevation change.\n</li>\n<li><span>▪ \n</span>Emergence of Indonesian islands, more rain over them, a stronger Walker Circulation, and cooler eastern Pacific may have led to ice ages.\n</li>\n</ul><p></p></div>","author":"Peter Molnar","siteTitle":"Annual Reviews: Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3673234039065d61c10e2c644135584372f7dd9be183427347ecf8d080bad075","entryHash":"4a0479f754e88f0da14522b9106fd3014151d222a5c385f68208364385508d55","category":"Environment"}
