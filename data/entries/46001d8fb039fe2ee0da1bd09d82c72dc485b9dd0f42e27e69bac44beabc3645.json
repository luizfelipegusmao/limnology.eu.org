{"title":"Static Resilience Evolution of the Global Wood Forest Products Trade Network from 2002 to 2021: A Complex Directed Weighted Network Analysis Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1915/v1","date":1724770765000,"content":"Based on the perspective of complex directed weighted network analysis, this paper constructs a static resilience evaluation framework for trade networks from two dimensions: structural resilience and node resilience. It studies the evolution of static resilience in the upstream, midstream, downstream, and recycling trade networks of global wood forest products from 2002 to 2021. The study finds that the total trade volume of global wood forest products has increased by 58.0%, 77.3%, 71.2%, and 77.2% in the upstream, midstream, downstream, and recycling sectors, respectively. The downstream trade network exhibits efficient information transmission and resource mobility capabilities. All four types of trade networks exhibit scale-free characteristics, with core countries such as China, the United States, and Germany playing a dominant role in the network and playing a crucial role in network robustness, but also increasing network vulnerability. In terms of unweighted assortativity, all four networks exhibit the characteristic of \"small countries relying on hubs,\" while the weighted assortativity of the downstream network is positive, indicating enhanced network resilience. In terms of node resilience, countries exhibit significant differences and dynamic changes. China demonstrates strong resilience and adaptability, while the United States maintains its core position. China's influence in the downstream network has significantly increased, and India has rapidly emerged in the recycling network. To enhance network resilience, it is necessary to increase diversity and redundancy, establish effective emergency response mechanisms, and promote the diversification and green transformation of the supply chain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46001d8fb039fe2ee0da1bd09d82c72dc485b9dd0f42e27e69bac44beabc3645","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
