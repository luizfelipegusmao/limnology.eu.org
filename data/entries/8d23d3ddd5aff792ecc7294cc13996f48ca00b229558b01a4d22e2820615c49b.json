{"title":"Understanding Dislocation-Interface Interactions during Recrystallization of Mg-(Ca, Zn) Alloys","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.306/7720416?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Magnesium (Mg) alloys show great promise in vehicle weight reduction due to their light weight, high specific strength, and good castability. However, the full adoption of Mg alloys in the automotive industry is limited by low ductility and poor formability, and as a result, Mg accounts for less than 1% of the average vehicle weight [<a href=\"#ozae044.306-B1\">1</a>]. This can be attributed to the formation of a strong basal texture during thermomechanical processing (TMP) [<a href=\"#ozae044.306-B2\">2</a>]. Recent studies have shown that the texture can be weakened by alloying with Ca and Zn and therefore, can improve the ductility and formability of these alloys. In many cases, recrystallization (RX) or the nucleation of strain-free grains is used to alter grain behavior, enabling changes in properties and overall crystallographic texture [<a href=\"#ozae044.306-B3\">3-5</a>]. The objective of this work is to observe and quantify the RX mechanisms of Mg-(Ca, Zn) alloys through understanding the multiscale interactions that occur at interfaces such as grain boundaries and deformation twins and their contribution to crystallographic texture weakening. A multimodal methodology that combines electron microscopy (i.e., SEM and S/TEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) with in-situ heating techniques will be utilized to understand the multiscale mechanisms that govern RX and the resulting crystallographic texture.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8d23d3ddd5aff792ecc7294cc13996f48ca00b229558b01a4d22e2820615c49b","category":"Environment"}
