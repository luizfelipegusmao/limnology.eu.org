{"title":"Treatment of Superficial Vein Thrombosis: Recent Advances, Unmet Needs and Future Directions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1330/v1","date":1718871347000,"content":"Once considered relatively benign, superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) of the lower limbs is often linked to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Treatment goals include alleviating local symptoms and preventing SVT from recurring or extending into DVT or PE. Fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily for 45 days is the treatment of choice for most patients with SVT. Potential alternatives include intermediate-dose low-molecular-weight heparin or the direct oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban. Despite these treatment options, significant gaps remain, including the role of systemic or topical anti-inflammatory agents alone or combined with anticoagulants, and the optimal duration of anticoagulation for patients at varying risk levels. Additionally, the efficacy and safety of factor Xa inhibitors other than rivaroxaban, management of upper extremity SVT, and optimal treatment for SVT near the sapheno-femoral or sapheno-popliteal junctions are not well understood. This narrative review aims to summarize current evidence on anticoagulant treatment for SVT, highlight key unmet needs in current approaches, and discuss how ongoing studies may address these gaps.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9d64e2b75d6547594a609a74296d5c9737401af52a75524717edd1d8bc1811a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
