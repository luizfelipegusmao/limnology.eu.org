The implementation of LDCT screening in countries with a high prevalence/incidence of tuberculosis (TB) is controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to identify whether LCS using LDCT increases early-stage diagnosis and decreases mortality, as well as the false-positive rate, in regions with a high prevalence of TB.</p> Methods/Design <p>Studies were identified by searching BVS, PUBMED, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. RCT and cohort studies (CS) that show the effects of LDCT in LC screening on mortality and secondary outcomes were eligible. Two independent reviewers evaluated eligibility and a third judged disagreements. We used the Systematic Review Data Repository (SRDR+) to extract the metadata and record decisions. The analyses were stratified by study design and incidence of TB. We used the Cochrane \"Risk of bias\" assessment tool.</p> Results <p>The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) were used. Thirty-seven papers were included, referring to 22 studies (10 RCTs and 12 cohorts). Few studies were from regions with a high incidence of TB (One RCT and four cohorts). Nonetheless, the evidence is compatible with European and USA studies. RCTs and CS also had consistent results. There is an increase in early-stage (I-II) diagnoses and reduced LC mortality in the LCDT arm compared to the control. Although false-positive rates varied, they stayed within the 20 to 30% range.</p> Discussion <p>This is the first meta-analysis of LDCT for LCS focused on its benefits in regions with an increased incidence/prevalence of TB. Although the specificity of Lung-RADS was higher in participants without TB sequelae than in those with TB sequelae, our findings point out that the difference does not invalidate implementing LDCT LCS in these regions.</p> Trial registration <p>Systematic review registration Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42022309581.</p>","author":"Debora Castanheira Pires","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0b13a16ee4407910f1834c2400f1d0d864a02272eee681d98100b32d7d593c69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
