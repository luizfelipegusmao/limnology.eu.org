Single particle analysis (SPA) has enabled structure determination of purified macromolecular complexes up to atomic resolution [<a href=\"#ozae044.894-B1\">1-2</a>]. Cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) combined with subtomogram averaging (STA) [<a href=\"#ozae044.894-B3\">3-4</a>] has been demonstrated to offer distinct perspectives of the arrangement and function of structural proteins within intact cells. Compared to SPA, cryo-ET with STA, despite its powerful potential to offer much richer information, is still an emerging technique that has only achieved high resolution for a handful of biomolecular structures thus far. At the Chan Zuckerberg Institute for Advanced Biological Imaging (CZ Imaging Institute), our objective is to contribute to the ongoing refinement of this technique through joint efforts. This includes collaborative hardware development such as the laser phase plate [<a href=\"#ozae044.894-B5\">5</a>] and direct electron detectors, and algorithm development, including but not limited to machine-learning-based denoising and automated annotation, and the establishment of a data portal to catalyze the development of machine-learning methods [<a href=\"#ozae044.894-B6\">6</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"920cca18dfb049ac167e3ff30a552a5ccd5a2912dbdd4abd059629af1f3a83c9","category":"Environment"}
