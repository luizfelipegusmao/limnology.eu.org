{"title":"ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 interacts with HISTONE DEACETYLASE 9 to suppress glucosinolate biosynthesis in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1340/7675295?rss=1","date":1715817600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Glucosinolates (GSLs) are defensive secondary metabolites produced by <span>Brassicaceae</span> species in response to abiotic and biotic stresses. The biosynthesis of GSL compounds and the expression of GSL-related genes are highly modulated by endogenous signals (i.e. circadian clocks) and environmental cues, such as temperature, light, and pathogens. However, the detailed mechanism by which light signaling influences GSL metabolism remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that a light-signaling factor, ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), was involved in the regulation of GSL content under light conditions in <span>Arabidopsis</span> (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). In <span>hy5-215</span> mutants, the transcript levels of GSL pathway genes were substantially upregulated compared with those in wild-type (WT) plants. The content of GSL compounds was also substantially increased in <span>hy5-215</span> mutants, whereas 35<span>S::HY5-GFP/hy5-215</span> transgenic lines exhibited comparable levels of GSL-related transcripts and GSL content to those in WT plants. HY5 physically interacts with HISTONE DEACETYLASE9 and binds to the proximal promoter region of <span>MYB29</span> and <span>IMD1</span> to suppress aliphatic GSL biosynthetic processes. These results demonstrate that HY5 suppresses GSL accumulation during the daytime, thus properly modulating GSL content daily in <span>Arabidopsis</span> plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"5cf07e63c315ccb44415a622de2284e9cf1eb3105d66e740632216c78bf36bdb","category":"Environment"}
