During necropsy, an enterolith was discovered partially obstructing the intestinal lumen. Examination of the enterolith revealed a bonefish spine nidus. Enterolithiasis has been linked to multiple factors including diet, genetics, alkaline intestinal environments and, as in this particular case, the ingestion and retention of foreign bodies. The composition of this enterolith from a cownose ray was primarily monohydrocalcite. This short communication, apparently the first to report enterolithiasis in stingrays, emphasizes the need for post-mortem examinations of carcasses on macroscopic and microscopic levels.</p>","author":"L.
