An online and anonymous questionnaire was applied from September 20, 2019 to June 15, 2021. 514 responses were obtained, of which 502 were considered according to the inclusion criteria. For recreational use of psychoactive substances, both for lifetime use and for use in the last 3 months, the prevalence of alcohol, cannabis and tobacco were the highest ones in that order.
