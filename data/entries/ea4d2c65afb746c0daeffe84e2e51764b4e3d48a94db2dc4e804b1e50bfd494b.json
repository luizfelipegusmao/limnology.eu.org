{"title":"Evaluation of Microalgal Diet to Culture Adult Oithona oculata Farran (Copepoda, Cyclopoida)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/2089803?af=R","date":1677312000000,"content":"<p>While copepods are important prey for many wild marine fish larvae and are preferred as a live feed for culturing larval fish, their low productivity and the costs associated with culturing them typically limit their use as a live food source in all but experimental situations. In a series of experiments with four readily and commercially available microalgae (<i>Thalassiosira weissflogii</i> Grunow, <i>Rhodomonas salina</i> Wislouch, <i>Tetraselmis suecica</i> Kylin Butch, and <i>Isochrysis galbana</i> Parke), we determine which of them, when exclusively fed to a commonly occurring copepod, <i>Oithona oculata</i>, over a 15-day period, results in the greatest copepod survival and egg production rates. We posit that species of <i>Oithona</i> might be an ideal candidate for copepod taxa for commercial-scale copepod culture and that the microalga <i>Rhodomonas salina</i> is an ideal food source to culture them.</p>","author":"Yoshiki Takayama, \nTaisei Yamasaki, \nTatsuki Toda, \nJianguang Qin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"ea4d2c65afb746c0daeffe84e2e51764b4e3d48a94db2dc4e804b1e50bfd494b","category":"Environment"}
