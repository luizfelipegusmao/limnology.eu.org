{"title":"Stromule Geometry Allows Optimal Spatial Regulation of Organelle Interactions in the Quasi-2D Cytoplasm","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/4/618/7258862?rss=1","date":1693612800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In plant cells, plastids form elongated extensions called stromules, the regulation and purposes of which remain unclear. Here, we quantitatively explore how different stromule structures serve to enhance the ability of a plastid to interact with other organelles: increasing the effective space for interaction and biomolecular exchange between organelles. Interestingly, electron microscopy and confocal imaging showed that the cytoplasm in <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span> and <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> epidermal cells is extremely thin (around 100 nm in regions without organelles), meaning that inter-organelle interactions effectively take place in 2D. We combine these imaging modalities with mathematical modeling and new in planta experiments to demonstrate how different stromule varieties (single or multiple, linear or branching) could be employed to optimize different aspects of inter-organelle interaction capacity in this 2D space. We found that stromule formation and branching provide a proportionally higher benefit to interaction capacity in 2D than in 3D. Additionally, this benefit depends on optimal plastid spacing. We hypothesize that cells can promote the formation of different stromule architectures in the quasi-2D cytoplasm to optimize their interaction interface to meet specific requirements. These results provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the transition from low to high stromule numbers, the consequences for interaction with smaller organelles, how plastid access and plastid to nucleus signaling are balanced and the impact of plastid density on organelle interaction.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"3c93bdfcc585b0d315ef2a9feaf48a5a63d9983ed134fbd56dd7458f40038e9b","category":"Environment"}
