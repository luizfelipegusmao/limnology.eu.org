Lai, Sridhar Ravi</p>\r\n\r\nThe potential application of flapping wings in micro-aerial vehicles is gaining interest due to their ability to generate high lift even in confined spaces. Most studies in the past have investigated hovering wings as well as those flapping near solid surfaces. However, the presence of surface tension at the water-air interface and the ability of the water surface to move might differentiate its response to the proximity of wings, compared to that of solid surfaces. Motivated by underwater, amphibian robots and several underwater experimental studies on flapping wings, our study investigated the effects of the proximity of flapping wings to the water surface at low Reynolds numbers (<i>Re</i> = 3400). Experiments were performed on a rectangular wing in a water tank with prescribed flapping kinematics and the aerodynamic forces were measured. The effects of surface proximity on the wing in its both upright and inverted orientations were studied. Broadly, the mean lift and drag coefficients in both orientations decreased significantly (by up to 60%) as the distance from the water surface was increased. In the case of the upright orientation, the mean lift coefficient was slightly decreased very close to the water surface with its peak being observed at the normalized clearance of h / c Â¯ = 0 . 07. Overall, the study revealed an enhancement in the aerodynamic forces closer to the water surface.","author":"Shantanu S.
