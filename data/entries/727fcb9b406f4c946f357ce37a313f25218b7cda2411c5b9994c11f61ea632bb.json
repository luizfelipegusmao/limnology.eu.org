{"title":"The Silent Threat: Prediabetes and Its Impact on Heart Attack Survival&mdash;A Call to Action!","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0691/v1","date":1725878520000,"content":"Background: Cardiovascular risk in prediabetic patients is substantial yet it is often underestimated in everyday clinical practice. Objectives: This study examines the future cardiovascular risk in prediabetic patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 725 STEMI patients at a tertiary center in Austria between 2018 and 2020, categorized into groups of non-diabetic, prediabetic, and diabetic patients. Baseline characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, and long-term survival outcomes were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis along with other statistical tests. Results: Of the 725 patients, 407 (56.1%) were non-diabetic, 184 (25.4%) prediabetic, and 134 (18.5%) diabetic. Prediabetic patients exhibited significant additional cardiovascular risk factors, such as arterial hypertension (67.4%) and dyslipidemia (78.3%), with prevalence rates between those of non-diabetic and diabetic patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that at three-year follow-up, prediabetic patients faced a survival disadvantage with a significant decrease in survival rates compared to non-diabetic patients (log-rank p = 0.016); their survival outcomes approached those of diabetic patients (p = 0.125). Conclusions: Our findings underscore the critical need for early identification and aggressive management of prediabetes in cardiovascular care of patients after acute STEMI. In current clinical practice, prediabetic patients are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, putting them at disproportionate risk. Integrating rigorous cardiovascular risk management strategies for prediabetic individuals, including lifestyle interventions and potentially pharmacological treatments, could prevent the progression to diabetes and mitigate associated cardiovascular risks. This paradigm shift in treating prediabetes as seriously as diabetes may significantly improve long-term survival outcomes for this vulnerable population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"727fcb9b406f4c946f357ce37a313f25218b7cda2411c5b9994c11f61ea632bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
