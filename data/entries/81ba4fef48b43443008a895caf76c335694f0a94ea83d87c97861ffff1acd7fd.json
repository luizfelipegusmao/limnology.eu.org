{"title":"High accuracy meets high throughput for near full-length 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing on the Nanopore platform","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae411/7816023?rss=1","date":1728432000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing is a foundational method in microbial ecology. Currently, short-read platforms are commonly employed for high-throughput applications of SSU rRNA amplicon sequencing, but at the cost of poor taxonomic classification due to limited fragment lengths. The Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform can sequence full-length SSU rRNA genes, but its lower raw-read accuracy has so-far limited accurate taxonomic classification and de novo feature generation. Here, we present a sequencing workflow, termed <span>ssUMI</span>, that combines unique molecular identifier (UMI)-based error correction with newer (R10.4+) ONT chemistry and sample barcoding to enable high throughput near full-length SSU rRNA (e.g. 16S rRNA) amplicon sequencing. The ssUMI workflow generated near full-length 16S rRNA consensus sequences with 99.99% mean accuracy using a minimum subread coverage of 3Ã—, surpassing the accuracy of Illumina short reads. The consensus sequences generated with ssUMI were used to produce error-free de novo sequence features with no false positives with two microbial community standards. In contrast, Nanopore raw reads produced erroneous de novo sequence features, indicating that UMI-based error correction is currently necessary for high-accuracy microbial profiling with R10.4+ ONT sequencing chemistries. We showcase the cost-competitive scalability of the ssUMI workflow by sequencing 87 time-series wastewater samples and 27 human gut samples, obtaining quantitative ecological insights that were missed by short-read amplicon sequencing. ssUMI, therefore, enables accurate and low-cost full-length 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on Nanopore, improving accessibility to high-resolution microbiome science.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"81ba4fef48b43443008a895caf76c335694f0a94ea83d87c97861ffff1acd7fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
