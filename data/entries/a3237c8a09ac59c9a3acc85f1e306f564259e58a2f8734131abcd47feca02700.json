{"title":"A Pig as a Model to Test Cardiovascular Devices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1212/v1","date":1713429824000,"content":"Pigs are used as laboratory animals in preclinical studies on medical devices for cardiac surgery. On the one hand, the anatomy of the cardiovascular system of these animals has been well studied and acknowledged suitable for use and testing of new cardiovascular devices developed for humans. On the other hand, there are no morphometric characteristics of the aortic root and other parts of it in pigs with different weights. This can lead to difficulties in the work of researchers and even result in the death of experimental animals due to the discrepancy in the size of the implantable devices. Thus, such information is essential to improve the efficiency of surgical technologies used in the correction of aortic pathologies in its various sections. The purpose of our research is to study the anatomy of the aorta in mini-pigs, and to assess whether the size, age, and sex of animals affect the size of the main structures in their aorta. In addition, we attempted to compare the results obtained by the method of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and angiography. We studied 28 laboratory mini-pigs weighing from 40 to 105 kg, and then we compared our results with other studies and did not find any relationship between the external somatometric characteristics of animals and the size of their aorta. Each animal has an individual anatomy, so they are to be examined in terms of preoperative planning by any available method - echocardiography, angiography or multispiral computed tomography (MRI).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a3237c8a09ac59c9a3acc85f1e306f564259e58a2f8734131abcd47feca02700","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
