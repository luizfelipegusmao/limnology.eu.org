{"title":"Resilience Mechanisms and Coping Strategies for Forcibly Displaced Youth Experiencing Social Isolation: An Exploratory Rapid Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1022/v1","date":1723631182000,"content":"Context:\nThe global escalation of conflict, violence, and human rights violations sets a pressing backdrop for examining the resilience of forcibly displaced youth (FDY) in Canada. This study aims to unpack the multifaceted challenges and resilience mechanisms of FDY, focusing on their health, well-being, and integration into host communities. It seeks to identify current models of resilience, understand the factors within each model, and highlight gaps and limitations. \nMethodology:\nUsing a university librarian-supported structured search strategy, this exploratory rapid review searched literature from Ovid Medline and Open Source databases, published in English between January 2019 and January 2024, that fit specific inclusion criteria. The eligible articles (N=12 out of 4,096) were charted and analyzed by two student researchers with the PI. Charted data were analyzed thematically. \nResults:\nThe selected studies captured diverse geographical perspectives, resilience models (such as Ungar's ecological perspective and Masten's resilience developmental models), as well as protective and promotive frameworks. Key findings indicate the complexity of resilience influenced by individual, familial, societal, and cultural factors. Each model offers insights into the dynamic interplay of these influences on FDY's resilience. However, these models often fall short of addressing the nuances of cultural specificity, the impact of trauma, and the intersectionality of FDY's identities. \nConclusion:\nRecognizing the diverse and evolving nature of FDY's coping mechanisms, this study advocates for a culturally appropriate approach to resilience that integrates an intersectionality framework of individual attributes and culturally sensitive models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef3550ac992348e797807406909386c873cfe6ebb2861b7d4881142eb708f98e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
