{"title":"A Deep-Learning Approach to Automatic Tooth Caries Segmentation on Panoramic Radiographs of Children in Primary Dentition, Mixed Dentition, and Permanent Dentition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0070/v1","date":1711967187000,"content":"Objectives: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of dental caries segmentation on the panoramic radiographs taken from children in primary dentition, mixed dentition, and permanent dentition with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) models developed using the deep learning method.\nMethods: This study used 6075 panoramic radiographs taken from children aged between 4 and 14 to develop the AI model. The radiographs included in the study were divided into three groups as primary dentition (n: 1857), mixed dentition (n: 1406), and permanent dentition (n: 2812). U-Net model implemented with PyTorch library was used for segmentation of caries lesions. Confusion matrix was used to evaluation of model performance.\nResults: In the primary dentition group, the sensitivity, precision and F1 scores calculated using the confusion matrix were found to be 0.8525, 0.9128, and 0.8816, respectively. In the mixed dentition group, the sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores calculated using the confusion matrix were found as 0.7377, 0.9192, and 0.8185, respectively. In the permanent dentition group, the sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores calculated using the confusion matrix were found as 0.8271, 0.9125, and 0.8677, respectively. In the total group including primary, mixed, and permanent dentition, the sensitivity, precision and F1 score calculated using the confusion matrix were 0.8269, 0.9123 and 0.8675, respectively.                                                                             \nConclusion: Deep learning-based AI models are promising tools for the detection and diagnosis of caries in panoramic radiographs taken from children in different dentitions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3363292611b3b7a463d8b323fe972a1fc61b20751466adb16e938d75e34448bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
