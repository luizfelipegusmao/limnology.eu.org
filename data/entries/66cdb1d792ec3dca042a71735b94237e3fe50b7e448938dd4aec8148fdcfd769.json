{"title":"In-shoe Sensor Measures of Loading Asymmetry during Gait as a Predictor of Frailty Development in Community-Dwelling Older Adults","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0138/v1","date":1719872445000,"content":"Previous studies have reported that clinical walk tests could not predict development of frailty. With advancements in wearable technology, it may be possible to predict the development of frailty using loading asymmetry parameters during clinical walk test. This prospective cohort study aimed to test the hypothesis that increased limb loading asymmetry predicts frailty risk in community-living older adults. Sixty-two independently ambulant community-living adults aged â‰¥ 65 years were recruited, and forty-seven subjects completed the one-year follow-up after baseline. Loading asymmetry index of net and regional (forefoot, midfoot, and rearfoot) plantar forces were collected using force sensing insoles (100 Hz) during a 10-m walk test with their maximum speed. Development of frailty was defined if the participant progressed from baseline at least one grading group of frailty at follow-up period using the Kihon Checklist. Fourteen subjects developed frailty at follow-up period. Increased risk of frailty was associated with each 1% increase in loading asymmetry of net impulse (Odds ratio 1.153, 95% CI 1.001 to 1.329). Loading asymmetry of net impulse significantly correlated with asymmetry of peak force in midfoot force. These results indicate the feasibility of measuring plantar forces of gait during clinical walking tests, and underscore the potential of using load asymmetry as a tool to augment frailty risk assessment in community-dwelling older adults.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"66cdb1d792ec3dca042a71735b94237e3fe50b7e448938dd4aec8148fdcfd769","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
