{"title":"Improving Student Participation in a Literature Class through Literature Circles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0111/v1","date":1717417462000,"content":"Literature circles create an interactive and participatory learning atmosphere that greatly increases student participation in the classroom. Through literature circles, students can exchange ideas and gain knowledge from one another in a nurturing learning atmosphere. Students feel more at ease taking chances and voicing their opinions in the classroom when there is a strong sense of community among the students. This research study used a narrative literature review as a qualitative method. Relevant literature in this review showed that literature circles can increase students' reading passion and enthusiasm. Students are more likely to be engaged when they can select their own reading materials and facilitate discussions. Thus, by implementing literature circles, teachers may create a more engaging and encouraging learning environment in the classroom, which will ultimately improve student performance and foster a deeper understanding of literature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00a3bd544def67e00b9c6a9543c9ebb0975c93a68d67c7b86209cb39047510b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
