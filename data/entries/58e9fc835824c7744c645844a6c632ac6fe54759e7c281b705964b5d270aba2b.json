{"title":"Vacuum Freeze-Drying of Camel and Mare Milk: Process Optimization and Quality Preservation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1041/v1","date":1728957270000,"content":"The freeze-drying of camel and mare milk presents challenges due to their unique compositions, such as high lactose and protein content. This research aims to optimize vacuum freeze-drying parameters, including temperature, drying time, and layer thickness, for enhanced product quality and reduced energy consumption. Ultrasound and homogenization techniques were applied to enhance moisture transfer during drying. Experimental data suggest optimal conditions of -50°C to +50°C over 22–24 hours, significantly improving reconstitution quality. Mathematical modeling in Python and Maple helped refine process parameters to achieve desirable product consistency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58e9fc835824c7744c645844a6c632ac6fe54759e7c281b705964b5d270aba2b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
