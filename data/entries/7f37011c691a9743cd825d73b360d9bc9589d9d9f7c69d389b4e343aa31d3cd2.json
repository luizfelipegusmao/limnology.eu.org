{"title":"Fighting for Survival at the Stomatal Gate","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-arplant-070623-091552?TRACK=RSS","date":1721606400000,"content":"<div><p>Stomata serve as the battleground between plants and plant pathogens. Plants can perceive pathogens, inducing closure of the stomatal pore, while pathogens can overcome this immune response with their phytotoxins and elicitors. In this review, we summarize new discoveries in stomata–pathogen interactions. Recent studies have shown that stomatal movement continues to occur in a close-open-close-open pattern during bacterium infection, bringing a new understanding of stomatal immunity. Furthermore, the canonical pattern-triggered immunity pathway and ion channel activities seem to be common to plant–pathogen interactions outside of the well-studied <span>Arabidopsis</span>–<span>Pseudomonas</span> pathosystem. These developments can be useful to aid in the goal of crop improvement. New technologies to study intact leaves and advances in available omics data sets provide new methods for understanding the fight at the stomatal gate. Future studies should aim to further investigate the defense–growth trade-off in relation to stomatal immunity, as little is known at this time.</p></div>","author":"Maeli Melotto, Brianna Fochs, Zachariah Jaramillo and Olivier Rodrigues","siteTitle":"Annual Reviews: Annual Review of Plant Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"f9af7703a9e08f35edcf21995cc07f36402e9892411dd5042fb57fa6c1c4e57d","entryHash":"7f37011c691a9743cd825d73b360d9bc9589d9d9f7c69d389b4e343aa31d3cd2","category":"Environment"}
