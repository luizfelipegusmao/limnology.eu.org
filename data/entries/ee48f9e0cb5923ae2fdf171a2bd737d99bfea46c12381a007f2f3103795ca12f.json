Participants were adult cataract patients with normal lid position, not suffering from any other ocular disease and not meet the exclusion cirteria of clinical trial. Participants were randomly divided into two groups: 35 participants (17 males and 18 females) in the 0.1% HA group and 34 participants (19 males and 15 females) in the 0.15% HA group, receiving treatment six times daily for 6 weeks following cataract surgery. Subjective and objective assessments were performed at preoperative and postoperative visits, including ocular surface disease index score, tear break up time, corneal staining score, Schirmer’s I test score, lipid layer thickness), meiboscore, and biochemical analysis of the eye drops.</p> Results <p>Throughout the study, the postoperative ocular surface disease index score was significantly lower in the group receiving 0.15% hyaluronic acid than in the group receiving 0.1% hyaluronic acid. Additionally, the postoperative ocular surface disease index score showed a significant positive correlation with the postoperative use of 0.15% hyaluronic acid and the preoperative Schirmer’s I test score. In multivariate analysis, treatment with 0.15% hyaluronic acid and the preoperative ocular surface disease index score were significant independent parameters affecting the postoperative ocular surface disease index score.</p> Conclusion <p>The use of 0.15% hyaluronic acid is recommended for its potential advantages in alleviating symptoms following cataract surgery, making it a viable alternative to traditional 0.1% hyaluronic acid treatment.</p> Trial registration <p>ISRCTN95830348.</p>","author":"Seung Ahn Yang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ee48f9e0cb5923ae2fdf171a2bd737d99bfea46c12381a007f2f3103795ca12f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
