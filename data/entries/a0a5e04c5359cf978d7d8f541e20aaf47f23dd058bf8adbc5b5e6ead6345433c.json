{"title":"The plant cell wall—dynamic, strong, and adaptable—is a natural shapeshifter","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1257/7596221?rss=1","date":1706745600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Mythology is replete with good and evil shapeshifters, who, by definition, display great adaptability and assume many different forms—with several even turning themselves into trees. Cell walls certainly fit this definition as they can undergo subtle or dramatic changes in structure, assume many shapes, and perform many functions. In this review, we cover the evolution of knowledge of the structures, biosynthesis, and functions of the 5 major cell wall polymer types that range from deceptively simple to fiendishly complex. Along the way, we recognize some of the colorful historical figures who shaped cell wall research over the past 100 years. The shapeshifter analogy emerges more clearly as we examine the evolving proposals for how cell walls are constructed to allow growth while remaining strong, the complex signaling involved in maintaining cell wall integrity and defense against disease, and the ways cell walls adapt as they progress from birth, through growth to maturation, and in the end, often function long after cell death. We predict the next century of progress will include deciphering cell type–specific wall polymers; regulation at all levels of polymer production, crosslinks, and architecture; and how walls respond to developmental and environmental signals to drive plant success in diverse environments.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"a0a5e04c5359cf978d7d8f541e20aaf47f23dd058bf8adbc5b5e6ead6345433c","category":"Environment"}
