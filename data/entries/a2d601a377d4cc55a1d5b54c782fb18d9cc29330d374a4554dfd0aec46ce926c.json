{"title":"Clinical and Hemodynamic Features of Aneurysm Rupture in Coil Embolization of Intracranial Aneurysms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0408/v1","date":1715603594000,"content":"Intraprocedural rupture (IPR) is a severe complication of coil embolization (CE) for intracranial aneurysms, yet the clinical and hemodynamic features of rupture risk areas remain unclear. From January 2013 to December 2023, 435 saccular cerebral aneurysms (316 unruptured, 119 ruptured) underwent CE at our institution. Included were cases where extravasation or coil protrusion occurred during CE. The rupture point was determined from postoperative data, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was conducted to assess hemodynamic features. IPR occurred in six aneurysms (1.3%; three ruptured, three unruptured; dome size: 4.7±1.8 mm, D/N: 1.5±0.5, locations: four internal carotid artery [ICA], one anterior cerebral artery, one middle cerebral artery). ICA aneurysms were treated using adjunctive techniques (three balloon-assisted, one stent-assisted). Two aneurysms (M1M2 and A1) were treated simply, yet had relatively small and misaligned domes. CFD analysis identified the rupture point as a flow impingement zone with maximum pressure (Pmax) in five aneurysms (83.3%). Time-averaged wall shear stress (WSS) was locally reduced around this area (1.3±0.7 [Pa]). Hemodynamically unstable areas indicated fragile, thin walls with rupture risk. Microcatheter insertion along the inflow zone, directed towards the caution area, was practiced. The presence of a flow impingement zone with Pmax and low WSS suggests potential aneurysm rupture in CE, particularly with adjunctive techniques. Small aneurysms, especially those with axial misalignment, warrant careful consideration due to the risk of excessive flow impact stress on the aneurysm wall.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a2d601a377d4cc55a1d5b54c782fb18d9cc29330d374a4554dfd0aec46ce926c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
