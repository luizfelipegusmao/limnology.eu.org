{"title":"Resilience, Anger, and Insomnia in Nurses after the End of the Pandemic Crisis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0301/v1","date":1725444577000,"content":"Nurses continue to experience intense psychological repercussions despite the official conclusion of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study conducted after the end of the pandemic crisis, in nurses, we evaluated the levels and explored the associations between anger, insomnia and resilience. A total of 442 nurses participated in an online survey and were invited to state their work experience, gender and age and complete the self-report measures of the Dimensions of Anger Reactions-5 (DAR-5), the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). 62.1% of participants presented with positive scores on the AIS, 41.5% displayed positive values on the DAR-5 scale, whereas 24.9% of nurses demonstrated scores indicative of low resilience on the BRS scale. Regression analysis revealed that 23.5% of the variance in the AIS scores can be attributed to the DAR-5 scores and 3% to the BRS scores. Mediation analysis confirmed the protective role of resilience contributing as a negative mediator in the DAR-5 and the AIS relationship. Screening for insomnia symptoms and anger issues among nurses after the end of the pandemic and implementing appropriate interventions is considered imperative to avoid long-term health consequences.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6cf5a9a84548b12dafcd3dc2baa1fdc80b6ea780a0ed195802b78872c52cb8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
