{"title":"A Pan-Asian Energy Transition? The New Rationale for Decarbonization Policies in Asia and the World’s Largest Energy Exporting Countries, the Case of Qatar, and Saudi Arabia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2108/v1","date":1717136270000,"content":"Climate change has become a major agenda item in international relations and in national energy policy-making circles around the world. This article studies the surprising evolution of the energy policy, and more particularly the energy transition, currently happening in the Arabian Gulf region, which features some of the world’s largest exporters of oil and gas. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and other neighboring energy exporters, plan to export blue and green hydrogen across Asia as well as towards Europe in the years and decades to come. Although poorly known and understood abroad, this recent strategy doesn’t threaten the current exports of oil and gas (still needed for a few decades) but prepares the evolution of their national energy industries towards the future decarbonized energy demand of their main customers in East and South Asia, and beyond. The world’s largest exporters of Liquefied Natural Gas, Qatar, has established industrial policies and projects to upscale CCUS, which can enable blue hydrogen production, as well as natural carbon sinks domestically via afforestation projects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1a11abd7f6f968e32d481eb4b64d3afc421172db9a63e407ee0945fd4025921","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
