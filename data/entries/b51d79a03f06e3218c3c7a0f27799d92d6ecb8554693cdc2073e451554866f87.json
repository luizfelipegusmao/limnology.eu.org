{"title":"Optical Sensing Volatile Organic Compounds Using Porphyrins","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1313/v1","date":1729085200000,"content":"Detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a rapidly growing research area due to importance of VOCs in environmental pollution, human health assessment, food quality control, and homeland security. Optical sensing materials based on porphyrins are particularly appealing for VOCs detection, owing to availability of porphyrins, their exceptional optical and binding properties, as well as their photo- and chemical stability. As research and technology continue to advance, optical sensors involving these materials are expected to play an increasing role in various applications. This article presents a comprehensive overview of porphyrin-based sensing materials developed for use as optical sensors for VOCs. First, sensing films composed exclusively of porphyrin molecules are discussed followed by materials obtained by grafting or incorporation of porphyrins into organic and inorganic polymer matrices. Considering growing interest to multianalyte analysis with porphyrin-based sensor arrays, special section is devoted to this area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b51d79a03f06e3218c3c7a0f27799d92d6ecb8554693cdc2073e451554866f87","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
