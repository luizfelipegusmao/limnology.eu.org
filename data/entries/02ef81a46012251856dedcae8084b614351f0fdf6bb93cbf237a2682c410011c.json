{"title":"Application of CVD Coatings on the Inner Surfaces of Cooled GTD Blades","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1343/v1","date":1713768724000,"content":"The possibility of applying Mo and Cr coatings by CVD method to the inner surfaces of tubular products Ø ˂ 60 mm has been studied.The process of applying Mo and Cr coatings by the method of gas-phase deposition was developed.The areas of parameters for obtaining coatings with a uniform structure, speed, hardness, as well as patterns of change in these characteristics when changing the main parameters of the process of obtaining such coatings are determined.The proven technological processes of applying Mo and Cr CVD coatings can be the basis for the development of pilot technologies for applying functional coatings to precision parts with small-diameter inner tubular surfaces in the mechanical engineering and aviation industries.A controlled process of applying two-component chromium-aluminum coatings by gas-phase deposition using organic and organometallic substances was developed. Optimization of the processes of applying high-quality two-component chromium-aluminum coatings on prototype models of the internal cavities of cooled turbine blades was carried out.The studies revealed the characteristics of two-component chromium-aluminum coatings comparable to those of coatings used in production, while ensuring good quality coatings in terms of adhesion strength to the turbine blade material. The reproducibility of the coatings obtained makes it possible to develop pilot technologies for production in the future.The lower toxicity of the precursors used makes it possible to create an environmentally friendly technology and significantly reduce environmental problems in production when applying two-component chromium-aluminum coatings to the internal cavities of cooled turbine blades.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02ef81a46012251856dedcae8084b614351f0fdf6bb93cbf237a2682c410011c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
