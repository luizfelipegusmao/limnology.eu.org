{"title":"Digital Transformation in Family Businesses: An analysis of drivers with fsQCA","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0537/v1","date":1725617703000,"content":"Digital Transformation (DT) encompasses profound technological changes. Businesses face the challenge of adapting their activities to the pace of new technologies to increase the efficiency of business processes, improve the customer experience, and create innovative value propositions.\nThis research focuses on how family businesses, which are a relevant part of global economic activity and job creation, address the challenges associated with Digital Transformation. Based on the case of the automotive retail sector in a small European country characterized by the high acceptance of technologies, we use fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to understand how critical success factors (causal conditions) combine towards adopting technologies representing different perspectives of the DT.\nThe results confirm the existence of multiple configurations based on the importance of Organizational Culture, Change Management, Knowledge, Human Capital, IT Systems, and DT Strategy towards the adoption of CRM, Digital Marketing, and Social Networks technologies, thus helping family businesses to understand the adoption of these technologies leading to organizational success in the context of the Digital Transformation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07cab7267bafcf494da6297a75b25488ff323764fd24fdccdbd14e247b0ab506","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
