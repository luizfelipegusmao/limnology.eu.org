{"title":"PSIII-20 The effects of vitamin E and/or C on parasite burden in hair sheep","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/502/7757702?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Anthelmintic resistance in flocks is an occurring issue for small ruminant producers due to increasing gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infections. Prevalence of high virulence GINs decreases immunity and growth, therefore not making anthelmintics economically sustainable for producers. In this current research study, we examined the role of vitamins E and/or C supplemented to crossbred hair sheep (Dorper, Katahdin, Barbados crosses) on parasite burden over time. The hypothesis of this research was that supplementing vitamin E and/or C will work comparable to anthelmintic treatment to control GIN in hair sheep. Mature ewes (n = 30) were stratified based on FAMACHA score. Ewes were placed into one of five treatment groups: 1) no dewormer or vitamin treatment (CON; n = 6), 2) anthelmintic treatment (Levamed; 0.08mg/kg; Bimeda Animal Health, Schaumburg, IL; n = 6), 3) combination of vitamin E and vitamin C (Vitamin E300; 0.33IU/kg of body weight (BW) administered subcutaneously; Durvet Animal Health; Blue Springs, MI; Vitamin C; Orally drenched at 0.56 mL/kg of BW; Radix Laboratories; Eau Claire, WI; n = 6), 4) vitamin C (Vitamin C;0.56 ml/kg of BW; Radix Laboratories; Eau Claire, WI; n = 6), and 5) vitamin E (Vitamin E 300; 0.33 IU/kg of BW; Durvet Animal Health; n = 6). Growing lambs (n = 30) were also placed into the same treatment groups. Evaluation of vitamin supplementation was observed on individual time points from d 0, 14, 28, 56, and 77 from the sheep. Parameters collected include body condition score (BCS), FAMACHA score, packed cell volume (PCV), and fecal egg count (FEC). There was no effect (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) on BCS in either lamb or mature groups on any of the days within the trial. However, on d 56, there was a tendency for the FAMACHA score to be improved in the vitamin E lambs compared with the control lambs. Additionally, on d 56 for the mature group, there was a significant difference (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05) that was observed within the Vit E+C group being less than the Dewormer and vitamin C groups. Treatments did not affect (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) packed cell volume (PCV) throughout the trial in either lamb or mature ewes. On d 14 of the trial, lambs receiving vitamin E and C, or the anthelmintic treatment had decreased (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05) strongyle FEC compared with the control lambs. The preliminary data analyzed suggests that vitamin E and/or C may work similarly to pharmaceutical anthelmintics in hair sheep to combat GIN. However, more research is essential to confirm the viability that vitamins may work as a sustainable alternative.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"7387aee2223442a5353337b45b7dd9c241e5ab50f8ca298b547ecfb99e8fa3ba","category":"Environment"}
