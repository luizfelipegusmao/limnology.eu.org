{"title":"Trehalose: Neuroprotective Effects and Mechanisms&mdash;An Updated Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2503/v1","date":1722407595000,"content":"Trehalose is a naturally occurring disaccharide that has recently gained significant attention for its neuroprotective properties in various models of neurodegeneration. This review provides an overview of available experimental data on the beneficial properties of trehalose for central nervous system pathological conditions. Trehalose’s impact on neuronal cell survival and function was also examined. As a result, we identified that trehalose’s neuroprotection includes autophagy modulation as well as its capability to stabilize proteins and inhibit the formation of misfolded ones. Moreover, trehalose mitigates oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage by stabilizing cellular membranes and modulating mitochondrial function. Furthermore, trehalose attenuates excitotoxicity-induced neuroinflammation by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine release and inhibiting inflammasome activation. A possible connection of trehalose with the gut-brain axis was also examined. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic effects of trehalose in neurodegenerative diseases. According to the conclusions drawn from this study, trehalose is a promising neuroprotective agent as a result of its distinct mechanism of action, which makes this compound a candidate for further research and development of therapeutic strategies to combat neuronal damage and promote neuroprotection in various neurological diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d35695e0dedb27618bf84d93772b6c89d04c2611bb298149072af195b7eea914","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
