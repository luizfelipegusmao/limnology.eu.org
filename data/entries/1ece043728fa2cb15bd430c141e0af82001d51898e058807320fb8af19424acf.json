One of the methods employed in solid waste management is street sweeping which is done by street sweepers. Street sweepers are being predisposed to respiratory and non-respiratory infection like eye infection, skin infection and musculoskeletal disorders. This analytical cross-sectional study enrolled a total of 233 street sweepers to assess perceived occupational health risks, particulate matters (i.e., PM<sub>2.5,</sub> PM<sub>5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> measured in (mg/m<sup>3</sup>)) dust and noise exposure levels in decibel units–dB(A), and utilization of protective personnel equipment among street sweepers in Mwanza city, Northern Tanzania. Modified poison regression was used to determine the association between exposures variables (i.e., sociodemographic, and socioeconomic factors) and outcomes ((i.e., noise dose level and particulate matters))). More than half (50.2%) of the participants were aged between 46–80 years. Their Median age was 46(IQR: 28–59) years. Large percent (63.1%) of the participants reported that their working environment have high health risks. The Median concentrations of the noise dose and particulates matters were 85.4 (IQR = 76.4–92.3) for noise dose, 13426 (IQR = 9637–17632) for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 5522 (IQR = 2453–7679) for PM<sub>5</sub>, and 2310(IQR = 1263–3201). The Median concentrations of the noise dose and particulates matters were 85.4 (IQR = 76.4–92.3) for noise dose in decibel units dB(A); 13426 (IQR = 9637–17632) for PM<sub>2.5</sub>; 5522 (IQR = 2453–7679) for PM<sub>5</sub>; and 2310(IQR = 1263–3201) for PM<sub>10</sub>. Individual Street sweepers in Mwanza city are highly exposed to noise dose and fine particulate matters at levels above the reference values for human of 85dB(A) and 5mg/m<sup>3</sup> respectively, making it a public health issue that requires holistic public health measures.","author":"Elias C.
