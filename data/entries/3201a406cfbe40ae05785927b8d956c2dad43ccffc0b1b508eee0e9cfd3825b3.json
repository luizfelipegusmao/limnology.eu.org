{"title":"Target Identification in Breast Cancer through Network Pharmacology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1605/v1","date":1716532681000,"content":"In this study, we utilized the UniProt database to extract breast cancer genes Total 2658 genes in Homo sapiens are obtain. Then 166 genes are taken and after delating duplicates 158 genes were remains. These genes were then analyzed for their biological pathways using Gene Ontology enrichment analysis through the Genecodis platform, resulting in the identification of 12 unique genes involved in disease pathways. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was conducted using the STRING database and Cytoscape software, identifying ANLN,TREM1,LZTFL1,OXSM,PLA2G3,TAS2R13,ABCB10,ECT2,TRPC,BCAS3,PLA2G3,ZDHHC7 and ERBB2 as potential gene targets for breast cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3201a406cfbe40ae05785927b8d956c2dad43ccffc0b1b508eee0e9cfd3825b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
