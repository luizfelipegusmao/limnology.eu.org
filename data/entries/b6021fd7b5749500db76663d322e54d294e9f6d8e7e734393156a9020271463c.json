{"title":"Orange passion fruit (Passiflora caerulea L.) as a new raw material for acetic fermentation: evaluation of organic acids and phenolic profile, in vitro digestion, and biological activities","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13663?af=R","date":1725860041000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>This study evaluated for the first time the potential of orange passion fruit as a base for alcoholic and acetic fermentations, with a view to assessing its profile of organic acids and polyphenols, <i>in vitro</i> digestion, and biological activities.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In terms of aliphatic organic acids, malic acid was the majority in the wine (3.19 g L<sup>−1</sup>), while in the vinegar, it was acetic acid (46.84 g L<sup>−1</sup>). 3,4-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-DHB) was the major phenolic compound in the wine and vinegar samples (3443.93 and 2980.00 μg L<sup>−1</sup>, respectively). After the <i>in vitro</i> gastrointestinal simulation stage, the wine showed high bioaccessibility for the compounds sinipaldehyde (82.97%) and 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,4-DHBA, 81.27%), while the vinegar exhibited high bioaccessibility for sinipaldehyde (89.39%). Through multivariate analysis, it was observed that 3,4-DHB was highly concentrated in the different digested fractions obtained from the wine. In contrast, in the vinegar, the stability of isorahmenetin and Quercetin 3-o-rhamnoside was observed during the <i>in vitro</i> digestion simulation. Lastly, the vinegar stood out for its inhibition rates of α-amylase (23.93%), α-glucoside (18.34%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (10.92%). In addition, the vinegar had an inhibitory effect on the pathogenic microorganisms <i>Salmonella enteritidis</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Orange passion fruit has proved to be a promising raw material for the development of fermented beverages. Therefore, this study provides an unprecedented perspective on the use and valorization of orange passion fruit, contributing significantly to the advancement of knowledge about fermented products and the associated nutritional and functional possibilities. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Bruna Rafaela da Silva Monteiro Wanderley, \nNatália Duarte de Lima, \nCarolina Turnes Pasini Deolindo, \nRafaela Ansiliero, \nAniela Pinto Kempka, \nLiziane Schittler Moroni, \nFrancisca Jamila Correia Louredo, \nLuciano Valdemiro Gonzaga, \nAna Carolina Oliveira Costa, \nRenata Dias De Mello Castanho Amboni, \nAna Carolina Moura de Sena Aquino, \nCarlise Beddin Fritzen‐Freire","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"b6021fd7b5749500db76663d322e54d294e9f6d8e7e734393156a9020271463c","category":"Environment"}
