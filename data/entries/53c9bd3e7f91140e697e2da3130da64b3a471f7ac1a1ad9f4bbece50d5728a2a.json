{"title":"Evidence of Warm Welcome From the Cymodocea nodosa (Tracheophyta, Alismatales) Meadow in the Seas of Taranto (Southern Italy, Mediterranean Sea)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1551/v1","date":1716459152000,"content":"The collection of photo shoots during the systematic monitoring activities is useful to witness the ecological role of marine phanerogams as hosts for a rich variety of organisms in coastal and transitional waters. Cymodocea nodosa is present in the Taranto seas. In the Mar Piccolo, it reached high covers in short times, up to 100%, due to the bettering of the environmental conditions. The most recent observations showed that it offers welcoming towards several vertebrates and invertebrates, native and non-indigenous, as well as to micro and macroalgae. The NPPR funded activities will make these observations more robust and structural.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53c9bd3e7f91140e697e2da3130da64b3a471f7ac1a1ad9f4bbece50d5728a2a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
