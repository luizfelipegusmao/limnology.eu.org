{"title":"Loss of Independence after Index Hospitalization Following Proximal Femur Fracture: A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1488/v1","date":1716442521000,"content":"Purpose: Proximal Femur Fractures (PFFs) in elder patients lead to decreased productivity. Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) are non-home destinations for post-discharge disposition. This study aims to evaluate the loss of independence (LOI) following PFFs and examine the economic impact it entails. Method: Literature from various databases was collected and analyzed retrospectively. The inclusion criteria included patients age &gt;18 years and articles published after 1990. All studies were screened and a PRISMA chart was used to demonstrate the search process. 24 studies were finally used for review. Results: LOI following PFFs significantly increases with age. Fractures in geriatrics avail a significant amount of post-care resources and had longer lengths of stay. Furthermore, six pre-operative risk factors were identified for non-home disposition including age &gt;75, female, non-Caucasian race, Medicare status, prior depression, Charlson Comorbidity Index. Patients discharged directly to home have lower total cost compared to those discharged to rehabilitation units. Loss of independence increases with advancing age. Discussion: PFFs can lead to serious loss of independence among elderly patients with direct impact on economic, social, psychological aspects and the healthcare system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b436e80f46c87e5ff71b2eb1f5db7a622d4142c1779b1be039d57110bafc7a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
