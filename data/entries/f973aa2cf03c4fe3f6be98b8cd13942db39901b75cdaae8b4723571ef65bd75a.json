{"title":"A Cox Proportional Hazards Model with Latent Covariates Reflecting Student&rsquo;s Preparation, Motives, and Expectations for the Analysis of Time to Degree","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2248/v1","date":1727674695000,"content":"Issues related to the duration of university studies, have attracted the interest of many researchers from different scientific fields, as far back as the middle of the 20th century. In this study, a Survival Analysis methodology, and more specifically a Cox Proportional hazards model, has been pro-posed to evaluate a theoretical framework/model that relates the risk a student either graduating on time or having a late graduation, with a number of observed and latent factors that have been proposed in the literature as the main determinants of degree completion. The major findings of the analysis suggest that the factors contributing to the shortening of the duration of studies in-clude high academic achievements at early stages, positive motivation, expectations, attitudes, and beliefs about studies. On the contrary, external situations, negative academic experiences and some individual characteristics of the students contribute to an extended duration of studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f973aa2cf03c4fe3f6be98b8cd13942db39901b75cdaae8b4723571ef65bd75a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
