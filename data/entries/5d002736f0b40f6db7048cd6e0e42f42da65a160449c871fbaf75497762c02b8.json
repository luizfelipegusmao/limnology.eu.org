Overcoming structural destruction indicates preventing the performance degradation due to structural destruction, thus, there is a growing interest in the development of materials that possess the ability. The self-healing mechanism is primarily attributed to i) the diffusion of matters at crack walls and ii) the formation of bonds with an adjacent crack face, which results in restoring of broken bonds and the reorganization of structures in the vicinity of the damage. However, seeking for the proper materials capable in self-healing-particularly in oxides-presents significant challenges due to their low mobility and intrinsic brittleness.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5d002736f0b40f6db7048cd6e0e42f42da65a160449c871fbaf75497762c02b8","category":"Environment"}
