{"title":"Severity Patterns in COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients in Spain. I-MOVE-COVID-19 Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1296/v1","date":1726560061000,"content":"In the frame of the I-MOVE-COVID-19 project, a cohort of 2050 patients admitted in two Spanish reference hospitals between March 2020 and December 2021 was selected, and a range of clinical factors data were collected at admission to assess their impact on the risk COVID-19 severity outcomes through a multivariate adjusted analysis and nomograms. The need for ventilation and ICU admission were found directly associated with a higher mortality risk (OR 6.9 and 3.2, respectively). The clinical predictors of mortality were need for ventilation and ICU, advanced age, neuromuscular disorders, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminaemia, dementia, cancer, elevated CPK and neutrophilia (OR between 1.8 and 3.5), whilst the presence of vomiting, sore throat and cough diminished risk of death (OR 0.5, 0.2 and 0.1 respectively). Admission to ICU was predicted by the need for ventilation, abdominal pain and elevated LDH (OR 371.0, 3.6 and 2.2, respectively) as risk factors; otherwise, it was prevented by advanced age (OR 0.5). In turn, the need for ventilation was predicted by low oxygen saturation, elevated LDH and CPK, diabetes, neutrophilia, obesity and elevated GGT (OR between 1.7 and 5.2), whilst prevented by hypertension (OR 0.5). These findings could enhance patient management and strategic interventions to combat COVID-19.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"174e66ead71c98c5bf706f7344dd8670e3a3763018d39945356a806c4d2c1a71","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
