While lamella preparation on plunge-frozen cellular samples has been studied extensively with DualBeams, different challenges are presented with larger, bulk tissue samples prepared by high pressure freezing. Enabling precise and targeted lamella prep on these tissue samples is critical to accessing the information within. With the key advantages of high milling currents, precise and automated lamella preparation and integrated optical imaging, the Arctis cryo DualBeam can solve these challenges efficiently.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"49048973d92f344e68be916945e9e2cad048c07f4f61ab29c3de8b222fcb85a7","category":"Environment"}
