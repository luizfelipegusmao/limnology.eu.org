{"title":"5 Hands-on 3: Introduction to developing Python computational pipelines for predictive machine learning modelling of livestock data","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/68/7757011?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This hands-on workshop aims to offer examples of computational pipelines that apply traditional predictive machine learning modelling techniques to animal science datasets with the purpose of solving classification and/or regression problems. The objective of this workshop is to provide the attendants with fully functional and customizable computational pipelines developed in Python. The workshop is structured in a hands-on format and includes a combination of basic notions about machine learning and relevant algorithms, evaluation measures, evaluation strategies and Python code examples. To avoid technical problems related to installing a Python environment on personal computers, we recommend the registrants to acquire access on the Repl.it platform (<a href=\"https://replit.com/\">https://replit.com/</a>) by creating a free account prior to attending the workshop.
