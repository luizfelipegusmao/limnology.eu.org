{"title":"Bone Drilling: A Review with a Lab Case Study of Bone Layer Classification Using Vibration Signal and Long Short-Term Memory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0440/v1","date":1717740435000,"content":"In orthopedics, bone drilling is a crucial part of a surgical method commonly carried out for internal fixation in bone fracture treatment. The primary purpose of bone drilling is the creation of holes for screw insertion to immobilize fractured parts. The bone drilling task depends on the orthopedist and surgeonâ€™s high level of skill and experience. This paper aimed to provide a summary of previously published review studies in the field of bone drilling. This review paper also presents a comprehensive review of the application of machine learning for bone drilling and as a future direction for the automation system. This review can also help medical surgeons and bone drillers understand the latest improvements through parameter selection and optimization strategies to reduce bone damage in bone drilling procedures. Apart from the review study, bone drilling vibration data collected in the University laboratory experiment is also presented in this study. The vibration data consist of three different layers of femur cow bone which are processed and classified using several machine learning methods. LSTM is, used in the bone drilling classification study to prove that the layers of the bone drilling are associated with the vibration signal and can be classified and predicted using the machine learning method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44fce442f18b1afce124ec084691674f2b39b3004c40eda20e82ac1cb29c4078","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
