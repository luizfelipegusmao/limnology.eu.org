{"title":"Options for Performing DNN-Based Causal Speech Denoising Using the U-Net Architecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0143/v1","date":1727920319000,"content":"Speech enhancement technology seeks to improve the quality and intelligibility of speech signals degraded by noise, particularly in telephone communications. Recent advancements have focused on leveraging deep neural networks (DNN), especially U-Net architectures, for effective denoising. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a 6-level skip-connected U-Net constructed using either conventional convolution activation blocks (CCAB) or innovative global local former blocks (GLFB) across different processing domains: temporal waveform, short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and short-time discrete cosine transform (STDCT). Our results indicate that the U-Nets can receive better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) when applied in the STFT and STDCT domains, with comparable short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) scores across all domains. Notably, the GLFB-based U-Net outperforms its CCAB counterpart in metrics such as CSIG, CBAK, COVL, and PESQ, while maintaining fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, we propose domain-specific composite loss functions, considering the acoustic and perceptual characteristics of the spectral domain, to enhance the perceptual quality of denoised speech. Our findings provide valuable insights that can guide the optimization of DNN designs for causal speech denoising.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"afa839d3eb455c281af5e54c14b33c3115e922c732d46fc85c2f310dedd6adb2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
