{"title":"Morphological and Mechanical Tube Feet Plasticity among Populations of Sea Urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/doi/10.1093/iob/obae022/7709461?rss=1","date":1720396800000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>Sea urchins rely on an adhesive secreted by their tube feet to cope with the hydrodynamic forces of dislodgement common in nearshore, high wave-energy environments. Tube feet adhere strongly to the substrate and detach voluntarily for locomotion. In the purple sea urchin, <span>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</span>, adhesive performance depends on both the type of substrate and the population of origin, where some substrates and populations are more adhesive than others. To explore the source of this variation, we evaluated tube foot morphology (disc surface area) and mechanical properties (maximum disc tenacity and stem breaking force) of populations native to substrates with different lithologies: sandstone, mudstone, and granite. We found differences among populations, where sea urchins native to mudstone substrates had higher disc surface area and maximum disc tenacity than sea urchins native to sandstone substrates. In a lab-based reciprocal transplant experiment, we attempted to induce a plastic response in tube foot morphology. We placed sea urchins on nonnative substrates (i.e., mudstone sea urchins were placed on sandstone and vice versa), while keeping a subgroup of both populations on their original substrates as a control. Instead of a reciprocal morphological response, we found that all treatments, including the control, reduced their disc area in laboratory conditions. The results of this study show differences in morphology and mechanical properties among populations, which explains population differences in adhesive performance. Additionally, this work highlights the importance of considering the impact of phenotypic plasticity in response to captivity when interpreting the results of laboratory studies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Organismal Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ad96bcf7a80ab7e3a1a88c34298d761f9695964c0badbbef4e1166baa6580fcc","entryHash":"2da87939ed01e3b3fc582df7d047c492eb019b95ae2929e52d34b9f99f6022d0","category":"Environment"}
