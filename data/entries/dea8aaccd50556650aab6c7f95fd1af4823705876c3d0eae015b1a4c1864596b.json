Read</p>\r\n\r\nInsecticidal <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> Berliner (Bt) toxins produced by transgenic cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> L.) plants have become an essential component of cotton pest management. Bt toxins are the primary management tool in transgenic cotton for lepidopteran pests, the most important of which is the bollworm (<i>Helicoverpa zea</i> Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in the United States (U.S.). However, bollworm larvae that survive after consuming Bt toxins may experience sublethal effects, which could alter interactions with other organisms, such as natural enemies. Experiments were conducted to evaluate how sublethal effects of a commercial Bt product (Dipel) incorporated into artificial diet and from Bt cotton flowers impact predation from the convergent lady beetle (<i>Hippodamia convergens</i> Guérin-Méneville) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), common in cotton fields of the mid-southern U.S. Sublethal effects were detected through reduced weight and slower development in bollworm larvae which fed on Dipel incorporated into artificial diet, Bollgard II, and Bollgard 3 cotton flowers. Sublethal effects from proteins incorporated into artificial diet were found to significantly alter predation from third instar lady beetle larvae. Predation of bollworm larvae also increased significantly after feeding for three days on a diet incorporated with Bt proteins. These results suggest that the changes in larval weight and development induced by Bt can be used to help predict consumption of bollworm larvae by the convergent lady beetle. These findings are essential to understanding the potential level of biological control in Bt cotton where lepidopteran larvae experience sublethal effects.","author":"Blake H.
