{"title":"Citizen Science in Meteorology: Enhancing Weather Understanding through Innovative Instrumentation and Community Engagement","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0023/v1","date":1717462348000,"content":"Citizen science has emerged as a potent approach for environmental monitoring, leveraging the collective efforts of volunteers to gather data at unprecedented scales. Within the framework of the I-CHANGE project, MeteoTracker, a citizen science initiative, was employed to collect and analyze meteorological measurements. This paper presents the results of our analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of citizen science in generating valuable environmental data. Through MeteoTracker, volunteers contributed to a comprehensive dataset, enabling insights into local weather patterns and trends. Our findings underscore the potential of citizen science to augment traditional monitoring efforts and inform decision-making processes in environmental research and management. The paper discusses the methodology employed, including data collection and statistical analysis techniques. Results highlight the reliability and accuracy of citizen-generated data, as well as the strengths of the MeteoTracker platform. The implications of our findings for environmental research, policy development, and public engagement are discussed, along with recommendations for enhancing the effectiveness of citizen science initiatives in environmental monitoring.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24aa7e596c57c75be66e9c19d7b93a1019ec337010ae5a0ed50f5877c4e6c132","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
