{"title":"Parent Mediated Autism Intervention Through a Culturally Informed Lens: Parents Taking Action and Pivotal Response Training with Latine Families","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1703/v1","date":1729582306000,"content":"Background The prevalence of autism has increased substantially among Latine children, however, few service systems are prepared to provide culturally relevant services. Parents Taking Action (PTA), is a culturally informed parent-mediated psychoeducation program designed to meet the informational needs of Latine families of children with autism. The purpose of this study was to pilot a hybrid model of intervention by including direct parent coaching through pivotal response training (PRT) along with PTA among Latina mothers of children with autism. Methods Ten Latina mothers of children 8 and under with autism participated in this study. Mothers received PTA from two bilingual trained promotoras (community health workers). PTA included 14 2-hour psychoeducation sessions. Mothers also received 4 one-hour sessions of PRT from bilingual/bicultural coaches. Results Paired samples t-tests indicated significant increases in family outcomes, self-efficacy in using the intervention strategies, and frequency of using strategies, from pre to post-test. Conclusions This study suggests that culturally informed parent-mediated autism intervention coupled with parent coaching positively affects family outcomes among Latine families of children with autism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"becf12a92eebde4b776714d2369da8a747161d41fb3d5a13e28215671ee9ae84","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
