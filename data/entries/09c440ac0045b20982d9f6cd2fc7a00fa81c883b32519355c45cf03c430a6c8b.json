{"title":"A culture-independent nucleic acid diagnostics method for use in the detection and quantification of <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> complex contamination in aqueous finished pharmaceutical products","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303773","date":1715868000000,"content":"<p>by Huong Duong, Elizabeth Minogue, Shannon Fullbrook, Thomas Barry, Kate Reddington</p>\r\n\r\nThe <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> complex (Bcc) is the number one bacterial complex associated with contaminated Finished Pharmaceutical Products (FPPs). This has resulted in multiple healthcare related infection morbidity and mortality events in conjunction with significant FPP recalls globally. Current microbiological quality control of FPPs before release for distribution depends on lengthy, laborious, non-specific, traditional culture-dependent methods which lack sensitivity. Here, we present the development of a culture-independent Bcc Nucleic Acid Diagnostic (NAD) method for detecting Bcc contaminants associated with Over-The-Counter aqueous FPPs. The culture-independent Bcc NAD method was validated to be specific for detecting Bcc at different contamination levels from spiked aqueous FPPs. The accuracy in Bcc quantitative measurements was achieved by the high degree of Bcc recovery from aqueous FPPs. The low variation observed between several repeated Bcc quantitative measurements further demonstrated the precision of Bcc quantification in FPPs. The robustness of the culture-independent Bcc NAD method was determined when its accuracy and precision were not significantly affected during testing of numerous aqueous FPP types with different ingredient matrices, antimicrobial preservative components and routes of administration. The culture-independent Bcc NAD method showed an ability to detect Bcc in spiked aqueous FPPs at a concentration of 20 Bcc CFU/mL. The rapid (â‰¤ 4 hours from sample in to result out), robust, culture-independent Bcc NAD method presented provides rigorous test specificity, accuracy, precision, and sensitivity. This method, validated with equivalence to ISO standard ISO/TS 12869:2019, can be a valuable diagnostic tool in supporting microbiological quality control procedures to aid the pharmaceutical industry in preventing Bcc contamination of aqueous FPPs for consumer safety.","author":"Huong Duong","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"09c440ac0045b20982d9f6cd2fc7a00fa81c883b32519355c45cf03c430a6c8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
