{"title":"Nation-wide survey of oral care practice in Japanese intensive care units: A descriptive study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301258","date":1711720800000,"content":"<p>by Tomoki Kuribara, Takeshi Unoki, Sachika Yamakita, Naoya Hashimoto, Yasuyo Yoshino, Hideaki Sakuramoto, Gen Aikawa, Saiko Okamoto</p>\r\n\r\nOral care for critically ill patients helps provide comfort and prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia. However, a standardized protocol for oral care in intensive care units is currently unavailable. Thus, this study aimed to determine the overall oral care practices, including those for intubated patients, in Japanese intensive care units. We also discuss the differences in oral care methods between Japanese ICUs and ICUs in other countries. This study included all Japanese intensive care units meeting the authoritiesâ€™ standard set criteria, with a minimum of 0.5 nurses per patient at all times and admission of adult patients requiring mechanical ventilation. An online survey was used to collect data. Survey responses were obtained from one representative nurse per intensive care unit. Frequency analysis was performed, and the percentage of each response was calculated. A total of 609 hospitals and 717 intensive care units nationwide participated; among these, responses were collected from 247 intensive care units (34.4%). Of these, 215 (87.0%) and 32 (13.0%) reported standardized and non-standardized oral care, respectively. Subsequently, the data from 215 intensive care units that provided standardized oral care were analyzed in detail. The most common frequency of practicing oral care was three times a day (68.8%). Moreover, many intensive care units provided care at unequal intervals (79.5%), mainly in the morning, daytime, and evening. Regarding oral care methods, 96 (44.7%) respondents used only a toothbrush, while 116 (54.0%) used both a toothbrush and a non-brushing method. The findings of our study reveal current oral care practices in ICUs in Japan. In particular, most ICUs provide oral care three times a day at unequal intervals, and almost all use toothbrushes as a common tool for oral care. The results suggest that some oral care practices in Japanese ICUs differ from those in ICUs in other countries.","author":"Tomoki Kuribara","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d4575488ba1054915bc4f70044cb30aa273cd06d4979727af89b17135003ff26","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
