{"title":"Study on the Spatial Layout Patterns of Townhouses: A Case Study of Kaohsiung City","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2064/v1","date":1724942926000,"content":"Due to their independent structure, piping, and access, townhouses offer great flexibility in floor plan changes and high spatial autonomy, making them the mainstream housing type in Taiwan. This study focuses on row houses and examines 2022 completion cases in Kaohsiung City. It collects floor plans from 14 newly constructed buildings, totaling 227 units, and analyzes spatial dimensions including facade width, depth, habitable room, staircases, bathrooms, and total floor area for each case. The objective of this study is to examine the spatial layout of row houses in Kaohsiung City, with the aim of providing reference for future planning and design of such structures. The study resulted showed that 81.8% of the row houses analyzed have a total floor area per unit ranging from 136 to 192 mÂ², a facade width between 4.1 and 6.38 meters, and a building depth from 7.67 to 12.68 meters. In addition, low negative correlation between facade width and total floor area, a high positive correlation between building depth and total floor area, and a moderate negative correlation between facade width and building depth. The spatial distribution within these houses includes 78% allocated to habitable room, 13.1% to staircases, and 8.7% to bathrooms. The total area of habitable room and bathrooms increases with the total floor area of the building. However, the total area of staircases remains almost constant as the area of habitable room increases. Furthermore, the most common location for staircase planning is the rear-right (RB) position, while the least common is the rear-left (LB) position. Among various staircase types, the C-shaped staircase has the largest average area per floor and the highest average proportion. Conversely, the I-shaped staircase has the smallest average area and the lowest average proportion. The U-shaped staircase is the most frequently planned, whereas the C-shaped staircase is the least frequently used.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c5adb64bf16bc789967545ab9b6d0a486d60b14079bac51939e05f41d1e78944","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
