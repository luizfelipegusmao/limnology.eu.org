Our pick of the best Mac antivirus software will help keep you and your Mac or MacBook safe from whatever rogue software comes your way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Macs have traditionally been a far less tempting target for malware writers, leading some to believe that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670537/do-macs-need-antivirus.html\">Macs don’t even need antivirus</a>, but their increasing popularity means they’re not immune from viruses and other types of malware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone is a security expert, or necessarily knows <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/225517/checking-your-mac-for-viruses-wait-what.html\">how to check their Mac for viruses</a>, but you also don’t need to be a security expert to keep your Mac safe. A good Mac antivirus product will do it all for you, protecting your Mac from new and known malware, blocking <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672565/can-macs-get-ransomware-and-how-to-stop-a-ransomware-attack.html\">ransomware</a>, protecting older systems from security vulnerabilities caused by outdated software, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most difficult decision for you as a Mac user is deciding which of the multiple Mac antivirus programs on the market is going to do the best job of keeping you and your data safe, and which ultimately offers the best value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our Macworld experts are here to help</strong>, and <em>no-one</em> is better placed to guide you on which antivirus to choose for your Mac than the leading authority on Mac products and products built for Mac (the clue is in our name). We thoroughly test all Mac antivirus products from a usability and functionality perspective, and use a combination of our own testing data and AV Comparatives/AV-Test lab data to ascertain which is the most reliable and trustworthy security product for your Mac. These are the security products our own editors would (and do) choose for their own machines, so you can place your full trust in our Mac antivirus recommendations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our top pick is <a href=\"https://offer.intego.com/Widg_8cbj3hvuz?aff_sub=1-1-668850-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Intego Mac Internet Security</a>. But depending on the type and number of devices you want to protect, and your budget, you may prefer one of the other Mac antivirus recommendations in our list below. You won’t find every Mac antivirus product we’ve tested here, only the very best contenders, meaning you can be sure that any of these products will do a decent job of protecting your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If value is the most important criteria for you, we also recommend looking at our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673359/mac-antivirus-deals-cheap-antivirus-software-to-protect-your-mac.html\">best Mac antivirus deals round-up</a>.

The job of VirusBarrier is self-explanatory, but the second is a two-way firewall, a component you don’t often see included with security software at this sort of price. Together these tools offer a high level of protection against direct and indirect unwanted software and malware threats. </p>\n\n<p>VirusBarrier X9 can scan every file on any connected disk, including within compressed archives, and it can scan emails and connected iOS devices. Suspicious files are quarantined, and these can then be marked as trusted, left quarantined or a repair attempt can be made.</p>\n\n<p>In the June 2023 test by AV-Comparatives, Intego’s VirusBarrier received an “Approved” rating and showed good performance and improvement compared to previous years. According to AV-Comparitives, it detected a good 99.4 percent of Mac malware, 97 percent of PUAs (Potentially Unwanted Programs) and 100 percent of Windows viruses, so it can be recommended. The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-macos/macos-ventura/june-2023/&amp;xcust=1-1-668850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">AV-Test</a> in June 2023 scored 5.5 out of 6 for protection, 5 out of 6 for performance and full marks for usability. </p>\n\n<p>In our testing, Intego VirusBarrier caught all our malware and ‘uninvited software’ samples including ones for other platforms. We were also warned when we opened a disk image with a malicious installer.</p>\n\n<p>The tool offers good compatibility with macOS, and unlike some of the competitors, it looks like a real Mac program.  </p>\n\n<p>Intego’s Internet Security bundle costs $24.99/£20.00 for the first year (if you use <a href=\"https://offer.intego.com/en/mac-av?aff_sub=1-1-668850-1-0-0\">this link</a>). There’s also a free VirusBarrier Scanner, which you can download on the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/virusbarrier-scanner/id1200445649&amp;xcust=1-1-668850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Mac App Store</a>, </p>\n\n<p>The Mac Premium Bundle X9 adds three more sets of capabilities for $39.99/£23.99 for the first year: the backup prowess of Personal Backup (a good ‘belt’ addition to your Time Machine ‘braces’), the useful cleaning, tidying and general speed optimizing tricks of Mac Washing Machine, and finally the multi-user safe surfing intelligence of ContentBarrier. Sure, that last one is not something everyone needs, but it’s great for parents. Whichever one of these software suites you choose, you can be sure they offer some of the best protection available for your Mac.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://offer.intego.com/Widg_8cbj3hvuz?aff_sub=1-1-668850-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">You can get Intego Mac Internet Security X9 here</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667651/intego-mac-internet-security-x9-review-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIntego Mac Internet Security X9 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.

As such it is basic, but it’s effective at protecting you from viruses, spyware, and malware. </p>\n\n<p>Despite being free, AVG covers all the bases: blocking viruses and malware from websites, downloads, and email attachments. AVG will scan applications and check every file and remove threats from your Mac. It auto updates so you shouldn’t miss out on protection from the latest threats. </p>\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-macos/&amp;xcust=1-1-668850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AV-Test</a> for 2023, AVG was certified and was considered Outstanding for protection, performance and usability.  <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.av-comparatives.org/tests/mac-security-test-review-2023/&amp;xcust=1-1-668850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">AV-Comparatives</a> June 2023 tests saw AVG Antivirus Free for Mac score 100% for Mac Malware Protection, 99% for Mac PUA Protection, and 100% for detecting Windows malware, which were better results than some paid-for options.  </p>\n\n<p>Though it lacks the advanced features of paid antivirus products, it handles the core tasks cleanly and seamlessly. However, if you need to resolve any advanced issues you will need to pay to upgrade to the full version of the software, which is about $2/£2 per month for a one-year subscription.

Norton 360 is available in Plus, Standard and Deluxe (there is also an Advanced edition in the U.K., and a Select +LifeLock edition in the U.S. both of which support up to 10 devices). The core Norton 360 protection features do a good job, but the cloud backup benefits are missing from the Mac edition. If you go beyond the Standard edition you get Dark Web Monitoring, Parental Control and School Time, and licenses for up to five devices (for the Deluxe edition) or 10 (for the Advanced or Select versions). </p>\n\n<p>Norton 360 focuses on catching unwanted software, but it also offers some useful additional features including a VPN for securing personal data while online, and a tool for managing passwords, bank card details and similar data. You’ll also get protection against identity theft with some editions, Norton calls this Dark Web Monitoring. The service regularly checks whether your email, telephone number, credit card number or other contact details have fallen into the wrong hands. Note that the Cloud Backup feature doesn’t work on macOS, but that is more of an extra rather than a vital part of the package.</p>\n\n<p>There is also protection against unwanted, uninvited and possibly malicious software. A Norton Password Manager utility that also helps manage wallet data for autofill payments, addresses, notes and favorites. Much of these are things that macOS does already, but the clear interface makes it easy to understand. </p>\n\n<p>Beware that the first year is discounted, so you will be charged more in subsequent years. The price currently varies between $19.99/£19.99 and $29.99/£29.99 for the first year (renewing at a higher price, as is so often the case with antivirus suites).</p>\n\n<p>Norton performed well in tests and was efficient at spotting unwanted and potentially risky software, from browser search engine hack scripts to actual trojans.

If you want just a virus scanner, Avast’s Free Antivirus, which is the free version of Avast Premium Security, gets our recommendation. Avast One Essential is the free version of Avast One, and offers some additional functions compared to Avast Free Antivirus. It includes options such as ransomware protection, privacy protection, recommends cleaning up the hard drive without being asked, and searches for data leaks. There’s also a free VPN service with 5GB data volume per week, but, you can only select the location in another country for an additional charge.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100470607-13637464?sid=1-1-668850-1-0-0&amp;url=https://www.avast.com/en-gb/premium-security#mac\" target=\"_blank\">Avast Premium Security for Mac</a> does its job well overall. It’s a well-featured suite that will protect from all sorts of nasties including watching for browser script hacks, potential ransomware and other remote attack activity. It will, of course, also scan for potentially unwanted programs and actual malware threats, whether on your Mac or your removable media or in email attachments.</p>\n\n<p>Custom scheduled scans can be set up, although the automatic background monitoring teamed with occasional specific manual scans is likely to be enough for most requirements. Wi-Fi network monitoring for vulnerabilities is another feature this software offers, and the Real Site option watches for fake sites pretending to be legitimate shopping or banking sites, a serious risk that goes beyond just watching for unwanted files on your own Mac. It is very effective at all these things, although we found that customizing its behavior can be a little fiddly.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few niggles such as the fact that the File Shield monitoring slows down file copy times a bit and the unwanted upselling for Cleanup Premium and. If you are using the free versions of Avast’s apps expect even more upselling! </p>\n\n<p>If you’d prefer to save your money, or get an idea of what’s on offer before parting with your cash, you might like to try the two free Antivirus for Mac solutions from Avast.  </p>\n\n<p>Just because they are free doesn’t mean these solutions are ineffective.

One of the biggest challenges was installation. In order to be able to check files, a virus scanner must install some background programs and needs access to the file system, so you will have to jump through some hoops to allow access. None of this is Avast’s fault, of course. </p>\n\n<p>As for the interface, we found the three-column overview with all the listed functions to be very cluttered and a bit overwhelming, but by far the biggest annoyance was the exaggerated warnings about alleged security gaps, with Avast One classifying our home WLAN as insecure and recommending the use of a VPN. </p>\n\n<p>You can get <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100470607-13637464?sid=1-1-668850-1-0-0&amp;url=https://www.avast.com/en-gb/premium-security#mac\" target=\"_blank\">Avast Premium Security for Mac here</a>.

We’ve looked at them all. </p>\n\n<p>Bitdefender Total Security ($39.99/£29.99 for the first year and then $99.99/£74.99) is an effective tool for keeping your Mac safe, and it will also protect Windows PC, an iOS and Android devices. The bundled VPN is very basic and gives you only 200MB of data per day, but the rest of the suite of tools is effective and easy to manage.</p>\n\n<p>But when you compare what the Mac version offers compared to the Windows version, you’ll feel quite hard done by. There’s no password manager, no social network protection, no webcam or microphone protection, no Wi-Fi security advisor and plenty of other features that Windows users get for the same price. If your goal is simply to keep your Mac protected from malware, then Bitdefender does a great job. But you can find better value elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac ($29.99/£24.98 for the first year and then $59.99/£39.99) offers good virus detection (of both Mac and Windows viruses).

The free version must be manually run. Once on your Mac, it offers Quick Scan, Deep Scan, and custom location scan options, which allow for a quick overview scan of critical components, a deep scan of every file and archive on your drive, and the ability to scan custom folders or external volumes as needed. </p>\n\n<p>While Bitdefender Virus Scanner can locate, quarantine, and delete malware, there were instances in which the application was unable to delete infected files and instead held them in quarantine at which point we had to go hunting for them as the Reveal in Finder button didn’t work. Ominously, Bitdefender has retired the free Virus Scanner for Windows, so the free Mac version’s days may be numbered. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668124/bitdefender-total-security-2021-review-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBitdefender Total Security review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6.

While <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1100liSb7/pubref:1-1-668850-1-0-0/destination:https://www.avira.com/en/free-security%0A\">Avira Free Security for Mac</a> lets you run a quick scan to check out system files and other vulnerable areas, or a full scan to analyze your entire Mac for malware, but not much else. </p>\n\n<p>In Avira Prime a single large window presents the various features, from scans to app management and cleanup, although a couple of its features use a separate panel for a web-based console. In our tests it detected all our compromised files and installers. It doesn’t look inside zip archives or disk images, but it pounces as soon as items are extracted from these.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, even while Avira Prime is actively scanning for trouble it has such a small impact on the general performance of our Mac that we wouldn’t notice it without comparing timings. </p>\n\n<p>Avira Prime scored well in AV-Comparatives’ June 2023 <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.av-comparatives.org/tests/mac-security-test-review-2023/&amp;xcust=1-1-668850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">tests</a>, with 99% Mac Malware Protection, 99% PUA protection and 100% Windows Malware detection.

But most actually require a paid subscription, so the product’s overall usefulness is limited and the constant sales pitches are annoying.</p>\n\n<p>The free app will run scans daily, weekly, or monthly. You can also create a custom scan. There are also real-time virus protection scans to scan new files saved to your computer or downloaded from the internet. You have to pay to scan a USB drive. Malware discovered is automatically quarantined. Avira was effective at detecting and stopping malware when we tested it.</p>\n\n<p>The free version of Avira includes a junk cleaner that can identify issues via a smart scan, but you need to pay to actually clean up anything beyond the junk files. </p>\n\n<p>The old adage of “you get what you pay for” is certainly true with Avira Free Security. Take away the tools that require a subscription, and you’re left with the antivirus feature, a limited VPN, a password manager that works only in Safari, and a junk file cleaner. </p>\n\n<p>You can get <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1100liSb7/pubref:1-1-668850-1-0-0/destination:https://www.avira.com%0A\" target=\"_blank\">Avira Prime here.</a> Also consider <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1100liSb7/pubref:1-1-668850-1-0-0/destination:https://www.avira.com/en/free-security%0A\" target=\"_blank\">Avira Free Security for Mac</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668094/avira-free-security-for-mac-review.html\">Avira Free Security for Mac review</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668098/avira-prime-for-mac-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAvira Prime review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8.

You can also select an external drive or connected USB stick for scanning.

Unfortunately, the Mac version falls short of many of the features of the Windows version. Malwarebytes Premium for Mac includes the basic virus and malware scanning as well as the ability to detect malicious apps, or PUPs (potentially unwanted program). The real-time protection constantly monitors your system for security threats, automatically blocking and quarantining anything that could infect your computer.</p>\n\n<p>But it doesn’t directly come with protection against malicious links and phishing attempts. Nor does it offer safeguards against ransomware and zero-day exploits.</p>\n\n<p>There is a free version of Malwarebytes, but that just includes just basic virus scanning. The premium version costs $3.33/£2.50 billed monthly or $39.99/£29.99 billed annually for one device, and $6.67/£5.83 billed monthly or $79.99/£69.99 billed annually for five devices. There’s a free 14-day trial. </p>\n\n<p>Malwarebytes Premium on a Mac is accessible through a menu bar icon. Clicking the icon displays a menu with options to start a scan, temporarily turn off the malware protection and malicious app blocker, update the program, view and tweak its settings, and open the management console.</p>\n\n<p>From the management console, you can trigger a manual scan and set up scheduled scans to run on a recurring basis. A detection history displays all quarantined items. There’s an Allow list to add legitimate files or programs that were mistakenly flagged as malware to. </p>\n\n<p>The Window’s version of Malwarebytes Premium got almost top marks from <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/manufacturer/malwarebytes/&amp;xcust=1-1-668850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AV-Test</a> in April 2023 (but fell short with 5 out of 6 for protection).

But there are no options to run a quick scan or even to schedule a scan, unlike the Windows version which includes a quick scan. It provides real-time virus and spyware scanning to automatically block malware, and ‘DeepGuard’ monitors applications for any changes indicative of a malware infection. </p>\n\n<p>You can set up ID monitoring to check your email address for data breaches among your online accounts. The VPN is another defense and includes tracking protection to prevent advertisers from monitoring your online activity and a kill switch to quickly cut off all internet traffic. </p>\n\n<p>F-Secure offers a password vault that creates and stores secure logins for all your accounts. The password vault requires an extension that supports Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Safari isn’t yet supported. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, F-Secure doesn’t let you review blocked or deleted malicious files, and no setting allows you to quarantine files instead of removing them. </p>\n\n<p>F-Secure’s Safe (which was the old name for F-Secure Internet Security) was tested by AV-Test in June 2023 and scored 5 out of 6 for protection, 5.5 out of 6 for performance and 6 for usability. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668100/f-secure-total-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tF-Secure Total review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Mac Antivirus: Specs Comparison</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Developer</strong></th><th><strong>Product name</strong></th><th><strong>USB scan</strong></th><th><strong>Ransomware protection</strong></th><th><strong>Adware prevention</strong></th><th><strong>Anti phishing  protection</strong></th><th><strong>Email protection</strong></th><th><strong>Firewall</strong></th><th><strong>VPN</strong></th><th><strong>iOS version</strong></th><th><strong>Parental Controls</strong></th><th><strong>Support</strong></th><th><strong>Trial</strong></th><th><strong>Price</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Intego</strong></td><td>Internet Security X9</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>7 days</td><td>$49.99/£49.99 / ye ($24.99/£20.99 /yr deal)</td></tr><tr><td>AVG</td><td>AntiVirus for Mac</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>60 days</td><td>Free (Paid for version is $2.49 per month for one year / $2.39 a month for two-years / $2.29 a month for three-years)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Norton </strong></td><td>360 Deluxe</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$39.99/£34.99/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>McAfee</strong></td><td>Total Protection </td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$34.99/£34.99/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Avast </strong></td><td>Premium Security</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>60 days</td><td>$44.99/£39.99/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitdefender</strong></td><td>Total Security </td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$39.97/£34.99/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eset </strong></td><td>Cyber Security Pro </td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$49.95/£39.95/yr</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Trend Micro</strong></td><td>Antivirus for Mac</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$39.99/£49.95</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Avira </strong></td><td>Prime</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>30 days</td><td>$99.99/£85.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Mac Antivirus: Buying Advice</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><h2> FAQ </h2><hr />\n<div><div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Do Macs even need antivirus software?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Plenty of Mac users will tell you that Apple computers are inherently secure and don’t require protection. We’d argue that they are wrong, or at very least overconfident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long ago, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676327/silver-sparrow-malware-detected-on-m1-macs-what-you-need-to-know.html\">Silver Sparrow malware</a> was detected on Macs powered by the M1 processor and infected hundreds of thousands of Macs. And it’s just one example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bad guys are absolutely targeting Mac users – and they’re getting smarter and greedier. Cyber security is something you can’t afford to ignore, and good Mac antivirus will help keep you safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668710/how-secure-mac.html\">Macs are generally more secure</a> than their Windows brethren because macOS is a Unix-based operating system, which means it is sandboxed. This is like having a series of fire doors: even if malware gains access to your Mac, it is unable to spread to other areas of the machine. But while they are more difficult to exploit than Windows PCs, it is not impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More general advice can be found in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1432223/mac-security-tips-password-find-my-users-lockdown-mode.html\">Mac security tips</a>; and those who have been hit by a malware attack should see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671430/how-remove-virus-mac.html\">how to remove a virus from a Mac</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>What features should I look for in Mac antivirus?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>All Mac antivirus software packages find viruses using both on-demand- and always-on protection. The former examines individual files either during scheduled scans or when you decide to run one. This can take a long time, especially if you have a lot of files, and some antivirus products will hog your Mac’s processor power to prioritise the scan, so it’s worth selecting a convenient time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always-on malware protection protects you when a scan is not currently active. If malware arrives – perhaps via an email or a downloaded file – your antivirus software should detect and quarantine it. Quarantining a file involves moving it to a safe folder, allowing you to decide what to do with it. You’ll typically receive a notification of the discovered malware, but some Mac antivirus products can be more informative than others in these notifications (something we keep in mind in our testing).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The effectiveness of this on-demand and always-on virus protection is absolutely the most important thing when it comes to choosing Mac antivirus, but additional features may also affect your choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Mac security suites now include ransomware protection. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts your files and demands a fee to decrypt them. An anti-ransomware feature will typically block any app from writing to a user’s home folders, such as Documents or Photos, unless that app has been whitelisted. Some apps, such as Microsoft Word, are pre-approved, and you can whitelist any that you trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web protection via browser plugins or extensions is also a common component and aims to stop you (or your children) from visiting infected websites or handing over personal information when you shouldn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different vendors offer different add-ons, and it is certainly a case of you get what you pay for: free products will have fewer bells and whistles, but the most comprehensive Mac security suites will include password managers, parental controls, cloud storage and more. The underlying antimalware engine will usually be the same for all security products from a particular company, so you can save money if you don’t need all those extra features.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>3.</span>\n<h3>Should my Mac antivirus include a VPN?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>One of the add-ons you might find with Mac security products, although also commonly sold separately, is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668698/best-vpn-for-mac-2.html\">Mac VPN</a> (virtual private network). For many users these are of interest because they can mask your location and allow you to view things (like streaming series) that are otherwise off-limits in your location. But they also have a very real benefit for security, protecting your internet connection by encrypting it, which is especially useful when using public Wi-Fi networks. In this day and age we should all be using VPNs and, while we’d recommend buying a dedicated Mac VPN product, one built into your antivirus software is better than nothing – just be prepared to be nagged to upgrade to the full product.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>4.</span>\n<h3>What is the best value Mac antivirus?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Value is perceived differently by all users: for some the best value Mac antivirus is the free one, and for others it is the one that is affordable but includes the most useful add-ons. We prefer to consider value in terms of which is the best all-round offering, rather than the budget deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there are ways you can save money even on the more expensive products. Bear in mind that all antivirus for Mac apps are sold as yearly subscriptions, and often the first year has a hefty discount. When that first year is up, there’s nothing stopping you switching to another product and benefiting from that discount again. Alternatively, opt for a three- or even five-year subscription to save even more money – and why not: it’s not like viruses are going to disappear in the meantime and you won’t need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the best Mac antivirus products can also cater to your other devices – and not just iPads and iPhones, but also Windows and Android devices. If you have multiple devices in your household, this can present a huge saving.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>5.</span>\n<h3>How do I spot fake Mac antivirus software?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Because many of us are waking up to the idea that malware is a threat to the Mac, malware writers have made it their business to play on that fear. There have been cases of malware writers disguising their viruses as antivirus apps – two notable examples are Mac Auto Fixer and MacDefender. It’s important to always read reviews on reputable sites such as Macworld before installing any software on your Mac or MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, don’t believe everything you read. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/552819/mackeeper-review.html\">MacKeeper</a> is a great example of an antivirus program that has got a bad rap, but it’s worked hard to repair its reputation. It has gained Apple Notarization, which means the software has been checked by Apple for malicious components, and the company has garnering certification from various bodies to prove it isn’t a PUP (potentially unwanted program), including an AV-Test certificate. That said, we haven’t recommended it here, and that’s simply because we feel that there are better options available. If you have already installed MacKeeper and wish to try one of our alternative recommendations, we explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/224718/how-to-uninstall-mackeeper-from-your-mac.html\">How to uninstall MacKeeper</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>6.</span>\n<h3>What can’t Mac antivirus protect you from?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Using a Mac antivirus product, especially one that includes tools to improve your online privacy, may lull you into believing you’re completely safe from personal and private information leaking out and that you no longer need to keep your wits about you. That’s not quite the case. While there’s no reason to panic, you should still practice caution – and there are a few more issues you should consider when using Mac antivirus, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, an antivirus for Mac product may upload the complete text of files flagged to the cloud, where it can be analyzed by separate tools hosted there. This practice is normal and sensible: some malware can detect when a running process may examine it, and will then engage in subterfuge. Antivirus software makers also can access their massive databases to examine files with characteristics that trigger their algorithms – certain elements that match known malware. As a result, security researchers discover new viruses, worms, Trojans horses, and the like. However, helping the greater good means you’ll have to be comfortable with trusting a third-party with your file contents. Where appropriate, we noted privacy policy issues in individual reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, this software may also rely partly or entirely on cloud-based checks of URLs, malware, and the like. Accordingly, an antivirus package might upload every URL you visit, metadata about files, signatures of files, information about your computer’s hardware, a list of running or installed applications, and more. Companies vary on their disclosure of such policies, and may not let you opt out of this kind of sharing. We note issues in each review as appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, antivirus software makers also get a sense of what behavior is happening on your computer that’s being monitored or blocked, and may use that information for their own purposes. In some cases, you can opt out of this information gathering.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>7.</span>\n<h3>How we test Mac antivirus software </h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Each software package is evaluated creating a clean installation of macOS, cloning it for each antivirus product, and then booting separately into each one to install a different package. This is to ensure that previous app installations don;t interfere with new ones – sometimes antivirus software treats other antivirus software as an infection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to visiting malicious websites, downloading known malicious software, and even running said malware on our Mac, we also reference the most recent reports from two labs that regularly cover macOS malware: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=http://www.av-comparatives.org/&amp;xcust=1-1-231118-1-0-0%7Cxid:fr1630002835232gbh&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/231118/best-antivirus-for-mac.html\">AV Comparatives</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.av-test.org/&amp;xcust=1-1-231118-1-0-0%7Cxid:fr1630002835232bgc&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/231118/best-antivirus-for-mac.html\">AV-TEST</a>. These laboratories test antivirus software against sets of known malware as well as products that are grouped as potentially unwanted applications (like adware).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter doesn’t damage or expose your computer or its files but may consume power and CPU cycles. Because the testing effectively looks at a combination of virus databases and behavior, they remain good gauges even after many months. When an antivirus for Mac software package lacks a rating from a known security research lab, we do more extensive testing with real malware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, while we gave props for a lot of different features and behaviors, we mark down products if they lack any or all of the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A nearly perfect score on macOS malware detection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ransomware monitoring</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Native browser plug-in or system-level Web proxy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A high score on Windows malware detection</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\nAntivirus, Personal Software, Security Software and Services</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e32d00377edbb5d7856d461d7435ec2fd6cf8ae5ee8be8be83f0227751039419","category":"Apple"}
