{"title":"Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and Hepatitis B and C Health Inequalities Among Male Prisoners in Nigeria: A Narrative Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0910/v2","date":1727088350000,"content":"Viral hepatitis caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) pose a significant global health challenge, with an increasing number of deaths and a substantial burden on healthcare systems, among prisoners in particular. Nigeria ranks fifth in Africa for prison population, with 98.2% being males and are more likely than females to have higher rates of viral hepatitis and other risky behaviours. This literature review explores the impact of social determinants of health (SDoH) on the prevalence and outcomes of HBV and HCV infections among male prison inmates in Nigeria, by examining factors such as overcrowding, inadequate healthcare access, and food insecurity. This review reports the updated data on HBV and HCV infection rates among inmates in different regions in Nigeria, with a special focus on related risk factors, highlighting how these determinants contribute to the high rates of hepatitis infections in this category. The review underscores the urgent need for a multifaceted approach involving policy changes, improved healthcare access, and enhanced preventive measures to address these health disparities. The findings aim to inform public health strategies and interventions to reduce the transmission and impact of viral hepatitis in prison settings, aligning with global health goals and promoting health equity among this population group.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8dd89de57d986824539bc579557aeaf2aef0f662d285d9d23824d6def25b153","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
