{"title":"NegEnt Spray: An Original CE Medical Device, Based on Liposomal Cannabidiol and Chamomile Hydrolate, for the Treatment of Muscles and Joints","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0755/v1","date":1712818946000,"content":"Musculoskeletal disorders are a common occurrence in Europe, affecting millions of people and costing billions of euros in social security services. Traditional treatments using drugs like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause gastric damage, making prolonged use difficult. To address this issue, the Author has developed NegEnt Spray - Muscles and Joints, a topical medical device that uses liposomal cannabidiol and chamomile hydrolate to reduce inflammation and pain in musculoskeletal disorders. The liposomal technology used in NegEnt Spray allows for better bioavailability and a more targeted action, while chamomile hydrolate provides a natural anti-inflammatory and soothing effect. The spray is non-greasy, absorbs quickly, and can be used under any circumstances. Its pocket-sized design makes it easy to carry and use throughout the day. With NegEnt Spray, patients can alleviate discomfort and pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders without worrying about the side effects of traditional treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d3e057c01520335f53b833e26b356a1c8fac12db62d3aa309bac83a43ecdf83e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
