{"title":"Mechanical performance of bentonite plugs in abandonment operations of petroleum wells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0145/v1","date":1717498357000,"content":"This study aims to evaluate how the operational procedure adopted for the pellets placement and the exposure to subsurface conditions influences the mechanical integrity of bentonite plugs used as barrier elements in the abandonment of petroleum wells. To this end, two methodologies were used to obtain the plugs: from the first methodology, the pellets were immersed in diesel or olefin, which are proposed as displacement fluids in offshore operations, and then, hydrated in deionized water; in the second methodology, representative of onshore operations, the pellets were directly hydrated in deionized water. After that, the plugs were tested by compression and adhesion tests. These mechanical tests were also carried out for test specimens obtained from plugs exposed to four formulations of synthetic formation waters. The results obtained demonstrated that the previous contact with olefin adversely affects the mechanical stability of bentonite plugs, while plugs formed from pellets immersed in diesel presented satisfactory mechanical properties. The mechanical properties of onshore plugs attested the highly successful performance of these elements, once its compressive strength was minimally impacted by exposure to formation waters and more pronounced reductions were observed only in the adhesion properties after the contact with higher salinity formation waters.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75d413db400ed00a1802cb58fa21e68930a1efeb379b40762386d01be25c57e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
