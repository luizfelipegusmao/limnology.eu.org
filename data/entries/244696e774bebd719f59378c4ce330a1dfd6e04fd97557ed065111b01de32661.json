Particularly, harmonic convexity of the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian under the mixed boundary condition is established for two-dimensional domain, which implies several new inequalities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"244696e774bebd719f59378c4ce330a1dfd6e04fd97557ed065111b01de32661","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
