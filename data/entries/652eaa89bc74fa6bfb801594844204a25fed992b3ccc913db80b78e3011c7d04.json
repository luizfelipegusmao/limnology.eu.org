{"title":"Counteracting effects of “hook avoidance” and “hook habituation” on angler catch rates in a catch‐and‐release fishery","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12694?af=R","date":1720969370000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Catch-and-release (C&amp;R) angling is often used to maintain high catch rates but fish vulnerability to capture may decrease following hooking, thereby decreasing angler catch per unit effort (CPUE) (hyperdepletion). To determine if fish post-capture response affected recapture probability and population-level CPUE, individual capture histories of Largemouth Bass in two lakes were compared before and after doubling angling effort in a Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) analysis. Previous capture and day-of-season both affected recapture probability. Counteracting effects of previous capture and reduced late-season catch rates caused no hyperdepletion of angler CPUE. Our results highlight the complexity of fish behavioral responses to angling and suggest that hyperdepletion of angling catch rates may not be an issue in C&amp;R fisheries.</p>","author":"Camille L.
