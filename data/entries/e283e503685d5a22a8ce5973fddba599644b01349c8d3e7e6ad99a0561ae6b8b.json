Although there is no such thing as ¾ of an electron, when an electron enters a pixel in a direct electron detector, the signal energy can spread into neighboring pixels [<a href=\"#ozae044.937-B1\">1</a>], giving a fractional signal. This seemingly innocent effect is a serious problem for Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM) when attempting to correct Poisson noise in low-fluence experiments [<a href=\"#ozae044.937-B2\">2</a>]. The Poisson distribution applies strictly to countable discrete events.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e283e503685d5a22a8ce5973fddba599644b01349c8d3e7e6ad99a0561ae6b8b","category":"Environment"}
