{"title":"Functionalized xanthohumol nanoemulsion: fabrication, characterization and bioavailability enhancement of bioactive compounds","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13767?af=R","date":1722414251000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Xanthohumol is an isopentadienyl flavonoid in hops, which have several pharmacological effects. However, due to the poor bioavailability of xanthohumol, it cannot be widely used.</p>\n<h2>RESULT</h2>\n<p>In this study, solvent extraction combined with preparative liquid chromatography was used to separate and purify xanthohumol in hop residue. And the purity, yield and recovery of xanthohumol was 983.0 ± 2.1 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, 921.61 ± 5.65 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, and 5.41 ± 0.07 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Response surface methodology optimization revealed that 216.75 g kg<sup>−1</sup> ethyl oleate, 574.1 g kg<sup>−1</sup> polyoxyl-35 castor oil (EL35) and 209.15 g kg<sup>−1</sup> polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG200) produced the xanthohumol nanoemulsion with a loading capacity of 85.40 ± 0.33 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, mean droplet diameter of 42.35 ± 0.06 nm, and zeta potential of −21.78 ± 0.18 mV.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Xanthohumol nanoemulsion has better relative stability. The relative oral bioavailability of xanthohumol nanoemulsion was increased by 1.76 times. These results provide a theoretical basis for the application of nanoemulsion containing xanthohumol in food and pharmaceutical industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Lifen Zhang, \nJiaxin Lv, \nWenchan Zhang, \nHuixiang Yi, \nMengjian Zhao, \nZiying Wang, \nGang Li, \nBo Xu, \nChengjun Ma, \nJinwei Li, \nMei Li, \nZhenhua Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"d05d7660dc8f3ca60b262f628cf77a80388a6817ed86b1e0cc9ab94261b4649d","category":"Environment"}
