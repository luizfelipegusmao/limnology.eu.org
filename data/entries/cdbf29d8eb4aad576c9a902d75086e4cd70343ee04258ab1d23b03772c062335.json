{"title":"Bladder Adenocarcinoma in a Constellation of Multiple Site Malignancies: An Unusual Case and Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1093/v1","date":1728969696000,"content":"Background and Objectives: Multiple primary malignant tumors represent a small percentage of the total number of oncological cases and can involve either metachronous or synchronous development and represent challenges in diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. Our purpose is to present a rare case of bladder adenocarcinoma in a female patient with multiple primary malignant tumors and to provide systematic review of the available literature. Materials and Methods:A 67-year-old female patient who was admitted altered general condition, and anuria. The past medical history of the patient included malignant melanoma (2014), cervical cancer (2017), colon cancer (2021), obstructive anuria (2023), liver metastasectomy (2023). Transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed for bladder tumors. Results: Contrast CT highlighted multiple pulmonary metastases, a poly nodular liver con-glomerate, retroperitoneal lymph node, II/III grade left ureterohydronephrosis, and no digestive tract tumor masses. The pathological result of the bladder resection showed an infiltrative adenocarcinoma. Conclusions: The difference between primary bladder adenocarcinoma tumor and metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma is the key for the future therapeutic strategy. Identification and assessment of risk factors such as viral infection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, smoking, genetics are pivotal in understanding and managing multiple primary malignant tumors. Personalized prevention strategies, screening programs may facilitate the early detection of this tumors, synchronous or metachronous one. The use of multicancer early detection (MCED) blood tests for early diagnosis appears promising. However, additional research is needed to standardize these techniques for cancer detection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cdbf29d8eb4aad576c9a902d75086e4cd70343ee04258ab1d23b03772c062335","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
