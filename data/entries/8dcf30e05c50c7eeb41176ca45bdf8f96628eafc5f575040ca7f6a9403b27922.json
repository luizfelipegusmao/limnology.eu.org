{"title":"Duality Principles and Numerical Procedures for a Large Class of Non-convex Models in the Calculus of Variations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202302.0051/v91","date":1720685948000,"content":"This article develops duality principles and numerical results for a large class of non-convex variational models. The main results are based on fundamental tools of convex analysis, duality theory and calculus of variations. More specifically the approach is established for a class of non-convex functionals similar as those found in some models in phase transition. Finally, in some sections we present concerning numerical examples and the respective softwares.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8dcf30e05c50c7eeb41176ca45bdf8f96628eafc5f575040ca7f6a9403b27922","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
