{"title":"Protein degradation in auxin response","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3025/7656879?rss=1","date":1713830400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The signaling molecule auxin sits at the nexus of plant biology where it coordinates essentially all growth and developmental processes. Auxin molecules are transported throughout plant tissues and are capable of evoking highly specific physiological responses by inducing various molecular pathways. In many of these pathways, proteolysis plays a crucial role for correct physiological responses. This review provides a chronology of the discovery and characterization of the auxin receptor, which is a fascinating example of separate research trajectories ultimately converging on the discovery of a core auxin signaling hub that relies on degradation of a family of transcriptional inhibitor proteins—the Aux/IAAs. Beyond describing the “classical” proteolysis-driven auxin response system, we explore more recent examples of the interconnection of proteolytic systems, which target a range of other auxin signaling proteins, and auxin response. By highlighting these emerging concepts, we provide potential future directions to further investigate the role of protein degradation within the framework of auxin response.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"9efb9ed316c5ea98e0ac82a98edc79ec999566dee76dcf40b25d2abf65609134","category":"Environment"}
