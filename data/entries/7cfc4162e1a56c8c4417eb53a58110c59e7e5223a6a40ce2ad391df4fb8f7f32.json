{"title":"Functional Combination Based Comprehensive Benefit Evaluation of Energy Storage Projects under Source-grid-load Scenarios via Super Efficiency DEA","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0212/v1","date":1712190564000,"content":"As an important support for power system with high penetration of renewable energy, energy storage system (ESS) has changed the traditional model of simultaneous implementation of electricity production and consumption, and its installed capacity under the source-grid-load scenario is rising year by year, but it faces the problems of insufficient utilization and benefits. This study analyzes the functional combination of ESS under the source-grid-load scenarios, and proposes a comprehensive benefit evaluation method of energy storage projects based on fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and super efficiency data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, which considers the perspective of economic and social environment. Firstly, the functional requirements of energy storage on the source-grid-load scenarios are explored respectively, and the characteristics of various functions are analyzed to form functional combination schemes. Secondly, index modeling is carried out from three aspects: the whole life cycle cost, functional combination benefit and social environmental benefit, and the comprehensive benefit evaluation index system of energy storage project is proposed, which includes both economic and social environment. Then, the intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy number is combined with DEMATEL to form an effective analysis method for the input-output relationship of the indexes, and the comprehensive evaluation is realized based on the super efficiency DEA model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation method and the rationality of the functional combination are verified under source-grid-load scenarios respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7cfc4162e1a56c8c4417eb53a58110c59e7e5223a6a40ce2ad391df4fb8f7f32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
