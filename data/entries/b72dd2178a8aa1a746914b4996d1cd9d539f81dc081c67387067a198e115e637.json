{"title":"A Comparative Analysis of Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Bayesian Networks: Methodological Insights and Practical Applications in Machine Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1491/v1","date":1729320643000,"content":"This paper provides an in-depth comparative analysis of three prominent machine learning techniques: decision trees, neural networks, and Bayesian networks. Each method is explored in terms of its theoretical foundations, algorithmic structure, strengths, limitations, and real-world applications. Decision trees are celebrated for their simplicity and interpretability, making them ideal for decision-making systems, but they often struggle with overfitting and poor performance on high-dimensional data. Neural networks, while capable of achieving high accuracy and effectively handling complex, non-linear patterns, are criticized for their \"black-box\" nature and computational intensity. Bayesian networks distinguish themselves through their ability to model uncertainty and incorporate prior knowledge, making them highly applicable in scenarios requiring probabilistic reasoning, yet they are challenging to scale for complex, high-dimensional data sets. This comparative analysis highlights the distinctive advantages of each method, their performance across various domains such as healthcare, finance, and risk assessment, and the growing potential of hybrid models that combine the strengths of these techniques. The paper concludes by discussing future research opportunities, particularly in enhancing model interpretability and scalability while addressing domain-specific challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b72dd2178a8aa1a746914b4996d1cd9d539f81dc081c67387067a198e115e637","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
