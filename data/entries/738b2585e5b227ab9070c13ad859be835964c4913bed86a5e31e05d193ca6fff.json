{"title":"MPO and Its Role in Cancer, Cardiovascular and Neurological Disorders: An Update","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0157/v1","date":1725341395000,"content":"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzyme that contains a heme group, found mostly in neutrophils and in small amounts in monocytes and plays a major role in their anti-microbial activity. However, excessive levels of MPO have been linked to various disorders and identified as a major cause of tissue destruction. Inhibiting its activity can  reduce the severity and extent of tissue damage. Over activity of MPO during chronic inflammation has been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis by inducing a hyper-mutagenic environment through oxidant interaction with DNA, causing DNA modification. Vascular endothelium is one of the most important targets of MPO and high levels have  been associated with increased rates of cardiomyopathy, ischemic stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. Therefore, it may be considered a therapeutic target in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. MPO also participates in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. For example, an increase in MPO levels  has been observed in the brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's, Multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's diseases. In Alzheimer's disease, active MPO is mostly found in the location of beta amyloids and microglia. Therefore, targeting MPO may be a potential treatment and prevention strategy for neurological disorders. This review will  discuss MPO's physiological and pathological role in cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"738b2585e5b227ab9070c13ad859be835964c4913bed86a5e31e05d193ca6fff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
