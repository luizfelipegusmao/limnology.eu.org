{"title":"Temporal and spatial use of a freshwater lake by upstream and downstream migrating adult Atlantic salmon Salmo salar","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15953?af=R","date":1729670419000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Atlantic salmon <i>Salmo salar</i> typically enter fresh water several months prior to spawning and just as pools can provide areas of refuge in river systems, lakes may also provide important refuge habitat during the spawning migration. Using acoustic telemetry we examined the spatial and temporal movements of wild and a ranched strain of Atlantic salmon in a freshwater lake where the main spawning areas were located upstream of the lake. Over the study period (2011–2014), returning adult wild salmon spent an average of 228 days in fresh water and 90% of that time in the lake. On entering the lake, most wild salmon moved quickly to the northern part of the lake, close to the main inflow, spending an average 76% of the time in this location. The average number of days wild fish were absent from the lake during the main spawning period varied between years, ranging from 10 to 26 days for females and 32 to 35 days for males. Seventy four per cent (17/23) of salmon spawners returned to the lake and two salmon subsequently died in the lake post-spawning. Atypically, two salmon were resident in the lake for the whole period in 2013/14. During the study, wild salmon were detected at depths within the top 5 m for 73% of the time. Median depths post-spawning were greater than in the pre-spawning period, when salmon were found to spend extensive periods at depths in excess of 10 m. In July 2013, when the lake was stratified, thermal regulation behaviour was observed in wild salmon, whereby salmon moved to cooler deeper water when water temperatures at 1 m exceeded 20°C. In contrast to wild salmon, the majority of ranch salmon returned to the traps downstream of the lake prior to the spawning period, which would be expected as they were released as smolts below the freshwater lake. Ranch fish spent an average 80% of the time in the vicinity of receivers in the south of the lake and an average 98% of the time within the top 5 m. However, two ranch females were resident in the lake until the following spring and one ranch female moved upstream into the river during the spawning period. Clearly, in this catchment the lake provides an important habitat for migrating adult salmon. In the context of climate change, where thermal and hydrological regimes in rivers are expected to change in response to changes in air temperature and precipitation patterns, the availability of deep lakes that stratify in the summer and cool water refuges in river systems is likely to play a key role in the sustenance and conservation of salmonid species. Information about the migration patterns of Atlantic salmon in undisturbed freshwater systems may also assist in resolving issues associated with fish passage in impacted rivers and inform management decisions.</p>","author":"Deirdre Cotter, \nE.
