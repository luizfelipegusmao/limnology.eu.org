{"title":"Bibliometric Systematic Literature Review of Problem-Based Learning Entrepreneurship","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1238/v1","date":1716187285000,"content":"The augmenting commitment in the entrepreneurial learning process, both at academic and industry level, has led to new mechanisms and methodologies. Entrepreneurship literature has shown evidence of raising interest in the problem-based learning (PBL) methodology with regard to upcoming events from the surrounding learning context. This paper presents a Systematic Bibliographic Literature Review (SBLR) with respect to the application of PBL throughout distinct entrepreneurial processes either in higher education, or in industry. It aimed to identify relevant entrepreneurial opportunities for PBL. Bibliographic databases were searched for documents published between 2002 and May 2024 to categorize key topics discussed in the literature on PBL and entrepreneurship. The review process identified 142 empirical and non-empirical papers on entrepreneurship related PBL. Data analysis revealed diverse subthemes for PBL uses in entrepreneurship in both higher education institutions and industry. The research questions “What is the interplay of problem-based learning methodology with entrepreneurship?” guided the study. The central output of the research is the discovery of the varying uses of PBL to cope with diverse events arising within entrepreneurship context. Future research directions are suggested.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1bf01b465b1d441b52b4d36e8209442d234170168703ac9c68dd74fa5cc15669","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
