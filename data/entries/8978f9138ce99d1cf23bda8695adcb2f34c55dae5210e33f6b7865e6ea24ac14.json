{"title":"Overview of Toxicity of Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles, Its Synthesis, Functions, Mechanism, Models Used in Toxicological Studies and Disposal Methods- a Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1267/v1","date":1724122592000,"content":"Due to its intriguing applications across a wide range of industries, nanotechnology is generating a lot of interest globally. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles are one type of nanoparticle (NP) that is commonly utilised in everyday use and can be produced using a variety of physical, chemical, and environmentally friendly techniques. Green synthesis is an economical, environmentally benign, and non-toxic method of synthesising NPs. Under normal circumstances, the application of TiO2 greatly enhanced the plants' shoot length, leaf area, and root dry weight. These growth-promoting factors coincided with elevated proline, soluble sugar, and chlorophyll B levels as well as improved antioxidant enzyme activity. Thus, higher levels of proline and other metabolites played a role in osmo-protection, while increased antioxidant enzyme activities helped to explain the observed decrease in hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde contents. Taken together, these factors significantly improved plant growth under salinity. TiO2 nanoparticles have demonstrated efficacy in treating contaminated water and have been shown to positively impact plant physiology, particularly in response to abiotic stresses. However, the reaction to these nanoparticles varies depending on characteristics such as metal species, type, size, shape, dose, duration of exposure, and other variables. One of the most popular nanomaterials in customer goods, agricultural, and energy industries is TiO2 NPs. Therefore, harm to ecosystems and living things will unavoidably result from high demand and widespread usage. Gaining more knowledge about the toxicity of TiO2 NP to living things could help with risk assessments and safe handling procedures for these nanoparticles. The synthesis of titanium oxide, its many uses, the toxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, and their mode of toxicity are all summarised in this paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8978f9138ce99d1cf23bda8695adcb2f34c55dae5210e33f6b7865e6ea24ac14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
