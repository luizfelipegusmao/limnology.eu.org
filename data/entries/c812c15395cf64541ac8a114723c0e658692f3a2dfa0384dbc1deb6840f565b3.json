{"title":"The Burden of Inpatient Hospitalizations with Cardiac and Cerebrovascular Diseases in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes: Insights from the National Inpatient Sample in the US","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0191/v1","date":1719910535000,"content":"Background: This study aimed to evaluate the burden and impact of cardiac and cerebrovascular disease (CCD) on hospital inpatients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Methods: This is a retrospective nationwide cohort study of people with T1DM with or without CCD in the US National Inpatient Sample between 2016 to 2019. The in-hospital mortality rates, length of stay (LoS) and healthcare costs were determined. Results: A total of 59,860 T1DM patients had a primary diagnosis of CCD and 1,382,934 did not. The median LoS was longer for patients with CCD compared to no CCD (4.6 vs. 3 days). Patients with T1DM and CCD had greater in-hospital mortality compared to those without CCD (4.1% vs. 1.1%, p&amp;lt;0.001). The estimated total care cost for all patients with T1DM with CCD was approximately US $326 million. The adjusted odds of mortality compared to patients with non-CCD admission was greatest for intracranial hemorrhage (OR 17.37, 95%CI 12.68-23.79), pulmonary embolism (OR 4.39, 95%CI 2.70-7.13), endocarditis (OR 3.46, 95%CI 1.22-9.84), acute myocardial infarction (OR 2.31, 95%CI 1.92-2.77) and stroke (OR 1.47, 95%CI 1.04-2.09). Conclusions: The burden of CCD in patients with T1DM is substantial and significantly associated with increased hospital mortality and high healthcare expenditures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c812c15395cf64541ac8a114723c0e658692f3a2dfa0384dbc1deb6840f565b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
