{"title":"Plant Density and Location: Optimization of Growth and Quality of Cut Sunflower in Tropical and Subtropical Environments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2178/v1","date":1724944067000,"content":"The cultivation of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) as a cut flower stands out in floriculture due to its aesthetic beauty and commercial value. Understanding how cut sunflower genotypes adapt to different edaphoclimatic regions and management practices is essential to optimize flower quality and productivity. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of plant density and location on the development, growth, and quality of cut sunflower in tropical and subtropical environments. Plant densities of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 plants/m² were evaluated in tropical climate and subtropical climate using a randomized block design in a factorial scheme. Results showed significant differences between locations for plant height, capitulum and stem diameter, final number of leaves, leaf area, leaf area index, phyllochron, and the developmental cycle. Plant density significantly influenced these variables except for plant height and developmental cycle. The interaction between location and plant density was significant only for capitulum diameter and final leaf number. The findings indicate that both planting density and location significantly influence the developmental cycle of cut sunflowers, with lower densities favoring more robust plants at harvest. A density of 30 plants/m² is recommended for efficient space use without significantly compromising floral stem quality. All produced stems are marketable, suggesting that adjusting planting density can optimize production without compromising quality, adapting to specific regional conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef94b3143e93de71caeaf0b3f680e6c55ba36bf28e691e7dd41ef0284b6523e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
