{"title":"Disentangling ecological drivers of interspecific achromatic plumage variation in birds","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13892?af=R","date":1720966946000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Aim</h2>\n<p>Understanding the ecological determinants of interspecific achromatic (light-to-dark) plumage variation in birds is crucial yet challenging due to the complex interplay of climatic, habitat-related, and morphological influences. This study aimed to disentangle the effects of temperature, precipitation, habitat openness, body mass and hand-wing index (HWI, a widely used single-parameter proxy for the extent to which a species relies on flight) on shaping achromatic plumage variation among bird species.</p>\n<h2>Location</h2>\n<p>Global.</p>\n<h2>Time Period</h2>\n<p>Contemporary.</p>\n<h2>Major Taxa Studied</h2>\n<p>Birds.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>Based on data from over 8000 sessile bird species globally, we employed phylogenetic linear regressions to account for achromatic plumage colour in relation to temperature, precipitation, habitat openness, body mass and HWI, while correcting for phylogenetic non-independence between species. Furthermore, we conducted phylogenetic path analyses to decompose direct from indirect effects.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>We found that temperature, precipitation, habitat openness and body mass exerted separate but interactive effects on the variation in achromatic colour across species. Species inhabiting cold, wet or densely vegetated environments were darker coloured, while smaller species were lighter. Darker plumage was more strongly related to higher precipitation in colder regions for nocturnal species. For diurnal species, darker plumage was more closely associated with higher precipitation in more open habitats, whereas lighter plumage was more linked to lower mass in denser habitats. Noteworthy was the identification of a substantial correlation between achromatic colour and HWI. Diurnal species that are more aerial were lighter. Conversely, nocturnal flyers, especially females, tended to be darker.</p>\n<h2>Main Conclusions</h2>\n<p>The findings highlight the multifaceted nature of plumage coloration evolution, with adaptations for thermal efficiency, crypsis, signalling, waterproofing or protection against bacteria. However, the variable relative importance of these factors among groups emphasizes the significance of each factor in different contexts.</p>","author":"Su Wu, \nKai Zhang, \nBin Wang, \nPinjia Que, \nBiao Yang, \nYu Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Ecology and Biogeography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3c0e5aaffe8fee3c8550c0a05a71fc802d704add877621e55c59b91462c01050","entryHash":"8d0c484081e9846ad1a64f1bbc3efdc3a38f9bb95062690fa0b18d2b4fa77ece","category":"Environment"}
