{"title":"Predictive Value of Serum VEGF Levels in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1475/v1","date":1726737367000,"content":"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFRs) serve an essential role in tumor angiogenesis and have emerged as potential therapeutic targets in lung cancer. This review explores the significance of serum VEGF levels as a predictive biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The VEGF family, consisting of VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFC, VEGFD, and placenta growth factor (PlGF), engages with specific receptors, including tyrosine kinase receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3) and neuropilin receptors (NRP-1 and NRP-2), to promote angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. VEGF-A, the primary component of the VEGF family, binds to VEGFR-2 to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration, while VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D interact with VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-3 to regulate tumor angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and metastasis. The VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway activates various downstream effectors, including phospholipase CÎ³1, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt, which are essential for maintaining vascular homeostasis and promoting angiogenesis. In NSCLC, elevated serum VEGF levels have been observed, and the VEGF/VEGFR axis is frequently impaired, leading to irregular blood vessel formation and metastatic spread. Despite the development of anti-VEGF therapies, their impact on lung cancer outcomes has been limited. Further research is needed to optimize the effectiveness of these treatments and elucidate the potential of serum VEGF as a predictive biomarker in NSCLC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b739336267daebf71b49b8a2343256a208cde51ebf1af3151126025d1ac1a8c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
