{"title":"IAA Synthesis Pathway of Fitibacillus barbaricus WL35 and Its Regulatory Gene Expression Levels in Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1475/v1","date":1721292896000,"content":"Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), as an important regulator of potato growth, seriously affects the growth and yield of potato. Although many studies have reported that IAA-producing Bacillus can promote plant growth, little research has been done on its synthesis pathway and the molecular mechanisms. In this study, IAA-producing strain WL35 was identified as Fitibacillus barbaricus, and its yield was 48.79 mg·L-1. The results of the pot experiments showed that WL35 significantly increased plant height, stem thickness, chlorophyll content and number of leaves of potato plants by 31.68%, 30.03%, 32.93% and 36.59%, respectively. In addition, in the field experiments, WL35-treated plants increased commercial potatoes yield by 16.45%, vitamin C content by 16.35%, protein content by 75%, starch content by 6.60%, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium accumulation by 9.98%, 12.70% and 26.76%, respectively. Meanwhile, the synthetic pathway of WL35 was found to be dominated by the tryptophan-dependent pathway, the IAM, TAM and IPA pathways worked together, and the pathways that played a role at different times were different. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis showed that there were a total of 2875 DEGs regulated in the samples treated with WL35 seed dressing compared with the CK, of which 1458 genes were up-regulated and 1417 genes were down-regulated. Potato roots express differential genes enriched in processes such as carbohydrate metabolism processes and cellular polysaccharide metabolism, which regulate potato plant growth and development. The above results provide a theoretical basis for the further exploration of the synthesis pathway of IAA and its growth-promoting mechanism on potato.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"558d63e99c86002b63fdb1113e410b94b26e83f16821179560120b29c00d5e74","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
