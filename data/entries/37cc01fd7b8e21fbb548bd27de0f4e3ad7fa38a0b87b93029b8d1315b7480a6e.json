Results indicated that approximately 72.42% of tropical cyclones (TCs) in the Western Pacific produce TRP over China. The peak months for TRP are July and August. The four key regions of TRP are the adjacent areas between the Sichuan and Shaanxi Provinces, the northern coast of the Bohai Sea, the coast of the Yellow Sea, and the southern coast area. The typical distance between the station with TRP and the TC center ranges from 1500 to 2500 km. Most of these stations are situated north to 60° west of north of the TC. The south–west water vapor transportation on the west side of the TC is crucial to TRP. TRP has a decreasing trend because of the decrease in the number of TCs that generate TRP. From the perspective of large-scale environmental conditions, a decrease in the integrated horizontal water vapor transport in Mainland China, the weakening of upward motion at approximately 25°–35°N, which is inconducive to convection, and an increase in low-level vertical wind shear, which is unfavorable for the development of TC in areas with high frequencies of TRP-related TCs, are the factors that result in the decreasing trend of TRP.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"37cc01fd7b8e21fbb548bd27de0f4e3ad7fa38a0b87b93029b8d1315b7480a6e","category":"Environment"}
