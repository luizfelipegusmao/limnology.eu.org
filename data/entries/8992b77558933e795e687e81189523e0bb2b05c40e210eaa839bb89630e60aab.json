{"title":"The Incidence of Respiratory Infections and Nutritional Deficiency in Chadian Under-Five Female and Male Children: Trends and Risk Factors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1685/v1","date":1719222503000,"content":"Lower respiratory infections (LRI), upper respiratory infections (URI), and nutritional deficiency (ND) in under-5 children from low-middle-income countries has been at a high level for decades, despite efforts that have been realized in some countries. The study used data extracted from the global burden of diseases (GBD) to analyze the trends behavior between 1990 and 2019, and evaluate their association with maternal factors. Between 1990 and 2019, the incidence of LRI decreased between 1.2 percent and 1.3 percent (1.2-1.3%) in different female age groups, and by nearly 1 to 1.3% in those of the male gender. The incidence of URI did not decrease (0.0%) in any of their age groups. ND incidence declined around 0.7 to 4.9% in the under-5 children. LRI declined mostly in the female age groups (1.2 to 1.3%), while ND decreased more in the male gender (0.9 to 4.9%). Maternal risk factors were strongly associated to the incidence of the three conditions with over 90 percent. Maternal prevalence of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis positively impacted the incidence of LRI, URI, and ND in Chadian under-5 children. Although the incidence of LRI and ND declined, URI incidence remained steady between 1990 and 2019 in Chadian under-5 children. To improve the health and provide a healthy growth of under-5 children, the maternal prevalence of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis infection should be strongly addressed for a prompt accomplishment of the sustainable development goals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8992b77558933e795e687e81189523e0bb2b05c40e210eaa839bb89630e60aab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
