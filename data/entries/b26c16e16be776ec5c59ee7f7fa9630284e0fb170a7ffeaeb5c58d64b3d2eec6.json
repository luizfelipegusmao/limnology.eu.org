{"title":"Militarization, Industrial Progress, and Their Carbon Footprints in NATO Countries: A Panel Econometric Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1293/v1","date":1716203780000,"content":"This study assesses the impact of militarization, industrialization, technological innovation, and energy consumption on CO2 emissions in NATO countries, divided into \"traditional\" (Group 1) and \"new member\" states (Group 2), using data from 1985 to 2019. It identifies heterogeneity in effects and dependencies between the groups. Employing Pedroni and Kao panel cointegration tests, a long-term equilibrium relationship among the variables is confirmed. The analysis, using panel ARDL and GMM methods, reveals distinct outcomes for each group. In Group 1, military spending and energy consumption significantly increase CO2 emissions, while industrialization and technological innovation reduce them. Conversely, in Group 2, technological innovation and energy consumption raise emissions, whereas military spending and industrialization decrease them. The findings suggest Group 1 should strategize military expenditure and energy consumption to cut emissions, whereas Group 2 should focus on eco-friendly technology and efficient energy use to achieve environmental sustainability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b26c16e16be776ec5c59ee7f7fa9630284e0fb170a7ffeaeb5c58d64b3d2eec6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
