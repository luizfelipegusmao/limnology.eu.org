{"title":"Race and Gender Disparity of Dietary Lycopene Intake and Periodontitis Severity in Older Adults","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1762/v1","date":1716864216000,"content":"Purpose: The objective of this paper is to explore the association between insufficient lycopene intake and risk of periodontitis among older adults. Methods: Data analysis was conducted using data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey 2009-2014. Overall, 1227 adults aged 65- to 79-years-old were investigated. Results: Overall, 48.7% of older adults in this study were classified with different levels of periodontitis and 49.1% of individuals with a form of periodontitis had insufficient dietary lycopene intake. Sufficient lycopene intake was found to be associated with a lower likelihood of severe periodontitis (OR: .33; 95% CI: 0.17-.65; p=0.002). Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) older adults were more likely to develop severe forms of periodontal disease in comparison to Non-Hispanic White (NHW) older adults (OR: 2.82, 95% CI: 1.46-5.45, p=0.003). Gender was also found to play a role in periodontitis status, with women being less likely to have severe periodontitis status, compared to men (OR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.14-0.55; p=0.0007,). However, only NHW females were less likely to have severe periodontitis compared to NHW males (OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.12-0.56; p= 0.001). Conclusion: Dietary intake of lycopene associated with periodontitis disease for individuals over the age of 65; those who consume a sufficient amount of lycopene are less likely to develop severe periodontitis. In general, more men suffered from periodontitis in comparison to women. Such association also has been found between NHB with severe periodontitis. In addition, reduced risk of moderate periodontitis is associated with sufficient lycopene intake is explored in NHW, future targeted interventions using lycopene in dietary intake as a preventative measure to delay or prevent the onset of periodontal disease needs to be race and gender specific.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e64f0181759a4b6e096ed8a3199c1eb6a42a12e93e728b0e60214d61b649f918","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
