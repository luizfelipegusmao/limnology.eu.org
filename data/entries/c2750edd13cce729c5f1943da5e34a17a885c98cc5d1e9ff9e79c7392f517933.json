{"title":"The Future of Antipsychotic Interventions: From Managing Symptoms to Improving Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1692/v1","date":1711625049000,"content":"Abstract\nFor the past 70 years, dopamine hypothesis has been the key working model in schizophrenia. This has contributed to the development of numerous inhibitors of dopaminergic signaling, antipsychotic drugs, which led to rapid symptom resolution but only marginal outcome improvement.  Over the past decades, there was limited research on the quantifiable pathological changes in schizophrenia, including premature cellular/neuronal, senescence, brain volume loss, attenuation of gamma oscillations on electroencephalogram and oxidation of lipids in plasma and mitochondrial membranes.\nWe surmise that aberrant activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor by toxins derived from the gut microbes or the environment drives premature cellular, including neuronal, senescence, a hallmark of schizophrenia. Early brain aging promotes secondary changes, including impairment and loss of mitochondria, gray matter depletion, decreased gamma oscillations, and a compensatory metabolic shift to lactate and lactylation. \nThe aim of this narrative review is twofold: \n1.\tTo summarize what is known about premature cellular/neuronal senescence in schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like disorders.\n2.\tTo discuss novel strategies for improving long-term outcome in severe mental illness with natural senotherapeutics, membrane lipid replacement, mitochondrial transplantation, microbial phenazines, novel antioxidant phenothiazines, inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c2750edd13cce729c5f1943da5e34a17a885c98cc5d1e9ff9e79c7392f517933","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
