{"title":"A Carbonic Anhydrase, ZmCA4, Contributes to Photosynthetic Efficiency and Modulates CO2 Signaling Gene Expression by Interacting with Aquaporin ZmPIP2;6 in Maize","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/2/243/7408755?rss=1","date":1699660800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the reversible CO<sub>2</sub> hydration reaction that produces bicarbonate for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC). This is the initial step for transmitting the CO<sub>2</sub> signal in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. However, it remains unknown whether the maize (<span>Zea mays</span> L.) CA gene, <span>ZmCA4</span>, plays a role in the maize photosynthesis process. In our study, we found that ZmCA4 was relatively highly expressed in leaves and localized in the chloroplast and the plasma membrane of mesophyll protoplasts. Knock-out of <span>ZmCA4</span> reduced CA activity, while overexpression of <span>ZmCA4</span> increased rubisco activity, as well as the quantum yield and relative electron transport rate in photosystem II. Overexpression of <span>ZmCA4</span> enhanced maize yield–related traits. Moreover, ZmCA4 interacted with aquaporin ZmPIP2;6 in bimolecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The double-knock-out mutant for <span>ZmPIP2;6</span> and <span>ZmCA4</span> genes showed reductions in its growth, CA and PEPC activities, assimilation rate and photosystem activity. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that the expression of other <span>ZmCAs, ZmPIPs</span>, as well as CO<sub>2</sub> signaling pathway homologous genes, and photosynthetic-related genes was all altered in the double-knock-out mutant compared with the wild type. Altogether, our study’s findings point to a critical role of ZmCA4 in determining photosynthetic capacity and modulating CO<sub>2</sub> signaling regulation via its interaction with ZmPIP2;6, thus providing insight into the potential genetic value of <span>ZmCA4</span> for maize yield improvement.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"9d2f90afabccd8979084244955786193770cafe65a58806bf3ea89d4bd80efb0","category":"Environment"}
