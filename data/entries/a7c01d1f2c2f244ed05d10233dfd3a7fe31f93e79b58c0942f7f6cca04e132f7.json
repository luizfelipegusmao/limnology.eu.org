{"title":"GPTs or Grim Position Threats? The Potential Impacts of Large Language Models on Non-Managerial Jobs and Certifications in Cybersecurity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1600/v1","date":1713944806000,"content":"ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM) utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), has caused concerns about its impact on job sectors, including cybersecurity. In this study, we assessed ChatGPT’s impacts in non-managerial cybersecurity roles using the NICE Framework and Technological Displacement theory. We also explored its potential in passing top cybersecurity certification exams. Findings revealed ChatGPT’s promise in streamlining some jobs, especially those requiring memorization. Moreover, we highlighted ChatGPT’s challenges and limitations, such as ethical implications, LLM limitations, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) security. The study suggests that LLMs like ChatGPT could transform the cybersecurity landscape, causing job losses, skill obsolescence, labor market shifts, and mixed socioeconomic impacts. We recommend a shift in focus from memorization to critical thinking, and collaboration between LLM developers and cybersecurity professionals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7c01d1f2c2f244ed05d10233dfd3a7fe31f93e79b58c0942f7f6cca04e132f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
