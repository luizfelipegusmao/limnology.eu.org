{"title":"Companies with at Least 10 Employees Selling Online across the Italian Regions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0546/v1","date":1712585184000,"content":"The following article analyzes Italian companies with more than 10 employees that use online sales tools. The data used were acquired from the ISTAT-BES database. The article first presents a static analysis of the data aimed at framing the phenomenon in the context of Italian regional disparities. Subsequently, a clustering with k-Means algorithm is proposed by comparing the Silhouette coefficient and the Elbow method. The investigation of the innovative and technological determinants of the observed variable is carried out through the application of a panel econometric model. Finally, different machine learning algorithms for prediction are compared. The results are critically discussed with economic policy suggestions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5d76cd2072b1381fea23ba657d53fe1ed79cd35cd28b1e0a8b705a92e6d7fbe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
