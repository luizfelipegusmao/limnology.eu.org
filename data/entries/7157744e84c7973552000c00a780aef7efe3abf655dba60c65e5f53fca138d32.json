This study explored the reasons for male involvement in FP and contraception in slum areas in Nakawa Division, Kampala, Uganda. A qualitative study was conducted among sexually active males in a slum area in Nakawa Division, Kampala. A purposive sampling technique was utilised to recruit 40 men for a Focus Group Discussion (FGDs), and 2 key informants (KI) for critical perspective interviews. A semi-structured FGDs and interview guides were used to collect the data. The FGDs were conducted in both English and the local language, Luganda. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts for both FGDs and KI interviews were imported into the NVivo Qualitative Data Analysis Software version 10 application, and thematic data analysis was conducted. The findings show that males’ involvement in FP and its decisions were minimal. The findings also show that several factors emerged as contributing to male’s participation in FP and utilisation of contraceptives. Inadequate understanding of FP and contraceptives, lack of clarity on males’ role in FP, unfriendly healthcare environment and community members’ perceptions of male involvement in FP were reported as reasons contributing to male participation in FP and contraction. There is limited involvement of males in FP. There is a need for renewed efforts that will positively alter the factors that impact male involvement favourably. Promotion and education about FP for males will significantly address issues of limited understanding and clarity of males’ role in FP services.","author":"Sarah Namee Wambete","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"7157744e84c7973552000c00a780aef7efe3abf655dba60c65e5f53fca138d32","category":"Environment"}
