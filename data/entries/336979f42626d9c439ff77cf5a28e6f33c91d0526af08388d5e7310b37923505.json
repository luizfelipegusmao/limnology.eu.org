{"title":"Demonstration of an In-Flight Entertainment System Using Power-over-Fiber","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1217/v1","date":1716201433000,"content":"The use of optical fibers is increasing in modern aircraft because it helps solve challenges of size, weight, communication, and reliability in new aircraft generation. This work describes a video and power transmission system using optical fibers (PoF) for in-flight entertainment (IFE) system application. We present the benefits and the limitations of this application, and we perform two practical experiments to demonstrate their performance. It used off-the-shelf devices in the experiments, such as one 15-W semiconductor laser operating at 808 nm, GaAs photovoltaic converters, optical transmitters and receivers, and video monitors. The power and video signals were transmitted using two 50-m multimode fibers. In addition, we proposed and tested two types of energy transformation units (ETU), which are responsible for supplying electrical energy to the IFE video monitor and the optical fiber receiver.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"336979f42626d9c439ff77cf5a28e6f33c91d0526af08388d5e7310b37923505","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
