{"title":"Mechanical Properties Predictive Model of Additive Manufacturing Specimens using ANFIS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0094/v1","date":1719838990000,"content":"Due to the manufacturing process of Additive Manufacturing (AM) Parts the mechanical properties cannot be predicted. The scope of the present work is to propose a predictive tool for the mechanical properties of AM parts through the use of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) combines neural networks with fuzzy logic to generate a mapping between the inputs and the output. Real data experiments from different AM technologies and materials compose the initial dataset so a detailed investigation is conducted to gain knowledge of how different parameters affect the UTS, the elongation and the Young modulus of each experiment. Experimental data were also use to train, check and verify the methodology. The method is tested for FFF technology, PLA material and 3 point bending stress, with interesting results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba83a3c8c725c855c310604d9da18b066d1a96211266eafb0a6c540879775bcd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
