{"title":"Engineering Motivation into an Instructional Design Skill-Strength Assessment and Mentoring System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1884/v1","date":1727165531000,"content":"In recent years, there has been a significant demand for Instructional Design (ID) professionals due to the rise of remote work, increased reliance on digital learning solutions for professional development, and the integration of digital technologies in formal and informal learning spaces. However, practical and authentic personalized courses are unavailable for professionals who want to transition into the field. This study addresses the gaps in most of the available ID courses and details the design of an Instructional Design Skill-Strength Assessment System (IDSSAS) that evaluates gaps in users' skills and offers them courses and mentors to help them bridge them in preparation for work as an ID in the corporate space. Employing a User-Centered Design (UCD) approach, the system prioritizes personalization, real-world application, and practical skills that better position them to be more employable, a significant improvement over the mostly available traditional, theory-focused ID training programs. IDSSAS, which is integrable with any Learning Management System (LMS) or Learning Experience Platform (LXP), was developed with Storyline 360, and it offers personalized learning and feedback as well as provides users with the agency to choose a mentor that is best aligned with their area of interest. The design was grounded in Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and incorporates design features like a progress bar, feedback loop, challenges, social interaction, and agency to support students' motivation and promote Autonomy, Relatedness, and Competence. IDSSAS, in its manual and present automated form, has been successfully used to mentor some transitioning ID professionals globally who are now gainfully employed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04495cd31135fa398762282a9cf53598f3f331993d526cc21b516a63ab3e44c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
