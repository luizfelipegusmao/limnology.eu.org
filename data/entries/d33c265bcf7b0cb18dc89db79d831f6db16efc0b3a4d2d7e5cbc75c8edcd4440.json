{"title":"Low Iron Diet Improves Clinical Arthritis in the Mouse Model of Collagen-Induced Arthritis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0493/v1","date":1717755036000,"content":"Background: In response to inflammation, the absorption of nutritional iron is restricted. Multiple inflammation-related signaling pathways can lead to ferroptosis, an iron-dependent mechanism of programmed cell death. Since the pathophysiological significance of the presence and uptake of iron in chronic inflammation is still unknown, we tested the effect of a low iron diet on the clinical course of arthritis in the mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).\nMethods: Six- to eight-week-old male DBA/1 mice were fed either a normal or a low iron diet starting three weeks before arthritis induction. From day four after the collagen-booster made on day 25, the development of arthritis was regularly monitored until the end of the experiment (day 34), using a standard clinical arthritis score. The complete blood count was determined as well as Fe2+, Fe3+, oxidized and reduced glutathione (GSH and GSSG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in whole paw tissue by ELISA. Quantitative PCR was performed from whole paw tissue for glutathione peroxidase 4 and other key regulator genes of iron metabolism and ferroptosis. We used nonparametric tests to com-pare markers of iron metabolism and ferroptosis as well as nonlinear regression models for longitu-dinal data for signs of arthritis.\nResults: Mice fed a low iron diet showed a significantly less severe course of arthritis compared to mice fed a normal iron diet (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d33c265bcf7b0cb18dc89db79d831f6db16efc0b3a4d2d7e5cbc75c8edcd4440","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
