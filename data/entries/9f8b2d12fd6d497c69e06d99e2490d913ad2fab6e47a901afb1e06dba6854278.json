This study introduces the Visual Interaction Analysis (VIA) methodology, utilizing advanced eye-tracking technology within immersive virtual reality (VR) environments to examine generational and gender differences in visual engagement after exposure to advertising materials. Using the Cognitive 3D platform for precise data capture, this research analyzed fixation patterns—total fixations, duration of fixations, and average duration per fixation—across Millennial and Generation Z cohorts. The analysis involved 44 participants, who were exposed to three posters in controlled VR settings. Results revealed significant generational differences: Generation Z demonstrated more focused attention, with higher fixation counts and longer total fixation durations compared to Millennials, suggesting that differences in media consumption and technological adaptation influence engagement strategies. However, both generations showed a similar depth of engagement, as indicated by the average duration per fixation. Gender analysis within Generation Z further revealed that female participants engaged for longer periods per fixation, indicating deeper processing of visual information. This methodology offers a robust framework for quantifying visual engagement, providing actionable insights that can help marketers tailor strategies and optimize campaign designs before launch.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f8b2d12fd6d497c69e06d99e2490d913ad2fab6e47a901afb1e06dba6854278","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
