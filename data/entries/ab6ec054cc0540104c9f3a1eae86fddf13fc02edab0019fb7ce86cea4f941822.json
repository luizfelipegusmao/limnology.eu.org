{"title":"The Influence of Social Media Marketing on Brand Loyalty","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0332/v1","date":1723028057000,"content":"This study explores the influence of social media marketing on brand loyalty, employing a qualitative research approach to gain in-depth insights into the key factors that drive consumer engagement and commitment. Through semi-structured interviews with 20 active social media users and a comprehensive analysis of social media content, the research identifies several critical elements affecting brand loyalty. Personalization emerged as a central theme, with tailored content, customized offers, and personalized recommendations significantly enhancing users' emotional connection with brands. High-quality content, characterized by engaging visuals and valuable information, was found to reinforce positive brand perceptions and sustain loyalty. Influencer marketing also plays a pivotal role, with authentic endorsements from relevant influencers boosting brand credibility and trust. Effective community management, involving active engagement, responsive feedback, and relationship-building, contributes to a positive brand experience and strengthens user loyalty. Targeted and relevant social media advertising supports brand loyalty, although excessive or irrelevant ads can lead to disengagement. The study also highlights the importance of balancing interaction frequency and content quality to maintain user interest without causing fatigue. Addressing social media fatigue by delivering relevant and valuable content is crucial for preventing user disengagement. Content that resonates with users' values and emotions further strengthens brand attachment. Consistency in brand voice, visual identity, and values ensures a coherent and positive brand experience. The findings emphasize the need for a strategic approach to social media marketing, integrating personalization, content quality, influencer partnerships, community management, advertising relevance, and consistency to build and sustain strong brand loyalty.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab6ec054cc0540104c9f3a1eae86fddf13fc02edab0019fb7ce86cea4f941822","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
