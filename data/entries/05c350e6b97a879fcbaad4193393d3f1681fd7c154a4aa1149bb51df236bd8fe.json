{"title":"Swiftwater Breathing Apparatus: Disrupting the Drowning Process and Mitigating Rescuer Fatalities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0816/v1","date":1718197245000,"content":"Drowning is a leading cause of accidental death worldwide, with traditional drowning prevention strategies focused on buoyancy aids and protective equipment proving insufficient in mitigating the immediate risks of cold water shock and drowning. Swiftwater Breathing Apparatus (SWBA) has emerged as a potential game-changer, offering respiratory protection at the water's surface and a means of interrupting the drowning process. This report examines how SWBA can disrupt the drowning process, the benefits of using SWBA compared to existing protective equipment, the issue of water rescuer fatalities, and the potential implications for insurers and coronial inquests.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05c350e6b97a879fcbaad4193393d3f1681fd7c154a4aa1149bb51df236bd8fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
