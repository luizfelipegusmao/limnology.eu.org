{"title":"Formation and Mechano-Chemical Properties of Chromium Fluorides Originated from the Deposition of Carbon-Chromium Nanocomposite Coatings in the Reactive Atmosphere (Ar+CF4) during Magnetron Sputtering","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0565/v1","date":1723129422000,"content":"The literature analysis did not indicate any studies on fluorination tests of carbon nanocomposite coatings doped with transition metals of the nc-MeC/a-C type. This was the motivation for undertaking research in this area. As a model coating to investigate the effect of fluorination in a tetrafluoromethane (CF4) atmosphere, a nano-composite carbon coating doped with chromium nc-CrC/a-C produced by magnetron sputtering from graphite targets and the use of a Pulse-DC type medium frequency power supply was chosen [6]. After deposition of the gradient CrCN adhesive sublayer, fluorination of the main coating was conducted in a reactive mode in an (Ar+CF4) atmosphere at various CF4 contents. It was observed that the presence of CF4 in the atmosphere resulted in a reduced amount of chromium carbides formed in favor of chromium fluorides. So far, this is an observation that seems unnoticed by the carbon coatings researchers. Fluorine was assumed to bond much more readily to carbon than to chromium, due to the stability of tetrafluoromethane (CF4). The opposite seems to be true. The mechanical properties (nano-hardness and Young's modulus) and tribological properties in the 'pin-on-disc' friction pair are presented, along with the analysis of bonds occurring between chromium, carbon, and fluorine (XPS).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9aec93e263d673f3f2ab26b384a3518821f7631a047a1568e096b235023fffd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
