{"title":"Intraoperative Hearing Monitoring Using ABR and TT-ECochG and Hearing Preservation during Vestibular Schwannoma Resection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1181/v1","date":1718710271000,"content":"Quick and appropriate diagnostics and the use of intraoperative monitoring (IM) of hearing during vestibular schwannoma (VS) resection increase the likelihood of hearing preservation. During surgery, various methods of IM can be used, i.e. auditory brainstem responses (ABR), transtympanic electrocochleography (TT-ECochG) and direct cochlear nerve action potentials. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic values of IM of hearing using ABR and TT-ECochG in predicting postoperative hearing preservation, as well as to evaluate relationships between them during various stages of surgery. This retrospective study presents the pre- and postoperative audiological test results and IM of hearing records (TT-ECochG and ABR) in 75 (43 women, 32 men, aged 18-69) patients with diagnosed VS. The preoperative pure tone average hearing threshold was 25.02 dB HL, while after VS resection it worsened on average by 30.03 dB HL. According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) Hearing Classification, before and after (pre/post) the surgery, there were 47/24 patients in hearing class A, 9/8-B, 2/1-C, and 17/42-D. In speech audiometry, the average preoperative speech discrimination score at an intensity of 60 dB SPL was 70.93%, and after VS resection it worsened to 38.93%. The analysis of electrophysiological tests showed that before the tumor removal the I-V ABR interlatencies was 5.06 ms, and after VS resection it was 6.43 ms. The study revealed correlations between worse postoperative hearing and changes in intraoperatively measured ABR and TT-ECochG. IM of hearing is very useful in predicting postoperative hearing in VS patients and increases the chance of postoperative hearing preservation in these patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50c625186ed2511e9a45c40a8f1eccddfa16197cd21840714361691c9e9b7a45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
