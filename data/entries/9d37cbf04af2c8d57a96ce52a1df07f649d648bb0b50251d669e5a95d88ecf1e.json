{"title":"Effect of Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization and Rehabilitation Strategies in Six Year Child with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: A Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0620/v1","date":1712645619000,"content":"The clinical features of increasing muscle weakening are shared by a diverse set of illnesses known as muscular dystrophies. In early childhood, males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) exhibit proximal muscle weakening and calf enlargement, making it the most frequent X-linked disease of muscular dystrophy in children. Development of motor skills is typically delayed, and wheelchair confinement eventually leads to early death from heart or lung problems. In terms of function, ambulation, quality of life, and life expectancy, treatment approaches like corticosteroid therapy and intermittent positive pressure breathing have improved. This is a case report of a 6-year-old kid who had early ambulatory stage Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and complained to the neuro-physiotherapy department about frequent falls, walking difficulties, and dyspnea when walking. Other grievances included being unable to get off the ground and having trouble ascending stairs. He had physiotherapy and dynamic neuromuscular stabilization for his complaints. The main goals of treatment were educating the family, respiratory training, preventing ankle plantar flexors, maintaining strength, balance and gait training.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d37cbf04af2c8d57a96ce52a1df07f649d648bb0b50251d669e5a95d88ecf1e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
