{"title":"Ice‐melt period dominates annual carbon dioxide evasion from clear‐water Arctic lakes","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10369?af=R","date":1710748776000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Current estimates of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) evasion from Arctic lakes are highly uncertain because few studies integrate seasonal variability, specifically evasion during spring ice-melt. We quantified annual CO<sub>2</sub> evasion for 14 clear-water Arctic lakes in Northern Sweden through mass balance (ice-melt period) and high-frequency loggers (open-water period). On average, 80% (SD: ± 18) of annual CO<sub>2</sub> evasion occurred within 10 d following ice-melt. The contribution of the ice-melt period to annual CO<sub>2</sub> evasion was high compared to earlier studies of Arctic lakes (47% ± 32%). Across all lakes, the proportion of ice-melt : annual CO<sub>2</sub> evasion was negatively related to the dissolved organic carbon concentration and positively related to the mean depth of the lakes. The results emphasize the need for measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> exchange at ice-melt to accurately quantify CO<sub>2</sub> evasion from Arctic lakes.</p>","author":"J. Karlsson, \nH. A.
