These unique properties of ferroelectric materials are due to the breaking of crystallographic inversion symmetry. Ferroelectrics often exhibit domains consisting of polarization vectors that are aligned in distinct directs in accordance with Bravais lattice. In ferroelectric thin films, domain structures and phase instabilities can be optimized by tuning the mechanical and electrostatic boundary conditions [<a href=\"#ozae044.338-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.338-B2\">2</a>]. Therefore, non-destructive imaging of polarity provides insights into size, shape, and distribution of ferroelectric domains, which is important to understanding the relationship between structure and property.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"403f8361eaf9b59d058f1041cbeb417f28b8d1279478ced3d46f1e275e5bf9c9","category":"Environment"}
