{"title":"Coupling of twelve putative chromosomal inversions maintains a strong barrier to gene flow between snail ecotypes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evlett/article/8/4/575/7656805?rss=1","date":1713830400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Chromosomal rearrangements can lead to the coupling of reproductive barriers, but whether and how they contribute to the completion of speciation remains unclear. Marine snails of the genus <span>Littorina</span> repeatedly form hybrid zones between populations segregating for multiple inversion arrangements, providing opportunities to study their barrier effects. Here, we analyzed 2 adjacent transects across hybrid zones between 2 ecotypes of <span>Littorina fabalis</span> (“large” and “dwarf”) adapted to different wave exposure conditions on a Swedish island. Applying whole-genome sequencing, we found 12 putative inversions on 9 of 17 chromosomes. Nine of the putative inversions reached near differential fixation between the 2 ecotypes, and all were in strong linkage disequilibrium. These inversions cover 20% of the genome and carry 93% of divergent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Bimodal hybrid zones in both transects indicated that the 2 ecotypes of <span>Littorina fabalis</span> maintain their genetic and phenotypic integrity following contact. The bimodality reflects the strong coupling between inversion clines and the extension of the barrier effect across the whole genome. Demographic inference suggests that coupling arose during a period of allopatry and has been maintained for &gt; 1,000 generations after secondary contact. Overall, this study shows that the coupling of multiple chromosomal inversions contributes to strong reproductive isolation. Notably, 2 of the putative inversions overlap with inverted genomic regions associated with ecotype differences in a closely related species (<span>Littorina saxatilis</span>), suggesting the same regions, with similar structural variants, repeatedly contribute to ecotype evolution in distinct species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Letters Current Issue","siteHash":"ccc44437a8276654c44dddd156a8ce3b5dae5730f1c2406ed04aa90599bdf071","entryHash":"5fd1cff9b8be4b31aef0ba53519c088ecd2901f8c7c990eef35d29ec83b86e2e","category":"Environment"}
