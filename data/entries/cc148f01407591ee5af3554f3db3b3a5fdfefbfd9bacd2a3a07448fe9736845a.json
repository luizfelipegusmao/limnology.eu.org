{"title":"Research on microbial diversity and nutritional flavor formation of Xianju wheat paste","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13916?af=R","date":1726800892000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Xianju wheat paste, a traditional condiment in Hubei Province, China, possesses nutritional value and a distinctive taste profile. Nevertheless, there remains a dearth of comprehensive comprehension regarding the intricate interplay between the microbial population and its nutritional profile in Xianju wheat paste.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>It was determined that Xianju wheat paste harbors predominant microbial genera such as <i>Bacillus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus</i> and <i>Aspergillus</i>. The findings from high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed the presence of 11 bacterial genera in Xianju wheat paste, with relative abundances exceeding 1%. These genera included <i>Bacillus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Brevibacterium</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium</i>, <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, <i>Pantoea</i>, <i>Brachybacterium</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>, <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i> and <i>Ochrobactrum</i>. Furthermore, six fungal genera were identified with relative abundances greater than 1%, specifically <i>Aspergillus</i>, <i>Zygosaccharomyces</i>, <i>Cutaneotrichosporon</i>, <i>Candida</i>, <i>Millerozyma</i> and <i>Rhizopus.</i> The correlation analysis indicated a significant impact of the microbial community and nutritional flavor on the second phase of fermentation in Xianju wheat paste. The predominant bacterium <i>Bacillus</i> in Xianju wheat paste facilitated the production of free amino acids, whereas <i>Staphylococcus</i> exhibited a negative correlation with free amino acid levels. The quantity of volatile compounds in Xianju wheat paste progressively increased during fermentation, with the presence of typical aroma compounds 4-vinyl-2-methoxyphenol significantly associated with <i>Bacillus</i>. This indicated <i>Bacillus</i> notably enhanced the production of aromatic substances. Furthermore, a strong correlation was observed between <i>Staphylococcus</i> and the 18 volatile organic compounds, highlighting their substantial contribution to these aroma compounds.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This research indicates that the presence of microbial communities significantly contributes to the development of the nutritional flavor profile in Xianju wheat paste.
