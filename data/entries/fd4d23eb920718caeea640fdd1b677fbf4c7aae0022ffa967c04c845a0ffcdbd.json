{"title":"Critical role of endoplasmic reticulum stress on bisphenol A‐induced cytotoxicity in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24290?af=R","date":1713353335000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Bisphenol A (BPA) is widely used in plastic and paper products, and its exposure can occur through skin contact or oral ingestion. The hazardous effects of BPA absorbed through the skin may be more severe; however, few studies have investigated the skin toxicity of BPA. This study investigated the effects of BPA on human epidermal keratinocyte cell lines, which is relevant for skin exposure. BPA treatment reduced cell viability in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and elevated oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an oxidative stress inhibitor, reduced BPA-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. However, only 10% of the decreased cell viability was restored at the highest NAC concentration. Treatment with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), which is an ER stress inhibitor, effectively countered the increase in ER stress-related proteins induced by BPA. Moreover, TUDCA treatment led to a reduction in oxidative stress, as demonstrated by the decrease in ROS levels, maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential, and modulation of stress signaling proteins. Consequently, TUDCA significantly improved BPA-induced cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, combined treatment using TUDCA and NAC further reduced the BPA-induced ROS levels; however, no significant difference in cell viability was observed compared with that for TUDCA treatment alone. These findings indicated that the oxidative stress observed following BPA exposure was exacerbated by ER stress. Moreover, the principal factor driving BPA-induced cytotoxicity was indeed ER stress, which has potential implications for developing therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with similar stress responses.</p>","author":"Sou Hyun Kim, \nDong Wan Kang, \nDoyoung Kwon, \nYoung‐Suk Jung","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"fd4d23eb920718caeea640fdd1b677fbf4c7aae0022ffa967c04c845a0ffcdbd","category":"Environment"}
