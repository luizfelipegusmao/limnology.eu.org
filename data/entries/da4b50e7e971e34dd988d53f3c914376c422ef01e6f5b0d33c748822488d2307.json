{"title":"IDENTIFICATION OF DOMINANT PARAMETERS IN THE PREDICTION OF STATUS OF PEDIATRIC CONGENITAL HEART DISEASES ICU PATIENTS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0946/v1","date":1720687578000,"content":"Background: The key objective of this research was to identify the dominant parameters and determine the patient status of pediatric patients with congenital heart disease in the ICU. The data we collected from the Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) Surgery Unit (ICU) in the National Heart Foundation Hospital and Research Institute, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Data from 300 ICU patients was collected and analyzed. We choose patients who are less than 12 years old at the time of ICU admission and whose ICU stay is longer than 24 hours. (2) Methods: According to the doctor’s advice, the dependent and independent variables are selected. The relationship between these parameters in the ICU was selected by linear modeling, which is associated with mortality risk. These parameters are used in the linear regression model and the ARIMA model for prediction. The prediction model is used for pediatric congenital heart disease patients in the ICU. (3) Results: The relation between CVP and BP (95% CI=0.2113,0.353 r=0.2841249), PEEP, and FiO2 (95% CI=0.6992,0.770 r=0.7367744) is statistically significant (p value&amp;lt;0.001). pH and PO2 were statistically significant, but there were correlations (95% CI=0.161,0.308 r=0.2362575). The statistically significant (p &amp;lt; 0.001) parameters were selected for prediction. In this study, BP, FiO2, and PO2 parameters were used in the linear regression model and the ARIMA model for prediction. We predict the next-hour patient’s status. The ARIMA model was found to have less error than the linear regression model. (4) Conclusions: This study helps identify the important parameters that are measured in the ICU to monitor patient status and predict the future value of those parameters, with the ultimate goal of providing physicians with an early signal of future patient conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da4b50e7e971e34dd988d53f3c914376c422ef01e6f5b0d33c748822488d2307","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
