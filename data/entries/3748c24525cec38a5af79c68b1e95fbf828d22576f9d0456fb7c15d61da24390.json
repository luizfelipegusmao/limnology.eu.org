Herein, we show that despite cooler conditions post-release, 4/18 (22%) salmon died when caught-and-released at water temperatures ≥20°C, whereas 1/13 (8%) salmon caught-and-released at water temperatures ≤20°C, but who encountered mean water temperatures ≥20°C post-release, died. We conclude water temperature at time of the catch-and-release event remains the most suitable predictor of post-release survival.</p>","author":"Travis E.
