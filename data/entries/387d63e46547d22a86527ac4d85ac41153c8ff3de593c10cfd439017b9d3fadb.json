However, some in-dividuals do not experience anticipated improvements despite weight loss. Bi-omarkers to identify such individuals at early stages are lacking. IGF-1 and IGFBP-1 were shown to predict T2DM onset in prediabetes. We assessed if these markers also predict the success of lifestyle interventions, thereby possibly guid-ing personalized strategies.\nWe analyzed fasting serum levels of IGF-1, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 in relation to changes in metabolic and anthropometric parameters, including intrahepatic li-pids (IHL) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume measured by MRI, in 345 high-risk prediabetic participants (54% female; aged 36-80 years). Participants were enrolled in three randomized dietary intervention trials and assessed both at baseline and one year post-intervention. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 28), significance set at p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"387d63e46547d22a86527ac4d85ac41153c8ff3de593c10cfd439017b9d3fadb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
