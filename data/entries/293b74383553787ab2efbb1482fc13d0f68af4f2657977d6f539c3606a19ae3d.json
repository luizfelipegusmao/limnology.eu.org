{"title":"Thermal profiles of Cicindelidia haemorrhagica (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) activity in hot springs in Yellowstone National Park","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/5/829/7710773?rss=1","date":1720569600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The wetsalts tiger beetle, <span>Cicindelidia haemorrhagica</span> (LeConte) (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae), is found in several active thermal hot spring areas in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) where substrate surface temperatures can exceed 50 °C. However, relationships between surface temperatures and the time adults spend on them remain poorly understood. Therefore, we characterized thermal profiles of Dragon Spring and Rabbit Creek, 2 thermally active research sites containing <span>C. haemorrhagica</span> in YNP, to quantify the time adults spend at different surface temperatures. We took 58 thermal video recordings of adults over 6 total days of observation ranging from 10 to 15 min for each adult. Thermal video analysis results indicated a positive relationship between the total time adult beetles spent on surface temperatures from Dragon Spring and Rabbit Creek as temperatures increased from 20 °C. Once surface temperatures exceeded 40 °C, the total time spent at those surface temperatures declined. Adults were recorded on substrates exceeding 50 °C at one of the 2 research locations. Rabbit Creek had substantially more instances of adults present with surface temperatures exceeding 40 °C, including one individual on a surface temperature of 61.5 °C. There were 3 instances of beetles spending more than 4 min at a particular surface temperature, all within the preferred range of 30–40 °C. Our thermal profile results and previous behavioral observations suggest that adults may be resistant to the heat produced from the thermal waters that influence the substrate temperatures but may not be subject to high surface temperatures as previously reported.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"293b74383553787ab2efbb1482fc13d0f68af4f2657977d6f539c3606a19ae3d","category":"Environment"}
