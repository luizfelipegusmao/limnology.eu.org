Although prior studies have supported the monophyly of most recognized subfamilies, relationships among these groups remain inconsistently resolved and previous molecular phylogenies have failed to support the monophyly of a few subfamilies. To help address this deficiency, we combined 24 new complete mitogenomes representing 6 previously unsequenced subfamilies and 13 tribes with previously available data to create a dataset of 79 cicadellid taxa representing 16 subfamilies for phylogenetic analysis. The new analyses confirm that leafhopper mitochondrial genomes are highly conservative in overall structure, with only a few rare rearrangements of tRNAs. All phylogenetic analyses consistently supported the monophyly of previously recognized cicadellid tribes for which more than 1 representative was included and all of the included subfamilies were also consistently recovered as monophyletic with the exception of Aphrodinae and Eurymelinae. Bayesian inference and Maximum Likelihood analyses with site-homogeneous models are only slightly affected by nucleotide compositional heterogeneity and yield more stable phylogenetic relationships of family-group taxa than analyses with a heterogeneous-site mixture model using PhyloBayes. Molecular divergence time estimates indicate that the main lineages of Cicadellidae, most corresponding to recognized subfamilies, diverged during the Cretaceous period (93â€“121 Mya).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Insect Systematics and Diversity Current Issue","siteHash":"d4d59e2090793e303021830a9c164d689828dc5448b6052be7ec32e87f45cab0","entryHash":"6e1bd51fa0f583f16e4e3e22c1c7f642ebc2b99fb3546983545c4e045bbcfa6c","category":"Environment"}
