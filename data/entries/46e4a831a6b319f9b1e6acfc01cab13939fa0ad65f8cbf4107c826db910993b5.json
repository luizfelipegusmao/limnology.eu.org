{"title":"Innovative Seatbelt-Integrated Metasurface Radar for Enhanced In-Car Healthcare Monitoring","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1506/v1","date":1729255694000,"content":"This study introduces a novel seatbelt-integrated, non-invasive beam-focusing metamaterial sensing system characterized by its thinness and flexibility. The system comprises a flexible transmitarray lens and an FMCW radar sensor, enabling accurate detection and analysis of seatbelt usage and positioning through human tissue. The metasurface design remains effective even when subjected to different bending angles. Our system closely tracks heart rate and respiration, validated against standard reference methods, highlighting its potential for enhancing in-car healthcare monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate the systemâ€™s reliability in monitoring physiological signals within dynamic vehicular environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46e4a831a6b319f9b1e6acfc01cab13939fa0ad65f8cbf4107c826db910993b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
