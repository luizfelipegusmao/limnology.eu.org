However, changes in their structure and material culture in the late Holocene have led to different hypotheses concerning their ecological and cultural changes. The archaeological site Galheta IV (ca. 1300 to 500 years cal BP) offers new insights into the complexity of the late coastal occupation in southern Brazil. Our attempt was to determine whether Galheta IV can be classified as a <i>sambaqui</i> site, or if it belongs to a Southern <i>proto</i>-<i>Jê</i> settlement. Here, we reassessed Galheta’s collections and applied a multi-proxy approach using: new <sup>14</sup>C dates, zooarchaeology, δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N isotopes in bulk collagen and <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr<sub>enamel</sub> isotopic ratios from eight human individuals, ceramics analysis, and FTIR. The results indicate an intense exploitation of marine resources, with an area designated for processing animals located at the opposite side of the funerary areas. Bone tools and specific species of animals were found as burial accompaniments. No evidence of human cremations was detected. <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr results indicate that the eight human individuals always lived on the coast, and did not come from the inland. The pottery analysis confirms the association with Itararé-Taquara, but contrary to what was assumed by previous studies, the pottery seems related to other coastal sites, and not to the highlands. In light of these findings, we propose that Galheta IV can be considered a funerary mound resulting from long and continuous interactions between shellmound and Southern <i>proto</i>-<i>Jê</i> populations. This study not only enhances our understanding of the late coastal occupation dynamics in southern Brazil but also underscores its importance in reshaping current interpretations of shellmound cultural changes over time.","author":"Jessica Mendes Cardoso","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cb38bcd2c2aeabaeda95d6886222baa6a59968140c6b72beaa14109fb5154458","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
