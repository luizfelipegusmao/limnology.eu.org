{"title":"Enhancing Efficiency and Security in Unbalanced PSI-CA Protocols through Cloud Computing and Homomorphic Encryption in Mobile Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0307/v1","date":1715041712000,"content":"Private Set Intersection Cardinality(PSI-CA) is a cryptographic method in secure multi-party computation that allows entities to identify cardinality of the intersection without revealing their private data.Traditional approaches assume similar-sized datasets and equal computational power, overlooking practical imbalances.In real-world applications, dataset sizes and computational capacities often vary, particularly in the Internet of Things and mobile scenarios where device limitations restrict computational types. Traditional PSI-CA protocols are inefficient here, as computational and communication complexities correlate with the size of larger datasets. Thus, adapting PSI-CA protocols to these imbalances is crucial.This paper explores unbalanced scenarios where one party (the receiver) has a relatively small dataset and limited computational power, while the other party (the sender) has a large amount of data and strong computational capabilities.This paper, based on the concept of commutative encryption, introduces Cuckoo filter, cloud computing technology, homomorphic encryption, among other technologies, to construct three novel solutions for unbalanced Private Set Intersection Cardinality (PSI-CA): an unbalanced PSI-CA protocol based on Cuckoo filter, an unbalanced PSI-CA protocol based on single cloud assistance, and an unbalanced PSI-CA protocol based on dual cloud assistance. Depending on performance and security requirements, different protocols can be employed for various applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4915c62c7d00316ac0cc7c586cd1a0781be603213fdcc5e45a39451a6d1a136","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
