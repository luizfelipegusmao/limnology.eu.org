{"title":"Uncovering Financial Performance and Efficiency: A Glimpse into Indonesia&#039;s State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Construction Industry Debt and Financial Risk","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0832/v1","date":1718188729000,"content":"This study aims to evaluate the financial performance of SOEs in Indonesia and compare it with private companies using financial ratio analysis and efficiency analysis approaches. Four construction sector SOEs were evaluated, and five private companies were compared using financial data from 2015 to 2022. The financial ratio analysis used the Peterson (2013) approach, while the efficiency analysis employed the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach and the paired t-test. The study results show that the financial ratio performance of state-owned companies is relatively poor, with low profitability, critical liquidity, and a high debt ratio. Debt, as a source of capital in financing construction projects, makes companies face a greater debt risk. This study validates that SOEs have lower efficiency compared to private companies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6ec8b4672edfdf7b7ec56cc8b4727efe93b82a20bc8238190b506eb7d55f127","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
