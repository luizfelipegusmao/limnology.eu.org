Himmelfarb</p>\r\n\r\nOptimal blood pressure (BP) control is essential in averting cardiovascular disease and associated complications, yet multiple factors influence the achievement of BP targets. We explored patient-, provider-, and health facility-level factors of systolic and diastolic BP and controlled BP status among patients with hypertension in Ghana. Using a cross-sectional design, we recruited 15 health facilities, and from each facility, we recruited four healthcare providers involved in managing hypertension and 15 patients diagnosed with hypertension. The primary outcome of interest was systolic and diastolic BP; the secondary outcome was BP control (&lt;140/90 mmHg) in compliance with Ghanaâ€™s national standard treatment guidelines. We used mixed-effects regression models to explore the patient- and facility-level predictors of the outcomes. Two hundred twenty-four patients and 67 healthcare providers were sampled across 15 health facilities. The mean (SD) age of providers and patients was 32 (7) and 61 (13) years, respectively. Most (182 [81%]) of the patient participants were female, and almost half (109 [49%]) had controlled BP. At the patient level, traveling for 30 minutes to one hour to the health facility was associated with higher diastolic BP (Coeff.:3.75, 95% CI: 0.12, 7.38) and lower odds of BP control (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.92) compared to traveling for less than 30 minutes. Receiving hypertension care at government health facilities than at private health facilities was associated with lower systolic BP (Coeff.: -13.89; 95% CI: -23.99, -3.79). A higher patient-to-physician or physician-assistant ratio was associated with elevated systolic BP (Coeff.: 21.34; 95% CI: 8.94, 33.74) and lower odds of controlled BP (OR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.72). Along with addressing the patient-level factors influencing BP outcomes in Ghana, there is a need for public health and policy interventions addressing the inaccessibility of hypertension services, the shortage of clinical care providers, and the underperformance of private health facilities.","author":"Samuel Byiringiro","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"a72b25707b7aeee0881af3785732e38fe466347bb0317baea300c12ac2c2beb4","category":"Environment"}
