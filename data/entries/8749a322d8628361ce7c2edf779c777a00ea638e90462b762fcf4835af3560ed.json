{"title":"Xylan-directed cell wall assembly in grasses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2197/7473176?rss=1","date":1702512000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Xylan is the most abundant hemicellulosic polysaccharide in the cell walls of grasses and is pivotal for the assembly of distinct cell wall structures that govern various cellular functions. Xylan also plays a crucial role in regulating biomass recalcitrance, ultimately affecting the utilization potential of lignocellulosic materials. Over the past decades, our understanding of the xylan biosynthetic machinery and cell wall organization has substantially improved due to the innovative application of multiple state-of-the-art techniques. Notably, novel xylan-based nanostructures have been revealed in the cell walls of xylem vessels, promoting a more extensive exploration of the role of xylan in the formation of cell wall structures. This <span>Update</span> summarizes recent achievements in understanding xylan biosynthesis, modification, modeling, and compartmentalization in grasses, providing a brief overview of cell wall assembly regarding xylan. We also discuss the potential for tailoring xylan to facilitate the breeding of elite energy and feed crops.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"8749a322d8628361ce7c2edf779c777a00ea638e90462b762fcf4835af3560ed","category":"Environment"}
