{"title":"A tentative anatomy of Christian responses to anthropogenic climate change","link":"https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/doi/10.1093/oxfclm/kgae002/7550025?rss=1","date":1705276800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This pilot study addresses the differences in responses to anthropogenic climate change expressed in published normative statements for a cross section of Christian denominations and groupings from the UK and USA as well as international groupings. Grid-group cultural theory is tentatively employed to better understand these differences. Because the cosmologies identified by grid-group theory have as their basis the metaphor of the body, this is in effect a tentative anatomy of Christian responses to anthropogenic climate change. As a test case, this paper explores whether or not it is fruitful to attempt to challenge a given cosmological outlook to better communicate climate change and how this might be achieved or whether to speak to that cosmological perspective and how this might be achieved. In addition, this paper explores how each distinctive cosmology might contribute helpfully in responding to anthropogenic climate change. Finally, avenues of further work to expand this approach are explored.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Oxford Open Climate Change Current Issue","siteHash":"00d34e28b1e6fdd64576c95b4b9bf33bcd15bb32fadd247b4a29ecaac9c1ad73","entryHash":"978c491526e10858c1cd12ff95fa593f0e3384fb0f02389ffe56040c2f125182","category":"Environment"}
