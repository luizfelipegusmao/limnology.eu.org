{"title":"Atrial Fibrillation in Elite Athletes: A Comprehensive Review of Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1350/v1","date":1724116592000,"content":"According to current knowledge, although the beneficial effects of regular exercise training are well recognized, there are conflicting data regarding its relation with the occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in competitive athletes. The aim of this literature review was to demonstrate a comprehensive report of incidence, pathophysiology and management of AF in elite athletes. The frequency of AF to be 2 to 10 times greater in high intensity endurance athletes compared to sedentary individuals. A U-shaped relationship between male elite athletes and AF has been observed, while the type and the dose of physical activity seems to play a major role in AF development. Male gender, increasing age, endurance sports, and time of training are associated with AF, thereby confirming a likely association between athleticism and AF. Pathophysiology of AF still remains unclear but, there are suggested theories that include complex mechanisms such as alterations of autonomic tone, left atrial enlargement and fibrosis, electrical remodeling, and increased inflammation. Elite athletes with AF require a comprehensive clinical evaluation and risk factor optimization, similar to that for nonathletes. Although anticoagulation and rate or rhythm control are corner stones for AF management, however, there are still no specific guidelines for elite athletes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0045e478c72bb46ee68a8365bf6ee8881c42d2771d4125eb98a961f74cd17b03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
