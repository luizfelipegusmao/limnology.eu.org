Visualization strategy is used to present the geographical distribution of these 6056 poets, and its formation factors are also analyzed. The results reveal that majority of the poets come from Zhejiang, Henan and Sichuan provinces, with Guangdong province also exceeding a hundred poets despite its remote location. In the central area of Ningbo, Luoyang and Meishan, there are also large distribution of the poets. Over time, the density of poets in the south increases while it decreases in the north, and this pattern becomes more pronounced as time progresses. By employing visualization strategy, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the geographical distribution of poets of <i>Complete Song Poetry</i> in Song Dynasty to reflect the cultural, economic, and political development of Song China.","author":"Enhai Lei","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"441e3d4dad77408f6ead77f1d94d0f76e952e6c10cfd058c1b86a67488e4b691","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
