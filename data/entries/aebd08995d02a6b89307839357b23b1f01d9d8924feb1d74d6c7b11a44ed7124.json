{"title":"Gold-Coated Magnetic Nanoparticles Prepared via Ultrasonic Spray Pyrolysis: A Novel Approach for Enhanced Functionalisation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2274/v1","date":1727600568000,"content":"Magnetic nanoparticles coated with gold nanoparticles are hybrid nanostructures combining the magnetic properties of iron oxide with the optical and chemical versatility of gold. The iron oxide core gives the nanoparticles magnetic functionality, which is useful in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), targeted drug delivery, and hyperthermia treatment. The gold coating enhances biocompatibility, provides resistance to oxidation, and allows for surface functionalisation with biomolecules for targeted applications. This combination makes these nanoparticles ideal for a range of biomedical applications, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and imaging, due to their magnetic, optical, and chemical properties. Transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, zeta potential and magnetisation of nanoparticles are key techniques that provide a comprehensive understanding of the nanoparticlesâ€™ size, structure, optical properties and magnetic behaviour, which are important factors for determining their potential use in various applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aebd08995d02a6b89307839357b23b1f01d9d8924feb1d74d6c7b11a44ed7124","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
