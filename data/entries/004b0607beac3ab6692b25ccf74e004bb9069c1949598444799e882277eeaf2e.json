{"title":"Isolation and Characterization of Exosomes from Cancer Cells Using Antibody-Functionalized Paddle Screw Type Devices and Detection of Exosomal miRNA Using Piezoelectric Biosensor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1417/v1","date":1721212964000,"content":"Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles produced by almost all cell types in the human body and exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that are known to serve as important biomarkers for diseases such as cancer. Given that the upregulation of miR-106b is closely associated with several types of malignancies, the sensitive and accurate detection of miR-106b is important but difficult. In this study, a surface acoustic wave (SAW) biosensor was developed to detect miR-106b isolated from the cancer cells based on immunoaffinity separation technique using our unique paddle screw device. Our novel SAW biosensor could detect a miR-106b concentration as low as 0.024 pM in a linear range from 0.1 pM to 1.0 Î¼M with a correlation coefficient of 0.9939. Additionally, we were able to successfully detect miR-106b in total RNA extracted from the exosomes isolated from the MCF-7 cancer cell line, a model system for human breast cancer, with performance comparable to commercial RT-qPCR methods. Therefore, the exosome isolation by paddle screw method and the miRNA detection using the SAW biosensor has the potential to be used in basic biological research and clinical diagnosis as an alternative to RT-qPCR.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"004b0607beac3ab6692b25ccf74e004bb9069c1949598444799e882277eeaf2e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
