{"title":"Development of a Mock-up of a Smart Insole Using FSR and ADXL345","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1680/v2","date":1714383804000,"content":"This research article describes the creation of a mock-up for a Smart Insole prototype that employs Force Sensitive Resistors (FSRs) and an ADXL345 accelerometer. The mock-up is an early step towards realising the concept and functionality of the planned Smart Insole system. The key factors in the mock-up's design, integration, and testing are highlighted, with a focus on the iterative refining and optimisation process. The mock-up, which was carefully planned and implemented, highlights the practicality and possible applications of Smart Insole technology in healthcare, sports performance measurement, and rehabilitation. The paper outlines the development process and implementation of a \"Smart Insole\" utilizing Force Sensitive Resistors (FSR) and the ADXL345 accelerometer. The project aims to create an innovative wearable technology solution for monitoring foot biomechanics and enhancing human performance. The Smart Insole prototype integrates FSRs strategically placed on the insole to capture pressure distribution across the foot, along with an ADXL345 accelerometer to track foot orientation and movement. Through a combination of hardware integration, firmware development using Arduino IDE, and visualization using Processing application, the Smart Insole offers real-time monitoring and analysis of gait dynamics, pressure distribution, and foot movement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b9dba66c68bf3ac9e760f54a0b31041515ec850932d1d25355dc83a62c65b9b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
