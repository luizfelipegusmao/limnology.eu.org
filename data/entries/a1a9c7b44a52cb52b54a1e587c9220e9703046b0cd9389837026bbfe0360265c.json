{"title":"Unveiling the economic potential of sports industry in China: A data driven analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310131","date":1726149600000,"content":"<p>by Haishan Liu</p>\r\n\r\nThe article explains the economic dynamics of the sports industry with adoption of deep learning algorithms and data mining methodology. Despite outstanding improvements in research of sports industry, a significant gap prevails with regard to proper quantification of economic benefits of this industry. Therefore, the current research is an attempt to filling this gap by proposing a specific economic model for the sports sector. This paper examines the data of sports industry covering the time span of 2012 to 2022 by using data mining technology for quantitative analyses. Deep learning algorithms and data mining techniques transform the gained information from sports industry databases into sophisticated economic models. The developed model then makes the efficient analysis of diverse datasets for underlying patterns and insights, crucial in realizing the economic trajectory of the industry. The findings of the study reveal the importance of sports industry for economic growth of China. Moreover, the application of deep learning algorithm highlights the importance of continuous learning and training on the economic data from the sports industry. It is, therefore, an entirely novel approach to build up an economic simulation framework using deep learning and data mining, tailored to the intricate dynamics of the sports industry.","author":"Haishan Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a1a9c7b44a52cb52b54a1e587c9220e9703046b0cd9389837026bbfe0360265c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
