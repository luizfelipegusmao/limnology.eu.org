{"title":"Surface Characterization of Nanostructured ITO Films of Oxygen Plasma Gas by Magnetron Sputtering for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0013/v1","date":1717462370000,"content":"The surface characterization of indium tin oxide (ITO) films was processed by oxygen (O2) plasma gas using a magnetron sputtering method of varying O2-plasma gas from 20 sccm to 100 sccm for potentially fostering in electronic devices applications on dye-sensitize solar cells (DSSC) in this work. In order to gain an outstanding performance rate with high-quality thin films, the affect of correlation between the electrical, optical, and morphology properties was significantly investigated. Clearly, the content of investigation exhibited that the films properties was changed by variation of the gas composition. These changes have contemporary relevance to the sputtering gas during the deposition process. To conclude, the greatest electrical properties was displayed by O2 -plasma gas flow rate of 20 sccm, which showed the lowest resistivity. In addition to this, the final products were practically fabricated to active layers for dye-sensitize solar cells (DSSC) applications. The highest efficiency of DSSC device was indicated of approximately 0.35% which was located by 40 sccm of the O2-plasma gas. Consequently, the study could be a possibility way of preparing ITO thin films with improved special properties of substantial applications for solar cells devices in the near future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c8866b99a3c99c94991bf7a5ebfda8230c1e7b7ebf0939384ac394462d3eb8d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
