In the EC-CBPAC process, three stainless-steel cathodes and three aluminum electrodes were connected to the negative and positive terminals of the power supply, respectively. The initial concentrations in the leachate were 1044 mg O<sub>2</sub>/L for COD, 204 mg/L for NH<sub>3</sub>-N, and 57 NTU (or 71.25-mg (NH<sub>2</sub>)2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/L) for turbidity, respectively. After a 40-min EC-CBPAC process, with a CBPAC dosage of 5 g/L and pH of 5 for COD and turbidity, and 9.5 for NH<sub>3</sub>-N, the optimum removal efficiencies for COD, NH<sub>3</sub>-N, and turbidity were achieved at 92%, 40%, and 91%, respectively. When the EC process was applied without CBPAC under the same experimental conditions, the removal efficiencies of COD, NH<sub>3</sub>-N, and turbidity were 87%, 28%, and 54%, respectively. Before and after the EC-CBPAC process, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, pore volume, and mean pore diameter of the CBPAC were found to be (888 m<sup>2</sup>/g, 0.498 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, and 22.28 Å) and (173 m<sup>2</sup>/g, 0.18 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, and 42.8 Å), respectively. The optimum pseudo-first-order (PFO) rate constants for COD, turbidity, and NH<sub>3</sub>-N were determined to be 3.15 × 10<sup>−2</sup>, 4.77 × 10<sup>−2</sup>, and 8.8 × 10<sup>−3</sup> min<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. With the current density increasing from 15 to 25 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, energy consumption, unit energy consumption, and total cost increased from 68.7 to 122.4 kWh/m<sup>3</sup>, 6.948 to 15.226 kWh/kg COD, and 0.85 to 1.838 $/kg COD, respectively.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner points</h2>\n<p>\nEC-CBPAC process has greater COD, NH<sub>3</sub>-N, and turbidity removal efficiency than EC process.\nCOD and turbidity achieved their optimum disposal efficiencies at 92% and 91%, respectively, at pH 5\nThe most efficient disposal efficiency for NH<sub>3</sub>-N was observed to be 40% at pH 9.5.\nEC-CBPAC process increased removal efficiencies for COD, NH<sub>3</sub>-N, and turbidity by 20%, 19%, and 38%, respectively, compared with EC alone.\nThe turbidity, NH<sub>3</sub>-N, and COD disposal fitted PSO model due to high correlation values (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> 0.94–0.99).\n</p>","author":"Aysenur Ogedey, \nEnsar Oguz","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"f9754f56b9ad1215a97101d4e3379067a66a1d852a2a726ad01b4f314578b33f","category":"Environment"}
