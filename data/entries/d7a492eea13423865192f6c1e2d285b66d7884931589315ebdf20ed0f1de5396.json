{"title":"Determine the Grain Structure of Poly-Silicon Using Differential Phase Contrast Imaging","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.596/7719657?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The grain structure of polysilicon is of paramount significance in determining the mobility and transfer characteristics of thin-film transistor [<a href=\"#ozae044.596-B1\">1</a>], however, it is difficult to evaluate the morphology of polycrystalline based on regular imaging methodology. Regular scanning/ transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) imaging setup may not delivery sufficient contrast on grain structures (Fig.1 a-d), despite the collection angle could be manipulated by turning the camera length. The grain structures could be extracted according with the diffraction pattern, such as precession electron diffraction (PED) and 4D-STEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.596-B2\">2</a>], through it is significant time and resource consuming for collecting the data and processing of spatially resolved diffraction map. Here in, an analytical capability that provide informative detail of grain structure with productive cycle is highly required in semiconductor industry for the Polysilicon process development and fast ramp-up. The presented research introduces the application of differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging on grain structure analysis of Polysilicon.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d7a492eea13423865192f6c1e2d285b66d7884931589315ebdf20ed0f1de5396","category":"Environment"}
