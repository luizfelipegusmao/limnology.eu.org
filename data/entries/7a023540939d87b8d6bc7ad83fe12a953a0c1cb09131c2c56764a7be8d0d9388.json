{"title":"Effects of water extract from Cornus controversa on the expression levels of DiSOC1-b and DiCCoAOMT1 genes related with the growth of dove tree seedlings","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jpe/article/doi/10.1093/jpe/rtae009/7607735?rss=1","date":1707868800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Although characterization of plant interactions has become a research hotspot to assess the adaptability of endangered plants, the underlying molecular basis remains elusive. Dove tree (<span>Davidia involucrata</span>) seedlings were watered with distilled water (CK), leaf water extract (0.025 g mL<sup>−1</sup>) and branch water extract (0.1 g mL<sup>−1</sup>) from <span>Cornus controversa</span>, respectively. Subsequently, the morphology, biomass and gene expression levels of <span>DiSOC1-b</span> and <span>DiCCoAOMT1</span> were analyzed. The results showed that morphological traits and biomass accumulation of <span>D. involucrata</span> seedlings were decreased by the addition of leaf water extracts, and increased by branch water extracts. Moreover, the gene expression level of <span>DiSOC1-b</span> was significantly down-regulated, while the gene expression level of <span>DiCCoAOMT1</span> was significantly up-regulated in the stems and roots of <span>D. involucrata</span> upon treatment with leaf water extracts of <span>C. controversa.</span> In contrast, the gene expression level of <span>DiSOC1-b</span> was significantly up-regulated in the leaves and stems, while the gene expression level of <span>DiCCoAOMT1</span> was significantly down-regulated in the roots of <span>D</span>. <span>involucrata</span> upon treatment with branch water extracts of <span>C. controversa</span>. In addition, the expression level of <span>DiSOC1-b</span> was positively correlated with most of morphological traits and total biomass (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), while <span>DiCCoAOMT1</span> was negatively correlated with the majority of morphological traits in <span>D. involucrata</span> seedlings (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Taken together, these results suggest that water extracts from the leaves and branches of the <span>C. controversa</span> exhibit opposite allelopathic effects and affect the expression levels of genes related to growth (<span>DiSOC1-b</span>) and environmental adaptability (<span>DiCCoAOMT1</span>) in <span>D. involucrata</span> seedlings.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plant Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"532f26bf1ba0f166bd6491390ce5cd237faca477af455cac49d2509f7b38d556","entryHash":"7a023540939d87b8d6bc7ad83fe12a953a0c1cb09131c2c56764a7be8d0d9388","category":"Environment"}
