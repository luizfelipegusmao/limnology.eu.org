{"title":"Understanding Consumer Perceptions of Virtual Reality in Marketing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0364/v1","date":1722937659000,"content":"This study explores consumer perceptions of virtual reality (VR) in marketing, aiming to understand how immersive technology impacts engagement and brand perception. As VR continues to evolve and integrate into various marketing strategies, it becomes crucial to examine its effectiveness and the factors influencing consumer attitudes. Through a detailed thematic analysis, this research identifies key themes such as familiarity with VR technology, immersion and engagement, technical quality, accessibility, personalization, storytelling, social interaction, purchase intentions, and brand perception. The findings reveal that familiarity with VR enhances enthusiasm and comfort, leading to more positive attitudes towards VR marketing. The immersive and multi-sensory nature of VR provides a significant advantage over traditional advertising methods, fostering stronger emotional connections and increasing memorability. However, the quality of the VR experience is critical; high-quality graphics and seamless interactions are essential for maintaining positive consumer perceptions. Technical issues, such as lag and motion sickness, can negatively impact the experience, especially for those less acquainted with VR technology. Accessibility remains a challenge, with limited access to VR headsets restricting the reach of VR marketing campaigns. Personalization of VR content is highly valued, though it must be balanced with ethical considerations related to data privacy. The power of storytelling in VR enhances engagement by allowing consumers to actively participate in narratives. Social interaction within VR experiences adds an extra layer of enjoyment. The study also highlights the practical applications of VR marketing in high-involvement sectors and underscores the need for continuous innovation and consumer feedback to maximize the technology's impact. Overall, VR holds significant potential to transform marketing practices by offering immersive, engaging, and memorable experiences that deepen consumer connections and drive positive outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b43f193d7f6016305e422cdd23045dc7b45353f2d252c6bf6556741348e40940","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
