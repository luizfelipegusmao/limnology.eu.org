{"title":"Design and assembly of the 117-kb Phaeodactylum tricornutum chloroplast genome","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2217/7480117?rss=1","date":1702944000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>There is growing impetus to expand the repertoire of chassis available to synthetic biologists. Chloroplast genomes present an interesting alternative for engineering photosynthetic eukaryotes; however, development of the chloroplast as a synthetic biology chassis has been limited by a lack of efficient techniques for whole-genome cloning and engineering. Here, we demonstrate two approaches for cloning the 117-kb <span>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</span> chloroplast genome that have 90% to 100% efficiency when screening as few as 10 yeast (<span>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>) colonies following yeast assembly. The first method reconstitutes the genome from PCR-amplified fragments, whereas the second method involves precloning these fragments into individual plasmids from which they can later be released. In both cases, overlapping fragments of the chloroplast genome and a cloning vector are homologously recombined into a singular contig through yeast assembly. The cloned chloroplast genome can be stably maintained and propagated within <span>Escherichia coli</span>, which provides an exciting opportunity for engineering a delivery mechanism for bringing DNA directly to the algal chloroplast. Also, one of the cloned genomes was designed to contain a single <span>Sap</span>I site within the yeast <span>URA3</span> (coding for orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase) open-reading frame, which can be used to linearize the genome and integrate designer cassettes via golden-gate cloning or further iterations of yeast assembly. The methods presented here could be extrapolated to other species—particularly those with a similar chloroplast genome size and architecture (e.g. <span>Thalassiosira pseudonana</span>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"cebdcf23a79fec9099fc9b2174dbadff37ab5069563a58e80b87f9435d84d1cc","category":"Environment"}
