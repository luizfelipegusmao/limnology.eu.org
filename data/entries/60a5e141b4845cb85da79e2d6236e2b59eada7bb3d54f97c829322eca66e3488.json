{"title":"Planar Rectangular Microstrip Antenna for Partial Discharge Detection: Experimental Validation on Oil-Filled Transformer Tank","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1810/v1","date":1719389561000,"content":"A Partial discharge (PD) occurrence in high-voltage (HV) and medium-voltage (MV) power assets is a warning sign of insulation system degradation or defective manufacturing/assembly, that may cause catastrophic damage and eventually lead to the breakdown of the power equipment. Ultra-high frequency (UHF) PD measurement technology has extensively been used to monitor the insulation health of the HV or MV equipment due to its high immunity against ambient noise and conducted disturbances. This paper presents experimental validation of a new design of a UHF planar rectangular microstrip antenna that can be used for PD monitoring of HV and/or MV power equipment, such as power transformers. The designed planar rectangular microstrip antenna has a compact size of 80mmx70mmx1.6mm. Laboratory experiments were performed to validate the antenna sensitivity to PD activity caused by insulation defects created inside an oil-filled transformer tank model. PD measurement results confirm that the proposed rectangular microstrip antenna has high sensitivity and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thanks to its capability to suppress external noise disturbances, especially during online PD monitoring. Thus, the proposed UHF antenna seems to be a promising and alternative PD sensor that can be employed in UHF PD monitoring systems of HV or MV power equipment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60a5e141b4845cb85da79e2d6236e2b59eada7bb3d54f97c829322eca66e3488","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
