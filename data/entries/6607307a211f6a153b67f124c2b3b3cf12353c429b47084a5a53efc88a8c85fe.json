{"title":"Lake shape and the characteristics of migration behavior modify Atlantic salmon smolt migration success through lakes","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15972?af=R","date":1729749282000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Migration is a high-risk behavior. For the Atlantic salmon, <i>Salmo salar</i>, migrating from its river nursery area to marine feeding grounds, the magnitude of risk varies with habitat type. Passage through lakes, in particular, is associated with low rates of migration success. Downstream migrating salmon smolts are rheotactic when migrating in rivers, but lakes typically provide poorer directional currents for migrating salmon. In this study we tested if, in the absence of clear navigational cues in lakes, Atlantic salmon smolts switch to a random search strategy to find the outflowing river. We constructed random search simulations to test if lake basin shape has an effect on migration success. We also compared simulated migration characteristics with migrations of salmon smolts through five real lakes for which there are telemetry data for migrating salmon. Correlated random walk simulations showed that a random search strategy could be successful for all lake shapes tested but was more successful in curved (round and elliptical) than rectangular basin shapes. Rectangular basins with the migration start and stop points at the ends of the lake had a higher success than those where these points were perpendicular to the axis of the lake. In general, a random walk model predicted the migration success rate of fish tracked through real lakes. However, for two lakes the simulated migration success exceeded that of actual success, suggesting that fish passing through these lakes were not adopting a random search strategy. We speculate that this is the result of either conflicting navigational cues which inhibit smolts from finding the lake outlet or that they temporarily suspend migration (e.g., to feed). Modelling predicted that for small lakes, directional swimming in short steps (ca. 100 m) followed by turns with very low variation from the direction of travel resulted in the highest migration success. For larger lakes, longer step lengths but also with low turn variation (simulated turning angle drawn from distributions of standard deviation 2<b>°</b> and 5<b>°</b> around a mean of 0<b>°</b>) resulted in the highest migration success. We conclude that navigation in downstream migrating salmon smolts switches from rheotaxis in rivers to a random search tactic in lakes except where residual flow cues in some lakes prevent this, at times resulting in suboptimal navigation outcomes.</p>","author":"Matthew Newton, \nJoseph McCallum, \nHannele M.
