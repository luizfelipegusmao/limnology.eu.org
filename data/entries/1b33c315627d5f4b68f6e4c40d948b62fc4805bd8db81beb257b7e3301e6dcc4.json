{"title":"Philosophical Inquiry of Keselarasan Local Wisdom to Advance The Foundations of Community Well-Being","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1384/v1","date":1713773839000,"content":"Differences are an unavoidable reality, both in Java-Indonesia and throughout the world. Therefore, a social psychological foundation for healthy coexistence is crucial. Differences can lead to unhealthy social problems without wisdom, such as tensions, quarrels, and even bloody social conflicts. For this reason, the study of the indigenous local wisdom of Keselarasan can provide the social psychological foundations for community well-being. Keselarasan contains basic principles for living together in multicultural societal conditions. This descriptive research type utilizes philosophical analysis, ethnography, and literature study. This study finds the basic behavioral principles of respect (urmat), peace (rukun), and empan papan (knowing how to place oneself). They constitute a psychological mindset and pattern of thought needed to manage differences and advance community well-being. These social and psychological principles contribute an alternative way to avoid 1bloody conflicts and build togetherness, or human coexistence in peace.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b33c315627d5f4b68f6e4c40d948b62fc4805bd8db81beb257b7e3301e6dcc4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
