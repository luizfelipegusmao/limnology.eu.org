{"title":"A New Quadratic Transformation Identity for the Confluent Heun Function","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0825/v1","date":1728558487000,"content":"We present a new quadratic transformation identity for the confluent Heun function. This transformation is independent of the previously discovered quadratic transformation (Heliyon 10, e36535, 2024) and offers additional insights into the properties of this special function. Like the first transformation, this new identity involves two arbitrary parameters and has potential applications in both mathematical and physical contexts, particularly in quantum mechanics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"06c1fe6e614f78bae59a48ed75ca02956dc2a287820b86f39c08cb056ca3ba8d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
