{"title":"5'-oxospiro3 (fluorene-9,4'-imidazolidine)-2'-thione","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2597/v1","date":1722483210000,"content":"The structure verification of 5'-oxospiro-(fluorene-9,4'-imidazolidine)-2'-thione by NMR was reported. For the aim, 2D NMR techniques including 1H-1H COSY, HMQC and HMBC experiments were used to assist the assignment of the 1H and 13C chemical shifts for the corresponding structure. The mutual interpretation of the 1D and 2D NMR spectra ensured a complete and an accurate 1H and 13C NMR data assignment for 5'-oxospiro-(fluorene-9,4'-imidazolidine)-2'-thione.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"572310591aff199d5e1b7c320f20ae52bd9038204debcbc8ac509b59d848d5f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
