Initially, TiB2 nanoparticles with a size ranging from 50 to 150 nm were synthesized using the borothermal reduction method in NaF-AlF3 molten salts at 1238 K. Subsequently, electrophoretic deposition experiment was conducted by applying a cell voltage of 1.2 V (corresponding to an electric field of 0.6V/cm) for 1 h in the molten salts containing TiB2 nanoparticles, resulting in a uniform, continuous, and dense TiB2 coating with a thickness of 35 μm on the molybdenum substrate. Moreover, the corrosion resistance of the TiB2 coated molybdenum metal to molten zinc was tested through continuous immersion. After 120 h of immersion, the TiB2 coating showed no signs of cracking or peeling off, successfully protecting the molybdenum metal substrate from corrosion by molten zinc. The results confirm that the molten salt electrophoretic deposition technique can be used to prepare TiB2 coatings with good resistance to molten zinc corrosion on molybdenum metal.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b920347a27de785c5a4d246a60388b5e5b61619bd7f40d8d92e6711dbe423436","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
