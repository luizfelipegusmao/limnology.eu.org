{"title":"The Effect of a Care Bundle on the Rate of Blood Culture Contamination in a General ICU","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1508/v1","date":1729320562000,"content":"Background/Objectives: A blood culture (BC) care bundle is aimed at decreasing BC contamination rate. This study examined prospectively the effect of a care bundle on BC contamination rates in a high workload ICU. Methods: We performed a before-after study in a general ICU, from January 2018 to May 2019. Blood culture sets were classified as positive, contaminated, indeterminate and negative. We used bivariate and interrupted time series analysis to assess the effect of the intervention and factors associated with contamination rates. Results: During the study, a total of 4236 BC vials were collected. BC Contamination rate decreased significantly after the intervention from 6.2% to 1.3%. Incidence rate of contaminated BC sets was significantly lower in the POST phase: 0.461 vs 0.154 BC sets per 100 ICU bed-days. Overall compliance with the BC care bundle increased from 3.4% to 96.9%. Conclusions: The care bundle was effective in reducing BC contamination and improving several quality indicators in our setting. The indeterminate BC rate is an important problem, and we suggest that it should be included in BC quality indicators. : The BC care bundle implementation was effective in reducing BC contamination rate, although its long-term effect was not assessed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e5329937b65f8b173ee046cdadb57cdde112313fea42ffbc940158d2135a0a2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
