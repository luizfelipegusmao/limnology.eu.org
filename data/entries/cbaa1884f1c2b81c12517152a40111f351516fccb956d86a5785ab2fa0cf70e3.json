{"title":"Multidimensional Study of the Attitude Towards Euthanasia of Older Adults with Mixed Anxiety-Depressive Disorder","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0671/v1","date":1712712082000,"content":"Introduction: This study aims to verify if elderly patients with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder are more prone to euthanasia and identify factors that interfere with their satisfaction with health and capacity for well-informed decisions. Material and Methods: The study applied a paper questionnaire composed of a sociodemographic section and a battery of scales (to assess depression, anxiety, cognitive performance, suicide risk, therapeutic adhesion, functionality, loneliness, attitude towards euthanasia, decision pattern, personality, empathy and health status) in the Psychogeriatric Unity of Senhora da Oliveira Hospital in Portugal. The sample was collected by convenience to include patients and controls of the same age. Six months later, a reassessment was done. Patients and controls were compared using descriptive statistics and a multiple-regression model.Results: A total of 114 patients and 25 controls were included. Eighty-one point six per cent of patients had four or fewer years of schooling. Contrary to controls, they presented mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, loneliness feelings, worse cognitive performance, a more fragile personality, higher personal distress and a poorer health state. No statistically significant differences were found between controls and patients regarding their attitudes towards euthanasia. Patients more favourable to euthanasia had higher empathic concern, conscientiousness and fantasy and lower personal distress.Discussion and Conclusion: When addressing euthanasia in these patients, it is crucial to ensure they are fully self-determinate and that all the necessary treatment and support are available. It may not be the case when the educational level is low and mild disease persists, significantly affecting their well-being and cognitive performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbaa1884f1c2b81c12517152a40111f351516fccb956d86a5785ab2fa0cf70e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
