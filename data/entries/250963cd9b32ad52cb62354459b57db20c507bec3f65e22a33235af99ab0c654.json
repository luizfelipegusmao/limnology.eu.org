{"title":"The Elba Curves","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1598/v2","date":1712327247000,"content":"This article deals with special curves similar to those known in mathematics as Lamé curves. Their equations have a certain similarity with the equations of Lamé curves. But these curves are more like ellipses in appearance. Like ellipses, they have major and minor axes. These are such curves that their major and minor semi-axis coincide with an ellipse but are different than an ellipse. The main feature of these curves is that for any triangle whose base coincides with the axis of a given curve and the vertex is on a given curve, the condition an+bn=cn is obtained. The number “n” is called the degree or rank of this curve. To distinguish this group of curves, we called them Elbe curves. The equations of these lines are also provided in the paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"250963cd9b32ad52cb62354459b57db20c507bec3f65e22a33235af99ab0c654","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
