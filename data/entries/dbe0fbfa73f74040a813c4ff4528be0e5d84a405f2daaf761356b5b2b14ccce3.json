{"title":"MAST: Phylogenetic Inference with Mixtures Across Sites and Trees","link":"https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/73/2/375/7616281?rss=1","date":1709164800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Hundreds or thousands of loci are now routinely used in modern phylogenomic studies. Concatenation approaches to tree inference assume that there is a single topology for the entire dataset, but different loci may have different evolutionary histories due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), introgression, and/or horizontal gene transfer; even single loci may not be treelike due to recombination. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce an implementation of a multi-tree mixture model that we call mixtures across sites and trees (MAST). This model extends a prior implementation by <a href=\"#CIT0006\">Boussau et al. (2009)</a> by allowing users to estimate the weight of each of a set of pre-specified bifurcating trees in a single alignment. The MAST model allows each tree to have its own weight, topology, branch lengths, substitution model, nucleotide or amino acid frequencies, and model of rate heterogeneity across sites. We implemented the MAST model in a maximum-likelihood framework in the popular phylogenetic software, IQ-TREE. Simulations show that we can accurately recover the true model parameters, including branch lengths and tree weights for a given set of tree topologies, under a wide range of biologically realistic scenarios. We also show that we can use standard statistical inference approaches to reject a single-tree model when data are simulated under multiple trees (and vice versa). We applied the MAST model to multiple primate datasets and found that it can recover the signal of ILS in the Great Apes, as well as the asymmetry in minor trees caused by introgression among several macaque species. When applied to a dataset of 4 Platyrrhine species for which standard concatenated maximum likelihood (ML) and gene tree approaches disagree, we observe that MAST gives the highest weight (i.e., the largest proportion of sites) to the tree also supported by gene tree approaches. These results suggest that the MAST model is able to analyze a concatenated alignment using ML while avoiding some of the biases that come with assuming there is only a single tree. We discuss how the MAST model can be extended in the future.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Systematic Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ff28aeeb9b03783edee2039c6a58e13e932a0eb216cc2d8b21d5a99c6800e59a","entryHash":"dbe0fbfa73f74040a813c4ff4528be0e5d84a405f2daaf761356b5b2b14ccce3","category":"Environment"}
