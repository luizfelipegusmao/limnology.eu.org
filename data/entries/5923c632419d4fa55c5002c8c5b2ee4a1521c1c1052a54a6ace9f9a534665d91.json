{"title":"Application of Synephrine to Grape Increases Anthocyanin via Production of Hydrogen Peroxide, Not Phytohormones","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1378/v1","date":1713774551000,"content":"The global warming has caused poor grape skin coloration and reduced the production of high-quality berries. To overcome these problems, the effect of synephrine (Syn) on anthocyanin accumulation was investigated. Syn treatment above 1 mM increased anthocyanin content in cultured grape cells in a molecular-structure-specific and concentration-dependent manner, and increased only the anthocyanin without affecting the sugar/acid ratio in grape bunches. It increased the expression of genes linked to anthocyanin synthesis after 24 h of treatment, without affecting phytohormone levels. Syn treatment induced the expression of SOD3, elevating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production from 3 to 24 h after treatment in cultured cells. Subsequent increases in CAT and APX6 expression occurred, which encode H2O2-eliminating enzymes. In cultured grape cells, Syn and H2O2 treatments upregulated the H2O2-responsive gene Chit4 and the anthocyanin-biosynthesis-related genes mybA1 and UFGT 4 days after the treatments and promoted anthocyanin accumulation 7 days after the treatments. In berries, both treatments enhanced anthocyanin accumulation after 9 days. These results suggest that Syn promotes anthocyanin accumulation through the production of H2O2 without the upregulation of phytohormone biosynthesis. Syn treatment is expected to improve poor grape coloration and contribute to higher-quality fruit production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5923c632419d4fa55c5002c8c5b2ee4a1521c1c1052a54a6ace9f9a534665d91","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
