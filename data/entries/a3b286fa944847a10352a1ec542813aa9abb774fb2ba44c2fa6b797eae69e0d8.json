{"title":"Analytical Prediction of Multi-Phase Texture in Laser Powder Bed Fusion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2219/v1","date":1727575891000,"content":"For advancing manufacturing, arising AM, with an inverse philosophical approach compared to conventional procedures, has benefits that include intricate fabrication, reduced material waste, flexible design, and more. Regardless of its potential, AM must overcome several challenges due to multi-physical processes with miscellaneous physical stimuli in diverse materials systems and situations, such as anisotropic microstructure and mechanical properties, a restricted choice of materials, defects, and high cost. Unlike conventional experimental work that requires extensive trial and error resources and FEM, which generally consumes substantial computational power, the analytical approach based on physics is an exceptional choice. Understanding the relationship between the microstructure and material properties of the fabricated parts is a crucial focus in AM research. Texture is a vital factor in almost every modern industry. This study first proposed a physics-based model to foreshadow the multi-phase crystallographic orientation distribution in Ti-6Al-4V LPBF while considering the part boundary conditions due to the importance of part geometry in real industry. The thermal distribution obtained from this function operates as the information for the single-phase crystallographic texture model. In this model, we forerun and validate the orientations of single-phase materials utilizing three Euler Angles with the principles of CET and thermodynamics, as well as the intensity of the texture by approximating them with published results. Then, we transform the single-phase texture into a dual-phase texture in Bunge calculation, illustrating visualized by pole figures of both BCC and HCP phases. This texture evolution model provides a new paradigm for future researchers to model the texture or microstructure evolution semi-analytically and save many computational resources in a real-world perspective. Others have not yet done this work about simulating the multi-phase texture in an analytical approach, so this work bridges the gap in this field. Furthermore, this paper establishes the foundation for future research on materials properties affected by microstructure or texture in academic and industrial environments. The precision and dependability of the results obtained through this method make it a valuable tool for ongoing research and advancement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a3b286fa944847a10352a1ec542813aa9abb774fb2ba44c2fa6b797eae69e0d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
