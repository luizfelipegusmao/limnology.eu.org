{"title":"Identification of Natural Compounds for Long COVID Based on Hub Gene Biomarkers and Repurposed Drugs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0890/v1","date":1723532168000,"content":"Long COVID is a phenomenon in which individuals experience persistent symptoms after recovering from COVID-19. The symptoms are discovered to be unique for every individual and can affect multiple organs systems in the body. This study aims to identify effective natural remedies for long COVID by analyzing hub genes associated with the symptoms of the condition and evaluating the repurposed drugs catered and used for treating the symptoms of long COVID. The most common and prevalent symptoms of long COVID were identified; Fatigue, Shortness of Breath, Loss of Smell, Headache, Brain Fog, Chest Pain, Insomnia, Heart Palpitations, Dizziness, Joint Pain, Depression, Anxiety, Tinnitus, Loss of Appetite. Hub genes for each of the symptoms provided an insight on the key biological pathways of the symptom. Repurposed drugs identified, provided the template to identify the natural compounds with similar structure as a potential therapeutic drug. The natural compounds were retrieved using fingerprint search of the repurposed drugs from the NPASS Database. The findings of this study suggest several natural remedies for each symptom based on the molecular docking of the hub gene and natural compound using iGEMDOCK. The identified natural remedies may hold promise in treating long COVID, but further research is required to explore the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed natural compounds. The results of the study pose important implications for the development of effective treatments for long COVID.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ebc8b5eb88a601d5b3e1ff3941e84eea0ff79d9f00324ba2d0901ce8e429734","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
