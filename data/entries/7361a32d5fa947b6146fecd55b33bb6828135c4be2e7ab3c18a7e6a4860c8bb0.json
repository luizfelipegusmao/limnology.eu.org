{"title":"Enhancing Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder Using Generative Adversarial Networks: A Personalized and Adaptive Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0107/v1","date":1725324484000,"content":"Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is a common mental health condition characterized by an intense fear of social situations, leading to significant impairments in daily functioning. Traditional exposure therapies, including Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), have shown efficacy in treating SAD but are often limited by logistical challenges and patient reluctance. Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) has emerged as a promising alternative, providing a controlled and immersive environment for exposure to anxiety-provoking scenarios. This paper explores the integration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) into VRET to enhance the personalization, realism, and adaptability of therapeutic scenarios. GANs, which consist of a generator and a discriminator network, allow for the creation of highly realistic virtual environments tailored to the specific fears and triggers of individual patients. By offering real-time adjustments and personalized exposure scenarios, GAN-enhanced VRET addresses key limitations of traditional therapies, increasing patient engagement and treatment adherence. This review synthesizes findings from key studies on GAN-enhanced VRET, evaluating its efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms and discussing the potential for broader application across various anxiety disorders. The results indicate that GAN-enhanced VRET offers a significant advancement in the treatment of SAD, providing a more accessible, engaging, and effective approach to exposure therapy. Future directions include expanding accessibility through cost reduction, integrating additional AI techniques, and exploring applications beyond SAD to improve mental health outcomes across diverse patient populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7361a32d5fa947b6146fecd55b33bb6828135c4be2e7ab3c18a7e6a4860c8bb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
