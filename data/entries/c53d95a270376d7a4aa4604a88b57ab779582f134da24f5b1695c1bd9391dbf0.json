{"title":"Design and Implementation of an Ultra-Wideband Water Immersion Antenna for Underwater Ultrasonic Sensing in Microwave Induced Thermoacoustic Tomography","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2161/v1","date":1724980852000,"content":"Microwave-induced thermoacoustic tomography (MITAT) holds significant promise in biomedical applications. It creates images using ultrasonic sensors to detect thermoacoustic signals induced by microwaves. The key to generating thermoacoustic signals that accurately reflect the fact is to achieve sufficient and uniform microwave power absorption of the testing target, which is closely tied to the microwave illumination provided by the antenna. In this article, we introduce a novel design and implementation of an ultra-wideband water immersion antenna for an MITAT system. We analyze and compare the advantages of selecting water as the background medium. Simulations are conducted to analyze the ultra-wideband characteristics in impedance matching, axial ratio, and radiation pattern of the proposed antenna. The measured |S11| shows good agreement with the simulated results. We also simulate the microwave power absorption of tumor and brain tissue, and the uniform microwave power absorption and high contrast between the tumor and brain indicate the excellent performance of the proposed antenna in the MITAT system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c53d95a270376d7a4aa4604a88b57ab779582f134da24f5b1695c1bd9391dbf0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
