{"title":"Under ice plankton and lipid dynamics in a subarctic lake","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/3/323/7664136?rss=1","date":1714694400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Climate warming causes shorter winters and changes in ice and snow cover in subarctic lakes, highlighting the need to better understand under-ice ecosystem functioning. The plankton community in a subarctic, oligotrophic lake was studied throughout the ice-covered season, focusing on lipid dynamics and life history traits in two actively overwintering copepods, <span>Cyclops scutifer</span> and <span>Eudiaptomus graciloides.</span> Whereas <span>C. scutifer</span> was overwintering in C-IV to C-V stage, <span>E. graciloides</span> reproduced under ice cover. Both species had accumulated lipids prior to ice-on and showed a substantial decrease in total lipid content throughout the ice-covered period: <span>E. graciloides</span> (60%–38% dw) and <span>C. scutifer</span> (73%–33% dw). Polyunsaturated fatty acids of algal origin were highest in <span>E. graciloides</span> and declined strongly in both species. Stearidonic acid (18:4n-3) content in <span>E. graciloides</span> was particularly high and decreased rapidly during the study period by 50%, probably due to reproduction. The copepods differed in feeding behavior, with the omnivore <span>C. scutifer</span> continuing to accumulate lipids until January, whereas the herbivorous <span>E. graciloides</span> accumulated lipids from under-ice primary production during the last months of ice-cover. Our findings emphasize the importance of lipid accumulation and utilization for actively overwintering copepods irrespective of the timing of their reproduction.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"78113166b09c9f52f4f61a699e53e7db5087746711a434177a8e72abc9d0ccf7","category":"Environment"}
