However, despite the documentation of dystocia in several viviparous (live-bearing) Chondrichthyan species (i.e., sharks, rays, skates, and chimaeras), there are no reports to date of dystocia in any oviparous (egg-laying) species. Here we present a case of a captive female epaulette shark (<i>Hemiscyllium ocellatum</i>) that demonstrated symptoms of dystocia in a research-related captive breeding programme. This communication serves as documentation that dystocia can occur in oviparous Chondrichthyans, and this information can help inform researchers and veterinary practitioners for improved care.</p>","author":"Carolyn R.
