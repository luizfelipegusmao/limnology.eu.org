{"title":"Evaluation of suitable micro‐algal diets for intensive culture of the calanoid copepod Acartia bilobata","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16092?af=R","date":1667394512000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Copepods are alternative live feed in marine fish hatcheries, and the quality and type of micro-algal diets influence their culture productivity. Three algal species of different groups including prymnesiophyte: <i>Isochrysis galbana</i> (Iso), the diatom: <i>Chaetoceros muelleri</i> (Cht) and eustigmatophyte: <i>Nannochloropsis occulata</i> (Nan) were fed to the calanoid copepod <i>Acartia bilobata</i>. Selected algae were offered as mono-algal diets: T1-Iso, T2-Cht and T3-Nan or as mixed algal diets: T4-Nan + Cht, T5-Nan + Iso, T6-Iso + Cht and T7-Iso + Cht + Nan. Reproductive parameters, egg production, hatching success, nauplii and copepodite survival, development and first maturity, were closely monitored. Results illustrated that <i>I. galbana</i> was the most suitable diet for this copepod species, supporting higher average relative egg production (5631.62 ± 133.49 egg L<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>), hatching success (96.32 ± 1.40%) and superior adult survival (44.44 ± 3.20%). Different algal diets influenced the nauplii and copepodite survival rate. Maximum survival to adults (56.67 ± 3.78%) and shortened development time (5.75 ± 0.12 days) and time to first maturity (4.50 ± 0.12 days) were observed when fed with <i>I. galbana</i>. The groups fed with <i>C. muelleri</i> exhibited lower survival (6.67 ± 0.67%) during development into adults, and the group fed with <i>N. occulata</i> alone or with <i>C. muelleri</i> did not survived till the adults. Amongst seven algal diets tested, <i>I. galbana</i> was found ideal for maximizing culture productivity, and hence recommended for intensive culture of <i>A. bilobata</i>.</p>","author":"Balakrishna Chintada, \nRitesh Ranjan, \nBabitha Rani, \nSanthosh B, \nSekar Megarajan, \nShubhadeep Ghosh, \nBiji Xavier, \nGopalakrishnan Achamveettil","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"29ef5a94d8e0e794031a2f8ec6dd879f00ba01eb544ce854f823af343de646f1","category":"Environment"}
