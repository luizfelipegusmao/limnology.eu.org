{"title":"Exploring the Impact of Mindful Leadership on Employee Green Creativity in Manufacturing Firms: A Social Information Processing Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1338/v1","date":1721134230000,"content":"Manufacturing enterprises are increasingly compelled to pursue innovative solutions to environmental issues. Addressing such issues requires mindful leadership to support employees and organizations in maintaining awareness during complex situations, thereby promoting environmental sustainability. Drawing on social information processing theory, this study theorizes and tests the relationships mindfulness leadership, employee moral reflectiveness, environmental passion, and employee green creativity. To test the model, we utilize a two-wave multi-source dataset comprising 215 workers from manufacturing firms in China. The findings demonstrate that mindful leadership is positively related to employee green creativity. Additionally, our research reveals that both moral reflectiveness and environmental passion serve as mediators in linking mindful leadership to employee green creativity. Crucially, our empirical analysis suggests a serial mediation model, examining the sequential role of moral reflectiveness and environmental passion in the relationship between mindful leadership and employee green creativity. The findings provide a new viewpoint on employees' eco-friendly behaviors and have practical implications for improving environmental sustainability within organizations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e5c1d7224bd4243495679dfd6ab55dd5b04629b8964cc1297f64c02e855c3177","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
