{"title":"The Use of Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies (bNAbs) in HIV-1 Treatment and Prevention","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0383/v1","date":1715075538000,"content":"Background: Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively halt disease progression in HIV infections, complete eradiation of the virus remains elusive. Additionally, challenges such as long-term ART toxicity, drug resistance, and the demanding regimen of daily and lifelong ad-herence required by ART highlight the imperative need for alternative therapeutic and preventa-tive approaches. In recent years, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have emerged as promising candidates, offering potential for therapeutic, preventative and possibly curative in-terventions against HIV infection. \nObjective: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the passive immunization of bNAbs in HIV-1 infected individuals. \nMain findings: Recent findings from clinical trials have highlighted the potential of bNAbs in treatment, prevention, and in the quest of an HIV-1 cure. While monotherapy with a single bNAb is insufficient in maintaining viral suppression and preventing viral escape, ultimately leading to viral rebound, combination therapy with potent, non-overlapping epitope-targeting bNAbs have demonstrated prolonged viral suppression and delayed time to rebound by effec-tively restricting the emergence of escape mutations, albeit largely in individuals with bNAb-sensitive strains. Additionally, passive immunization of bNAb have provided ‘proof-of-concept’ for antibody-mediated prevention against HIV-1 acquisition, although com-plete prevention was not obtained. Therefore, further research on the use of bNAbs in HIV-1 treatment and prevention remains imperative.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a208a85ad299ab30919ab79f75b7e7587871f9ff39a8e06e43e5b7ba077ef683","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
