Specifically, the study combines Raman and EDS analytics with SEM and LM imaging to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the chemical and structural properties of materials. The methodology used to integrate these techniques is using a software-based solution including an image-based alignment step. Instead of using holders decorated with fiducials, like in the ‘Shuttle and Find’ based workflow [<a href=\"#ozae044.250-B1\">1</a>], here one can use any characteristic landmarks of the sample. As a result, for a battery sample, we can demonstrate the benefit of combining multiple analytical techniques, to gain a more complete understanding of material properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"151189fe6857f7791b337a3954f4e0235f03e8b1b79ef7b3a99615b5651bdb60","category":"Environment"}
