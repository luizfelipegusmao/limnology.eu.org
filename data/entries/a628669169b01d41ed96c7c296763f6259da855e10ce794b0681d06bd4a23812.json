{"title":"Green light is similarly effective in promoting plant biomass as red/blue light: a meta-analysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/18/5655/7686923?rss=1","date":1717372800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Whether green light promotes or represses plant growth is an unresolved but important question, warranting a global meta-analysis of published data. We collected 136 datasets from 48 publications on 17 crop species, and calculated the green light effect for a range of plant traits. For each trait the effect was calculated as the ratio between the trait value attained under a red/blue background light plus green, divided by the value attained under the background light only, both having the same light intensity. Generally, green light strongly increased intrinsic water use efficiency (15%), the shoot-to-root ratio (13%), and decreased stomatal conductance (−15%). Moreover, green light increased fresh weight to a small extent (4%), but not plant dry weight, resulting in a reduced dry matter content (−2%). Hence, green light is similarly effective at increasing biomass as red and blue light. Green light also showed to increase leaf area (7%) and specific leaf area (4%; i.e. thinner leaves). Furthermore, effects of green light were species-dependent, with positive effects on biomass for lettuce and microgreens, and negative effects in basil and tomato. Our data suggest that future research should focus on the role of green light in modulating water loss, its putative role as a shade signal, and the causes for its species-specific effects on crop biomass.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"a628669169b01d41ed96c7c296763f6259da855e10ce794b0681d06bd4a23812","category":"Environment"}
