Diffraction patterns of specimens are measured by many common techniques including X-ray crystallography, optical diffraction, and electron microscopy. A proficiency in Fourier transforms was crucial in discovering the atomically constructed shapes of DNA, ribosomes, viruses, hemoglobin, crystallized proteins, ATP synthase, and quasicrystals. Most famously, the diffraction pattern of DNA, captured by Rosalind Franklin in 1953 [<a href=\"#ozae044.437-B1\">1</a>], led to the discovery of its helical geometry (Fig. 1a) [<a href=\"#ozae044.437-B4\">4</a>]. However, the non-trivial leap from diffraction to real-space requires a deep intuition.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f9d566dfcf37e66c1dcc297f23dd2d5afb94c1fe764c4cc65230b5a14dd8305c","category":"Environment"}
