{"title":"Graphene Oxide 2D Films for Integrated Thermo-Optic Devices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0463/v1","date":1712548956000,"content":"Efficient heat management and control in optical devices, facilitated by advanced thermo-optic materials, is critical for many applications such as photovoltaics, thermal emitters, mode-locked lasers, and optical switches. Here, we investigate the thermo-optic properties of 2D graphene oxide (GO) films by precisely integrating them onto microring resonators (MRRs) with control over the film thicknesses and lengths. We characterize the refractive index, extinction coefficient, thermo-optic coefficient, and thermal conductivity of for the GO films with different layer numbers and degrees of reduction, including reversible reduction and enhanced optical bistability induced by photo-thermal effects. Experimental results show that the thermo-optic properties of 2D GO films vary widely with the degree of reduction, with significant polarization anisotropy, enabling efficient polarization sensitive devices. The versatile thermo-optic response of 2D GO substantially expands the scope of functionalities and devices that can be engineered, making it promising for a diverse range of thermo-optic applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de9644505c102b8da2bab22865f5ed7ee955c8988e2f44922ff7b2bffb99e6b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
