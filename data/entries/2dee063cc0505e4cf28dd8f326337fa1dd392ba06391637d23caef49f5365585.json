{"title":"Small‚Äêscale measurement of fracture toughness of muddy marine sediments via bubble injection","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lom3.10625?af=R","date":1716040461000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Muddy marine sediments are elastic materials in which bubbles grow and worms extend their burrows by fracture. Bubble growth and burrowing behavior are dependent on the stiffness and fracture toughness (<i>K</i>\n<sub>Ic</sub>) of these muds. This article describes a custom laboratory apparatus to measure the fracture toughness of muddy, cohesive sediments using a bubble injection method. The system induces fracture in sediment samples by incrementally injecting air through a needle inserted into the sediment. The increasing pneumatic pressure is monitored until it drops abruptly, indicating bubble formation. Fracture toughness is then calculated from the peak pressure at which fracture occurred, following cavitation rheology methods developed for soft gels. The system has produced measurements that compare well to previous data but with better spatial resolution, allowing for characterization of spatial heterogeneity on small scales.</p>","author":"Anika S.
