{"title":"Effects of airflow superfine pulverization on the structure, functional properties, and flavor quality of wheat bran","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13693?af=R","date":1719314366000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Wheat bran (WB) is a byproduct of refined wheat flour production with poor edible taste and low economic value. Herein, the WB was micronized via airflow superfine pulverization (ASP), and the effects of the ASP conditions on its particle size, nutritive compositions, whiteness, hydration characteristics, moisture distribution, microstructure, cation exchange capacity, volatile flavor components, and other characteristics were investigated.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Reducing the rotational speed of the ASP screw and increasing the number of pulverizations significantly decreased the median particle size Dx(50) of WB to a minimum of 12.97 ± 0.19 μm (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), increased the soluble dietary fiber content from 55.05 ± 2.94 to 106.86 ± 1.60 mg g<sup>−1</sup>, and improved the whiteness and water solubility index. In addition, the water holding capacity and oil holding capacity were significantly reduced (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), while the cation exchange and swelling capacities first increased and then decreased. Up to about 70% of water in WB exists as bound water. As the Dx(50) of WB decreased, the content of bound and immobile water increased, while the free water decreased from 14.37 ± 1.21% to 7.59 ± 1.03%. Furthermore, WB was micronized and the particles became smaller and more evenly distributed. Using gas chromatography–ion mobility spectrometry, a total of 37 volatile compounds in micronized WB (including 10 aldehydes, 9 esters, 7 alcohols, and several acids, furans, ethers, aldehydes, esters, and alcohols) were identified as the main volatile compounds of WB.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Collectively, ASP improved the physicochemical properties of WB. This study provides theoretical references for the use of ASP to improve the utilization and edibility of WB. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ying Mao, \nYinghui Zhang, \nTiantian Li, \nYueyi Chen, \nZhan Wang, \nCheng Guo, \nWeiping Jin, \nWangyang Shen, \nJinling Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"0f50c11b61d31ef5283b060960da2c9c2e6ce1acd1b95e437c54837c404c8953","category":"Environment"}
