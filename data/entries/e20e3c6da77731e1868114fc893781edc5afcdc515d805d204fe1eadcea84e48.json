The present study aimed to do a nutritional (3-day dietary diaries) and body composition (ISAK profile) assessment of sport climbing athletes of different genders and sport levels. The mean age of the forty-six Spanish climbers (22 men and 24 women) was 30 years (SD: 9) with 7.66 years of experience (SD: 6.63). The mean somatotype of the athletes was classified as balanced mesomorph. Negative correlations were observed between fat mass variables and climbing level (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e20e3c6da77731e1868114fc893781edc5afcdc515d805d204fe1eadcea84e48","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
