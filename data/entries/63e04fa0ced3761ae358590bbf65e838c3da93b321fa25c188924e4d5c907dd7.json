In this study, we developed an in silico framework to screen drug-induced hepatocellular toxicity (INSIGHT) by integrating the post-treatment transcriptomic data from both rodent models and primary human hepatocytes. We first built an early prediction model using logistic regression with elastic net regularization for 123 compounds and established the INSIGHT framework that can screen for drug-induced hepatotoxicity. The 235 signature genes identified by INSIGHT were involved in metabolism, bile acid synthesis, and stress response pathways. Applying the INSIGHT to an independent transcriptomic dataset treated by 185 compounds predicted that 27 compounds show a high DILI risk, including zoxazolamine and emetine. Further integration with cell image data revealed that predicted compounds with high DILI risk can induce abnormal morphological changes in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrion. Clustering analysis of the treatment-induced transcriptomic changes delineated distinct DILI mechanisms induced by these compounds. Our study presents a computational framework for a mechanistic understanding of long-term liver injury and the prospective prediction of DILI risk.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"63e04fa0ced3761ae358590bbf65e838c3da93b321fa25c188924e4d5c907dd7","category":"Environment"}
