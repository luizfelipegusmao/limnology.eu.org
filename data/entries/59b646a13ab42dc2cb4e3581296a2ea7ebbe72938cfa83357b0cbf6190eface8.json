{"title":"A Review and Thematic Analysis of How 3D Printing Technology Makes a City Smarter","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0594/v1","date":1728436434000,"content":"This paper presents a comprehensive review of the transformative impact of 3D printing technology on smart cities. As cities face rapid urbanization, resource shortages, and environmental degradation, innovative solutions such as additive manufacturing (AM) offer potential pathways for sustainable urban development. By synthesizing 66 publications from 2015 to 2024, the study examines how 3D printing improves urban infrastructure, enhances sustainability, and fosters community engagement in city planning. Key benefits of 3D printing include reducing construction time and material waste, lowering costs, and enabling the creation of scalable, affordable housing solutions. The paper also addresses emerging areas such as the integration of 3D printing with digital twins (DT), machine learning (ML), and AI to optimize urban infrastructure and predictive maintenance. It highlights the use of smart materials and soft robotics for structural health monitoring (SHM), and repairs. Despite the promising advancements, challenges remain in terms of cost, scalability, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration among engineers, urban planners, and policymakers. The findings suggest a roadmap for future research and practical applications of 3D printing in smart cities, contributing to the ongoing discourse on sustainable and technologically advanced urban development","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59b646a13ab42dc2cb4e3581296a2ea7ebbe72938cfa83357b0cbf6190eface8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
