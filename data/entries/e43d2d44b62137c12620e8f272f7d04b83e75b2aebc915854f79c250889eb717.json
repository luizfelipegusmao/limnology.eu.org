{"title":"An indigenous microalgal pool containing Klebsormidium sp. K39 as a stable and efficacious biotechnological strategy for Escherichia coli removal in urban wastewater treatment","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13918?af=R","date":1727086208000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In recent decades the demand for freshwater has drastically increased as a consequence of population growth, economic development, climate change and pollution. Therefore, any strategy for wastewater treatment can play a role in alleviating the pressure on freshwater sources.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In the present study an autochthonous microalgal pool (MP), isolated from a constructed wetland, was proposed as an alternative to the secondary treatment of an urban wastewater treatment system. The MP removal efficacy was compared to those obtained using <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> and <i>Scenedesmus quadricauda</i>, against <i>E. coli.</i> Results exhibited a comparable removal efficacy and after 2 days, in samples inoculated with <i>E. coli</i> at lower density, <i>S. quadricauda</i> and <i>C. vulgaris</i> induced a decrease of 2.0 units Log and the autochthonous MP of 1.8 units Log, whereas in samples with <i>E. coli</i> at higher density the bacteria were reduced 2.8, 3.4 and 2.0 units Log by <i>S. quadricauda</i>, <i>C. vulgaris</i> and the autochthonous MP, respectively. Moreover, the identification of microalgal strains isolated from the MP revealed the presence of <i>Klebsormidium</i> sp. K39, <i>C. vulgaris</i>, <i>Tetradesmus obliquus</i> and <i>S. quadricauda.</i> Although the MP composition remained quite constant, at the end of the treatment, a different distribution among the microalgal species was observed with <i>Klebsormidium</i> sp. K39 found as dominant.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The microalgal-based wastewater treatment appears as a valuable alternative, although further investigations, based on ‘omics’ approaches, could be applied to better explore any fluctuation within the MP species composition in an <i>in situ</i> trial. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Paride Salvatore Occhipinti, \nNunziatina Russo, \nPaola Foti, \nAlessandra Pino, \nCinzia L Randazzo, \nAntonino Pollio, \nCinzia Caggia","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"e43d2d44b62137c12620e8f272f7d04b83e75b2aebc915854f79c250889eb717","category":"Environment"}
