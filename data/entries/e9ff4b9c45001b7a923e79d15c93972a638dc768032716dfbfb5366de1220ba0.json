The utilization of waste <i>Brassica nigra</i> meal (BNM) as protein flocculant in treating VORCE was explored. The <i>B. nigra</i> meal flocculant (BNMF) exhibited a crystalline nature, with the presence of amino and carboxyl functional groups, rendering it highly efficient (89.69% efficiency) in floc formation. Zeta potential and particle size (−5.6 mV and 240.68 nm, respectively) indicate BNMF's effectiveness in initiating floc formation. The interactive effects of pH, dosage, settling time on COD, and TSS removal were investigated using the Box–Behnken design. At an optimal pH of 6.9 and BNMF dosage of 0.77 g/L, a maximum removal of 85.38% COD and 72.56% TSS was obtained. The perikinetic theory for the coagulation–flocculation followed a second-order rate reaction with high <i>K</i>\n<sub>c</sub> (0.0001 L/mg min), low settling time (37.04 min), and high collision efficiency (2.703 × 10<sup>17</sup>), indicating the model's significance in achieving maximum COD and TSS removal. These findings highlight the potential use of BNMF in the treatment of VORCE, leading to circular economy by valorizing waste from mustard oil extraction and zero discharge.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner points</h2>\n<p>\nValorization of waste <i>Brassica nigra</i> meal (BNM) as a potent protein flocculant\nOptimization for vegetable oil refinery condensate effluent (VORCE) treatment was done.\nInteractive effects of the process parameters were analyzed using Design expert.\nPerikinetic theory for VORCE treatment follows second-order reaction rate with high <i>K</i>\n<sub>c</sub>.\n</p>","author":"Kavithakani Annamalaisamy, \nChithra Kumaran","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"e9ff4b9c45001b7a923e79d15c93972a638dc768032716dfbfb5366de1220ba0","category":"Environment"}
