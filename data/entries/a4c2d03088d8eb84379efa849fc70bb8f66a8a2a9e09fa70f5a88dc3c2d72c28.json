{"title":"Comparative Analysis of Comprehensive Genomic Profile in Thymomas and Recurrent Thymomas Reveals Potentially Actionable Mutations for Target Therapies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1356/v1","date":1721206823000,"content":"Conclusions: CGP do not substantially differ between initial tumor vs tumor recurrence and recurrent thymomas vs non-recurrent thymomas. Cell-cycle control genes alterations are associated with an early recurrence after thymectomy. Multiple target therapies are potentially available by performing a comprehensive CGP, suggesting that a precision medicine approach on these patients could be further explored.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4c2d03088d8eb84379efa849fc70bb8f66a8a2a9e09fa70f5a88dc3c2d72c28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
