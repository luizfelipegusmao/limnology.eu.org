{"title":"Migrants from Ukraine in the Polish labour market as perceived by Poles from rural areas and towns","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306895","date":1726236000000,"content":"<p>by Wioletta Knapik, Lidia Luty, Monika Zioło, Monika Odlanicka-Poczobutt</p>\r\n\r\nThe article is devoted to presenting the topic of migration of Ukrainian nationals to Poland. The work makes use of a survey under a project carried out in Polish rural areas and small towns. Seven hundred interviews were held in total. We conducted a quantitative analysis of its results here. The employed methods involve variable frequency distribution. The independence of the features was tested with the non-parametric chi-square test of independence. The association of the investigated variables was determined with Cramér’s V. The research shows that the most numerous foreign nationals in the Polish labour market in 2021 were Ukrainians. The positive trend started in 2017. The respondents perceived the migration of Ukrainian nationals to Poland mostly positively, especially regarding seasonal work. They also emphasized that the Ukrainians performed work at variance with their qualifications. Only every fifth participant agreed that migrants took away jobs from Poles. Most of the respondents pointed out that small business owners benefited from employing Ukrainians. The overwhelming majority of the respondents noted an increase in migration from Ukraine after the full-scale invasion and that entire families of Ukrainians were coming to Poland. Nearly half of them agreed that the support system for Ukrainian migrants was a burden on municipal budgets.","author":"Wioletta Knapik","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8512883cc68b5cd2399f516708b87673c1b8a8d1329a9d7b47d436f883019a13","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
