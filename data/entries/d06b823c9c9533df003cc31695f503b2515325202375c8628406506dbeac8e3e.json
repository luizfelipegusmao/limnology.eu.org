{"title":"Substantiation of the Monitoring Network of Talik Zones in Urbanized Permafrost Areas Based on GPR Profiling Data (Aanadyr, Chukotka)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1722/v1","date":1716796234000,"content":"Modern climatic changes have an impact on the bearing capacity of permafrost soils at the base of the foundations of buildings and structures in the urbanized territories of the Arctic and Subarctic. The activation of cryogenic processes leads to the destruction of the infrastructure of human settlements and, as a result, to social, economic, environmental consequences for the population. Based on the results of geothermy of frozen and thawing soil, GPR profiling of the territory of the city of Anadyr, it was concluded that the main risks of permafrost degradation are associated with the spread of hydrogenic melt zones. Maps of soil temperature in imaginary cross-sectional with a depth of 3, 5 and 10 m were compiled; maps of the capacity of thawing soils and the permafrost aquifer; a map of zones of dangerous spread of exogenous cryogenic processes. A permafrost monitoring system in the territory of Anadyr has been substantiated, which will consist of an automated network of observations of soil temperature in 35 wells at the border and at the epicenter of 20 zones of dangerous development of exogenous cryogenic processes and 12 control GPR profiles at the intersection of linear hydrogenic taliks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d06b823c9c9533df003cc31695f503b2515325202375c8628406506dbeac8e3e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
