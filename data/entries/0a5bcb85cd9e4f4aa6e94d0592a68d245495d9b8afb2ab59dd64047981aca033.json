{"title":"Techno-Feasibility Assessment of a Floating Breakwater Concept for Supporting Marine Renewables in Deep Waters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1599/v1","date":1713940240000,"content":"Previous research has proven that one of the fundamental requirements for ensuring increased profitability and economic competitiveness of offshore-based projects is co-locating different technologies within the same marine space. This paper presents a number of techno-feasibility analyses for floating offshore technologies for the Maltese Islands, located in the Central Mediterranean Sea. The first part compares the feasibility of offshore-based solar photovoltaic prices with those onshore, taking into consideration Maltaâ€™s land prices. The second part considers the use of a novel floating breakwater design that integrates energy storage. The breakwater is used to create a sheltered water area in deep waters for a multi-use marine park. Different revenue streams for the floating break water are considered, including renting the sheltered marine space out to operators of floating solar farms, aquaculture cages and vessel berthing facilities, and the provision of energy storage services. It is found that the combined income from the multiple revenue streams is still insufficient to justify the investment and that financially support from Government is essential to render the floating breakwaters viable.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a5bcb85cd9e4f4aa6e94d0592a68d245495d9b8afb2ab59dd64047981aca033","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
