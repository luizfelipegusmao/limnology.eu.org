{"title":"A Hybrid Contrast and Texture Masking Model to Boost HEVC Perceptual RD Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1975/v1","date":1717033597000,"content":"As most of the videos are destined for human perception, many techniques have been designed to improve video coding based on how the human visual system perceives video quality. In this paper, we propose the use of two perceptual coding techniques, namely contrast masking and texture masking, jointly operating under the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard. These techniques aim to improve the subjective quality of the reconstructed video at the same bit rate. For contrast masking, we propose the use of a specific weighting matrix for each block size (from 4×4 up to 32×32). We achieve average Bjøntegaard Delta-Rate (BD-rate) gains of between 2.5% and 4.48%, depending on the perceptual metric and coding mode used. The texture masking scheme is based on the classification of each coding unit, using its mean directional variance features as input to a support vector machine model. According to this classification, the block’s energy, the type of coding unit, and its size, an over-quantization is computed to provide a QP offset (DQP) for this coding unit. By applying both techniques in the HEVC Reference Software, an overall average of 5.79% BD-rate gain is achieved.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"642ff2541684a5e04bd6dd597daab096cbe0bb02a48088c50dfc7f12b4523c35","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
