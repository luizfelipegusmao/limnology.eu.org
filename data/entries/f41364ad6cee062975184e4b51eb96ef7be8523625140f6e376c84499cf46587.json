{"title":"The Potential of Helichsryum splendidum for Restoration of Sites Polluted with Coal Fly Ash","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1921/v1","date":1719479024000,"content":"Coal fly ash (CFA) generated from coal-fired power plants (C-FPPs) is continuing to be an environmental health concern due to its potential to contaminate groundwater, surface water, air, and soil, leading to the degradation of land. This study investigated the effectiveness of Helichrysum splendidum Less. for phytoremediation of CFA-polluted sites by conducting pot trials experiments in 14 weeks. Plants of the same age were transplanted into CFA collected from Hendrina Power station to assess their potential in assimilating metallic pollutants (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) into their tissues and untreated plants were used as controls. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry was used to quantify the amount of trace elements in samples and the translocation factor (TF) and bioconcentration factor (BCF) were determined to evaluate the phytoremediation potential of Helichrysum splendidum. The results revealed that higher concentrations of As, Ni and Zn were accumulated in the aerial parts as indicated by the TF values greater than 1. In contrast, higher amounts of Cu, As and Zn were found in the roots for CFA grown plants, as demonstrated by their BCF values 1.22, 1.19 and 1.03, respectively. Although CFA medium had restricted growth of some plants as compared to the controls, the results showed an interesting removal efficiency ranging between 18.0 to 56.7% with highest reported for Cu and Zn. Gas exchange analysis revealed that photosynthetic parameters were almost similar in the CFA and control soil pots. The study can confirm that Helichrysum splendidum has phytoextraction and phytostabilization potentials and can be effectively employed for restoration of CFA dams.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f41364ad6cee062975184e4b51eb96ef7be8523625140f6e376c84499cf46587","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
