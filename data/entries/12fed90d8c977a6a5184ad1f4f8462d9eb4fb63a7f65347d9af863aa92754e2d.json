{"title":"Improving Accessibility to Patients with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): Barriers to Early Diagnosis and Timely Treatment in Latin America.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1263/v2","date":1711348886000,"content":"Abstract: Delayed initiation of effective antifibrotic therapy in patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILD) may influence the progression and outcome of the disease. This study analyzes the differences in the journey of patients with ILD in the Brazilian and Mexican health systems. An evaluative study was conducted in reference centers for interstitial lung diseases in Brazil and Mexico with a panel of four specialists. The patient's journey in both countries begins when the patient seeks medical care after observing a chronic respiratory symptom. In both countries, due to diagnostic complexity, these patients arrive at ILD referral centers at an advanced stage of the disease. Once diagnosis is established, the treatment onset differs between Mexico and Brazil. Antifibrotic drugs are not yet available by SUS in Brazil, and the purchase is unfeasible for most of the population, which forces specialists to only offer support to patients until the treatment can get the drug. In Mexico, antifibrotics have been available in health sectors since 2018. Brazil and Mexico have several similarities regarding the initial journey of the patient due to diagnosis difficulties, but the outcome tends to be different due to a difference in access to treatment with antifibrotics. For this reason, advancing health policies that ensure proper treatment for patients with ILD is crucial for the sustainability and reliability of the health system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"12fed90d8c977a6a5184ad1f4f8462d9eb4fb63a7f65347d9af863aa92754e2d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
