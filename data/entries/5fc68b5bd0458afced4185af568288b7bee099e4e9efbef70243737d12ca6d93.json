{"title":"Nitrate transporter protein NPF5.12 and major latex-like protein MLP6 are important defense factors against Verticillium longisporum","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/13/4148/7658550?rss=1","date":1714089600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant defense responses to the soil-borne fungus <span>Verticillium longisporum</span> causing stem stripe disease on oilseed rape (<span>Brassica napus</span>) are poorly understood. In this study, a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) using the Arabidopsis accessions Sei-0 and Can-0 was established. Composite interval mapping, transcriptome data, and T-DNA mutant screening identified the <span>NITRATE/PEPTIDE TRANSPORTER FAMILY 5.12</span> (<span>AtNPF5.12</span>) gene as being associated with disease susceptibility in Can-0. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed interaction between AtNPF5.12 and the MAJOR LATEX PROTEIN family member AtMLP6, and fluorescence microscopy confirmed this interaction in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was applied to mutate the <span>NPF5.12</span> and <span>MLP6</span> genes in <span>B. napus</span>. Elevated fungal growth in the <span>npf5.12 mlp6</span> double mutant of both oilseed rape and Arabidopsis demonstrated the importance of these genes in defense against <span>V. longisporum</span>. Colonization of this fungus depends also on available nitrates in the host root. Accordingly, the negative effect of nitrate depletion on fungal growth was less pronounced in <span>Atnpf5.12</span> plants with impaired nitrate transport. In addition, suberin staining revealed involvement of the <span>NPF5.12</span> and <span>MLP6</span> genes in suberin barrier formation. Together, these results demonstrate a dependency on multiple plant factors that leads to successful <span>V. longisporum</span> root infection.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"5fc68b5bd0458afced4185af568288b7bee099e4e9efbef70243737d12ca6d93","category":"Environment"}
