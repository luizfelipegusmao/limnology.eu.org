{"title":"Randomized and Controlled Studies on Atropine Efficacy for Preventing Myopia Progression from 2017 to 2023","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1059/v1","date":1718606685000,"content":"Abstract. Myopia has become a major health problem around the world. The devel-opment of myopia is starting to appear at an earlier age than in previous generations and its consequences have prompted multiple studies, particularly regarding topical atropine treatment aiming at preventing or slowing myopia progression. Our objective is to review randomized and controlled studies on the efficacy and safety of topical atropine to prevent myopia progression in children. This was a narrative review compiled from literature of PubMed and Cochrane Library, including randomized and controlled clinical trials of atropine eye drops for myopia progression published within 2017 - 2023. Fourteen clinical trials were found in the 7 year-period analyzed. All study atropine concentrations were effective in reducing the progression of myopia compared to the placebo. The highest dose of atropine (1%) showed the best efficacy in reducing the spherical equivalent progression and axial elongation over the lower dose (0.01%). Side-effects were mild or moderate. The use of atropine eye drops to prevent myopia progression has shown benefits without involving serious adverse effects. Higher doses of atropine (0.5% and 1%) have been shown to have more efficacy in preventing myopia progression than lower doses (0.01%), so starting intervention with those doses of at-ropine could be considered for preventing myopic children from becoming severe myopia patients later in life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4081becb825ad8925db9bad8caa4864879a46ff332ae1307d0680bb3a6fbccb8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
