{"title":"A Secure Rubber Supply Chain Management System Based on Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain: A Use Case in Cambodia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1793/v1","date":1716876644000,"content":"Conventional traceability systems in Cambodian agriculture, such as Rubber Supply Chain Management (RSCM), often struggle to provide timely data and fair market prices, leading to mistrust among stakeholders, exploitation by intermediaries, and hindering progress towards ethical sourcing and sustainable practices. This research aims to showcase the potential of integrating blockchain technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and Differential Privacy (DP) methods to empower Cambodian rubber farmers. By enhancing transparency, facilitating fair pricing, and promoting sustainable methods in the rubber industry, this integrated approach leverages Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) to create a decentralized and secure system for tracking rubber from its source to the end consumer. Integration with IPFS ensures secure and easily accessible data storage, further enhancing the systemâ€™s reliability. Additionally, the implementation of differential privacy techniques safeguards confidential data during information sharing among farmers and supply chain stakeholders, minimizing potential privacy concerns. This comprehensive system encourages consumers to make ethical and sustainable alternative options by providing accessible information on harvesting methods, processing procedures, labor conditions, and environmental impacts. The potential benefits extend beyond Cambodia, serving as a model for other developing countries aiming to modernize and enhance the agricultural distribution networks. Our results show that transaction send rates (TPS) and throughput in systems with and without differential privacy grow with increased transaction volumes. However, the system without differential privacy achieves greater scalability and efficiency above a certain threshold. However, it offers a slightly reduced latency, reflecting a trade-off between privacy and performance efficiency in blockchain-based agricultural traceability systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"609d3760ba1d46d992cd2d19d6d0fdf92f697cc5eaf28d0c7aa527e53007b4df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
