{"title":"Learning Beyond Boundaries: Addressing the Transformative and Challenging Impacts of Artificial Intelligence on Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1788/v1","date":1724648852000,"content":"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) brought about significant opportunities and challenges in educational environment. It is disputable whether the application of AI to education is beneficial or not regarding human learning and teaching. This study aims at exploring the implications of the evolving educational landscape by comparing and discussing human and AI learning processes. Even though AI is not a conscient agent, it does not spell out any words randomly but provide meaningful texts with any reasoning. It helps us to understand human learning better by comparing learning in biological and artificial intelligences. Moreover, the new concepts in learning in AI come about the change of learning paradigm such as connectionism/connectivism. After all, AI will empower the abilities of learning and teaching for students as well as teachers. This study will give some implications for the future education with AI.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5506a8b87418b7699a704d66dd8d44b30bda0f5ac5c1c0529e1d769935c521f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
