While putative courtship displays have been observed, actual copulation has not been documented. Here we examine video collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (“drone”) of novel behavioral interactions between basking sharks in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts in May 2021. The behaviors, including close following and tight concentric circling, are consistent with pre-copulatory behavior observed in other shark species. These observations provide new insights into the pre-copulatory behavior of basking sharks.</p>","author":"Tobey H. Curtis, \nJeff Robinson, \nHarold L. Pratt Jr, \nGregory B. Skomal, \nNicholas M.
