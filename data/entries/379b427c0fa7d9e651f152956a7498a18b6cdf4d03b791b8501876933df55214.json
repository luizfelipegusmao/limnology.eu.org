{"title":"Evaluating dynamic and predictive discrimination for recurrent event models: use of a time-dependent C-index","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/25/4/1140/7408088?rss=1","date":1699574400000,"content":"<span><div>Summary</div>Interest in analyzing recurrent event data has increased over the past few decades. One essential aspect of a risk prediction model for recurrent event data is to accurately distinguish individuals with different risks of developing a recurrent event. Although the concordance index (C-index) effectively evaluates the overall discriminative ability of a regression model for recurrent event data, a local measure is also desirable to capture dynamic performance of the regression model over time. Therefore, in this study, we propose a time-dependent C-index measure for inferring the model’s discriminative ability locally. We formulated the C-index as a function of time using a flexible parametric model and constructed a concordance-based likelihood for estimation and inference. We adapted a perturbation-resampling procedure for variance estimation. Extensive simulations were conducted to investigate the proposed time-dependent C-index’s finite-sample performance and estimation procedure. We applied the time-dependent C-index to three regression models of a study of re-hospitalization in patients with colorectal cancer to evaluate the models’ discriminative capability.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biostatistics Current Issue","siteHash":"d3a47065211a18721436d2ad1f713237ccbb15b7790ebb347bb018c26cfcb04f","entryHash":"379b427c0fa7d9e651f152956a7498a18b6cdf4d03b791b8501876933df55214","category":"Environment"}
