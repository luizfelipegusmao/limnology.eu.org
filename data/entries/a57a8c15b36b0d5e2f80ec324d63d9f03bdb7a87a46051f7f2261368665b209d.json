{"title":"Victim of changes? Marine macroalgae in a changing world","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/133/1/1/7444981?rss=1","date":1700697600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>Marine macroalgae (‘seaweeds’) are a diverse and globally distributed group of photosynthetic organisms that together generate considerable primary productivity, provide an array of different habitats for other organisms, and contribute many important ecosystem functions and services. As a result of continued anthropogenic stress on marine systems, many macroalgal species and habitats face an uncertain future, risking their vital contribution to global productivity and ecosystem service provision.<div>Scope</div>After briefly considering the remarkable taxonomy and ecological distribution of marine macroalgae, we review how the threats posed by a combination of anthropogenically induced stressors affect seaweed species and communities. From there we highlight five critical avenues for further research to explore (long-term monitoring, use of functional traits, focus on early ontogeny, biotic interactions and impact of marine litter on coastal vegetation).<div>Conclusions</div>Although there are considerable parallels with terrestrial vascular plant responses to the many threats posed by anthropogenic stressors, we note that the impacts of some (e.g. habitat loss) are much less keenly felt in the oceans than on land. Nevertheless, and in common with terrestrial plant communities, the impact of climate change will inevitably be the most pernicious threat to the future persistence of seaweed species, communities and service provision. While understanding macroalgal responses to simultaneous environmental stressors is inevitably a complex exercise, our attempt to highlight synergies with terrestrial systems, and provide five future research priorities to elucidate some of the important trends and mechanisms of response, may yet offer some small contribution to this goal.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"a57a8c15b36b0d5e2f80ec324d63d9f03bdb7a87a46051f7f2261368665b209d","category":"Environment"}
