Despite evidence of MP altering soil physicochemical properties, impacts on belowground root traits and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi remain poorly explored. Existing research has mainly centred on a few model plant species, emphasizing root biomass, and often employs single polymer types and addition rates that surpass realistic scenarios.\n\nTo investigate how environmentally relevant mixtures and concentrations of MPs impact plant growth, root trait expression and AM fungal colonization, we conducted a greenhouse experiment using six plant species chosen for their contrasting root life strategies; three species in the Amaryllidaceae family represented resource conservation root traits (<i>Allium fistulosum</i> (onion), <i>Allium tuberosum</i> (chive), <i>Allium porrum</i> (leek)), and three from the Solanaceae family, represented plants with resource acquisitive root traits (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> (tomato), <i>Solanum melongena</i> (eggplant), <i>Capsicum annuum</i> (pepper)). MP treatments consisted of control (0% MP), low (0.1% w/w) and high (1% w/w) MP additions, using an environmentally relevant MP mixture of weathered polymer types and shapes. We measured above and belowground biomass, average root trait expression (specific root length (SRL), average root diameter (D) and root tissue density (RTD)), AM fungal colonization, as well as intraspecific variability across MP addition treatments.\n\nWe found that responses to environmentally relevant additions of MPs were species specific and not determined by root life-strategy. MPs increased biomass in leek, eggplant and tomato, while decreasing AM fungal colonization in tomato. MP additions had no discernible impact on average root functional trait expression across species. However, the addition of MPs resulted in altered intraspecific variability in root traits and AM fungal colonization, indicating a mechanism for plant tolerance to MPs.\n\nTo address the impacts of MPs on plant functioning, research needs to focus on environmentally relevant mixtures of MPs, considering various plant species' capacities to tolerate soil contamination and the potential for tipping points under real-world conditions.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/09/11/microplastic-additions-modulate-intraspecific-variability-in-root-traits-and-mycorrhizal-responses-across-root-life-history-strategies/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"E.
