{"title":"Data Obfuscation for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning using Quantum Symmetry Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1701/v1","date":1721734799000,"content":"This study introduces a data obfuscation technique, leveraging the exponential map associated with the generators of Lie groups.  Originating from quantum machine learning frameworks, our method illustrates the practical application of quantum mechanics principles in data processing. Specifically, it employs the exponential map of a generator algebra to introduce controlled noise into the data, achieving obfuscated data while preserving its utility for machine learning tasks. This strategy is shown to safeguard privacy in sensitive datasets, such as discussed medical records, and to enhance dataset volume and diversity through augmentation. Our empirical analysis, benchmarked against standard machine learning approaches, demonstrates that our method can maintain or even improve the predictive accuracy of the original data. This research highlights the potential of Lie group theory for advancing data privacy in medicine, marking a significant contribution to machine learning methodologies by offering the dual benefits of data obfuscation and enrichment. Through this synthesis of algebraic structures and machine learning, we propose new pathways for the secure and effective use of data in sensitive areas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9504867fc651bfa9392b263a626b42437f76126e24abadd4b241731ad6b77ad6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
