{"title":"Why high-speed rail causes heterogeneous spatial patterns in firm innovation: Perspectives from intensive and extensive margins","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311621","date":1728309600000,"content":"<p>by Longfei Zheng, Huasheng Zhu, Kwok Yuen Fan, Zheng Chang</p>\r\n\r\nThis study examines the impact of high-speed rail (HSR) on corporate innovation in China, analyzing county-level patent applications. Utilizing difference-in-differences regression, we break down the overall impact of HSR connectivity on innovation into two categories: extensive margins, where a greater number of firms become innovative, and intensive margins, where individual firms increase their level of innovation. HSR access has increased patent applications, particularly in manufacturing and non-high-tech services, affecting both margins. However, in high-tech services, the impact is significant only on the extensive margin. Effects vary between urban areas and peripheral counties, with knowledge spillovers and brain drain as key predictors.","author":"Longfei Zheng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"53737b89656448ade1688967366c04a92a0eb6aa284a80beab4f177136c70396","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
