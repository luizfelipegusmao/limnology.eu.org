{"title":"428 Influence of melatonin supplementation in pregnant multiparous crossbred beef cows grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue on dam weight, milk yield, and pre-weaning growth of steer calves","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/206/7757119?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective was to evaluate the influence of melatonin supplementation in pregnant beef cattle grazing toxic, endophyte-infected tall fescue (E+) on post-calving dam body weight (BW), milk production, and preweaning growth of steer calves. Multiparous cows were artificially inseminated with sex-sorted semen (Y chromosome-bearing sperm) from a single Red Angus sire and maintained on pastures free from E+ fescue prior to the start of the treatment period. Pregnant cows were assigned to one of three treatment groups with two replications per treatment: non-toxic, novel endophyte-infected (NE+) tall fescue without melatonin supplementation (NE+/NM; n = 15), E+ fescue with melatonin supplementation (E+/M; n = 16), and E+ fescue without melatonin supplementation (E+/NM; n = 18). The treatment period was over 70 d between May and July (d 147 ± 1 to 217 ± 1 of gestation). A commercially available feed was mixed with melatonin (100 µg/kg BW) or without melatonin and hand-fed to each cow daily. At the conclusion of the treatment period (56 ± 18 d before parturition), cattle were moved to a single group and maintained on pastures free from E+ fescue for the remainder of the study. Dams and steer calves were weighed at d 0, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, and 168 relative to calving (d 0 = calving). Four-hour milk yields on d 28 ± 3 and d 56 ± 3 were used to estimate daily milk volume and weight. Dam and calf BW were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS specific for repeated measures with treatment, time, and the interaction as fixed effects and replicate as random. Calf birth weight, dam milk volume, and dam milk weight were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS with treatment as a fixed effect and replicate as random. On d 28, estimated daily milk volume and weight were decreased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) in E+/NM dams relative to NE+/NM dams. On d 56, estimated daily milk volume and weight were decreased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.03) in E+/NM and E+/M dams relative to NE+/NM dams. There was an effect of time for dam and calf weights (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). There was a treatment by time interaction for calf body weight, with calves born to E+/NM dams having decreased body weight relative to calves born to NE+/NM and E+/M dams from d 112 to d 168 (<span>P</span> = 0.02). There were no other effects of treatment, time, or the interaction (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). These data suggest melatonin supplemented to pregnant crossbred multiparous beef cows grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue during mid-late gestation may increase preweaning growth of steer calves.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"4222adf648116e8a659f9809db0eb93695006a02b965ca7c0592d10e40a87a9d","category":"Environment"}
