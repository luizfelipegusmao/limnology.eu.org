{"title":"Valuation Of Carbon Storage in Telaga Warna National Park Indonesia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1434/v1","date":1711351034000,"content":"Forests are crucial natural resources in Indonesia, storing significant biodiversity and providing essential benefits for both the environment and people's livelihoods. They contribute significantly to the country's economy, support local communities, and play a vital role in mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration. This study examines the carbon storage valuation in tree forests of Telaga Warna National Park, Indonesia, highlighting the importance of preserving forests for carbon sequestration and climate resilience. The data was collected within a subplot measuring 10x10 meters, and for trees within a plot measuring 20x20 meters. The study focuses on pole and tree species. Based on the data obtained, it is found that the dominant vegetation in Telaga Warna National Park is Riung Anak / Casitanopsis javanica, with a potential carbon value of US$ 2.96 per Ha for pole species and US$ 98.49 for tree species.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"223649a003f7d66d1ec7f66a89cbf7d6894da639755f43f15e221e8ced68059b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
