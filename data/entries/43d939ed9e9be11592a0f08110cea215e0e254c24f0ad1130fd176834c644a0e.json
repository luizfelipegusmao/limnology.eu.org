{"title":"STORMS: Occupational Telerehabilitation in Multiple Sclerosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0470/v1","date":1723014695000,"content":"Digital solutions in the field of restorative neurology offer significant assistance, enabling patients to engage in rehabilitation activities remotely. This research introduces ReMoVES, an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) system delivering telemedicine services specifically tailored for Multiple Sclerosis rehabilitation, within the overarching framework of the STORMS project. The ReMoVES platform facilitates the provision of a rehabilitative exercise protocol, seamlessly integrated into the Individual Rehabilitation Project, curated by a multidimensional medical team operating remotely. This manuscript delves into the second phase of the study, elucidating the technology employed, the outcomes achieved, and the practical, professional, and academic implications. The STORMS initiative, as the genesis of digital telerehabilitation solutions, aims to enhance the quality of life for Multiple Sclerosis patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43d939ed9e9be11592a0f08110cea215e0e254c24f0ad1130fd176834c644a0e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
