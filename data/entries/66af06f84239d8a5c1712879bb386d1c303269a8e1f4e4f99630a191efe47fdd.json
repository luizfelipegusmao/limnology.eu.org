We previously demonstrated that Ocnus (ocn) plays an essential role in spermatogenesis. ValRS-m (Valyl-tRNA synthetase, mito-chondrial) gene was downregulated in ocn RNAi testes. By hatchability testing, we found that ValRS-m-knockdown induced complete sterility of male flies. We also concluded that ValRS-m-knockdown inhibited the transition from spermatogonia to spermatocytes and caused accumulated spermatogonia in testes. To understand the intrinsic reason for this destruction, we further conducted transcriptome sequencing analysis in ValRS-m RNAi testes. A total of 7710 dif-ferentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified to have at least a 2-fold change with a p-value of","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"66af06f84239d8a5c1712879bb386d1c303269a8e1f4e4f99630a191efe47fdd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
