Most of the previous studies focus on the cellular stress response triggered by misfolded proteins or defective protein import in the endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria. However, little is known about the cellular stress response to impaired protein import in the peroxisome, an understudied organelle that has recently emerged as a key signaling hub for cellular and metabolic homeostasis. To uncover evolutionarily conserved cellular responses upon defective peroxisomal import, we carried out a comparative transcriptomic analysis on fruit flies with tissue-specific peroxin knockdown and human HEK293 cells expressing dominant-negative PEX5<sup>C11A</sup>. Our RNA-seq results reveal that defective peroxisomal import upregulates integrated stress response (ISR) and downregulates ribosome biogenesis in both flies and human cells. Functional analyses confirm that impaired peroxisomal import induces eIF2Î± phosphorylation and ATF4 expression. Loss of ATF4 exaggerates cellular damage upon peroxisomal import defects, suggesting that ATF4 activation serves as a cellular cytoprotective mechanism upon peroxisomal import stress. Intriguingly, we show that peroxisomal import stress decreases the expression of rRNA processing genes and inhibits early pre-rRNA processing, which leads to the accumulation of 47S precursor rRNA and reduction of downstream rRNA intermediates. Taken together, we identify ISR activation and ribosome biogenesis inhibition as conserved adaptive stress responses to defective peroxisomal import and uncover a novel link between peroxisomal dysfunction and rRNA processing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"f5bd9e13896cf27198cd5c79fca752c7fb25691adfb1df2e4b37dfe4d768088d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
