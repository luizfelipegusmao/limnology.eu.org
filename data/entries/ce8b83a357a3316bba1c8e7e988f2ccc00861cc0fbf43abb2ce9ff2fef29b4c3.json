{"title":"RAA-CRISPR/Cas12a-mediated rapid, sensitive and on-site detection of Newcastle disease in pigeons","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1986/v1","date":1724829432000,"content":"Pigeon Newcastle disease, caused by pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), is a significant infectious disease in pigeons that can result in substantial mortality and poses a severe threat to the pigeon industry. Rapid and accurate onsite diagnosis of pigeon disease is crucial for timely diagnosis and the implementation of effective prevention and control measures. In this study, we established a rapid detection method for PPMV-1 based on recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) and CRISPR/Cas12a. The RAA primers target the conserved regions of the L gene for preamplification in clinical nucleic acid samples, followed by CRISPR/Cas12a detection of the target gene. Visualization could be achieved by combination with a lateral flow dipstick (LFD). This method demonstrated high specificity, showing no cross-reactivity with non-PPMV-1 samples. The sensitivity of the method assessed by fluorescence analysis reached 100 copy/µL, and when it was combined with an LFD, the sensitivity was 103 copies/µL. The constructed RAA-CRISPR/Cas12a-LFD visual detection method was applied to clinical sample testing and was found to enable rapid and accurate detection of swab samples and tissue specimens. Its sensitivity was consistent with the current gold standard, quantitative real-time PCR results. The RAA-CRISPR/Cas12a-LFD detection method we developed provides a novel approach for the rapid, simple, precise, and specific onsite diagnosis of pigeon Newcastle disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce8b83a357a3316bba1c8e7e988f2ccc00861cc0fbf43abb2ce9ff2fef29b4c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
