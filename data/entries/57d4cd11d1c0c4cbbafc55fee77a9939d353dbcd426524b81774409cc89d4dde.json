Although some standardized developmental and reproductive toxicity studies recommend serum thyroxine (T4) measures in developing rats, extrapolating between a serum T4 reduction and neurodevelopmental outcomes is not straightforward. Previously, we showed that the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers may be affected by developmental hypothyroidism in newborn rats. Here, we hypothesized that if the brain barriers were functionally disturbed by abnormal thyroid action, then small molecules may escape from the brain tissue and into general circulation. These small molecules could then be identified in blood samples, serving as a direct readout of thyroid-mediated developmental neurotoxicity. To address these hypotheses, pregnant rats were exposed to propylthiouracil (PTU, 0 or 3â€‰ppm) to induce thyroid hormone insufficiency, and dams were permitted to give birth. PTU significantly reduced serum T4 in postnatal offspring. Consistent with our hypothesis, we show that tight junctions of the brain barriers were abnormal in PTU-exposed pups, and the blood-brain barrier exhibited increased permeability. Next, we performed serum microRNA Sequencing (miRNA-Seq) to identify noncoding RNAs that may reflect these neurodevelopmental disturbances. Of the differentially expressed miRNAs identified, 7 were upregulated in PTU-exposed pups. Validation by qRT-PCR shows that miR-495 and miR-543-3p were similarly upregulated in males and females. Interestingly, these miRNAs have been linked to cell junction dysfunction in other models, paralleling the identified abnormalities in the rat brain. Taken together, these data show that miR-495 and miR-543-3p may be novel <span>in vivo</span> biomarkers of thyroid-mediated developmental neurotoxicity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"57d4cd11d1c0c4cbbafc55fee77a9939d353dbcd426524b81774409cc89d4dde","category":"Environment"}
