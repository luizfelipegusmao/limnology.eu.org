The rice fortified with iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 is being supplied through various social welfare schemes in India in a phased manner and planned to cover the entire country by March 2024. We have conducted a situational analysis to assess the rollout of fortified rice supplied through the Public Distribution System (PDS) and to evaluate the accessibility, availability, acceptability, and utilization of fortified rice by the beneficiaries of the PDS. This was a mixed-method, sequential exploratory study conducted in six districts from six different states of India that had begun distribution of fortified rice through PDS in pilot mode during 2020â€“2021. In each district, the district supply officer of the PDS, Food Corporation of India (FCI) or State Food Corporation (SFC) warehouse supervisor, and four Fair Price Shop (FPS) dealers were interviewed. Under each FPS, a minimum of seven beneficiary households were randomly selected and interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The in-depth interviews were conducted with different stakeholders using theme guides. All the interviewed stakeholders were aware about their roles and responsibilities and purpose to distribute fortified rice. There was a continuous supply of fortified rice (across all visited districts) to beneficiaries through a well-established system. Acceptability and compliance to intake of fortified rice was good with no reported gastrointestinal adverse outcomes following fortified rice intake. There was an efficient roll-out of fortified rice though PDS with a good compliance to intake of fortified rice. It is feasible to design and conduct a study to assess the impact of fortified rice on anemia and iron storage at the community level.","author":"E. R.
