{"title":"The Mini-Pig as an Animal Model for Focal Cartilage Treatment of the Knee &ndash; A Comparison to the Domestic Pig","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0981/v1","date":1723613056000,"content":"The study objective is to evaluate the reliability of the Göttingen Mini-pig (G-MP) as a large animal model for preclinical studies addressing articular cartilage treatment procedures. Second this work compared the G-MP to the domestic pig (DP) in terms of surgical anatomy, postoperative management, and follow-up period possibilities and challenges. Six G-MP and four DP underwent a two-stage surgical procedure including cartilage harvesting using a superolateral approach followed by cartilage implantation using a medial parapatellar tendon approach. The superolateral approach exposed 11% (SD ± 5) of the entire trochlea in G-MP and 20% in the DP model. The medial parapatellar tendon approach in G-MP exposed 63% (SD ± 4) of the trochlear surface and exposed 34% (SD ± 13) of the medial femoral condyle, allowing 4 trochlear lesions of 6mm of diameter and one to the medial condyle in 4 out of 6 G-MP and in all DPs. Cartilage thickness was under 1mm in G-MP compared to more than 2mm in DP. Weight-progression was + 4 kg/week in DP and + 0.2 kg/week for G-MP. The G-MP is a feasible model for cartilage research, with adequate access to the joint via the dual approach. Thus enabling 4-5 lesions of 6mm, however a thinner cartilage in the G-MP needs to be considered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ee0bc23fa8eb737c7cdb349c8eb6c4356d1ad6240275cfa843eb14cc3aaa7e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
