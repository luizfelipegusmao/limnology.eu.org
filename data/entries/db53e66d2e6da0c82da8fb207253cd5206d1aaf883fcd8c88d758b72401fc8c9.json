{"title":"The Fr&eacute;chet-Chen Distribution and Its Applications to Reliability Analysis of Electronic Devices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1956/v1","date":1727257343000,"content":"This paper presents a hybrid probability distribution known as the FCD, which is based on the hazard functions of the Fr√©chet and Chen distributions. A notable characteristic of the FCD is its ability to model monotonic (increasing and decreasing) and non-monotonic (bathtub-shaped) behaviors, commonly linked to electrical and electronic device failure times in reliability analysis. The paper explores the statistical properties relevant to the reliability analysis of these devices. It proposes a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and Bayesian Analysis equations for estimating the parameters of the FCD. Three case studies of electronic device lifetimes with varying behaviors were analyzed to validate the proposed methodology. The FCD was compared to other distributions with similar characteristics, and the results from each case study demonstrated that the proposed distribution yields competitive outcomes, closely reflecting the behavior of the devices analyzed, making it a valuable option for reliability engineering practitioners in warranty and maintenance time evaluations","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db53e66d2e6da0c82da8fb207253cd5206d1aaf883fcd8c88d758b72401fc8c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
