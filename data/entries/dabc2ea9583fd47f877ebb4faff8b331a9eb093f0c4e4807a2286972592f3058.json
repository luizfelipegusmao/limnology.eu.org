{"title":"Sociocultural Aspects and Isolation of Streptococcus spp. from Dental Biofilm: A Comparison of Patients in Public Health and Private Dental Practices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1986/v1","date":1721904720000,"content":"The different sociocultural context and lifestyle may influence oral health. To evaluate the interference of these factors, we conducted a quantitative-qualitative cross-sectional study. The research was carried out in a private dental office, in an urban area, and in the Family Health Unit (USF), in a rural area. Fifty patients of each location participated on the research. A semi-structured questionnaire covering sociocultural profile, oral hygiene habits, drug consumption, use of medicinal plants, and antibiotics usage was applied. Also, laboratory tests to evaluate the tendency to have dental decay and Streptococcus sp colony counting was performed. There was no significant difference between patients in the two groups regarding gender, race, marital status, type of residence, number of residents in the same household, and type of employment. Private clinic participants were more prone to consuming alcohol and/or cigarettes and reported to brush the teeth more often. There was no association between salivary acidity and higher biofilm bacterial density. The usage of medicinal plants was more evident in the public service. Data presented here revealed that social inequality between private and public dental assistance are greater from the point of view of investment in public health for the population with difficult access and not from cultural or educational level diversity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dabc2ea9583fd47f877ebb4faff8b331a9eb093f0c4e4807a2286972592f3058","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
