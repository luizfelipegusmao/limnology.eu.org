{"title":"The Role of Pistacia lentiscus in the Prevention of Chronic Rhinosinusitis Recurrence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1307/v1","date":1711418413000,"content":"Objective\nRhinosinusitis is a chronic condition characterized by frequent episodes of recurrence; its main treatment is pharmacological and this therapy should be continued for a long time until stabilization of the problem. Some patients, however, often must resort to targeted therapies for disease recurrences, which is why targeted preventive treatments are sought. \nMethods\nIn the study performed, Pistacia lentiscus oil was used.  Two groups of patients were studied with endoscopy, SNOT 22 and Nasal Cytology to evaluate nasal cellularity and ciliar motility.\nResults \nPistacia lentiscus oil has the ability to reduce mucosal inflammation, by destroying and preventing the formation of biofilm. \nConclusion\nThe study showed that daily administration of Pistacia lentiscus oil significantly reduced the presence of biofilm. Moreover, continuous use of a lentiscus oil wash significantly reduced patientsâ€™ symptoms and improved their quality of life according to the Snot 22 questionnaire.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf82cc87fa0f91d931b7c829c4066b779caafd494dd91c00e0f425420bc4bdef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
