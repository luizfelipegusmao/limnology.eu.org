{"title":"Systematic review: The relationship between gabapentinoids, etizolam, and drug related deaths in Scotland","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310655","date":1728482400000,"content":"<p>by Beata Ciesluk, Dr. Greig Inglis, Adrian Parke, Lucy J. Troup</p>\r\n\r\nIn recent years Scotland has been experiencing a disproportionally high number of drug related deaths compared to other European countries, causing significant individual, societal and economic burden. A possible cause of this is the increase in average number of substances involved in Scottish drug related deaths, as well as the changing pattern of substances involved. Opioids, cocaine, and alcohol have been consistently involved in the culture of drug use in Scotland, however recently National Records Scotland have identified that designer benzodiazepines such as etizolam, and prescription drugs such as gabapentinoids are increasingly being detected in Scottish toxicology reports. A systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted through searching PubMed and Google Scholar to identify peer-reviewed articles published in English between 2013 and 2023 that investigated Scottish population data on gabapentinoids and etizolam to establish their contribution to the rise in Scottish drug related deaths. 18 studies were included in the review. A high use prevalence of etizolam and gabapentinoids in Scotland has been identified, with both substance-related deaths showing recent increase, marked since 2015. This pattern is replicated in the Scottish prison system. There has also been a significant increase of gabapentinoids prescriptions in Scotland. Polydrug use was identified as the most common determinant of both etizolam and gabapentinoids related adverse effects and fatality in Scotland, especially concurrent opioid use. The results indicate the literature on individual characteristics of Scottish at-risk users of gabapentinoids and etizolam is limited, however the data shows both substances are being used by older cohort, with adverse effects seen more in older women.","author":"Beata Ciesluk","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fa5d4680c1684fb4dc2dd3fb8b6dcb198d8bc711f097ba8f8aec772fe1001e40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
