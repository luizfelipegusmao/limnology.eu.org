Rhee, Young San Ko, Chi Heon Kim</p>\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Republic of Korea (ROK) experienced three epidemic waves in February, August, and November 2020. These waves, combined with the overarching pandemic, significantly influenced trends in spinal surgery. This study aimed to investigate the trends in degenerative lumbar spinal surgery in ROK during the early COVID-19 pandemic, especially in relation to specific epidemic waves. Using the National Health Information Database in ROK, we identified all patients who underwent surgery for degenerative lumbar spinal diseases between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020. A joinpoint regression was used to assess temporal trends in spinal surgeries over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of surgeries decreased following the first and second epidemic waves (p&lt;0.01 and p = 0.34, respectively), but these were offset by compensatory increases later on (p&lt;0.01 and p = 0.05, respectively). However, the third epidemic wave did not lead to a decrease in surgical volume, and the total number of surgeries remained comparable to the period before the pandemic. When compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, average LOH was reduced by 1 day during the COVID-19 period (p&lt;0.01), while mean hospital costs increased significantly from 3,511 to 4,061 USD (p&lt;0.01). Additionally, the transfer rate and the 30-day readmission rate significantly decreased (both p&lt;0.01), while the reoperation rate remained stable (p = 0.36). Despite the impact of epidemic waves on monthly surgery numbers, a subsequent compensatory increase was observed, indicating that surgical care has adapted to the challenges of the pandemic. This adaptability, along with the stable total number of operations, highlights the potential for healthcare systems to continue elective spine surgery during public health crises with strategic resource allocation and patient triage. Policies should ensure that surgeries for degenerative spinal diseases, particularly those not requiring urgent care but crucial for patient quality of life, are not unnecessarily halted.","author":"Woon Tak Yuh","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"05ae3cbfeffcf781437a0ba8653de26e50936008a18e8c7bb941dce51ab1e58b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
