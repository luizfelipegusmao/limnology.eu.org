{"title":"Tailored Physical Activity Interventions for Long COVID: Current Approaches and Benefits- a Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0438/v1","date":1720083410000,"content":"This narrative review examines the crucial role of physical activity in managing long COVID, characterized by persistent symptoms such as fatigue, breathlessness, and cognitive impairments following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The methodology involved a comprehensive literature search across PubMed, EBSCO (EDS), and Google Scholar, selecting peer-reviewed articles from December 2019 focusing on long-term COVID physical activity interventions. The review highlights that tailored exercise programs, adjusted to individual health status and abilities, significantly alleviate symptoms and enhance psychological well-being. Key findings emphasize the importance of personalized exercise prescriptions due to the variability in patient responses and the need for a multidisciplinary approach in developing and monitoring interventions. Despite promising outcomes, the review identifies research gaps, including the need for long-term studies, randomized controlled trials, and deeper mechanistic insights. It suggests that standardized reporting, templates like CERT, and integrating digital health tools are essential for optimizing interventions. Overall, the review advocates including personalized physical activity programs in standard care for long COVID to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dcdb34bc70c368bfe787f1de53a0a730b90a490f086601ecd25238c7313e5e63","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
