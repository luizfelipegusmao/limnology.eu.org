Electric field observation within ferroelectric materials is potentially possible by DPC STEM, but concomitant diffraction contrast hinders the quantitative electric field evaluation. Diffraction contrast is basically caused by the diffraction-condition variation inside a field of view, but in the case of ferroelectric materials, the diffraction conditions can also change with respect to the polarization orientations. To quantitatively observe electric field distribution inside ferroelectric domains, the formation mechanism of diffraction contrast should be clarified in detail. In this study, we systematically simulated diffraction contrast of ferroelectric domains in DPC STEM images based on the dynamical diffraction theory, and clarify the issues for quantitatively observing electric fields inside ferroelectric domains. Furthermore, we conducted experimental DPC STEM observations for a ferroelectric material to confirm the influence of diffraction contrast predicted by the simulations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"d91ae754612c0dbf5ab782d1bb32d3760356749fc0d6a35d8c9a7d21df115d43","category":"Environment"}
