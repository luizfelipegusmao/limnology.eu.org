The prospect of on-the-fly fabrication of materials, tailored to meet specific component requirements, holds considerable allure. Nevertheless, there is currently insufficient <span>in situ</span> experimental data to capture material interaction at nano- and atomic-scale levels, hindering the enhancement of exciting models and simulations for seamless direct fabrication of the components. This gap obstructs detailed investigations into solidification and solid-state phase transformations occurring during and after laser beam interactions. In our research, we employed <span>in situ</span> laser system integrated into both a secondary electron microscope (SEM) and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to explore the formation of non-equilibrium phase transformations and their evolution during <span>in situ</span> laser beam interaction with Fe-Cr-Ni structural material at multiscale level (µm-nm-Å).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"673a1632d23aca9a5a8db103874687501a706dc4ae8bba887518419ad7762c24","category":"Environment"}
