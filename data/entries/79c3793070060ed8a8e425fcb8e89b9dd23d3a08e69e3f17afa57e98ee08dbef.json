{"title":"Impact of pre-harvest fungicide application on the storage performance of tomato fruits","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308670","date":1723125600000,"content":"<p>by Zhifu Lan, Jing Huang, Komivi S. Akutse, Yongwen Lin</p>\r\n\r\nTo examine the impact of pre-harvest fungicide applications on the postharvest storage performance of tomato fruits, we measured the lycopene content, hardness, soluble solids content, rotting rate, and weight loss rate of the fruits, as well as conducted a sensory assessment. Protective and systematic fungicides were sprayed on tomatoes 20 days before harvest in order to prevent rotting and weight loss during storage. Our findings showed that, the fungicide-treated tomatoes had a significantly lower rotting rate of 16.00% and a weight loss rate of 3.96%. However the control group experienced 65.33% rotting rate and 6.90% weight loss rate on 12<sup>th</sup> days of storage. Out of the pre-harvest applications, ‘Zineb’ a protective fungicide significantly delayed the loss of hardness and soluble solids accumulation in tomato fruits during storage, but it had no significant effect on lycopene content. On the other hand, when comparing to the examined treatment, the systemic fungicides did not have any significant effect on the postharvest storage performance of tomato fruits. Sensory evaluation results indicated that systemic fungicides improved the aroma of the fruits, while protective fungicides had a greater impact on the appearance and juiciness of the fruits. This study offers a potential novel solution for preserving fruits and vegetables which have been frequently infected by phytopathogens during storage, and consequently mitigate/reduce postharvest losses.","author":"Zhifu Lan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"79c3793070060ed8a8e425fcb8e89b9dd23d3a08e69e3f17afa57e98ee08dbef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
