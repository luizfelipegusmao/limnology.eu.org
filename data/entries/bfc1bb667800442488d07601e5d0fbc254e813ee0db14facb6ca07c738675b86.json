{"title":"PSLBI-18 Isoleucine requirements of young adult and senior Labrador retrievers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/630/7757797?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Age-appropriate diets that meet the unique nutritional needs of aging are in greater demand as senior dogs represent an increasing percentage of the pet population. Studies targeting the specific amino acid requirements of the aging canine are important because they may inform dietary formulations for this specific life stage. In this study, the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique was used to determine the minimum requirements for isoleucine (Iso) in young adult and senior Labrador retrievers. After 2-d adaptation to Iso-adequate basal diet (Iso = 0.608% dry matter), dogs underwent individual IAOO studies. In brief, all dogs were randomly fed one of six test diets with varying levels of isoleucine ranging from deficient to sufficient (final Iso content in experimental diets were 0.244, 0.285, 0.326, 0.532, 0.57 and 0.608% dry matter). Test diet was divided into 13 equal meals; at the 5th meal, a tracer amino acid was supplied (a bolus L-[1-<sup>13</sup>C] phenylalanine based on body weight was first given, followed by [1-<sup>13</sup>C] Phe doses every 30 min spanning a 4 h period), and breath samples were collected via respiration mask every 30 min. CO<sub>2</sub> production was determined via indirect calorimetry and production of <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> at each dose was measured by enrichment of <sup>13</sup>C in breath samples via isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). Results for IRMS data were converted to atom percent excess (APE) and analyzed using segmented linear regression. The Four Rivers mean and population requirements for isoleucine were 898 ± 71 mg/1,000 kcal ME (mean ± 2 SD) for young adults and 885 ± 91 mg/1,000 kcal ME (mean ± 2 SD) in senior dogs, which is slightly greater than the National Research Council’s minimum requirement. As the pet food industry offers more specialized diets for aging canines, updating the amino acid requirements for such animals is increasingly important.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"bfc1bb667800442488d07601e5d0fbc254e813ee0db14facb6ca07c738675b86","category":"Environment"}
