{"title":"Olfactory Selection Preferences of Pagiophloeus tsushimanus Adults toward Lauraceae Plants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2622/v1","date":1722591469000,"content":"Pagiophloeus tsushimanus, a new record of wood-boring pest first reported in China in 2014, has significantly infested Cinnamomum camphora across various administrative districts in Shanghai. And it shows a concerning trend of spread. The larval stage of the insect, being concealed within the trunks of C. camphora, exhibits characteristics such as hidden activity, strong destructiveness, and difficulty in control. This severely affects the normal growth of the host trees. While the primary host plant for P. tsushimanus is the C. camphora, preliminary observations have shown that the pest can also complete its life cycle on Cinnamomum chekiangensis and Phoebe chekiangensis. Both of them are significant species for urban greening. To explore the host selection preference of this beetle, this study investigates the olfactory selection behavior of adult P. tsushimanus towards C. camphora, C. chekiangensis, and P. chekiangensis. Results from choice tests, no-choice tests, and \"Y\"-shaped olfactometer experiments indicated that both male and female adults exhibited a feeding preference for C. camphora branches, with females showing a preference for laying eggs on C. camphora branches as well. Behavioral responses demonstrated a positive chemotaxis towards volatiles from C. camphora and a negative chemotaxis towards volatiles from C. chekiangensis and P. chekiangensis. Overall, the findings suggest that both male and female adults have a selective preference for volatiles emitted by C. camphora. These provides a theoretical basis for monitoring and controlling host shift occurrences in P. tsushimanus.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c048a397280578867b4992b7b372f0c881848c790c8b6f206c44c4c7457433e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
