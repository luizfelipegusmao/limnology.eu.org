{"title":"Cutaneous Manifestations in Costello Syndrome: From Atopic Dermatitis to Cutaneous Papilloma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2052/v1","date":1727329215000,"content":"Abstract\nBackground\nCostello syndrome (CS) is a rare RASopathy caused by a mutation in the proto-oncogene gene HRAS located on chromosome 11p15.5. It is characterized by failure to thrive, intellectual disability, coarse facies, and various cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and dermatological abnormalities.\nAims\nThis literature review describes the various dermatological manifestations of CS in hopes of guiding dermatologists to recognize this rare neurocutaneous syndrome promptly and achieving better patient outcomes.\nMethods\nPubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus were utilized to search for articles and studies on the dermatological features and disorders present in CS. Articles were selected and screened primarily by two reviewers. In the initial article selection process, a third reviewer was included in times of contradiction between the two primary reviewers. Twenty-three articles were ultimately included for analysis.\nResults\nCS presents myriad dermatological manifestations, the most characteristic being fine, curly to wavy hair, thick, bushy eyebrows, thin but fast-growing nails, cutaneous papillomas, and loose and redundant skin. Significant cutaneous pathologies associated with CS include eczema, acanthosis nigricans, nevi, coarse facies, and hyperpigmentation. Individuals with CS are also at increased risk for heat intolerance, hyperhidrosis, and photosensitivity.\nConclusions\nDermatologists must be aware of CS and its dermatological manifestations to efficiently treat the comorbidities involved with this rare neurodevelopmental disorder. CS can present similarly to Cardio-facial-cutaneous syndrome, Noonan syndrome, William syndrome, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome; thus, a keen understanding of the cutaneous differences amongst the syndromes may aid in accurate diagnosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10f0ccf2936815a0f8e4d9378cb9e32715db752d6bef377a72df1e4f1936afba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
