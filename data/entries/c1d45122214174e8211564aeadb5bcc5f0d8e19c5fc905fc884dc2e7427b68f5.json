{"title":"Aromatic Metal Corrosion Inhibitors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0936/v1","date":1728645899000,"content":"Molecular inhibitors added to the corrosive medium attacking metallic materials are a well-established way of combating corrosion. The inhibitive action proceeds via adsorption of the inhibitor on the surface to be protected. Aromatic building blocks in the inhibitor play a major role in their protective action, further details like substituents, heteroatoms and molecular geometry contribute. An overview is provided focused on aromatic inhibitors aiming at the identification of particularly promising inhibitors and their mode of action. Directions of further research and development are pointed out in conclusion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c1d45122214174e8211564aeadb5bcc5f0d8e19c5fc905fc884dc2e7427b68f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
