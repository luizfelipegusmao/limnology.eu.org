{"title":"Scale Characteristics of Six Fish Species of the Genus Cyprinion (Teleostei: Cypriniformes): A Microscopic Analysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/4/771/7717189?rss=1","date":1721347200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study investigated the morphological characteristics of scales in six <span>Cyprinion</span> species, using light and scanning electron microscopy focusing on key features such as scale type, key scales, lateral line scales, radius/radii, rostral margin, focus, circuli, lepidonts, tubercles, and scale indices. The research analyzed the scales using ultramicroscopy and light microscopy imaging, categorizing them based on size classes and body regions. The morphological variations in scale characteristics were examined across different species, regions, and size classes. Notable findings included the tetra-sectioned form of scales, representing a unique characteristic of the <span>Cyprinion</span> genus. Morphological changes in scale features were observed with fish growth, particularly in the overall shape, focus shape, and size. Quantitative analysis revealed variations in average relative scale length and width among different species, regions, and size classes. The study utilized canonical discriminant analysis for multivariate assessment, classifying the species into distinct groups based on morphometric indices. The findings contribute to the understanding of scale morphology in <span>Cyprinion</span> species and exploring morphological variation between the examined species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9e35a4582d75e2d8ee96d3e9d6e2f75f45f1d045e7da598b298ea3931401bffb","category":"Environment"}
