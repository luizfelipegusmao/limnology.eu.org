This study investigated diabetes-related knowledge, attitudes, and practice toward exercise and its benefits among individuals with T2DM. A total of one hundred and ninety-nine participants (male= 21.6% and female= 78.4%) with T2DM, aged between 18- 75, 43.77 (SD ±14.78) years participated in the study. A validated diabetes-related knowledge, attitude, and practice questionnaire, evaluated by true/false or unsure was utilised in the study. Descriptive and inferential statistics analysis was used to analyze data with the significance set at p&lt;0. The study results demonstrated significantly poor diabetes-related knowledge of exercise (p&lt;0.001). The majority of the study participants 163 (81.90%) with T2DM did not know that physical activity and exercise are different. Regarding the attitude of the individuals with T2DM, 158 (70.40%) of the study participants felt that their regular work was an adequate substitution for exercise. More than 50% of the study participants demonstrated a positive practice towards exercise and its benefits towards T2DM (p&lt;0.001). The study revealed that participants’ knowledge and attitudes were poor towards exercise and its benefits, but their practice was good.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a6022883cef2a7fe98713501148b9bbdedda8f68d2feb4990b17e0c63e733065","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
