{"title":"Assessment of Wound Bed Delivery of Galectin-3 to Modulate Macrophage Polarization, Re-epithelialization and Collagen Synthesis in a Murine Model of Excisional Skin Healing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1653/v1","date":1724319798000,"content":"Chronic wounds remain trapped in a pro-inflammatory state, with strategies targeted at inducing re-epithelialization and the proliferative phase of healing desirable. A member of the lectin family, galec-tin-3 is implicated in regulation of macrophage phenotype and epithelial migration. We investigated if local delivery of galectin-3 enhanced skin healing in a full thickness excisional C57BL/6 mouse model. An elec-trospun gelatin scaffold loaded with galectin-3 was developed and compared to topical delivery of galec-tin-3. Electrospun gelatin/galectin-3 scaffolds had an average fiber diameter of 200 nm, with 83% scaffold porosity approximately and am average pore diameter of 1.15 μm. The developed scaffolds supported der-mal fibroblasts adhesion, matrix deposition and proliferation in vitro. In vivo treatment of 6 mm full thickness excisional wounds with gelatin/galectin-3 scaffolds did not influence wound closure, re-epithelialization or macrophage phenotypes, but increased collagen synthesis. In comparison, topical delivery of galectin-3 [6.7 µg/ml] significantly increased arginase-I cell density at day 7 versus untreated and gelatin/galectin-3 scaf-folds (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd728f22034937436ea3c2d9fc5631ec35bb4e7db53805602bc91c9418cbe910","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
