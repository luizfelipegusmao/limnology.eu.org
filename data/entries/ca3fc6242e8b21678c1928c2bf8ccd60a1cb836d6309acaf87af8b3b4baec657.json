Thanks to the significant advances in high-energy resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the monochromated scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.737-B1\">1</a>], it is now possible to measure the phonon dispersion at local structures of materials, including defects and interfaces [<a href=\"#ozae044.737-B2\">2-4</a>]. Although the phonon dispersions from different Brillouin zones (BZs) correspond to the same modes of lattice vibration, they display different spectral features in STEM vibrational spectroscopy. To accurately interpret the vibrational properties of local structures, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive understanding of the excitation mechanisms of lattice vibrations by fast electrons.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ca3fc6242e8b21678c1928c2bf8ccd60a1cb836d6309acaf87af8b3b4baec657","category":"Environment"}
