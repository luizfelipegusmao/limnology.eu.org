The synthesis of SiC has been approached by different methods as microwave, detonation, calcination, pyrolysis, solvothermal, carbothermal reduction between some others the synthesis generally implies the use of furnace that require to reach temperature of at least 1000 C and hold those high temperatures for at least an hour which is a costly approach, here we suggest a novel method for the synthesis of SiC [<a href=\"#ozae044.635-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8c007979292d79110ee16e9b456c15ce3daa6c230b431d97fba70bb5653ac004","category":"Environment"}
