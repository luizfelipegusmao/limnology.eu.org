{"title":"The reproducibility and predictivity of radiomic features extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography of hepatocellular carcinoma","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310486","date":1726236000000,"content":"<p>by Abdalla Ibrahim, Siddharth Guha, Lin Lu, Pengfei Geng, Qian Wu, Yen Chou, Hao Yang, Delin Wang, Lawrence H. Schwartz, Chuan-miao Xie, Binsheng Zhao</p>\r\nPurpose <p>To assess the reproducibility of radiomic features (RFs) extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT) scans of patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with regards to inter-observer variability and acquisition timing after contrast injection. The predictive ability of reproducible RFs for differentiating between the degrees of HCC differentiation is also investigated.</p> Methods <p>We analyzed a set of DCE-CT scans of 39 patients diagnosed with HCC. Two radiologists independently segmented the scans, and RFs were extracted from each sequence of the DCE-CT scans. The same lesion was segmented across the DCE-CT sequences of each patientâ€™s scan. From each lesion, 127 commonly used RFs were extracted. The reproducibility of RFs was assessed with regard to (i) inter-observer variability, by evaluating the reproducibility of RFs between the two radiologists; and (ii) timing of acquisition following contrast injection (inter- and intra-imaging phase). The reproducibility of RFs was assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), with a cut-off value of 0.90. Reproducible RFs were used for building XGBoost classification models for the differentiation of HCC differentiation.</p> Results <p>Inter-observer analyses across the different contrast-enhancement phases showed that the number of reproducible RFs was 29 (22.8%), 52 (40.9%), and 36 (28.3%) for the non-contrast enhanced, late arterial, and portal venous phases, respectively. Intra- and inter-sequence analyses revealed that the number of reproducible RFs ranged between 1 (0.8%) and 47 (37%), inversely related with time interval between the sequences. XGBoost algorithms built using reproducible RFs in each phase were found to be high predictive ability of the degree of HCC tumor differentiation.</p> Conclusions <p>The reproducibility of many RFs was significantly impacted by inter-observer variability, and a larger number of RFs were impacted by the difference in the time of acquisition after contrast injection. Our findings highlight the need for quality assessment to ensure that scans are analyzed in the same physiologic imaging phase in quantitative imaging studies, or that phase-wide reproducible RFs are selected. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of reproducibility and quality control when using RFs as biomarkers for clinical applications.</p>","author":"Abdalla Ibrahim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"478a741ef511116c8227d581cb1ef82683fec1d6dc1b64132a78f160a21baaec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
