{"title":"Attachment in Adolescence: Old Patterns and New Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1181/v1","date":1726542012000,"content":"This narrative review provides an in-depth analysis of attachment during adolescence, empha-sizing how early attachment experiences shape emotional, social, and psychological development. Drawing from the foundational work of Bowlby and Ainsworth, it revisits attachment theories and explores how the attachment system evolves as adolescents seek greater autonomy while maintaining bonds with caregivers. The review discusses the prevalence and developmental con-sequences of attachment-related disorders, such as reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder, particularly in relation to adverse caregiving environments. Key themes include the intergenerational transmission of attachment, where parental reflective func-tioning and early caregiving behaviors influence attachment security across generations. The evolving role of fathers, peer relationships, and romantic bonds in adolescence are explored as significant factors shaping attachment patterns during this developmental period. Methodologi-cal considerations highlight the value of qualitative approaches, including interviews and obser-vational methods, for capturing the complexity of adolescent attachment dynamics. Additionally, the review addresses the processes that contribute to both continuity and change in attachment classifications over time, emphasizing the impact of life events, parental behaviors, and develop-mental transitions. The implications of attachment for developmental psychopathology, particu-larly in relation to emotional regulation and psychosocial functioning, are discussed. Finally, the review calls for further interdisciplinary research to deepen understanding of attachment mecha-nisms, using advanced technologies and culturally sensitive approaches to improve mental health and developmental outcomes across the lifespan.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f4d123cae7dc2fcb7e850a64c1aa051c84ed354877594a2c17aeb3693ed7642","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
