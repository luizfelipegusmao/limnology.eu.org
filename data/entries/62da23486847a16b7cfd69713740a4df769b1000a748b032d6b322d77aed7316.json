Many cattle in the northern great plains are fed on family-owned farms and feedlots, highlighting the need for producer-friendly mitigation strategies, such as the established, but not widely adopted management strategy of controlled or precision feeding. The objective of this experiment was to determine the impact of precision feeding on enteric methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) production and subsequent animal performance. Angus-cross steers [n = 48; body weight (BW) = 447 ± 4.4kg] were blocked by BW and assigned to one of three treatment groups. Treatments consisted of a control (CON) where steers were fed ad libitum, Treatment 1 (TRT1) 96 percent of ad libitum and Treatment 2 (TRT2) 92 percent of ad libitum. TRT1 and TRT2 were adjusted once weekly based on the CON steers average intakes from the previous week. BW was measured on d 0, 1, 28, 56, and 84 and dry matter intake (DMI; kg/d) was measured using an Insentec Roughage Intake Control System (Insentec, Markenesse, The Netherlands). Enteric CH<sub>4</sub> and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) production was determined utilizing 2 GreenFeed emission measurement systems (AHCS; C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD). Only visits greater than 3 min in duration were used for analysis. Average Daily Gain (ADG) and gain to feed (G:F) did not differ among treatments (<span>P</span> = 0.17, <span>P</span> = 0.80, respectively), but ADG had a tendency to decrease (linear; <span>P</span> = 0.09). DMI was greatest for CON and least for TRT2 (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.01). CH<sub>4</sub> (g/d) output differed between treatments (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.007). There was a tendency for a quadratic relationship for derived methane yield (MY; g/kg DMI) among treatments (<span>P</span> = 0.10). Emission intensity (EI; g CH4/kg gain) was not different across treatments (<span>P</span> = 0.40). These results suggest precision feeding may have a positive impact on methane emissions but could negatively impact performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"62da23486847a16b7cfd69713740a4df769b1000a748b032d6b322d77aed7316","category":"Environment"}
