{"title":"Simultaneous determination of semi‐essential nutrients taurine, l‐carnitine and choline in infant formulas and adult/pediatric nutritional formulas by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography‐electrospray ionization‐tandem mass spectrometry","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13682?af=R","date":1728660030000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The nutritional intake of formula-fed newborns is often limited to a single source, so it must be supplemented with essential nutrients for the growth and proper development of infants. Taurine, <span>l</span>-carnitine, and choline are considered conditionally essential nutrients especially in newborns and infants.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this work, a simple routine hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-ESI-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of these semi-essential nutrients in infant and adult/pediatric milk formulas. The extraction recoveries were between 90% and 114%. Precision of the method offered relative standard deviation below 5% and 7% for intra-day and inter-day precision, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to quantification of taurine, <span>l</span>-carnitine, and choline in milk formula. The contents found were in good agreement with those provided on the product label for almost all samples.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>In view of these results, it can be concluded that the developed method can be a useful approach for the simultaneous determination of taurine, <span>l</span>-carnitine and choline in powdered milk samples, so it can be useful in the routine quality control of this kind of samples. © 2024 The Author(s).
