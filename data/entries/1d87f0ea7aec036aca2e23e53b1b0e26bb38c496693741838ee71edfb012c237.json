{"title":"The Dipole-Radiation Interaction Revisited","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1771/v1","date":1721720453000,"content":"The phenomena of light absorption, fluorescence and laser emission are accounted for within a unique picture. The atomic dipole is dealt with in a quantum framework, whereas the electromagnetic field is assumed to be a classical sine-wave. The on and off resonance cases are investigated. This is achieved owing to a novel application of Poynting's theorem. Observable predictions are made, regarding absorption of the electromagnetic energy and the frequency  bandwidth of light emitted either by fluorescence or laser effect.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d87f0ea7aec036aca2e23e53b1b0e26bb38c496693741838ee71edfb012c237","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
