{"title":"Assessment of the American College of Surgeons-Surgical Risk Calculator (ACS-SRC) for prediction of early postoperative complications in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery for ovarian peritoneal carcinomatosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0600/v1","date":1728436158000,"content":"Ovarian cancer is diagnosed at a locally advanced stage in two-thirds of cases. The first line of treatment consists of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. However, CRS can be associated with high rates of postoperative complications (POCs) and detection of fragile patients at high risk of POCs is important. The American College of Surgeons Surgical Risk Calculator (ACS-SRC) provides a predictive model for early POCs (30 days) for any given surgical procedure. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the ACS-SRC in predicting the occurrence of early POCs for patients undergoing CRS for ovarian cancer. This was a retrospective study that included patients undergoing CRS for advanced ovarian cancer between January 2010 and December 2022. Early POCs were reviewed and the rate of POCs was compared with those predicted by the ACS-SRC to evaluate its accuracy (i.e., discrimination and calibration). A total of 218 patients were included, 112 of whom underwent extensive surgery/resection. A total of 94 complications were recorded. This cohort demonstrated correct calibration of the ACS-SRC for the prediction of surgical site infection (SSI), readmission, and the need for nursing care post-discharge (NCPD; transfer to revalidation center or need for nursing care at home). Using both the discrimination and calibration methods, the score only predicted NCPD. In this study, the ACS-SRC was shown to be of little value for patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery for ovarian peritoneal carcinomatosis, as it only accurately predicted NCPD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4a7a78d6121ddf2cf13f77ed42b7841a7ee4c884e3f6b3d04a4c551f3c0affb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
