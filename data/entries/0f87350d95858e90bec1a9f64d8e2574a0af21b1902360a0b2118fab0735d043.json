{"title":"Comparing the effects of ground cultivation and protection against browsing upon the natural regeneration of Scots pine and birch in a Caledonian pinewood","link":"https://academic.oup.com/forestry/article/97/4/604/7590541?rss=1","date":1706313600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Caledonian pinewoods of northern Scotland represent the remnants of once extensive forests found at the western edge of the natural range of Scots pine (<span>Pinus sylvestris</span> L.). The surviving pinewoods are of international significance and are of high conservation and cultural value. However, for many decades, there has been concern about their long-term future because of a lack of regenerating seedlings and young trees. This problem is thought to be driven by high deer populations resulting in intensive browsing and severe damage to young trees, as well as a lack of favourable micro-sites for seedling germination. An experiment was established on the Mar Lodge estate in 2007–08 adjacent to native pinewood stands to test the effects of protection and site cultivation upon seedling numbers and growth. The experiment was located within a regeneration zone where intensive deer control had reduced numbers to &lt;5 animals km<sup>−2</sup>. Ten years after initiation, occurrence and numbers of both Scots pine and birch seedlings were substantially increased in cultivated treatments compared with uncultivated controls. There were no effects of protection upon seedling numbers. Protection improved height growth of Scots pine, but not of birch. Cultivation had no effect upon the growth of pine seedlings but did influence the height of birch seedlings due to the rapid growth of some pre-existing seedlings in the uncultivated control. Vegetation cover had increased from ~60%to at least 80% cover 6 years after cultivation. The results suggest that site cultivation may be desirable to boost seedling germination within a Caledonian pinewood, but sustained measures to control browsing pressure are a prerequisite for satisfactory establishment of these seedlings.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Forestry: An International Journal of Forest Research Current Issue","siteHash":"674daa49a10aca976a546578a4b89e6a296c5e7ca75e6f3ff66a7154daf5b0cb","entryHash":"0f87350d95858e90bec1a9f64d8e2574a0af21b1902360a0b2118fab0735d043","category":"Environment"}
