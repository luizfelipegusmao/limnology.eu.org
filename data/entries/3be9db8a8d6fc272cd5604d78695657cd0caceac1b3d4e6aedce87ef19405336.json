{"title":"Gene expression and metabolite levels converge in the thermogenic spadix of skunk cabbage","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1561/7601411?rss=1","date":1707177600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The inflorescence (spadix) of skunk cabbage (<span>Symplocarpus renifolius</span>) is strongly thermogenic and can regulate its temperature at around 23 °C even when the ambient temperature drops below freezing. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying developmentally controlled thermogenesis and thermoregulation in skunk cabbage, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptome and metabolome analysis across 3 developmental stages of spadix development. Our RNA-seq analysis revealed distinct groups of expressed genes, with <span>selenium-binding protein 1/methanethiol oxidase</span> (<span>SBP1/MTO</span>) exhibiting the highest levels in thermogenic florets. Notably, the expression of <span>alternative oxidase</span> (<span>AOX</span>) was consistently high from the prethermogenic stage through the thermogenic stage in the florets. Metabolome analysis showed that alterations in nucleotide levels correspond with the developmentally controlled and tissue-specific thermogenesis of skunk cabbage, evident by a substantial increase in AMP levels in thermogenic florets. Our study also reveals that hydrogen sulfide, a product of SBP1/MTO, inhibits cytochrome <span>c</span> oxidase (COX)-mediated mitochondrial respiration, while AOX-mediated respiration remains relatively unaffected. Specifically, at lower temperatures, the inhibitory effect of hydrogen sulfide on COX-mediated respiration increases, promoting a shift toward the dominance of AOX-mediated respiration. Finally, despite the differential regulation of genes and metabolites throughout spadix development, we observed a convergence of gene expression and metabolite accumulation patterns during thermogenesis. This synchrony may play a key role in developmentally regulated thermogenesis. Moreover, such convergence during the thermogenic stage in the spadix may provide a solid molecular basis for thermoregulation in skunk cabbage.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"3be9db8a8d6fc272cd5604d78695657cd0caceac1b3d4e6aedce87ef19405336","category":"Environment"}
