{"title":"Enhanced Performance of a Hydrokinetic Turbine Through a Biomimetic Design","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1506/v1","date":1718958868000,"content":"Hydrokinetic energy constitutes a significant promise as a renewable energy source, yet many regions experience flow velocities insufficient to support conventional turbine installations. According to this, the present work proposes a vertical axis hydrokinetic turbine aimed to environments where conven-tional turbines may not be feasible due to insufficient water velocity. This turbine is based on a biologi-cally inspired design which improves the traditional Savonius turbine. This innovative configuration is inspired by the Fibonacci spiral. The turbine's performance was analyzed through Computational Fluid Dynamics. A notable improvement was found in comparison with the traditional Savonius turbine, providing a 15.1% increment in the power coefficient.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"118ed28dfe35cb9f0d1aa23ae133baa9493172b9d9bccf7e49e8e038862680c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
