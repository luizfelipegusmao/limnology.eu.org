{"title":"Cellulose-Based Acoustic Absorber with Macro-Controlled Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2277/v1","date":1727600711000,"content":"Cellulose-based materials are now commonly used, including in the field of acoustic comfort. Often presented as a less environmentally impactful alternative to traditional acoustic absorbents (such as melamine, glass wool, etc.), these cellulose-based materials are more frequently derived from recycling, thus undergoing in most cases the technical process allowing these cellulose fibers to be obtained, thus inheriting the acoustic properties of the latter, with limited or even non-existent control. This paper proposes a manufacturing process that allows for the production of cellulose foam with precise control over its porosity, pore size, and interconnections. In addition to exhibiting remarkable sound absorption properties, this process also enables the fabrication of gradient porous structures and other hybrid materials that can result in remarkable sound absorption properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57be2d3980f0b79c68ea5d0b200c8c512e579efa641099210efc7746e6057c13","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
