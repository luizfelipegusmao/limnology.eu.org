{"title":"Phase portraits of a class of Liénard equations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1626/v1","date":1716536521000,"content":"Recently several papers have been published on the Liénard equation\nx'' +L x+m x^3+n x^5=0,\nwhere the authors studied their explicit solutions and their applications. Here we describe the complete dynamics of these differential equations in the Poincar\\'e disc. The Poincar\\'e disc is the closed disc centered at the origin of coordinates of radius one, the whole plane R^2 is identified with the interior of this disc, and its boundary, the circle $\\sss^1$ is identified with the infinity of R^2.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f64feae1a00d34e647e89216831753d3aca354c5ef045b1e32c052ae985366e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
