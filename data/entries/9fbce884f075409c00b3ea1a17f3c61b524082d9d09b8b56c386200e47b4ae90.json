However, it is unknown if changes in the expression/activity of placental Large Neutral Amino Acid Transporter Small Subunit 1 (Slc7a5/LAT1) are mechanistically linked to placental function and fetal growth. We hypothesized that trophoblast-specific <span>Slc7a5</span> overexpression increases placental transport of essential amino acids, activates the placental mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and promotes fetal growth in mice. Using lentiviral transduction of blastocysts with a <span>Slc7a5</span> transgene, we achieved trophoblast-specific overexpression of <span>Slc7a5 (Slc7a5</span> OX) with increased fetal (+27%) and placental weights (+10%). Trophoblast-specific <span>Slc7a5</span> overexpression increased trophoblast plasma membrane (TPM) LAT1 protein abundance and TPM System L transporter (+53%) and System A transporter activity (+ 21%). <span>Slc7a5</span> overexpression also increased transplacental transport of leucine (+ 85%) but not of the System A tracer, 14C-methylamino isobutyric acid, in vivo. Trophoblast-specific overexpression of <span>Slc7a5</span> activated placental mTORC1, as assessed by increased (+44%) phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (Ser 235/236), and mTORC2 as indicated by phosphorylation of PKCÎ±-Tyr-657 (+47%) and Akt-Ser 473 (+96%). This is the first demonstration that placental transport of essential amino acids is mechanistically linked to fetal growth. The decreased placental System L activity in human IUGR and the increased placental activity of this transporter in some cases of fetal overgrowth may directly contribute to the development of these pregnancy complications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"9fbce884f075409c00b3ea1a17f3c61b524082d9d09b8b56c386200e47b4ae90","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
