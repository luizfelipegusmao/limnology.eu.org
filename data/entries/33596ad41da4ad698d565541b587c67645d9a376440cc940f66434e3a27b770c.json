{"title":"Application of Biochar from Acacia saligna Leaf in the Synthesis of TiO2 Photocatalyst","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1198/v1","date":1721119218000,"content":"The large energy band gap associated with titanium oxide nanoparticle is a limitation to its application as a photo catalyst within the solar spectrum. More than 45% of solar radiation can be utilized at a reduced energy band gap of 〖TiO〗_2. Various structural modifications in 〖TiO〗_2 targeted in optimized photo catalyst application include the enhancement of its support system. Activated carbon supported 〖TiO〗_2 nanoparticle may produce the desired reduction in the energy band gap, reduce electron recombination and consequently enhance its photocatalytic activity in the visible region of electromagnetic spectrum. In the current investigation, an activated carbon made from the leaves of an invasive plant (Acacia Saligna) was applied as a support in the synthesis (hydrothermal process) of 〖TiO〗_2 nanoparticle. The determination of energy band-gap of 〖TiO〗_2 supported activated carbon using UV-Vis spectrophotometer gave 2.11 eV. Likewise, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM-EDS), Fourier transformer infrared (FTIR), XRD and Brunauer- Emmett-Teller (BET) showed that 〖TiO〗_2was successfully immobilized on the activated carbon’s external surface. The BET results showed that the synthesized 〖TiO〗_2exhibits small hysteresis phenomenon which represent a typical type IV isotherm attributed to mesosoporous material with a low porosity. Meanwhile, these XRD results reveal the presence of mixture of rutile and anatase crystalline phase","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33596ad41da4ad698d565541b587c67645d9a376440cc940f66434e3a27b770c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
