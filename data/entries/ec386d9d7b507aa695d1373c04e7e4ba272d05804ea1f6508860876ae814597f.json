{"title":"Evaluation Singapore’s Sustainability Reporting Alignment with the IFRS S1 Standards","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0236/v1","date":1725367177000,"content":"This study assesses the alignment of Singaporean companies’ sustainability reporting with the newly introduced International Financial Reporting Standard S1, a global framework for sustainability-related financial disclosures. Given Singapore’s role as a major financial hub, understanding the extent to which local companies comply with this standard is critical to promoting transparency and accountability in sustainability practices. The study was conducted in two phases: the first phase was to summarize the timing of different countries’ preparations for the implementation of the IFRS S1 standard, as well as their attitudes. The second phase was a content analysis of the sustainability reports of 70 listed companies. The findings show that while companies are generally proactive in reporting governance, strategy, and metrics, they fall short in risk management disclosure, which is an important requirement of IFRS S1. This gap highlights the challenges companies face in incorporating comprehensive risk management practices into sustainability reporting. This study provides a reference for improving future sustainability reporting and encourages companies to align more closely with IFRS S1 to meet investors’ growing demand for transparent and standardized sustainability disclosures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec386d9d7b507aa695d1373c04e7e4ba272d05804ea1f6508860876ae814597f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
