These hazards have inflicted notable harm on the local population, infrastructure, and agricultural lands, causing substantial environmental repercussions. Given the gravity of this situation, the present research systematically investigates the processes and mechanisms of the genesis of collapse dolines within the study area, employing an integrated approach that combines fieldwork, geological survey, and geophysical techniques. More than thirty collapse dolines were identified, characterized by a prevailing NEâ€“SW orientation and a close alignment with major faults. Field observations provided essential insights into doline composition and susceptibility, with Quaternary formations exhibiting the highest vulnerability, followed by the Plio-quaternary and evaporitic complex formations. The integration of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and Seismic refraction tomography (SRT) techniques yielded further geological understanding. The results highlighted distinct discontinuities in both ERT and SRT profiles, confirming the presence of faults and fractures linked to collapse dolines. The combination of these geophysical findings with lineament analysis from satellite data further revealed a correlation between doline alignments and major faults. Overall, the susceptibility of the Abda region to collapse events is driven by a combination of geological composition, structural elements, and hydrological patterns. These factors collectively amplify the risk of surface subsidence due to continual erosion and dissolution processes. In light of these insights, it is imperative to address the potential risks posed by collapse dolines through comprehensive mapping and meticulous delineation of the influential factors to ensure the safety and stability of vulnerable regions.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"7bd8ec5485af07bd898f47685ef46bdc7e0a03dfcd8324ec3aee09b4a1cd5393","category":"Environment"}
