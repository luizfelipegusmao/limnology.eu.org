The objective was to know the Ct values related to the incidence and reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 in successive outbreaks, which took place in nursing homes in Castellon (Spain) during 2020-2022, and to test its usefulness as an instrument of epidemic surveillance in nursing homes. Poisson regression and multinomial logistic regression were used in the analysis. We studied four nursing home SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, and the average infection rate, reinfection rate, and case fatality were 72.7%, 19.9%, and 5.5%, respectively; 98.9% of residents were vaccinated with three doses of a mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Ct values for first infections and reinfections were 27.1±6.6 and 31.9±5.4 (p = 0.000).
