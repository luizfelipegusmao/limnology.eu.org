{"title":"Wetlands in Majuli: Exploring Culture-Environment Nexus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0293/v1","date":1717636254000,"content":"Wetlands play a crucial role not only in providing ecological services but also in enriching the cultural and spiritual life of human society. Despite this, their cultural values have often been overlooked. The formal recognition of cultural values began with the Ramsar Convention in the 1970s, which acknowledged wetlands as resources of great economic, cultural, scientific, and recreational value. The wetlands of Majuli are of profound cultural and socio-cultural importance, particularly in terms of religious and spiritual significance, as well as recreational value. This study examines the cultural services provided by the wetland ecosystem of Majuli, focusing on its significance in the local human-environment nexus. Utilizing a qualitative approach with quantitative aspects, data was collected from primary sources through observation, interviews, and group discussions, along with secondary sources such as books, journals, and web portals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de9357fdae6a36f61c131cd3125a13831f4f9f7bb51c5de3c082443dac203758","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
