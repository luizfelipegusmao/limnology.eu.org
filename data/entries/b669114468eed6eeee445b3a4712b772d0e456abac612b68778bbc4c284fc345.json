Electric-field control of topologically-protected magnetic skyrmions allows low-current reading and writing of stable, switchable bits. The stability granted skyrmions by their non-trivial topology is guaranteed in pristine substrates, but a skyrmion in any real device will interact with crystalline defects and interfaces. Skyrmion ordering behavior [<a href=\"#ozae044.755-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.755-B2\">2</a>] and skyrmion behavior in a finite-sized substrate [<a href=\"#ozae044.755-B3\">3</a>] have been studied in-depth, but skyrmion interactions with crystalline defects and interfaces remain uncharacterized.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b669114468eed6eeee445b3a4712b772d0e456abac612b68778bbc4c284fc345","category":"Environment"}
