{"title":"Antifungal and Antibacterial Activity of Lathyrus Aphaca L. Mediated Green Synthesized CdS Nanoparticles and their Characterization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0555/v1","date":1710144128000,"content":"Cadmium Sulfide nanoparticle (CdS-LA hybrid nanoparticles) was synthesized here by a green approach using the precursor cadmium acetate and sodium sulphide along with the extract of a plant Lathyrus aphaca L. containing the phytochemicals which were responsible for surface modification of nanoparticles. The nanoparticle was used to evaluate their inhibition potential against species of bacteria and fungi. The nanoparticles were characterized by XRD which demonstrates the hexagonal crystal structure. SEM confirms the homogenous surface appearance of the CdS-LA hybrid crystalline structure. EDX analysis confirms surface modification of nanoparticles by phytochemicals. FTIR confirmed the Cd-S linkage laterally with the related functional groups and the presence of metabolites on the surface of nanoparticles. The UV-visible spectroscopy confirmed the peak at the characteristic wavelength range but a slight shift occurred in the peak of the CdS nanoparticles due to the presence of the phytochemicals. This study particularly provides an environment-friendly strategy to synthesize the CdS nanoparticles capped by Lathyrus Aphaca L. extract that are biologically active due to the mediation of the plant extract. CdS-LA hybrid nanoparticles have shown inhibition potential against various species of bacteria and fungi and realize the biological importance of the green synthesis of nanoparticles especially mediated with the plant extract.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17d398339c1a4f8413561ac75af3f05170565bd98c46c17ce7e8420cbf38cb5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
