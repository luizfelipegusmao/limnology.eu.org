Findings highlight the strategic alignment between HRM and SCM as crucial for optimizing supply chain performance and responsiveness. Effective talent management strategies, such as recruitment, development, and succession planning, emerged as critical factors in ensuring operational stability and innovation within supply chains. Training programs were identified as instrumental in equipping employees with the necessary skills to navigate technological advancements and market complexities, fostering collaboration and enhancing decision-making capabilities. Leadership development initiatives were also found to be pivotal in promoting organizational effectiveness and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. The study further underscores the role of HRM in cultivating a collaborative and inclusive organizational culture that enhances communication, trust, and teamwork among supply chain stakeholders. Additionally, the integration of digital technologies and sustainability considerations emerged as transformative trends shaping modern supply chains, with HRM practices playing a crucial role in facilitating technological adoption and promoting environmentally responsible practices. Addressing challenges such as resource constraints, regulatory compliance, economic uncertainties, and global supply chain complexities remains crucial for organizations aiming to optimize HRM practices and achieve sustainable supply chain performance. Overall, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of how HRM can drive innovation, collaboration, and resilience within supply chains, positioning organizations for long-term success and growth.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0937c6607be9a11715579b0f131635d62f14d2365db8c551580c1ba47fe82754","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
