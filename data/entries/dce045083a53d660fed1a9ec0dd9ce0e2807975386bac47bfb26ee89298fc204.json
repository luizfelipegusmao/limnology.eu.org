{"title":"New Strategies in the Control of Graves&rsquo; Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0001/v1","date":1714523435000,"content":"Graves' disease (GD) is an autoimmune disorder in which Thyrotropin Receptor Antibodies (TRAb) continuously stimulate thyroid receptors, leading to excessive production of thyroid hormones. TRAb also affect the orbital tissues, causing Graves' ophthalmopathy. Treatment to control Graves' disease consists of antithyroid drugs, radioiodine and thyroidectomy, and through such treatments, TRAb is reduced and the disease is alleviated. The mechanism by which TRAb, which play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Gravesâ€™ disease, decreases after GD treatment is still unknown. This paper presents a theoretical mechanism of how GD patients maintain a vicious cycle and how GD treatment can reduce the TRAb levels and breaks the cycle using stress-based ideas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dce045083a53d660fed1a9ec0dd9ce0e2807975386bac47bfb26ee89298fc204","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
