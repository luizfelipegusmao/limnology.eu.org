{"title":"Advancing jasmine tea production: YOLOv7‐based real‐time jasmine flower detection","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13752?af=R","date":1721456059000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>To produce jasmine tea of excellent quality, it is crucial to select jasmine flowers at their optimal growth stage during harvesting. However, achieving this goal remains a challenge due to environmental and manual factors. This study addresses this issue by classifying different jasmine flowers based on visual attributes using the YOLOv7 algorithm, one of the most advanced algorithms in convolutional neural networks.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The mean average precision (mAP value) for detecting jasmine flowers using this model is 0.948, and the accuracy for five different degrees of openness of jasmine flowers, namely small buds, buds, half-open, full-open and wiltered, is 87.7%, 90.3%, 89%, 93.9% and 86.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, other ways of processing the images in the dataset, such as blurring and changing the brightness, also increased the credibility of the algorithm.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This study shows that it is feasible to use deep learning algorithms for distinguishing jasmine flowers at different growth stages. This study can provide a reference for jasmine production estimation and for the development of intelligent and precise flower-picking applications to reduce flower waste and production costs. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Hanlin Zhou, \nJianlong Luo, \nQiuping Ye, \nWenjun Leng, \nJingfeng Qin, \nJing Lin, \nXiaoyu Xie, \nYilan Sun, \nShiguo Huang, \nJie Pang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"dea40373f27cdbe6baff24188237e6726f24ad7d15fa272552839f7f81782f5a","category":"Environment"}
