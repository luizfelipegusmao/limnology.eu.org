{"title":"A revision of the higher latitude periwinkle species Laevilitorina caliginosa sensu lato","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlad171/7441982?rss=1","date":1700611200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The marine gastropod genus <span>Laevilitorina</span> is exclusive to the Southern Hemisphere, with 21 species from southern South America, Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, and sub-Antarctic Islands. We present a comprehensive revision of <span>Laevilitorina</span>, using molecular and morphological analyses, to address formally the interspecific divergences within the nominal taxon <span>Laevilitorina caliginosa s.l</span>. We confirm the validity of <span>L. caliginosa</span> and <span>Laevilitorina venusta</span>, and we demonstrate that specimens from the Strait of Magellan and Hornos Island constitute four new species here described: <span>Laevilitorina magellanica</span> sp. nov., <span>Laevilitorina pepita</span> sp. nov., <span>Laevilitorina fueguina</span> sp. nov., and <span>Laevilitorina hicana</span> sp. nov. All six species are clearly distinguishable genetically, morphologically, and through radular tooth shape and configurations. <span>Laevilitorina venusta</span> is broadly distributed across the Antarctic Peninsula, South Georgia, and sub-Antarctic Islands (Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen, and Macquarie), whereas <span>L. caliginosa s.s.</span> appears geographically restricted to Cape Horn, the Falkland/Malvinas Islands, and South Georgia. The identification of populations from Macquarie Island as <span>L. caliginosa</span> is dubious; we suggest that these records are likely to pertain to <span>L. venusta</span>. This detailed revision of <span>Laevilitorina</span>, whereby hidden diversity was detected, significantly enriches our knowledge of the evolutionary history of this group.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"29b7a15f14f597ab7d961c6ef76b7a67628513a699467b73c7288c9544f92dbd","category":"Environment"}
