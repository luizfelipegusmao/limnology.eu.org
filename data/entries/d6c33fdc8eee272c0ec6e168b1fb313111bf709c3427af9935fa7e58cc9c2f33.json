{"title":"Insights into Grain Boundary Junctions and Advances in the TOMO Project","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.039/7719404?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>This abstract introduces a two-part presentation that first explores the remarkable potential of Atom Probe Tomography (APT) for uncovering secondary phase nucleation at high-order grain boundary junctions. The second segment will provide an update on the advancements and insights from the Project TOMO. The ability to resolve and chemically identify distinct atoms within structural defects, such as those present at grain boundaries (GBs), could significantly improve our comprehension of the relationship between the structure and properties of materials. This is particularly relevant in instances of oxidation, where the diffusion of cationic and anionic species across the oxide scale plays a crucial role during the growth of oxides. This understanding becomes even more vital in the context of well-nucleated (completely covered) polycrystalline oxide scales, which develop swiftly following transient oxidation on the surfaces of commercial alloys subjected to high temperatures. The size of oxide nuclei may greatly vary, influenced by factors such as the alloy's composition, the oxygen partial pressure available, the composition of the gas, and the temperature. Notably, in a steam atmosphere, especially within an H<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O environment, oxide grain sizes are observed to be significantly finer, typically ranging from 10 to 100 nm [<a href=\"#ozae044.039-B1\">1</a>]. This atmospheric condition is commonly encountered by commercial alloys across various industrial applications, including solid oxide fuel cells, coal gasification, and pre-oxidation in H<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O environments for the selective oxidation of high-temperature alloys prior to their use in the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons. Therefore, comprehending chemical segregation at structural defects within nanosized oxide grains is essential for clarifying the mechanisms of oxidation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d6c33fdc8eee272c0ec6e168b1fb313111bf709c3427af9935fa7e58cc9c2f33","category":"Environment"}
