{"title":"Invasive Thyroid Aspergillosis on 18FDG-PET/Ct: When Filaments Are Lost along the Way","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0559/v1","date":1718013968000,"content":"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) represents a common form of fungal infection caused by various species of Aspergillus that most frequently affect immunocompromised patients. Typically, this disease occurs preferentially in high-risk groups including patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), leukemia, autoimmune diseases, and organ transplant patients undergoing medical immunosuppression. Considered the second most common cause of op-portunistic fungal infection in humans after Candida albicans, this pathogen predominantly affects the lungs, but may also spread by hematogenous route to various organs and have a heterogenous presentation. Owing to its high iodine levels, high perfusion, and enclosed capsule, the thyroid gland is considered to have a lower susceptibility to microbial invasion and it is fairly uncommon to find associated infectious nodules. In metabolic imaging, 18F-FDG-PET/CT has become increasingly useful for detecting a wide range of infectious and inflammatory diseases and is already the gold standard for certain indications. According to the literature, no studies of hypermetabolic nodular thyroid aspergillosis on 18F-FDG-PET/CT confirmed on histology have yet been reported. Here, we report the first case of a patient with a heterogeneous presentation of IA and the presence of a hypermetabolic nodule in the thyroid with a surprising result.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"596c915efa6aec82cc81cca8e037795c2d21d7bafe9f38c67cf4cbc66122f4aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
