{"title":"3D Light-Direction Sensor Based on Segmented Concentric Nanorings Combined with Deep Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0067/v1","date":1725256564000,"content":"High-precision, ultra-thin angular detectable imaging upon a single pixel holds significant promise for light field detection and reconstruction, thereby catalyzing advancements in machine vision and interaction technology. Traditional light-direction angle sensors relying on optical components like gratings and lenses face inherent constraints from diffraction limits in achieving device miniaturization. Recently, angle sensors via coupled double nanowires have demonstrated prowess in attaining high-precision angle perception of incident light at sub-wavelength device scales, which may herald a novel design paradigm for ultra-compact angle sensors. However, the current approach to measure the three-dimensional (3D) incident light direction is unstable. In this paper, we propose a flexible segmented concentric nanorings structure capable of discerning the 3D light-direction based on its sensitivity character to both elevation (θ) and azimuth (ϕ) angles at a micrometer device scale. Through deep learning (DL) analysis and prediction, our simulations reveal that for angle scanning with a step size of 1o, the device can still achieve a detection range of 0∼360o for azimuth and 45o∼90o for elevation, with an average accuracy of 0.19o, and DL can further solve some data aliasing problems to expand the sensing range. Our design broadens the angle sensing dimension based on mutual resonance coupling among nanorings segments, and through waveguide implementation or sensor array arrangements, the detection range can be flexibly adjusted to accommodate diverse application scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0d256f61925940fc05c0670d6bb4df3502857030fbf9543ebdbb94f403ea5ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
