{"title":"Removal of Inorganic and Organic Pollutants from Liquid Phase by Membrane Based on Carbonaceous Materials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0868/v1","date":1715610490000,"content":"The present work reports the effective method for removal of inorganic and organic pollutants using membranes based on different carbonaceous materials. The membranes were prepared based on cellulose acetate (18 wt. %), polyvinylpyrrolidone as a pore generating agent (2 wt. %) and activated carbon (1 wt.%). Activated carbons were developed from residues after extraction of mushroom Inonotus obliguus using microwave radiation. It has been shown that addition of activated carbon the physical (porosity, equilibrium water content and permeability) and chemical (content of the surface oxygen group) properties of the membranes. The addition of carbon material has a positive effect on the removal of copper ions from their aqueous solutions by the cellulose-carbon composites obtained. Moreover, the membranes were proved to be more effective in removal of copper ions than iron ones and phenol. The membranes were found to show higher effectiveness in copper removal from a solution of the initial concentration 800 mg/L. The most efficient in copper ions removal was the membrane containing urea-enriched activated carbon.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"381b574f1ae7fc25f5e2cca9caf4aa82ffb145922d60409d805c700bbf65c24c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
