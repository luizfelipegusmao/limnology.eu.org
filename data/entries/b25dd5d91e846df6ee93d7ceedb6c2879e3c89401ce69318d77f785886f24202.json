{"title":"Diphenylamino-Modified Neutral Pt(II) Complexes: Their Aggregation-Induced Phosphorescent Emission and Picric Acid Sensing Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0745/v1","date":1723432832000,"content":"Three neutral Pt(II) complexes with diphenylamino-modified 2-phenylpyridine derivatives as cy- clometalating ligands and acetylacetone as the ancillary ligand exhibit aggregation-induced phosphorescent emission (AIPE) properties in THF/H2O. The crystal structures of the complexes highlight the contributions of non-covalent Pt···Pt interactions and hydrogen bonds to the AIPE properties. These AIPE-active Pt(II) complexes 1-3 have been successfully applied to detect picric acid (PA) in aqueous media, affording the lowest limit of detection at 70 nM. Furthermore, three Pt(II) complexes are able to detect PA in common water samples. The quenching of luminescence in the detection can be attributed to photo-induced electron transfer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b25dd5d91e846df6ee93d7ceedb6c2879e3c89401ce69318d77f785886f24202","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
