{"title":"Time Trend and Associated Factors Involving Accidents with Cyclists","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0205/v1","date":1725341726000,"content":"Transportation accidents in Brazil rank as the second leading cause of hospitalizations due to external causes, significantly impacting the organization of the healthcare system.. While all road users are at risk, pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable. Although governments and societies advocate for increased bicycling as a sustainable urban transportation option, the uneven accessibility of cycling infrastructure poses accident risks. Addressing the gap in research on this issue, this study investigates the trends and contributing factors of bicycle traffic accidents in the metropolitan area of Maringá, Paraná, Brazil. This ecological time series study analyzed 848 pre-hospital care records from SAMU and SIATE of Maringá-PR, spanning January 2010 to December 2019. The results reveal a rise in accident frequency over the study period, with the majority of victims being males aged 11 to 20 years. Accidents predominantly occurred between noon and 8:00 p.m., with peak occurrences on Fridays and Saturdays. Serious accidents were most frequent on Tuesdays and Fridays. These findings align with existing literature and underscore the importance of incorporating data from SIATE and SAMU into urban accident prevention strategies. Additionally, the study highlights the need for further research on this topic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4541d6cf19f591d1c814b3e35fefaa8036bf2130307fcdcecd8d1bdfcce1c55","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
