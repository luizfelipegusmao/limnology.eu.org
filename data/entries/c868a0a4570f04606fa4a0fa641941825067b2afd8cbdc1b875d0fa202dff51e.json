{"title":"Integration of Solar Energy and Agriculture: Agrivoltaic Systems for Sustainable Food and Energy Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0025/v1","date":1722511670000,"content":"The integration of solar energy systems with agricultural practices, known as agrivoltaic systems, presents a promising solution for advancing sustainable food and energy production. This approach involves installing photovoltaic panels on agricultural lands, which allows for simultaneous crop cultivation and energy generation. Agrivoltaic systems offer a dual benefit: they enhance land use efficiency by utilizing the same area for both solar power generation and crop production, and they contribute to sustainable energy transitions. This abstract explores the benefits and challenges associated with agrivoltaic systems. Key advantages include increased land productivity, reduction in water usage due to shading effects, and potential economic gains from dual income streams. Furthermore, these systems can mitigate land use conflicts by combining food production with renewable energy generation. However, there are challenges to address, including the potential for decreased crop yields under solar panels, the need for appropriate system design to balance energy generation and agricultural needs, and the economic feasibility of initial investment and maintenance. The integration of agrivoltaic systems represents a critical step toward achieving sustainable development goals by promoting environmental stewardship and resource efficiency. Future research and advancements in technology are essential to optimize system performance and maximize benefits for both agriculture and energy sectors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c868a0a4570f04606fa4a0fa641941825067b2afd8cbdc1b875d0fa202dff51e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
