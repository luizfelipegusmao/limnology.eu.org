{"title":"Consumer Understanding and Perceptions of Front-of-Pack Nutrition Labelling of Foods and Non-Alcoholic Beverages in Kenya; a Qualitative Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1283/v1","date":1729076747000,"content":"Background: Front-of-package labelling (FoPL) is shown to be effective in assisting consumers make healthier food choices. Several countries are implementing various types of FoPL systems. \nObjective: This study explored consumers’ perceptions and understanding of three different FoPLs and their insights into features that could influence the effectiveness of the symbols in Kenya\nMethods: A qualitative study was conducted in four Counties in Kenya; Nairobi, Mombasa, Garissa, and Kisumu. Data was collected through twelve focus group discussions with 137 adults drawn from diverse socio-demographic and socio-economic backgrounds. Three FoPLs were assessed: Red and Green (RG) Octagon, Red and Green Octagon with icons and text (RGI), and the Black Octagon Warning label (WL). The FGDs explored participants’ perceptions of the symbols’ visibility and memorability, their understanding, potential effectiveness, and cultural appropriateness. Printed images displaying four different commonly consumed products bearing specific FoPLs were used during data collection. Data was analyzed thematically and organized using NVivo version 14.0.\nResults: Results showed that Kenyan consumers had varied perceptions about the proposed FoPL symbols. Majority of the participants found the black Octagon WL to be most visible and memorable due to its good blend of black and white colours. Although the RG octagon symbol and RGI octagon symbols were also found to be eye-catching due to their bright colours, it emerged that the different colours often confused some participants on their meaning. Most participants understood the WL compared to the RG and RGI because they found the additional text more educative. Generally, the WL was preferred as the symbol most likely to influence consumer purchase behaviours and food consumption. All the three FoPLs tested were found to be culturally appropriate.\nConclusions: The Black Octagon Warning Label is the most easily visible and understood among the three FoPLs tested and has the potential to influence purchase and consumption behaviours among Kenyan consumers. Although the RG and RGI symbols are visually appealing to many, confusion related to different colours could affect their effectiveness. Consumers need to be educated on the use of FoPLs to ensure they discourage the purchase and consumption of unhealthy foods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2526f0903bec9f78cb55154fd5769d1e4413614deb65428ecc08da5ef39bfd2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
