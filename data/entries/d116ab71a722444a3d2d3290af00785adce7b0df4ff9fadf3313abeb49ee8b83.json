{"title":"The influence of traceability label trust on consumers’ traceability pork purchasing behavior: Based on the moderating effect of food safety identification","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306041","date":1719583200000,"content":"<p>by Zengjin Liu, Zhuo Yu, Jing Zhao, Xibing Han, Caixia Li, Ning Geng, Meilian Yu</p>\r\n\r\nBased on 908 consumer questionnaire data from 15 urban areas in Shanghai, we use the binary logit model to empirically analyze the impact of traceability label trust on consumers’ traceable pork purchase behavior and the moderating effect of food safety identification. After constructing the theoretical analysis framework, this paper verifies it from the two aspects of statistical analysis and econometric analysis and tests the robustness of the final results. The results show that: first, traceability label trust has a significant positive impact on consumers’ traceability pork behavior. Second, food safety identification can significantly strengthen and promote this process. Third, consumers’ purchasing behavior is significantly positively affected by traceable pork consumption scenarios and price labels, but the permanent elderly in the composition of family members significantly negative impact on it. Therefore, we put forward relevant policy suggestions, such as strengthening the knowledge popularization and publicity based on the advantageous commodity attributes of traceable pork, carrying out food safety knowledge popularization education, and enhancing consumers’ risk perception and food safety identification ability.","author":"Zengjin Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d116ab71a722444a3d2d3290af00785adce7b0df4ff9fadf3313abeb49ee8b83","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
