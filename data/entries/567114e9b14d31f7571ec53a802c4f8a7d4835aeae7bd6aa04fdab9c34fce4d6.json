{"title":"Beyond the P-Value: The Significance of Inconclusive Results and the Role of the IIRF in Advancing Scientific Inquiry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1537/v1","date":1721316501000,"content":"In scientific research, there is a noticeable lack of specific studies focused on inconclusive results, in contrast to the abundance of studies dedicated to conclusive or positive outcomes. While conclusive results offer definitive answers, inconclusive results, often viewed less favorably, do not provide such clarity. However, they play a vital role in the scientific process by identifying gaps and inspiring future research. This paper introduces the pioneering Integrated Inconclusive Results Framework, a significant development that addresses the challenges associated with inconclusive results. The Framework aims to shift the perception of inconclusive results from setbacks to crucial components of scientific progress, ultimately enhancing scientific inquiry's rigor, transparency, and overall quality. The paper delves into the historical treatment of inconclusive results, causes, and strategies for handling them, offering insights into utilizing them to inspire and guide future research, thereby strengthening the scientific community and instilling confidence and reassurance in the direction of scientific research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"567114e9b14d31f7571ec53a802c4f8a7d4835aeae7bd6aa04fdab9c34fce4d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
