{"title":"Hydrogen Production from Biomass on an Industrial Scale","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0775/v1","date":1725953727000,"content":"Hydrogen is increasingly recognized as a crucial element in the shift toward sustainable energy systems due to its high energy density and minimal environmental impact. Biomass, a renewable material derived from plants and animals, presents a promising feedstock for hydrogen production, offering both environmental and economic benefits. This paper examines diverse biomass resources for hydrogen production, including agricultural and forest residues, dedicated energy crops, and organic waste. It reviews key technologies for converting biomass to hydrogen, categorized into thermochemical, biochemical, and hybrid processes. Thermochemical methods like gasification and pyrolysis are discussed for their ability to handle varied feedstocks and produce high-purity hydrogen. Biochemical processes, such as anaerobic digestion and dark fermentation, are analyzed for their efficiency and lower operational costs. Hybrid approaches, which integrate multiple technologies, are explored for their potential to enhance system performance. Industrial applications of biomass-derived hydrogen are highlighted, including its use in transportation, power generation, the chemical industry, and heating. Future perspectives emphasize the need for advanced catalysts, process integration, sustainable feedstock sourcing, and supportive policies to drive commercial viability. The paper concludes by highlighting biomassâ€™s significant promise in advancing sustainable energy systems and achieving global energy security and environmental goals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70f47334624490ad1f371a6fe11c9144daf982b4fac627bebc7890782e2ebf06","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
