In the medical field, CR can significantly aid doctors in accurate diagnosis and preoperative planning. However, doctors require efficient real-time rendering when using CR, which presents a challenge due to the substantial computing resources demanded by CRâ€™s ray tracing and global illumination models. Precomputed lighting can enhance the efficiency of real-time rendering by freezing certain scene variables. Typically, precomputed methods freeze geometry and materials. However, since the physical rendering of medical images relies on volume data rendering of transfer functions, the CR algorithm cannot utilize precomputed methods directly. To improve the rendering efficiency of the CR algorithm, we propose a precomputed low-frequency lighting method. By simulating the lighting pattern of shadowless surgical lamps, we adopt a spherical distribution of multiple light sources, with each source capable of illuminating the entire volume of data. Under the influence of these large-area multi-light sources, the precomputed lighting adheres to physical principles, resulting in shadow-free and uniformly distributed illumination. We integrated this precomputed method into the ray-casting algorithm, creating an accelerated CR algorithm that achieves more than twice the rendering efficiency of traditional CR rendering.","author":"Yuliang Yuan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"30ebb740a270e0458c54a0800ef696fc2030a6c1187ead5292ae1250467ff7c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
