{"title":"Alcohol Consumption and Cancer Risk: Two Sample Mendelian Randomization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2438/v1","date":1722323530000,"content":"Although numerous observational studies reported the association between alcohol consumption and cancer, insufficient studies have estimated the causality. Our study evaluated the causal relationship between various type of cancer according to the frequency of drinking and the amount of alcohol consumed. The research data were obtained from the publicly available MR-Base platform. The frequency and amount of drinking were selected as exposure, and 14 cancer types were selected as the outcome. Two-sample summary data Mendelian randomization (2SMR) was conducted to examine the causality between alcohol consumption and cancer type. Additionally, for cancers suspected of pleiotropy, outliers were removed and re-analyzed through radial MR. MR results by Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method were different before and after removing outliers. The biggest differences were found in esophageal cancer and biliary tract cancer. For esophageal cancer, after removing outliers (rs13102973, rs540606, rs650558), the OR (95% CI) was 3.44 (1.19-9.89), which was statistically significant (p=0.02172). Even in biliary tract cancer, after removing outliers (rs13231886, rs58905411), the OR (95% CI) was 3.86 (0.89-16.859), which was statistically significant at the borderline. (p=0.07223). The strongest association was shown in esophageal cancer. For other cancers, the evidence was not sufficient to draw conclusions. More research is needed to understand the causality between drinking and cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30a05de2a86f04d19a373575f736135cb0261e0e7cb51bb3b2ca277e06d0cf26","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
