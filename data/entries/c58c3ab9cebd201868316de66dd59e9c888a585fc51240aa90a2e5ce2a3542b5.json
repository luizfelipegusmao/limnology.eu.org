{"title":"Reliability Optimization Design of Constrained Metamorphic Mechanism Based on the Augmented Assur Groups","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1668/v1","date":1719223434000,"content":"In order to obtain stable and reliable configuration transformation ability, reliability optimization design is regarded as an effective way to reduce the probability of kinematic function failure for the constrained metamorphic mechanism. Based on the structural composition principle of multi-configuration source metamorphic mechanism that can operate in an under-actuated state, the modularized calculation methods are established for the force analysis of augmented Assur groups including metamorphic kinematic joints. According to the equivalent resistance gradient model of metamorphic mechanisms, with considering the uncertainties in the link dimensions, masses, and compliance parameters et al, a probabilistic evaluation method for describing the configuration transformation ability of the constrained metamorphic mechanism is established. Based on reliability evaluation and reliability sensitivity analysis, a reliability optimization design method for improving the configuration transformation ability is proposed, and then the optimization design is carried out for tolerances of random variables focusing on those structural parameters with higher reliability sensitivity, so that the optimized results can satisfy the requirements of both reliability and economic simultaneously. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the illustration of a paper folding metamorphic mechanism. The research provides the foundation of reliability design of metamorphic mechanisms to obtain the high-probability repeated execution ability of configuration transformation, it also has theoretical and practical significance to promote the engineering application of metamorphic mechanisms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c58c3ab9cebd201868316de66dd59e9c888a585fc51240aa90a2e5ce2a3542b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
