It is worth noting that modular units typically incur higher costs compared to field erected units due to the additional requirements of structural steel and robustness for transportation purposes.Nevertheless, the increased cost of modularization can often be balanced by conducting the work at the fabrication site instead of on-field construction. This approach reduces the overall project cost by minimizing field construction expenses and shortening the construction schedule. The objective of this paper is to assess and compare LNG modularization options for a newly established LNG facility in comparison to a conventional stick-built plant used as the base case.:The paper delves into various topics related to LNG plant construction, such as the development of modular units, a comprehensive comparison of different options, evaluation of construction schedules and manpower requirements, logistics considerations, and a recommended approach for design and construction. The cost estimates and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) schedules are meticulously compared for each option. Additionally, an inshore/near shore gravity base structure (GBS) option is included for further comparison. It is crucial to emphasize that establishing general costs is not possible as each project is distinct and requires individual study and analysis.:Each project has unique characteristics, resulting in varying shapes of cost curves and break-even points. The outcomes of the feasibility evaluation play a crucial role in determining the extent to which the modular approach to construction is advantageous for the specific project at hand. The evaluation takes into consideration multiple factors to determine the potential benefits of adopting a modular construction approach, allowing decision-makers to make informed choices regarding the project's construction methodology","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e11fcc4e9d346e6e961174e34c56226ac896b1a9da684947c15074edf2d57b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
