How to help preterm infants achieve complete oral feeding as soon as possible has become an important issue in the management of preterm infants. Non-nutritive sucking (NNS), as a useful oral stimulation, can improve the effect of oral feeding in preterm infants. This review aimed to explore the effect of NNS on oral feeding progression through a meta-analysis.</p> Methods <p>We systematically searched PubMed, CINHAL, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane databases, China’s National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang and VIP database from inception to January 20, 2024. Search terms included ’non-nutritive sucking’ ’oral feeding’ and ’premature.’ Eligibility criteria involved randomized controlled studies in English or Chinese. Studies were excluded if they were reviews, case reports, or observational studies from which valid data could not be extracted or outcome indicators were poorly defined. The meta-analysis will utilize Review Manager 5.3 software, employing either random-effects or fixed-effects models based on observed heterogeneity. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous data, and estimated pooled odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous data. Sensitivity and publication bias analyses were conducted to ensure robust and reliable findings. We evaluated the methodological quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) utilizing the assessment tool provided by the Cochrane Collaboration.</p> Results <p>A total of 23 randomized controlled trials with 1461 preterm infants were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed that NNS significantly shortened time taken to achieve exclusive oral feeding (MD = -5.37,95%CI = -7.48 to-3.26, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001), length of hospital stay(MD = -4.92, 95% CI = -6.76 to -3.09, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001), time to start oral feeding(MD = -1.41, 95% CI = -2.36 to -0.45, <i>p</i> = 0.004), time to return to birth weight(MD = -1.72, 95% CI = -2.54 to -0.91, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001). Compared to the NNS group, the control group had significant weight gain in preterm infants, including weight of discharge (MD = -61.10, 95% CI = -94.97 to -27.23, <i>p</i> = 0.0004), weight at full oral feeding (MD = -86.21, 95% CI = -134.37 to -38.05, <i>p</i> = 0.0005). In addition, NNS reduced the incidence of feeding intolerance (OR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.14 to 0.35, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001) in preterm infants.</p> Conclusion <p>NNS improves oral feeding outcomes in preterm infants and reduces the time to reach full oral feeding and hospitalization length. However, this study was limited by the relatively small sample size of included studies and did not account for potential confounding factors. There was some heterogeneity and bias between studies. More studies are needed in the future to validate the effects on weight gain and growth in preterm infants. Nevertheless, our meta-analysis provides valuable insights, updating existing evidence on NNS for improving oral feeding in preterm infants and promoting evidence-based feeding practices in this population.</p>","author":"Shuliang Zhao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4fea3c5334fc18c68e9a959d734a14c205f0b753ab5b727bd7cd4b0e32453ebb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
