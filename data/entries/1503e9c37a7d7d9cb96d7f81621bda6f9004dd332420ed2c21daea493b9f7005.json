{"title":"Arabinosylation of cell wall extensin is required for the directional response to salinity in roots","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3328/7660951?rss=1","date":1714521600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Soil salinity is a major contributor to crop yield losses. To improve our understanding of root responses to salinity, we developed and exploited a real-time salt-induced tilting assay. This assay follows root growth upon both gravitropic and salt challenges, revealing that root bending upon tilting is modulated by Na<sup>+</sup> ions, but not by osmotic stress. Next, we measured this salt-specific response in 345 natural Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) accessions and discovered a genetic locus, encoding the cell wall-modifying enzyme EXTENSIN ARABINOSE DEFICIENT TRANSFERASE (ExAD) that is associated with root bending in the presence of NaCl (hereafter salt). Extensins are a class of structural cell wall glycoproteins known as hydroxyproline (Hyp)-rich glycoproteins, which are posttranslationally modified by <span>O</span>-glycosylation, mostly involving Hyp-arabinosylation. We show that salt-induced ExAD-dependent Hyp-arabinosylation influences root bending responses and cell wall thickness. Roots of <span>exad1</span> mutant seedlings, which lack Hyp-arabinosylation of extensin, displayed increased thickness of root epidermal cell walls and greater cell wall porosity. They also showed altered gravitropic root bending in salt conditions and a reduced salt-avoidance response. Our results suggest that extensin modification via Hyp-arabinosylation is a unique salt-specific cellular process required for the directional response of roots exposed to salinity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"1503e9c37a7d7d9cb96d7f81621bda6f9004dd332420ed2c21daea493b9f7005","category":"Environment"}
