{"title":"GcMAF in Radiation Therapy: Identification and Molecular Characterization of the Human GcMAF Receptor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0455/v2","date":1718950263000,"content":"Gc protein-derived Macrophage Activating Factor (GcMAF), a powerful immunostimulant endowed with anti-cancer and anti-angiogenetic activities, offers significant advantages when combined with radiation therapy. A stronger immune response improves the effectiveness of radiation therapy by allowing the body to better eliminate residual cancer cells after treatment. In addition, by boosting the immune system, GcMAF mitigates some of the immunosuppressive side effects of radiation therapy, leading to faster recovery. In order to fully exploit the potential of GcMAF in cancer therapy, knowledge of the molecular interactions with its receptor is essential. This study proposes the first extracellular domain (residues 1-34) of the CCR1 protein as the GcMAF receptor. The CCR1 gene, expressed in monocytes and 168 other cell types or tissues, encodes this transmembrane protein. Electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, along with hydrogen bonds mediate the molecular interactions between the TPT420-GalNAcELAK (or TPK420ELAK) sequences of GcMAF (or Gc2 protein variant) and the TTEDYDTTT sequence of its receptor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70fd1e19b8b89ebc611e4e5cdaafc6d4e946dee60c7c2b676413f2983f5fe41c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
