{"title":"Key bacterial groups maintain stream multifunctionality in response to episodic drying","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10400?af=R","date":1716819035000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Microbial biodiversity is fundamental to maintain ecosystem functioning in seasonally variable ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how alterations in water availability caused by episodic drying compromise the ability of stream microbes to maintain multiple functions simultaneously (e.g., primary production and carbon cycling). Using data from 32 streams, we investigated how the phenology of annual drying influences stream sediment microbial biodiversity and their capacity to sustain multifunctionality. Our results showed that stream multifunctionality and most bacteria did not respond to changes in drying phenology. Only two bacterial groups, the drying-resistant Sphingobacteriia and the drying-sensitive Acidobacteria_Gp7, exhibited positive associations with multifunctionality; whereas, bacterial diversity showed a negative correlation with functions. Among these biodiversity aspects, Sphingobacteriia showed the strongest capacity to maintain multifunctionality at low and moderate performance levels. Our findings will help to better understand the mechanisms through which biodiversity sustains the functioning of seasonally variable streams and their responses to global change.</p>","author":"Giulia Gionchetta, \nRebeca Arias‐Real, \nPilar Hurtado, \nHelmut Bürgmann, \nCayetano Gutiérrez‐Cánovas","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Letters: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e3d6bd1d0a248694da65f62e7591c05124a8fbc5456d1cafb66209dfd7ae6238","entryHash":"e8abf17a3ea030259d08c02732d17301a2b564ac3d0753c43205aa537b3f59ba","category":"Environment"}
