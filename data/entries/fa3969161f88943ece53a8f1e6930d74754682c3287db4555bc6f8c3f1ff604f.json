The results of the bending give us the guideline to analyze the axial loads, eccentric loads and the transverse loads that submit elements such as axles, supports and crossbars used in the automotive and aeronautical industries. Obtaining a result of practically isotropy, that is to say that the application of accelerated aging did not modify this property, the Maximum Stress was found at 564.831 MPa and for the yielding stress at 267.5 MPas [<a href=\"#ozae044.256-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fa3969161f88943ece53a8f1e6930d74754682c3287db4555bc6f8c3f1ff604f","category":"Environment"}
