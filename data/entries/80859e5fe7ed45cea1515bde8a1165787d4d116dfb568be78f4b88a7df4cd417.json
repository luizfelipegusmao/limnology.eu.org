{"title":"Corrections of the Distribution of Nuclei Due to Neutron Degeneracy and Their Effects in the R-Process in Neutron Stars - Black Hole Mergers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2539/v1","date":1722427478000,"content":"The r-process is one of the processes that produce heavy elements in the Universe. One of its possible astrophysical sites is the neutron star - black hole (NS-BH) merger. We first show that the neutrons may be degenerate before and during the r-process in these mergers. Previous studies assumed neutrons were non-degenerate and the related rates were calculated under Maxwell-Boltzmann approximations. Hence, we corrected the related rates with neutron degeneracy and put into the network code and calculated with the trajectories of NS-BH mergers. We show that there are differences in the nuclei distributions and leads to big changes in the heat generation and hence the temperature changes during the r-process. The higher temperatures in the r-process lead to higher luminosity of the light curves of these mergers than the one using non-degenerate rates. However, this has little effect on the final abundances.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"80859e5fe7ed45cea1515bde8a1165787d4d116dfb568be78f4b88a7df4cd417","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
