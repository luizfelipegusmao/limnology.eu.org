{"title":"Analyzing the Energy Consumption of Smart Home and Price Prediction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1354/v1","date":1711102871000,"content":"This paper describes a system that is used to gather data from Smart Home sensors measuring energy consumption, analyze and predict future consumption by using machine learning algorithm for prediction. It focuses on the architecture of the system as well as the need for such system to exist in practice â€“ why the consumption should be measured at all and how that measurement can be put to good use for achieving energy efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51d882bf1d58260ce256b1ade97292794d44265a2f06d27e963e878859db68c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
