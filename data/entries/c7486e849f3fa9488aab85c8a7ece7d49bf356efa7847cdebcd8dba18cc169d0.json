{"title":"Use of traditional tools and micro-computed tomography for the taxonomy of carnivorous bivalves from the deep waters of Southwestern Atlantic","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlae118/7796657?rss=1","date":1727654400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In this study, we conduct a morphological integrative analysis, using traditional techniques and micro-computed tomography imaging, on Septibranchia species. Specimens deposited in malacological collections and samples collected aboard the research vessels <span>Puerto Deseado</span> and <span>Austral</span> off Mar del Plata (~36°S), San Jorge Gulf (~46°), and Marine Protected Area Namuncurá/Burdwood Bank area (~54°S), at depths ranging from 200 to 3000 m, are the subjects of this study. Seven species were identified, including <span>Cardiomya cleryana</span> (d’Orbigny, 1846), <span>Cardiomya knudseni</span> (Allen &amp; Morgan, 1981), <span>Lyonsiella</span> cf. <span>fragilis</span> Allen &amp; Turner, 1974, and <span>Cetoconcha spinulosa</span> (Thiele, 1912), previously found in the study area. <span>Cardiomya fragilissima</span> (E. A. Smith, 1885), an Antarctic/sub-Antarctic species, extends its distribution up to 36°S. Two new species, <span>Cetoconcha gigas</span> sp. nov. and <span>Lyonsiella tentaculata</span> sp. nov., are described. A lectotype is designated for <span>Pholadomya adelaidis</span> Hedley, 1916 and a neotype for <span>Sphenia cleryana</span> d’Orbigny, 1846. A detailed description of the morphological characters of each species and genus, along with insights into their geographical and bathymetric distribution, are provided. The micro-computed tomography analysis of <span>Cardiomya cleryana</span>, <span>Cardiomya fragilissima</span>, and <span>Cetoconcha spinulosa</span> contributed to a detailed anatomical inspection and revealed the presence of muscle bundles associated with the anterior portion of the visceral mass in the scanned specimens.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"c7486e849f3fa9488aab85c8a7ece7d49bf356efa7847cdebcd8dba18cc169d0","category":"Environment"}
