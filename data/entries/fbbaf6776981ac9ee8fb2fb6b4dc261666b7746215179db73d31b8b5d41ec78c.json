{"title":"A Mass‐Conserving‐Perceptron for Machine‐Learning‐Based Modeling of Geoscientific Systems","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036461?af=R","date":1713164400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Although decades of effort have been devoted to building <i>Physical-Conceptual</i> (PC) models for predicting the time-series evolution of geoscientific systems, recent work shows that <i>Machine Learning</i> (ML) based <i>Gated Recurrent Neural Network</i> technology can be used to develop models that are much more accurate. However, the difficulty of extracting physical understanding from ML-based models complicates their utility for enhancing scientific knowledge regarding system structure and function. Here, we propose a physically interpretable Mass-Conserving-Perceptron (MCP) as a way to bridge the gap between PC-based and ML-based modeling approaches. The MCP exploits the inherent isomorphism between the directed graph structures underlying both PC models and GRNNs to explicitly represent the mass-conserving nature of physical processes while enabling the functional nature of such processes to be directly learned (in an interpretable manner) from available data using off-the-shelf ML technology. As a proof of concept, we investigate the functional expressivity (capacity) of the MCP, explore its ability to parsimoniously represent the rainfall-runoff (RR) dynamics of the <i>Leaf River Basin</i>, and demonstrate its utility for scientific hypothesis testing. To conclude, we discuss extensions of the concept to enable ML-based physical-conceptual representation of the coupled nature of <i>mass-energy-information flows</i> through geoscientific systems.</p>","author":"Yuan‐Heng Wang, \nHoshin V.
