No comparisons are available between athletes with opposite training adaptations that include a broader spectrum of both proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids, and that take into account skeletal muscle mass. We hypothesized that the levels of the exercise-induced PFAAs concentration are related to the type of training-related metabolic adaptation. We compared highly trained endurance athletes (n = 11) and sprinters (n = 10) aged 20‒35 years who performed incremental exercise until exhaustion. Venous blood was collected before and during the test and 30-min recovery (12 samples). Forty-two PFAAs were assayed using LC-ESI-MS/MS technique. Skeletal muscle mass was estimated using dual X-ray absorptiometry method. Glutamine and alanine were dominant PFAAs throughout the whole exercise and recovery period (~350‒650 μmol∙L<sup>-1</sup>). Total, combined proteinogenic, non-essential, and non-proteinogenic PFAAs levels were significantly higher in endurance athletes than sprinters (ANOVA group effects: p = 0.007, <i>η</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.321; p = 0.011, <i>η</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.294; p = 0.003, <i>η</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.376; p = 0.001, <i>η</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.471, respectively). The exercise response was more pronounced in endurance athletes, especially for non-proteinogenic PFAAs (ANOVA interaction effect: p = 0.038, <i>η</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.123). Significant between-group differences were observed for 19 of 33 PFAAs detected, including 4 essential, 7 non-essential, and 8 non-proteinogenic ones. We demonstrated that the PFAAs response to incremental aerobic exercise is associated with the type of training-related metabolic adaptation. A greater turnover and availability of circulating PFAAs for skeletal muscles and other body tissues is observed in endurance- than in sprint-trained individuals. Non-proteinogenic PFAAs, despite low concentrations, also respond to exercise loads, indicating their important, though less understood role in exercise metabolism. Our study provides additional insight into the exercise-induced physiological response of PFAAs, and may also provide a rationale in discussions regarding dietary amino acid requirements in high-performance athletes with respect to sports specialization.","author":"Krzysztof Kusy","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"66e5141bc8a76d5e1a0517de4f917d72b9b287b13b4d38a2f0fc6c901aee0424","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
