{"title":"Spatial-temporal assessment of future population exposure to compound extreme precipitation-high temperature events across China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307494","date":1723644000000,"content":"<p>by Ke Jin, Yanjuan Wu, Xiaolin Sun, Yanwei Sun, Chao Gao</p>\r\n\r\nGlobal warming has increased the probability of extreme climate events, with compound extreme events having more severe impacts on socioeconomics and the environment than individual extremes. Utilizing the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), we predicted the spatiotemporal variations of compound extreme precipitation-high temperature events in China under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) across two future periods, and analyzed the changes in exposed populations and identified influencing factors. From the result, we can see that, the CMIP6 effectively reproduces precipitation patterns but exhibits biases. The frequency of compound event rises across SSPs, especially under high radiative forcing, with a stronger long-term upward trend. Furthermore, the economically developed areas, notably China’s southeastern coast and North China Plain, will be hotspots for frequent and intense compound extreme events, while other regions will see reduced exposure. Finally, in the long-term future (2070–2100), there is a noteworthy shift in population exposure to compound events, emphasizing the increasing influence of population factors over climate factors. This highlights the growing importance of interactions between population and climate in shaping exposure patterns.","author":"Ke Jin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ce822f77680e11cac39477b1e49be8a247f77ebcfc185e3a599e2b2fb3333e5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
