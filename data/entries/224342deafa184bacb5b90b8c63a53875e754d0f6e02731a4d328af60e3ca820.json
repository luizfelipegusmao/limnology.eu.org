{"title":"Do Molecules Tunnel Through Nanoporous Graphene?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1545/v1","date":1716459006000,"content":"Molecular transport and quantum tunneling of H2 and H2O molecules through nanoporous gra-phene is studied using computational modeling and first principles density functional theory. It is demonstrated that molecules with sufficiently high kinetic energies can tunnel through the na-nopores. It is also demonstrated that molecules can be trapped in front of the nanopore or behind it. These investigations help us learn the behavior of molecules in and around nanopores of gra-phene. They also help us learn fundamentals of molecular tunneling. We believe, nanoporous gra-phene can play important roles for gas separation and nanofiltration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"224342deafa184bacb5b90b8c63a53875e754d0f6e02731a4d328af60e3ca820","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
