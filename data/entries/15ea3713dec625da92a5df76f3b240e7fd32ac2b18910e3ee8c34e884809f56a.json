{"title":"Complete Chloroplast Genome Sequences of Three Cleomaceae Species in China: Comparative and Phylogenetic Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1969/v1","date":1724806578000,"content":"Cleomaceae is an important group that is medicinally and economically important. However, its systematic position has been controversial. In this study, we have obtained three chloroplast genomes sequencing results of Cleomaceae species. The genome sizes ranged from 157,073 bp (Sieruela rutidosperma) to 158,152 bp (Gynandropsis gynandra). These chloroplast genomes have a typical quadripartite formation with a large single-copy (LSC) region (86,422-87,242bp), a small single-copy (SSC) region (18,485-18,548bp), and a pair of inverted repeat (IR) regions (26,083-26,184bp). The chloroplast genomes encoded 131-132 genes, comprising 8 rRNA genes, 37 tRNA genes, and 79-84 protein-coding genes. The overall GC contents of the three chloroplast genomes are almost identical (35.81%-36.02%). The phylogenetic trees concluding 8 Cleomaceae plants were constructed based on ML and BI methods. The results showed that Gynandropsis gynandra and Sieruela rutidosperma were in the same branch, with Corynandra viscosa as their sister. Six hypervariable areas were identified, containing clpP, matK, ndhF, atpH-atpI, atpF-atpH and petN-psbM which could be used in species identification and population genetics studies. This study provides valuable information for further species identification, evolutionary and genetic studies of Cleomaceae in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15ea3713dec625da92a5df76f3b240e7fd32ac2b18910e3ee8c34e884809f56a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
