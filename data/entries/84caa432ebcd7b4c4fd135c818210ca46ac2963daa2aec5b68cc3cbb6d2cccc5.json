{"title":"Novel Insight into the Effect of Balneotherapy on Changes in the Functional State in Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain: Integration of Physical and Mental Healthcare Indicators and Patients&rsquo; Health Perception","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1738/v1","date":1721713201000,"content":"Background: Alarming data indicates that low back pain (LBP) affected around 619 million people globally in 2020, that presenting significant health and economic burden. Importantly, the chronic LBP (cLBP) strongly impairs quality of life and leads to disability and premature retirement thus emphasizing the urgent need for providing deeper insight into the factors that affect treatment outcomes and offer thorough guidance for the assessment and management of this disease. Taking into consideration the rising prevalence of cLBP and knowledge gap referring to the overall health benefits of balneotherapy (BT), the aim of this study was to assess the effects of BT on functional status, quality of life and psychological symptoms in patients with cLBP. Methods: A total 210 patients were recruited and divided into two groups: patients receiving conventional pharmacological therapy (CT) and receiving BT. The effectiveness of the treatment was assessed on the basis of Visual Analog Scale for pain intensity, EuroQol (EQ-5D) for the patientâ€™s self-rated health and Work Ability Index Questionnaire to evaluate functional ability. In order to provide deeper insight into the quality of life and also factors associated with the functional status and mental health affected by BT, we also used the Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire and Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Results: Our findings suggest that BT significantly contributed to reduction of pain, better functionality and disability perception status. Conclusions: Understanding the association between individual perceptions of functionality, emotional and social elements provides basis for providing comprehensive guidelines and recommendations for cLBP management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84caa432ebcd7b4c4fd135c818210ca46ac2963daa2aec5b68cc3cbb6d2cccc5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
