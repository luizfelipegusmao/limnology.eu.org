In-situ EM is a high-end technique to dynamically study the catalysts under reaction condition, which is enabled by Gas cell holder and Liquid cell holder equipped with an electron microscope. The liquid cell holder integrated with biased electrodes are used to study electrocatalysts for CO<sub>2</sub>RR in recent years [<a href=\"#ozae044.809-B1\">1</a>]. This technique allows the observation of catalysts at electrolyte-electrode interface but still suffers from the limited spatial resolution [<a href=\"#ozae044.809-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b8fb55386d1aa96389bac749875015e03521a125023c7fffdf54cab759b0a624","category":"Environment"}
