{"title":"Antioxidant Effects of Aromatic Plant Extracts in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1667/v1","date":1726856402000,"content":"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a class of cognitive and motor disorders that include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and others. They are caused by lesions in cells and tissues of the central nervous system, resulting in corresponding dysfunctions and consequent decline in cognitive and motor functions. Neural tissues are extremely vulnerable to oxidative stress, which plays critical biological roles in NDDs. Aromatic compounds are found extensively in natural plants and have substantial effects of anti-oxidative stress damage, which not only have a wide range of research applications in cosmetics, foods, etc., but are also frequently utilized in the treatment of various central nervous system diseases. This review summarizes the relevant oxidative stress mechanisms in NDDs (AD, PD, HD, and ALS) and reviews aromatic compounds such as polyphenols, terpenoids, and flavonoids that can be used in the management of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as their specific mechanisms of antioxidant action. This review will serve as a reference for future experimental studies on neurodegenerative illnesses while also offering fresh insights into clinical therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c0a951f79e5dc875f64e109ac4d96926fa482ffb5bf24714813b07a1ce314fb5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
