{"title":"Various Mixtures of Carbon Negative Replacements of Gasoline and Diesel Fuel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1371/v1","date":1726728623000,"content":"We manufacture different Carbon Negative fuels at out manufacturing facilities. We manufacture fuel Butanol, fuel Isobutanol, fuel Diacetyl alcohol, and fuel Mesityl oxide. All said fuels are manufactured from the air CO2. Mixtures of our Carbon Negative fuels are great to fuel both Gasoline and Diesel fuel cars and trucks. The fuel mileage we can gather using said mixtures exceeds both either the Gasoline mileage aor the Diesel fuel mileage using respective cars / trucks. We publish herein the fuel mileage which always exceeds the gas and diesel fuel mileages for said fuels manufactured by the international petroleum corporations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7eec1de939f8bea85a3eeefb0723e5d63cad63ed93a1f6abcdd38445b942613","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
