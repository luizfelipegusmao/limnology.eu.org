{"title":"Application of Weak-Beam Dark-Field STEM for Dislocation Loop Analysis†","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/4/681/7713814?rss=1","date":1721001600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Nanoscale dislocation loops formed by irradiation can significantly contribute to both irradiation hardening and embrittlement of materials when subjected to extreme nuclear reactor environments. This study explores the application of weak-beam dark-field (WBDF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) methods for quantitative irradiation-induced defect analysis in crystalline materials, with a specific focus on dislocation loop imaging and analysis. A high-purity Fe-5 wt% Cr model alloy was irradiated with 8 MeV Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions at 450°C to a fluence of 8.8 × 10<sup>19</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>, inducing dislocation loops for analysis. While transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has traditionally been the primary tool for dislocation imaging, recent advancements in STEM technology have reignited interest in using STEM for defect imaging. This study introduces and compares three WBDF STEM methods, demonstrating their effectiveness in suppressing background contrasts, isolating defect information for dislocation loop type classification, providing finer dislocation line images for small loop analysis, and presenting inside–outside contrast for identifying loop nature. Experimental findings indicate that WBDF STEM methods surpass traditional TEM approaches, yielding clearer and more detailed images of dislocation loops. The study concludes by discussing the potential applications of WBDF STEM techniques in defect analysis, emphasizing their adaptability across various material systems beyond nuclear materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a008ab26abc70c9f233f38d0da4e567840ba9a4ae71933598a69091ea772df46","category":"Environment"}
