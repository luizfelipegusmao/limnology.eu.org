{"title":"Mediator complex: an important regulator of root system architecture","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/18/5521/7694202?rss=1","date":1718582400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Mediator, a multiprotein complex, is an important component of the transcription machinery. In plants, the latest studies have established that it functions as a signal processor that conveys transcriptional signals from transcription factors to RNA polymerase II. Mediator has been found to be involved in different developmental and stress-adaptation conditions, ranging from embryo, root, and shoot development to flowering and senescence, and also in responses to different biotic and abiotic stresses. In the last decade, significant progress has been made in understanding the role of Mediator subunits in root development. They have been shown to transcriptionally regulate development of almost all the components of the root system architectureâ€”primary root, lateral roots, and root hairs. They also have a role in nutrient acquisition by the root. In this review, we discuss all the known functions of Mediator subunits during root development. We also highlight the role of Mediator as a nodal point for processing different hormone signals that regulate root morphogenesis and growth.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"e22984f6d30ccc168fc0453023e9947913141ff103f63817c03331a711422f9c","category":"Environment"}
