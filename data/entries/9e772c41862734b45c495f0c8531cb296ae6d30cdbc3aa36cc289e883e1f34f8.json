{"title":"Effects of Xylitol on Tumor Progression in Syngeneic Mice Cancer Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0215/v1","date":1714975533000,"content":"This study investigates the effects of xylitol, a natural sugar alcohol, on tumor progression in syngeneic mouse cancer models. Xylitol has been known for its dental health benefits, but emerging evidence suggests broader biological roles, including potential anti-cancer properties. We explored xylitol's impact on two mouse cancer models: 4T1 mammary carcinoma and B16F10 melanoma. Xylitol's efficacy in inhibiting cancer cell lines and modulating tumor progression was assessed using immunocompetent female mice. The experiments involved intratumoral and peri-tumoral administration of a 20% xylitol solution in two mouse strains: BALB/c (4T1 mammary carcinoma) and C57BL/6 (B16F10 melanoma). Tumor volume, histopathology, and metabolomic analyses were conducted to gauge xylitol's influence. The study revealed that xylitol administration initially reduced tumor growth in the B16F10 melanoma model, accompanied by alterations in tumor metabolism. However, similar effects were not observed in the 4T1 mammary carcinoma model, and melanoma tumor growth re-commenced after stroma deterioration permitted xylitol solution leakage. These findings suggest that xylitol may have potential as an adjunct therapy in cancer treatment, specifically in melanoma. The differential response between the two cancer models underscores the complexity of cancer biology and the need for further investigation into xylitol's mechanisms of action and its role in cancer therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e772c41862734b45c495f0c8531cb296ae6d30cdbc3aa36cc289e883e1f34f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
