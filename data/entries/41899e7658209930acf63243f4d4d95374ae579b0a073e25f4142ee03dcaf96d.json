{"title":"Wood dust and risk of leukemia: Systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307444","date":1724767200000,"content":"<p>by Yaser Soleimani, Mahdi Daraei, Parniyan Sadeghi, Alireza Khazali, Hanieh Rostami, Sheyda Mahmoudi, Alireza Mosavi Jarrahi, Mohammad Reza Taherian, Goljamal Jorjani, Nasser Bahari</p>\r\nObjectives <p>This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between wood dust exposure and leukemia. The objectives included synthesizing available evidence, assessing its quality, identifying potential sources of heterogeneity, and drawing conclusions regarding the association between wood dust and leukemia.</p> Methods <p>A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies meeting that report on the association between wood dust and leukemia. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools were employed to ensure robust quality assessment. Meta-analysis, using random-effects models, synthesized evidence from studies with low risk of bias. Overall odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Subgroup analyses explored potential sources of heterogeneity.</p> Results <p>The meta-analysis included a comprehensive review of various study types, encompassing 7 studies that examined the association between wood dust exposure and leukemia risk. The analysis revealed a statistically significant positive association, with an overall odds ratio (OR) of 1.56 (95% CI: 1.15â€“2.12). This indicates that individuals exposed to wood dust are 1.56 times more likely to develop leukemia compared to those not exposed, with the 95% confidence interval ranging from 1.15 to 2.12, highlighting a substantial risk elevation across different study designs. Quality assessment using The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools demonstrated a low risk of bias across all included studies, enhancing the credibility of the observed association. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore potential sources of heterogeneity within the studies. Notably, subgroup analysis based on the year of the study revealed significant differences, as indicated by an I^2 value of 87%. The robustness of these results underscores the importance of addressing wood dust exposure as an occupational hazard, particularly in industries related to woodworking and forestry.</p> Conclusion <p>This meta-analysis provides robust evidence supporting an increased risk of leukemia associated with wood dust exposure implying proactive measures in people exposed to dust.</p>","author":"Yaser Soleimani","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"41899e7658209930acf63243f4d4d95374ae579b0a073e25f4142ee03dcaf96d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
