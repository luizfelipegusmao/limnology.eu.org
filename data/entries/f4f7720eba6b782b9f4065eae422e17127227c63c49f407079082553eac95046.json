{"title":"Design and Fabrication of Low-Pressure Abrasive Water Jet Cutting Machine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1496/v1","date":1713842063000,"content":"Abrasive Water Jet Machining (AWJM) is a non-conventional machining process that, unlike other methods, is deemed superior because of its applicability, versatility, and no heat-affected zones in the target material. The main objective of this paper was to develop a cheap, practical model for a low-pressure water jet cutting machine and provide some empirical test data for cutting delicate materials. Proper design calculations were performed and are included for both the water jet machine and the two-axis numerical control. Finite Element Analysis results validate the structural integrity of beams and columns in AWJM. Computational Fluid Dynamic analysis of the nozzle shows good agreement with the theoretical calculations regarding the pressure and velocity of the water-abrasive mixture exiting the nozzle. Modal analysis in ANSYS was done to mitigate potential failure due to resonance induced by vibrations. Limited testing on various thicknesses of polystyrene foam ranging from 1-5 mm thickness and rubber sheet of 1 mm thickness showed that even low pressure of 25-30 bar was sufficient to produce a kerf without any burr. However, extensive testing to report optimized parameters like nozzle transverse speed, standoff distance, abrasive flow rate, etc for working at low-pressure ranges is still a consideration for future investigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f4f7720eba6b782b9f4065eae422e17127227c63c49f407079082553eac95046","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
