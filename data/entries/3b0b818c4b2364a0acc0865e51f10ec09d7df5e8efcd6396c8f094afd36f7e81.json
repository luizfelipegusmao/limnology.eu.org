{"title":"Non-Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease and Atrial Fibrillation: A Complex Interplay with One Begets Another","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2243/v1","date":1722326457000,"content":"This article aims to analyze the relationship between non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF), exploring the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and implications for clinical management. NOCAD and AF are prevalent cardiovascular conditions that often coexist, yet their interrelation is not well understood. NOCAD, characterized by the presence of atherosclerotic plaques without significant luminal stenosis, can lead to ischemic necrosis of cardiomyocytes and their replacement with fibrous tissue, in this way sustaining the focal ectopic activity in atrial myocardium. Atrial fibrillation, on the other hand, is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, associated with an increased risk of stroke and heart failure, which may accelerate atherosclerosis and may increase oxygen consumption in the myocardium, creating a mismatch between supply and demand, thus promoting the development or worsening of coronary ischemia. Therefore, NOCAD and AF seems to be a complex Interplay with one begets another.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b0b818c4b2364a0acc0865e51f10ec09d7df5e8efcd6396c8f094afd36f7e81","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
