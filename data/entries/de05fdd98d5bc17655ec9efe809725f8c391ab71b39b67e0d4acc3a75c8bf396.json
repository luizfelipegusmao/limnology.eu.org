{"title":"Development of a highly sensitive TaqMan method based on multi-probe strategy: its application in ASFV detection","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biomethods/article/doi/10.1093/biomethods/bpae011/7610884?rss=1","date":1708300800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The establishment of high sensitive detection method for various pathogenic microorganisms remains constantly concerned. In the present study, multi-probe strategy was first systematically investigated followed by establishing a highly sensitive TaqMan real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qPCR) method for detecting African swine fever virus (ASFV). Briefly, four probes based on the <span>B646L</span> gene of ASFV were designed and the effects of different combinations of the probes in a single TaqMan qPCR assay on the detection sensitivity were investigated. As less as 0.5-5 copies/Î¼l of the ASFV gene was detected by the established TaqMan qPCR assay. Furthermore, plasmid harboring the <span>B646L</span> in water samples could be concentrated 1000 times by ultrafiltration to enable a highly sensitive detection of trace viral nucleic acids. Moreover, no cross-reactivity was observed with other common clinical swine viruses such as PCV2, PCV3, PCV4, PEDV, PDCoV, CSFV, PRRSV, and PRV. When detecting 173 clinical porcine serum samples, the coincidence rate between the developed method and WOAH (World Organization of Animal Health) recommended method was 100%. This study might provide an integrated strategy to achieve higher detection sensitivity of trace pathogenic microorganisms and applicably sensitive TaqMan-based qPCR assays.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"de05fdd98d5bc17655ec9efe809725f8c391ab71b39b67e0d4acc3a75c8bf396","category":"Environment"}
