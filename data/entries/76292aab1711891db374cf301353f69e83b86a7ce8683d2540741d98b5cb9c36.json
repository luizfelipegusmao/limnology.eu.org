{"title":"Linear Quadratic Tracking Control of Car-in-the-Loop Test Bench using Model learnt via Bayesian Optimization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1681/v1","date":1719223450000,"content":"In this paper, we introduce a control method for the linear quadratic tracking (LQT) problem with zero steady-state error. It is achieved by augmenting the original system with an additional state representing the integrated error between the reference and actual outputs. In its essence, it is a linear quadratic integral (LQI) control embedded in a general LQT control framework, with the reference trajectory generated by a linear exogenous system. During the simulative implementation for the specific real-world system Car-in-the-Loop (CiL) test bench, we assume that the 'real' system is completely known. Therefore, for the model-based control, we can have a perfect model identical to the 'real' system. It becomes clear that stable solutions can scarcely be achieved with controller designed with the perfect model of the 'real' system. Contrary, we show that a model learnt via Bayesian Optimization (BO) can facilitate a much bigger set of stable controllers. It exhibits an improved control performance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this discovery is the first in the LQT related literature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76292aab1711891db374cf301353f69e83b86a7ce8683d2540741d98b5cb9c36","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
