{"title":"An Efficient Plant DNA Extraction Protocol of Inga feuilleei (Pacae)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1944/v1","date":1716984478000,"content":"Plant DNA extraction techniques are well-established, featuring a variety of protocols tailored to the needs of individual laboratories or research goals. Currently, there is a strong demand for plant DNA extraction methods that are rapid, cost-effective, and uncomplicated. We have devised an optimized protocol for plant DNA extraction that eliminates the need for liquid nitrogen. DNA was extracted from leaves of Inga feuilleei (pacae) in the Ca√±ete Valley using a basic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method. Subsequently, the extracted DNA was quantified and assessed for quality through agarose gel electrophoresis. This protocol holds the potential to significantly reduce costs in laboratories engaged in routine DNA extraction for genetic diversity and gene expression analyses. It addresses challenges encountered by other conventional methods, particularly in situations where they have proven ineffective due to issues related to explant, sample conditions, and the quantity and quality of nucleic acids. This is especially pertinent for numerous laboratories in developing countries where constraints related to the cost and availability of liquid nitrogen may be a limiting factor. Furthermore, this is the first study reported in this species for genomic studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"381ac0fd2dc24d753ba67adc3774aacfd87964d5089bb03578e7c52003a501a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
