{"title":"Specific Permselectivity and Electrochemical Properties of Homogeneous Bilayer Membranes with Selective Layer Made of Dadma—Å and Ema Copolymer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1781/v1","date":1721734042000,"content":"New homogeneous bilayer membranes with a thin anion-exchange layer have been developed based on the copolymer of N,N-diallyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride (DADMAC) and ethyl methacrylate (EMA) on the surface of a membrane substrate made from polyfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA). The overall and partial current-voltage characteristics, as well as external and internaldiffusion limiting currents, were theoretically and experimentally investigated. Parameters such as specific conductivity, sorption, and diffusion permeability of individual membrane layers were determined, along with effective transport numbers and specific permselectivity of the bilayer homogeneous membranes in mixed solutions of calcium chloride and sodium chloride. It was found that applying a thin anion-exchange layer of DADMAC and EMA to the homogeneous membrane allows for the creation of a charge-selective bilayer membrane with enhanced selectivity towards monovalent metal cations. The specific selectivity of the bilayer membrane for sodium cations increases more than 6-fold (from 0.8 to 4.8). Verification of the obtained experimental data was performed within a four-layer mathematical model with quasi-equilibrium boundary conditions for the diffusion layer (I)/modifying layer (II)/membrane substrate (III)/diffusion layer (IV) in ternary NaCl+CaCl2 solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4bc159f1f640596f728e468a37f6b1bbbfea025439f9b1eb7f5605965d5106c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
