{"title":"Concerns about the use of antimicrobials in swine herds and alternative trends","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae039/7630388?rss=1","date":1710547200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pig productivity in Brazil has advanced a lot in recent decades. Specialized breeds are more vulnerable to pathogens, which has boosted the use of antimicrobials by farmers. The selective pressure generated favors the emergence of resistant bacteria, which compromises the effectiveness of this treatment and limits therapeutic options. In addition to increasing costs and mortality rates in the production system, public awareness of this issue has increased. The authorities have imposed restrictive measures to control the use of antimicrobials and have banned their use as growth promoters. This literature review highlights biosecurity and animal welfare to prevent pig diseases. Hence, we describe alternatives to the use of antimicrobials in pig production for the selection of effective non-antibiotic feed additives that help maintain good health and help the pig resist disease when infection occurs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"8310c0738f276a5146556433b5cfd47fb59e87f1855eebbaeeb68937793f5c72","category":"Environment"}
