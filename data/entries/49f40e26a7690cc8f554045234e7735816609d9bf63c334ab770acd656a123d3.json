{"title":"Phytochemical Characterization, Bioactive Properties, and Acute Toxicity of Wild Vitex agnus-castus L. methanolic extracts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1414/v1","date":1729177338000,"content":"Vitex agnus-castus L.(VAC) belonging to the Verbenaceae family is a Mediterranean plant which is widely used in traditional Tunisian medicine. The aim of this study was to investigate the phytochemical composition, antioxidant, antiviral and cytotoxic potential of methanolic VAC fruits extracts. Quantitative analyses of the different constituents of extracts were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode-array detection (HPLC-DAD). Spectrophotometric methods and chemical tests were used for phytochemical characterization and antioxidant activity. The cytotoxic study was evaluated using epidermoid carcinoma Hep-2 cells, while the antiviral assessment against clinical isolates of coxsackievirus B3 (CBV-3) was determined by using a HEp cell survival assay. VAC extracts presented several components and minerals The results of HPLC-DAD indicated the presence 7 of phenolic compounds with a remarkable abondance of chlorogenic and coumaric acids as polyphenols compounds. The data also showed that VAC extracts had an important antioxidant effect (IC50=0.061 mg/mL) with a reduced cytotoxicity (CC50= 213 Âµg/ml), and these effects are displayed in a dose-dependent manner. However, all the tested extracts are inactive against CBV-3. The results achieved confirm the important role of this plant as a source of therapeutic activities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49f40e26a7690cc8f554045234e7735816609d9bf63c334ab770acd656a123d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
