{"title":"Healthcare Utilization and Clinical Outcomes of Lanadelumab: Insights from Spain&#039;s First Cohort of Difficult-to-Treat Hereditary Angioedema Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0490/v1","date":1728349955000,"content":"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder clinically characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling, affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and airways. Lanadelumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits plasma kallikrein, is approved for long-term prophylaxis (LTP) in HAE patients, demonstrating effectiveness in reducing disease burden. This study evaluated the real-world impact of lanadelumab on healthcare resource utilization, angioedema episode frequency, and quality of life (QoL) in adult HAE type 1 patients treated at the Allergy Department of Hospital Universitario de Canarias, Tenerife Spain. A retrospective review of electronic medical records was conducted for patients who iniciated LTP with lanadelumab between March 2021 and June 2024. Results confirmed a 75.27% reduction in hospital visits, and a 94.1% decrease in the average number of angioedema episodes during the study period. Additionally, the use of on-demand rescue medication (icatibant) was significantly reduced by 61% (p&amp;lt;0.05), with HAEQoL scores improving from 62.2 to 99.5 points, and no significant adverse effects were reported. These findings indicate that lanadelumab effectively reduces healthcare resource utilization and angioedema episodes, while notably enhancing the QoL in selected HAE type 1 patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a77885fbea2b276eb2d701390899007aa83377f9bfa9d0879563e32711b5bb4b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
