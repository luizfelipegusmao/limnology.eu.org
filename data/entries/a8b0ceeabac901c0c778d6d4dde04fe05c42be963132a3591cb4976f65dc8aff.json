{"title":"Cultural hierarchies in health: Does inherited sociocultural position (biraderi) shape diet and nutrition among British Pakistani children? Protocol for a mixed-methods study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305556","date":1718632800000,"content":"<p>by Komal Bhatia, Hannah Intezar, Parveen Akhtar</p>\r\n\r\nThis study aims to explore links between <i>biraderi</i>–a form of identity-based social grouping and stratification which cuts across religions among South Asians–and infant and child nutrition among British Pakistanis using data from the Born in Bradford cohort study. The study will entail a mixed-methods approach to (i) develop an operational framework of biraderi for epidemiologic analyses and apply it to longitudinal data from the Born in Bradford cohort study, (ii) quantify and describe child nutrition and dietary patterns for biraderi sub-groups, and (iii) investigate whether known mechanisms of identity-based segregation, graded inequality, and network effects operate through diet and nutrition in the UK. Using Krieger’s ecosocial theory as an integrative framework we will (iv) re-conceptualise and interpret the role of biraderi / caste in the social construction and embodied experience of how infants and children eat in the UK. Following a literature review on biraderi and health, we will convene and consult a lay consultation group in Bradford through focus groups and academic experts through a Delphi study to guide planning, implementation, interpretation and dissemination of our secondary data analysis. In addition to being the first study to look at biraderi-based nutritional inequalities in the UK, our study is innovative in that we will formally involve experts and users in the design and interpretation of our quantitative analyses. Findings will be applicable in any part of the world where children experience disadvantage linked to sociocultural hierarchy and identity. Our findings will be of particular use in (i) identifying women and children at particular risk of suboptimal breastfeeding practices, poor complementary feeding, and unhealthy diets in primary school in the UK, and (ii) elucidating the sociocultural pathways through which inequalities in population health nutrition outcomes are expressed.","author":"Komal Bhatia","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a8b0ceeabac901c0c778d6d4dde04fe05c42be963132a3591cb4976f65dc8aff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
