{"title":"Towards a ‘systems’ approach for viral challenge experiments in shrimp: Reporting guidelines for publication","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/raq.12877?af=R","date":1710918000000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The success of contemporary disease management strategies in shrimp aquaculture, such as the ‘systems’ approach, is predicated on robust knowledge of the conditions and interactions between the host, pathogen and environment that promote disease. Pathogen challenge experiments (PCEs) are a power tool for investigating these conditions and interactions. However, absence of accurately reported experimental detail in published PCEs limits scientific transparency, reproducibility, and the potential for the research to make progressive advancements contributing to contemporary shrimp disease management strategies. This review identifies and discusses key factors relating to the host (shrimp), pathogen (virus), and environment that should be carefully considered during the design and publication of PCEs. We offer substantial evidence of their impact on viral disease outcomes, drawn from the existing body of literature, to supporting their consideration. The prevalence of reported experimental details for these factors across 186 viral PCEs in shrimp were evaluated. The review highlights a concerning paucity of experimental detail reported in published shrimp PCEs. We propose a checklist for the minimum reportable information in the publication of shrimp viral PCEs, hereafter referred to as the Shrimp PCE Reporting Guidelines (SPERG). The guidelines aim to enhance the transparency and standardisation of reporting in published PCEs, ensuring that key factors pertaining to the shrimp, pathogen, and environment are adequately considered and documented. Adoption of SPERG is envisaged to empower researchers, reviewers, and readers to assess the internal and external validity of PCEs, facilitating critical evaluation and improved utility of PCE findings for contemporary disease management.</p>","author":"P.
