{"title":"From One Heath to One Sustainability. The Role of Contagious Mastitis Pathogens in Decreasing the Dairy Herd Sustainability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1057/v1","date":1723637808000,"content":"Economic, social, and environmental sustainability are the results of efforts aiming to improve all aspects of milk production, respecting animal welfare and improving herd health. An epidemi-ological study was designed to assess the role of contagious pathogens (S. aureus and S.agalactiae) in a cohort of 120 dairy herds located in the southern regions of Italy. Milk quality was assessed using certified methods, and the prevalence of mastitis pathogens in bulk tank milk was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Welfare scores were assessed using a scoring card that have more than 100 items, including animal-based measurements. Statistical analyses were performed using general lineal model and logistic regression procedures. The results showed that S. aureus had a significant negative effect on the amount of milk components delivered to the dairy plant, and on the level of welfare. Whereas, the presence of S.agalactiae did not show any significant association. The major risk factors associated with the presence of S.aureus were also identified to help prioritise control programs. These results support the “One Sustainability” approach im-plying that an increase of animal productivity is related to the improvement of animal health and welfare and potentially leading to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.Economic, social, and environmental sustainability are the results of efforts aiming to improve all aspects of milk production, respecting animal welfare and improving herd health.
