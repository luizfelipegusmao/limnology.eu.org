In Tanzania, cervical cancer is the leading female malignancy, and a major cause of cancer related mortality and morbidity in women. More than 80% of women with cervical cancer, are diagnosed with late stage, in which curative treatment options are not available. To explore the knowledge, perceptions and behaviors among women with late-stage cervical cancer who attended Bugando Medical Centre (BMC) from November to December 2021. Explorative qualitative study was conducted from November to December 2021 at BMC, involving 11 participants who had late-stage cervical cancer. Purposive sampling was used to recruit information-rich participants.  Data collection was done by using open ended In-depth interview guide. The guide contained information on social demographic characteristics, knowledge on cervical disease, perceptions towards cervical cancer symptoms, health care seeking behaviors. Data was transcribed and analysed manually by using thematic approach. The coded texts generated three themes and nine subthemes. The results showed that Participants had poor knowledge about cervical cancer disease, causes, risk factors, prevention measures and treatment options which had impact on the perceptions and health care seeking behaviors. Participants misinterpreted the symptoms with other urogenital conditions like fungus and urinary tract infection. Misconception about the symptoms and disease, long distance to health facilities and financial challenges hindered involvement in seeking biomedical intervention and witch doctors were given a priority. Findings from this study suggest a strong need of intensive health promotion efforts and education through mass media and outreaches to improve adequate and correct knowledge and awareness about cervical cancer disease, causes, symptoms, risk factors, prevention and treatment options. Health care providers and policy makers should include cervical cancer disease as a topic of everyday health education in the health facilities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef3b747aca315bf9888e2a87e638bd7352afcde1cd3295b52cf6726244c2c506","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
