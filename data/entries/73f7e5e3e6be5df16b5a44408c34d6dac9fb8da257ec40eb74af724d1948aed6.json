The proposed method is a two-phase distributed robust energy storage capacity allocation method, which aims to regulate the stochasticity and volatility of net energy output. Firstly, an energy storage capacity allocation model is established, which considers energy storage’s investment and operation costs to minimize the total cost. Then, a two-stage distributed robust energy storage capacity allocation model is established with the confidence set of uncertainty probability distribution constrained by 1-norm and ∞-norm. Finally, a Column and Constraint Generation (C&amp;CG) algorithm is used to solve the problem. The validity of the proposed energy storage capacity allocation model is confirmed by examining different wind and solar penetration levels. Furthermore, the model’s superiority is demonstrated by comparing it with deterministic and robust models.","author":"Xin Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"73f7e5e3e6be5df16b5a44408c34d6dac9fb8da257ec40eb74af724d1948aed6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
