{"title":"Effect of Sintering Temperature on the Physical and Mechanical Characteristics of Fabricated ZrO2-Cr-Ni-Ce-Y Composite","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0398/v1","date":1725848881000,"content":"This study investigates the synthesis and characterization of zirconium oxide (ZrO₂)-based metal-composites doped with cerium (Ce) and yttrium (Y), using chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) as base metals. These constituents were selected for their superior mechanical properties and compatibility with the ceramic phase. High-purity powders were homogenized via high-energy ball milling, followed by cold isostatic pressing (CIP) and sintering in a controlled atmosphere. The sintering process was conducted at various temperatures (850°C to 1350°C) to examine densification, grain growth, and microstructure evolution. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed a homogeneous distribution of phases, with distinct microstructural features attributed to each element at different sintering temperatures. Density measurements using the water immersion method and theoretical calculations demonstrated increased density and reduced porosity with higher sintering temperatures. Vickers hardness testing indicated that hardness improved with increased sintering temperature, peaking around 1150°C due to cerium and yttrium reinforcement within the matrix. Flexural strength tests showed the highest value at 1350°C, with a significant drop in porosity, suggesting enhanced mechanical properties due to efficient doping and phase transformations. Overall, the incorporation of cerium and yttrium significantly improved the mechanical behavior and phase stability of the ZrO₂-Cr-Ni composites, highlighting their potential for advanced engineering applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a50d2c7be2a22b13be67370159e6c4df017fa602918c607a4bd6eb9d90c3e80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
