{"title":"Assessment of the Biodegradability and Compatibility of Finished Leathers: Analysis Using Spectroscopy and Thermal Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0498/v1","date":1717763669000,"content":"In this study, the biodegradation properties of leather treated with various finishing chemicals were evaluated in order to enhance the sustainability of leather processing. We applied advanced analytical techniques including FT-IR, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Leather samples treated with different polymers, resins, bio-based materials, and traditional finishing agents were subjected to a composting process under controlled conditions to measure their biodegradability. The findings revealed that bio-based polyurethane finishes and acrylic wax exhibited biodegradability, while traditional chemical finishes like isocyanate and nitrocellulose lacquer showed moderate biodegradation levels. The results indicated significant differences in the biodegradation rates and the impact on plant germination and growth. Some materials, such as black pigment, nitrocellulose lacquer and wax, were beneficial for plant growth, while others, such as polyurethane materials, had adverse effects. These results support the use of eco-friendly finishes to reduce the environmental footprint of leather production. Overall, this study underscores the importance of selecting sustainable finishing chemicals to promote eco-friendly leather manufacturing practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7d974c660352d3403cc04ddb0eb278be8859b811c19cda67e05144b3e222891","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
