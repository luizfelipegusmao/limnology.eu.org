The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological well-being of adolescent students in Brescia (Northern Italy), two years after the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. An online survey investigated the extent and the reasons reported by high school students for their emotional distress (ED), also considering other factors such as physical activity, diet, sleep and smartphone overuse. The main reasons for ED were classified through a qualitative analysis of the freetext answers. 1686 students agreed to participate, 50% showed a presence of ED. According to a multiple logistic analysis, the main factors associated to ED were female gender (AdjOR 2.3, p&lt;0.0001), age (AdjOR 1.6, p&lt;0.0001), sleep duration &lt;8 hours (AdjOR 1.5, p=0.0003), anxiety perception (AdjOR 3.4, p&lt;0.0001), and certain eating behaviors, e.g. comfort food consumption (AdjOR 2.0, p&lt;0.0001). According to free-text answers, the main reasons for ED were: “school pressure”, “ relationships with family and peers”, “negative emotional states” and “the pandemic”. The results show a high level of ED among adolescents and the reported reasons may help to better address their psychological needs after the pandemic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bcac8fd89cab2cccf6b7bfc6de4643e8fcffa8fb05b29cb84db4f60e6eef1a42","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
