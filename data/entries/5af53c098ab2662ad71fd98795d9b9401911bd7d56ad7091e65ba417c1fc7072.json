{"title":"Trypanosoma vivax in buffaloes on Maraj&oacute; Island","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1573/v1","date":1726825735000,"content":"A study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of Trypanosoma vivax infection in 72 Murrah buffaloes from Soure, a municipality located on Marajó Island. The aim of the research was to identify the presence of T. vivax in the buffalo population. Blood samples were collected, followed by DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using the primers TviCatL1 and DTO 155. T. vivax DNA was detected in one 36-month-old female with a body condition score of 2 (on a scale of 1 to 5), although the animal exhibited no clinical signs of infection. These findings suggest that T. vivax is not frequently circulating among the tested buffaloes, or that the animals may be in the chronic phase of infection, which is often characterized by low parasitemia levels. The identification of T. vivax in a clinically asymptomatic animal underscores the importance of using molecular diagnostics for early detection and monitoring of the parasite in buffalo herds, especially in regions where the presence of T. vivax may be underestimated. This study contributes to understanding the epidemiological status of T. vivax in buffaloes on Marajó Island, highlighting the need for ongoing surveillance in endemic areas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5af53c098ab2662ad71fd98795d9b9401911bd7d56ad7091e65ba417c1fc7072","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
