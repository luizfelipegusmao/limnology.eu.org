{"title":"Genetics of phenological development and implications for seed yield in lentil","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/4772/7666095?rss=1","date":1715040000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Understanding phenology, its genetics and agronomic consequences, is critical for crop adaptation. Here we aim to (i) characterize lentil response to photoperiod with a focus on five loci: the lentil <span>ELF3</span> orthologue <span>Sn</span>, two loci linked to clusters of lentil <span>FT</span> orthologues, and two loci without candidates in chromosomes 2 and 5 (Experiment 1: 36 lines, short and long days in a phytotron), and (ii) establish the phenology–yield relationship (Experiment 2: 25 lines, 11 field environments). A vintage perspective, where we quantify time trends in phenotype over three decades of breeding, links both experiments. Yield increased linearly from older to newer varieties at 29 kg ha<sup>–1</sup> year<sup>–1</sup> or 1.5% year<sup>–1</sup>, correlated negatively with flowering time in both winter- and summer-rainfall regimes, and decoupled from biomass in favourable environments. Time to flowering shortened from older to newer varieties at –0.56% year<sup>–1</sup> in the field, and –0.42% year<sup>–1</sup> (short days) and –0.99% year<sup>–1</sup> (long days) in the phytotron. Early-flowering lines of diverse origin carried multiple early alleles for the five loci, indicating that at least some of these loci affect phenology additively. Current germplasm primarily features the early-flowering haplotype for an <span>FTb</span> cluster region, hence the potential to increase phenological diversity with yield implications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"946928910f2c5e7c646c55e368c86f4521c5358d2d98b733bf809e767eb97c84","category":"Environment"}
