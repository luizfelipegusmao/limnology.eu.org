{"title":"Suitability of containerized toxicant to control Solenopsis invicta (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) threatening cave species in Bexar County, Texas","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/1/168/7505511?rss=1","date":1704240000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Several protected troglobitic invertebrate species are known to occur in caves on Joint Base San Antonio—Camp Bullis, Bexar County, Texas, United States. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) identified red-imported fire ant <span>Solenopsis invicta</span> (hereafter RIFA) (Buren 1972) as the primary threat to cave species’ nutrient sources, cave crickets, <span>Ceuthophilus secretus</span> (Scudder 1894). Per the service’s recommendations, Joint Base San Antonio—Camp Bullis currently implements boiling water mound injections with digging for RIFA control. However, treatment effectiveness is highly variable and largely dependent on the time of day, weather, and personnel diligence. Toxicants have been used for RIFA treatment throughout the world, but concerns exist that traditional applications of toxicant bait around caves might be accessible and inadvertently affect nontarget arthropods, including cricket populations. To mitigate this accessibility, physically limiting access to the toxicant from crickets may be an option. Our objectives were to (i) compare and evaluate the effectiveness of Amdro (Hydramethylnon) and Advion (Indoxacarb) granular baits housed in Ants-No-More Bait Stations (Kness MFG. Inc., Albia, IA) and (ii) evaluate the distance of effectiveness of each bait within a bait station. Ultimately, we observed a 98% reduction in RIFA mound abundance from both baits. Additionally, RIFA mounds within 10 m of the containerized toxicant were reduced by 70%. Our pilot study suggested that Ants-No-More Bait Stations are an effective way to reduce RIFA mounds by 70% if placed 10 m from each other. In practice, this could include bait stations completely covering a particular distance to a cave entrance or fewer bait stations in a ring barrier at a single radial distance to a cave entrance. Containerized toxicants may be a cost-effective and safe RIFA control option around protected cave environments, but further studies are needed to determine potential effects on nontarget arthropods, optimal bait station configuration, and potential effects of biomagnification.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"e4fbfee8cd801f95f5252bc30f667c2125fade8c93d59052aa33d5abf716ffb7","category":"Environment"}
