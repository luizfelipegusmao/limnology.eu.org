{"title":"Discovery of Truncated M-fractional Exact Solitons, and Qualitative Analysis to the Generalized Bretherton Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0269/v1","date":1722913932000,"content":"This paper is concerned about the novel exact solitons to the truncated M-fractional\n(1+1)-dimensional non-linear generalized Bretherton model with arbitrary constants\n. This model is used to explain the resonant nonlinear interaction between the waves\nin different phenomenon, including fluid dynamics, plasma physics, ocean waves, and\nmany others. A series of exact solitons, including bright, dark, periodic, singular,\nsingular-bright, singular-dark, and other solitons are obtained by applying the extended\nsinh-Gordon equation expansion (EShGEE), and the modified (Gâ€²/G2)-expansion tech-\nniques. A novel definition of Fractional derivative provides the solutions distinct from\nthe present solutions. Mathematica software is used to obtain, and verify the solutions.\nThe solutions are shown through 2-D, 3-D, and density plots. The stability process\nis performed to verify that the solutions are exact and accurate. The modulation\ninstability is used to determine the steady-state stable results to the corresponding\nequation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b25d667cc5e9ee9923760f954625bbc8614ac85aa1e313a339a372074d14047","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
