{"title":"Hydrological Monitoring System of the Nav&iacute;o-Quebrado Coastal Lagoon (Colombia): A Very Low Cost, High Value, Replicable, Semi Participatory Solution With Preliminary Results","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1053/v1","date":1721065338000,"content":"Like many coastal lagoons in several countries, “Navío Quebrado” lagoon (La Guajira-Colombia) is a very delicate and precious environment; indeed, it is a nationally recognized Flora and Fauna Sanctuary. Several factors, amongst which climate change, are threatening its existence because of changes in the governing hydro-morphological processes. A first step to address this problem certainly is to understand its hydrological behavior and to be able to replicate via simulation its recent history and then infer likely futures. These potential futures will be marked by changes in the water input by its tributary, the Camarones River, and by a modified water exchange with the sea, according to a foreseen sea level rise pattern, as well as by a different evaporation from the free surface, according to temperature changes. In order achieve the required ability to simulate future scenarios, data on the actual behavior have to be gathered, i.e. a monitoring system has to be set up, which to date is not existent. Conceptually, designing a suitable monitoring system is not a complex issue and seems easy to implement. However, the environmental and socio-cultural and socio-economic context makes every little step a hard climb. An extremely simple –almost “primitive”- monitoring system has been set up in this case which is based on very basic measurements of current velocity and water levels and a direct participation of local stakeholders, first of all the National Park unit of the Sanctuary. All this may clash with the latest groovy advances of science, like in situ automatized sensors, remote sensing, machine learning and digital twins, and certainly several improvements are possible and desirable. But it has strong positive points: it is providing surprisingly reasonable data and…it is working at almost zero additional cost. Several technical difficulties made this exercise interesting in itself and worth being shared. Its novelty lies in showing how old, simple methods may offer a working solution to new challenges. This humble experience may be of help in several other similar situations across the world.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c1e64aea764a0aed1c6194fd43ecb00a069de79386fbbcd301d29cce5a2d7ae0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
