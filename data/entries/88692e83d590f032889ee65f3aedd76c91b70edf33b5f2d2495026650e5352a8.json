{"title":"Variation of Bacterial and Fungal Communities in Soils from Three Major Apple-Pear (Pyrus bretschneideri Rehd.) Orchards","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0312/v1","date":1722851147000,"content":"The microbial communities are closely related to the overall health and quality of soil, but studies on microbial ecology in apple-pear orchard soils are limited. In the current study, 28 soil samples were collected from three apple-pear orchards in northeastern China, and the composition and structure of fungal and bacterial communities were investigated by high-throughput sequencing. Molecular ecological network showed that the keystone taxa of bacterial communities were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, and Chloroflexi, and the keystone taxa of fungal communities was Ascomycota. Mantel tests showed that soil texture and pH were important factors shaping soil bacterial and fungal communities, and soil water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) were also closely related to soil bacterial communities. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and variation partition analysis (VPA) analysis revealed that geographic distance, soil texture, pH, and other soil properties could explain 10.55%, 13.5%, and 19.03% of the overall variation of bacterial communities, and they explained 11.61%, 13.03%, and 20.26% of the overall variation of fungal communities, respectively. The key stone taxa of bacterial and fungal communities in apple-pear orchard soils and their strong correlation with soil properties could provide useful clues toward sustainable management of orchards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88692e83d590f032889ee65f3aedd76c91b70edf33b5f2d2495026650e5352a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
