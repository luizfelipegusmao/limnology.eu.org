{"title":"From iPSCs to Pancreatic &beta; Cells: Unveiling Molecular Pathways and Enhancements With Vitamin C and Retinoic Acid in Diabetes Research","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1245/v1","date":1721095510000,"content":"Diabetes mellitus, a chronic and non-transmissible disease, triggers a wide range of micro- and macrovascular complications. The differentiation of pancreatic β-like cells (PβLCs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offers a promising avenue for regenerative medicine aimed at treating diabetes. Current differentiation protocols strive to emulate pancreatic embryonic development by utilizing cytokines and small molecules at specific doses to activate and inhibit distinct molecular signaling pathways, directing the differentiation of iPSCs into pancreatic β cells. Despite significant progress and improved protocols, the full spectrum of molecular signaling pathways governing pancreatic development and the physiological characteristics of the differentiated cells are not yet fully understood. Here, we report a specific combination of cofactors and small molecules that successfully differentiate iPSCs into PβLCs. Our protocol has shown to be effective, with the resulting cells exhibiting key functional properties of pancreatic β cells, including the expression of crucial molecular markers (pdx1, nkx6.1, ngn3) and the capability to secrete insulin in response to glucose. Furthermore, the addition of vitamin C and retinoic acid in the final stages of differentiation led to the overexpression of specific β cell genes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cb2581abaf1ca04ff2f432f703af9e0d1202b16b20ec2404f666739aa66e2bc8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
