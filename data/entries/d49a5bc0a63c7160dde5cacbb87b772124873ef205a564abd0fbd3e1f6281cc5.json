{"title":"Beyond fission and fusion—Diving into the mysteries of mitochondrial shape","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002671","date":1719842400000,"content":"<p>by Noga Preminger, Maya Schuldiner</p>\r\n\r\nMitochondrial shape and network formation have been primarily associated with the well-established processes of fission and fusion. However, recent research has unveiled an intricate and multifaceted landscape of mitochondrial morphology that extends far beyond the conventional fission–fusion paradigm. These less-explored dimensions harbor numerous unresolved mysteries. This review navigates through diverse processes influencing mitochondrial shape and network formation, highlighting the intriguing complexities and gaps in our understanding of mitochondrial architecture. The exploration encompasses various scales, from biophysical principles governing membrane dynamics to molecular machineries shaping mitochondria, presenting a roadmap for future research in this evolving field.","author":"Noga Preminger","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"d49a5bc0a63c7160dde5cacbb87b772124873ef205a564abd0fbd3e1f6281cc5","category":"Environment"}
