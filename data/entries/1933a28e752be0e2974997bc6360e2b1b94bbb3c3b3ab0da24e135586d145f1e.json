{"title":"Medial open wedge osteotomy yields comparable stability to lateral open wedge procedure on the distal femur","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310869","date":1727272800000,"content":"<p>by Roman Frederik Karkosch, Michael Schwarze, Tomas Smith, Maximilian Petri, Marc-Frederic Pastor, Hauke Horstmann</p>\r\nBackground <p>Supracondylar osteotomies are a frequently and successfully used technique in the treatment of coronal plane deformities and unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee. While lateral open wedge techniques are common for valgus deformities, the data about medial open wedge techniques for varus deformities is sparse. The aim of this study was to compare the biomechanical properties of medial and lateral open wedge osteotomies using a locking Tomofix<sup>®</sup> plate (DePuy Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland). Our hypothesis was that there would be no difference regarding biomechanical outcome parameters between these two groups.</p> Methods <p>Medial and lateral open wedge osteotomies were performed in composite bone model as routine. Each experimental group contained 6 constructs. Standardized osteotomy gaps of ten millimeters were performed and Tomofix<sup>®</sup> plates were fixed to third generation composite bones. The constructs were subsequently mounted into a servohydraulic testing machine. Axial and torsional loadings were applied as described in previous experimental studies. All specimens were subject to a load to failure mode with the mechanism of failure being noted.</p> Findings <p>Both experimental groups showed comparable biomechanical properties under axial and torsional loadings. Mean high force axial stiffness was 3772 N/mm for lateral and 4185 N/mm for the medial construct. Significant differences were noted for torsional stiffness under low- (0 N) and mid-force (150 N) loadings (<i>P</i> = 0.002; <i>P</i> = 0.009), favoring the medial open wedge constructs.</p> Interpretation <p>Medial open wedge osteotomy yields comparable biomechanical stability to the lateral open wedge procedure on the distal femur in a composite bone model.</p>","author":"Roman Frederik Karkosch","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1933a28e752be0e2974997bc6360e2b1b94bbb3c3b3ab0da24e135586d145f1e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
