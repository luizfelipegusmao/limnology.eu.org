{"title":"Arthroscopic Debridement Enhanced by Intra-articular Antibiotic-Loaded Calcium Sulphate Beads for Septic Arthritis of a Native Knee Following Iatrogenic Joint Injection: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0238/v1","date":1725366952000,"content":"Septic arthritis (SA) represents an orthopedics urgency and mainly affects the knee joint. Due to its devastating effects on cartilage, immediate management is crucial. SA is characterized by an an-nual incidence of 2 to 10 cases per 100,000 individuals, with mortality rates fluctuating between 0.5% and 15%, with a substantially higher mortality rate observed in older people (15%) in con-trast to younger cohorts (4%). The etiology of septic arthritis is multifactorial: a spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria can contribute to the development of this condition, especially Staphylococcus aureus. The treatment involves urgent (arthroscopic or arthrotomic) debridement associated with adequate antibiotic therapy. Intra-articular antibiotic carriers can also be used to increase their local concentration and effectiveness. The case of a 67-years-old woman affected by knee SA from methicillin-susceptible S. aureus is presented. She was treated with an arthroscopic debridement enhanced by intra-articular antibiotic-loaded calcium sulphate beads, together with antibiotic therapy. At 2-year follow-up, the infection has been eradicated and the patient fully recovered. This is the first description, to our knowledge, in English Literature of the use of antibiotic-loaded calcium sulphate beads as an adjuvant in the surgical treatment of SA of a native knee joint.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ba0a3afa568a7108f48ad64f2c17e1aa493898c2fa6e8fded895f1ce34d1491","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
