Based on the BeiDou PPP-B2b service, real-time precipitable water vapor (PWV) is retrieved with the precise point positioning (PPP) software. The experiment was conducted in Beijing in January, 2023. Three solutions are designed with PPP using the BeiDou system only, the GPS system only and the BeiDou-GPS combined solution. Real-time PWVs for the 3 solutions are validated with the ERA5 reanalysis data. Between PWVs from single BeiDou and ERA, there are a bias of 0.7 mm and a RMSE of 1.8 mm. While for the GPS case, the bias is 0.73 mm and RMSE is 1.97 mm. The biases are less than 1 mm and RMSEs are less than 2mm. Both the BeiDou and the GPS processing performs very well. But little improvement is found for the BeiDou-GPS combined solution, comparing with the BeiDou system only and the GPS system only solution. This may be due to the poor handling of two different kinds of errors for the GPS and the BeiDou systems in our PPP software. A better PWV estimation with the two systems is to estimate PWV with single system at first step, and then to obtain the optimization by Bayesian model averaging.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"929fe1f926e0f1a26dd23416de4761c91c0acf2a1fd7e9bdb0bd3830240a06be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
