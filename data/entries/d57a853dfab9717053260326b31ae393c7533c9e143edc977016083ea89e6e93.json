{"title":"Research of the Failure Mechanism and Preventive Strengthening of Prefabricated Small Box Girder under Car Explosion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1125/v1","date":1710847658000,"content":"The purpose of this study is to investigate the failure mechanism and preventive strengthening methods of prefabricated full length small box girder (PSBG) under car explosion. After damage analysis during blast loads using the commercial software Autodyn, three strengthening methods are presented to improve the blast mitigation performance. The results show that the failure modes and bearing capacity are significantly different with various strengthening measures. Adhering U-shaped steel plate can effectively enhance the shear performance of PSBG under blast loads. Strengthening the bottom of the upper flange of box girder with steel plate can effectively mitigate the local bending failure, and enhance the overall flexural capacity during car explosion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d57a853dfab9717053260326b31ae393c7533c9e143edc977016083ea89e6e93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
