{"title":"Heightened sensitivity in high-grooming honey bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae057/7683862?rss=1","date":1716854400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Honey bees use grooming to defend against the devastating parasite <span>Varroa destructor</span> Anderson and Trueman. We observed the grooming responses of individual bees from colonies previously chosen for high- and low-grooming behavior using a combination of mite mortality and mite damage. Our aim was to gain insight into specific aspects of grooming behavior to compare if high-grooming bees could discriminate between a standardized stimulus (chalk dust) and a stimulus of live <span>Varroa</span> mites and if bees from high-grooming colonies had greater sensitivity across different body regions than bees from low-grooming colonies. We hypothesized that individuals from high-grooming colonies would be more sensitive to both stimuli than bees from low-grooming colonies across different body regions and that bees would have a greater response to <span>Varroa</span> than a standardized irritant (chalk dust). Individuals from high-grooming colonies responded with longer bouts of intense grooming when either stimulus was applied to the head or thorax, compared to sham-stimulated controls, while bees from low-grooming colonies showed no differences between stimulated and sham-stimulated bees. Further, high-grooming bees from colonies with high mite damage exhibited greater grooming to <span>Varroa</span> than high-grooming colonies with only moderate mite damage rates. This study provides new insights into <span>Varroa</span>-specific aspects of grooming, showing that although a standardized stimulus (chalk dust) may be used to assess general grooming ability in individual bee grooming assays, it does not capture the same range of responses as a stimulus of <span>Varroa</span>. Thus, continuing to use <span>Varroa</span> mites in grooming assays should help select colonies with more precise sensitivity to <span>Varroa</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"ef5a0ed9eca938a69626cad3d0a88228e874deb690458a3ea40ecaa0147c0d22","category":"Environment"}
