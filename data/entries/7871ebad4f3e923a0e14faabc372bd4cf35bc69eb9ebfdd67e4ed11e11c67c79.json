{"title":"Unmet Needs in Pain Management in Pediatric Ambulatory Surgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1665/v1","date":1724405635000,"content":"Perioperative acute pain management in pediatric patients is essential to reduce complications. Adenoidectomy-Tonsillectomy are surgical procedures requiring pain control, and risk minimization for postoperative bleeding, nausea, and vomiting. Despite their known secondary effects, the use of opioid analgesics remains preponderant in pediatric perioperative management. We present an updated review on perioperative pain management in children and describe the development and implementation of a multimodal analgesia protocol aimed to improve patientsâ€™ pain management while consistently reducing opioids use. Information from relevant articles was summarized, then compared to our clinical needs. Learnings were used to create and implement a multimodal analgesia protocol to be used in patients 3-9 years-old undergoing adenoidectomy/tonsillectomy. Analgesic strategies have emerged to reduce or avoid the use of opioids. Among these strategies, combining different non-opioid analgesics (Ibuprofen, Paracetamol, Metamizole) has been shown to be an effective and safe pharmacological strategy when implemented as part of postoperative multimodal analgesia protocols. Significant evidence associating the use of NSAIDs with a bigger risk of postoperative bleeding does not exist. Multimodal and preventive analgesia has shown to provide significantly more effective analgesia than some opioid regimens. Ibuprofen offers highly effective analgesia for postoperative pain, particularly when combined with acetaminophen.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7871ebad4f3e923a0e14faabc372bd4cf35bc69eb9ebfdd67e4ed11e11c67c79","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
