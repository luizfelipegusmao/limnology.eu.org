{"title":"Integrative analysis of bulk RNA‐seq and scRNA‐seq data indicates the prognostic and immunologic values of SERPINH1 in glioma","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24192?af=R","date":1715774307000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>SERPINH1 is abnormally expressed in multiple cancers and is associated with malignant progression. However, few reports detail its role in the etiopathogenesis of glioma. Hence, the aim of this article was to investigate the potential value of SERPINH1 in glioma using an integrative analysis.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>Data of RNA-seq and scRNA-seq was obtained and evaluated using online databases. The expression of SERPINH1 was confirmed by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The prognostic value of SERPINH1 was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. SERPINH1-related signaling pathways and the interaction of SERPINH1 with immunity were also investigated.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>SERPINH1 exhibited a markedly elevated expression in glioma compared to normal brain tissues in the online databases. Similar results were confirmed by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. SERPINH1 was found to be an independent prognosis factor, and high expression of SERPINH1 indicated poor survival. Moreover, a nomogram was constructed to predict prognosis more accurately and intuitively. GSEA analysis showed that SERPINH1 was involved in seven signaling pathways, including JAK-STAT pathway. Further analysis indicated SERPINH1 was significantly associated with immunity, especially in low-grade glioma. Additionally, an examination of scRNA-seq data revealed that SERPINH1 was primarily expressed in T cells of the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>SERPINH1 is a key biomarker of glioma prognosis and is immunologically relevant, which provides additional options for targeted therapy of glioma.</p>","author":"Shiqiang Hou, \nYinan Chen, \nChunjing Jin, \nNing Lin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"6aa798424c0ff6a2852b9eb55bebca5c70f229b14b8145f33419fac591ef05dc","category":"Environment"}
