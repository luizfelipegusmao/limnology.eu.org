{"title":"Examining Chlorophyll Extraction Methods in Sesame Genotypes: Uncovering Leaf Coloration Effects and Anatomy Variations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0147/v1","date":1714728146000,"content":": This study focuses on optimizing chlorophyll extraction techniques and strategically placing leaf disks to enhance chlorophyll concentration in sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) leaves. Thirty sesame genotypes, categorized into light green (LG), middle green (MG), and deep green (DG) pigment groups based on leaf coloration, were selected from a larger pool of field-grown accessions. The investigation involved determining optimal SPAD value index measurements, quantifying pigment concentrations, exploring extraction solvents, and selecting suitable leaf disk positions. Significant variations in chlorophyll content were observed across genotypes, greenness categories, and leaf disk positions. The categorization of genotypes into DG, MG, and LG groups revealed a correlation between leaf appearance and chlorophyll content. The study highlighted a consistent relationship between carotenoids and chlorophyll, indicating their role in adaptation to warm environments. Examination of leaf disk positions revealed a significant chlorophyll gradient along the leaf blade, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols. Chlorophyll extraction experiments identified DMSO and 96% ethanol, particularly the later incubated for 10 minutes at 85Â°C, as effective choices. This recommendation considers factors like cost-effectiveness, time efficiency, safety, and environmental regulations, ensuring consistent and simplified extraction processes. For higher chlorophyll extraction, focusing on leaf tips and the 75% position along the sesame leaf blade is suggested, consistently yielding higher chlorophyll content. Our findings therefore, underscores insightful knowledge on chlorophyll gradients and encouraging for standardized protocols, that enabling researchers to refine experimental designs for precise and comparable chlorophyll measurements. Recommended solvent choices ensure reliable outcomes in plant physiology, ecology, and environmental studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"107b239cdf66b3c2e4ab5467315b1b3aefb3a752076f6f3d55ed9ff57deb246c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
