{"title":"Research and application of neural network‐based intelligent water‐saving systems","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/wej.12918?af=R","date":1714620392000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Capitalizing on the swift evolution of big data and information technology, conventional water-saving endeavours have been revamped into ‘smart water-saving’. This paradigm shift leverages cutting-edge technologies like neural networks, the Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced sensor systems. These components seamlessly integrate with network infrastructure, mobile systems and sophisticated water-saving information systems to forge comprehensive smart water-saving management systems. These systems adeptly amass, process and dissect vast troves of water-saving data, harmonizing with the requirements of water management authorities and consumers alike. This fusion of technology empowers us to furnish all-encompassing information services, thereby elevating the standards of water resource management. In summary, the integration of state-of-the-art technology into water-saving initiatives represents a momentous leap forward in addressing critical water-related challenges and realizing more efficient, sustainable water resource management practices.</p>","author":"Dan Wu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"7ba1ff52100bedddbcdf65ce6a006f3c6c67dc4e10e435c71e5a0ea1d92d74fa","category":"Environment"}
