{"title":"A Survey of Generative Adversarial Network on Next Generation Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1662/v1","date":1729591549000,"content":"Generative adversarial networks consisting of two parts, generator and discriminator, have obtained acceptable results in classification, prediction and generation of new samples in the discussion of 4G, 5G and 6G. In this article, the aim is to review a comprehensive study in relation to these networks. At the beginning of this research, different topics such as network training, network error checking and types of GAN's are investigated. In the following, the applications of GAN will be discussed separately.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"857efa660ca7c5d206224cb71418b099e2a875c2794f837fd47a654ddc37146d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
