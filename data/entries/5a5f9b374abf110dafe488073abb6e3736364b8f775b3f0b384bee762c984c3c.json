{"title":"The relationship between caregiver contribution to self-care and patient quality of life in heart failure: A longitudinal mediation analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300101","date":1710252000000,"content":"<p>by Gabriele Caggianelli, Fabio Alivernini, Andrea Chirico, Paolo Iovino, Fabio Lucidi, Izabella Uchmanowicz, Laura Rasero, Rosaria Alvaro, Ercole Vellone</p>\r\nBackground <p>Patients with heart failure may experience poor quality of life due to a variety of physical and psychological symptoms. Quality of life can improve if patients adhere to consistent self-care behaviors. Patient outcomes (i.e., quality of life) are thought to improve as a result of caregiver contribution to self-care. However, uncertainty exists on whether these outcomes improve as a direct result of caregiver contribution to self-care or whether this improvement occurs indirectly through the improvement of patient heart failure self-care behaviors.</p> Aims <p>To investigate the influence of caregiver contribution to self-care on quality of life of heart failure people and explore whether patient self-care behaviors mediate such a relationship.</p> Methods <p>This is a secondary analysis of the MOTIVATE-HF randomized controlled trial (Clinicaltrials.gov registration number: NCT02894502). Data were collected at baseline and 3 months. An autoregressive longitudinal path analysis model was conducted to test our hypotheses.</p> Results <p>We enrolled a sample of 510 caregivers [mean age = 54 (±15.44), 24% males)] and 510 patients [mean age = 72.4 (±12.28), 58% males)]. Patient self-care had a significant and direct effect on quality of life at three months (β = 0.20, p &lt; .01). Caregiver contribution to self-care showed a significant direct effect on patient self-care (β = 0.32, p &lt; .01), and an indirect effect on patient quality of life through the mediation of patient self-care (β = 0.07, p &lt; .001).</p> Conclusion <p>Patient quality of life is influenced by self-care both directly and indirectly, through the mediation of caregiver contribution to self-care. These findings improve our understanding on how caregiver contribution to self-care improves patient outcomes.</p>","author":"Gabriele Caggianelli","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5a5f9b374abf110dafe488073abb6e3736364b8f775b3f0b384bee762c984c3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
