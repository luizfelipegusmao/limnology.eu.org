{"title":"Characterization of Cassava (Manihot esculenta) Germplasm from Sierra Leone Based on Agro-Morphological and Culinary Traits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0236/v1","date":1714972352000,"content":"Dearth of information on extent of genetic variability in cassava limits the genetic improvement of cassava in Sierra Leone. This study aimed at assessing the genetic variability and relationships within 103 cassava genotypes using agro-morphological and culinary markers. A field trial was conducted in the School of Agriculture and Food Sciences research site. The experiment was laid in an augmented randomized block design. Morphological classification based on qualitative and quantitative traits categorized the germplasm into three different groups. A total of ten principal components (PCs) in the qualitative and six PCs in the quantitative trait sets accounted for 66.74% and 67.27% of the total genetic variation, respectively. Traits with significantly strong and positive correlations included presence of fruit (PFRT) and presence of seed (PSE)(r = 0.86***),root yield per plant (RYPP) and number of storage root (NSR) (r = 0.76***), RYPP and number of commercial root (NCR) (r = 0.68***), length of leaf lobe (LLL) and width of leaf lobe (WLL) (r = 0.66***),and between NSR and NCR (0.84***). Cooking time, cooking percentage, texture, mealiness, taste and aroma varied widely among the accessions. Findings established that the cassava germplasm possess useful genetic variability that could be exploited through selection for short term release programme, genetic conservation of valuable germplasm and genetic improvement of the crop.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"887019ade1d2dfab965c197d0fc73384978f6c55e14347a8b850474a30901cbe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
