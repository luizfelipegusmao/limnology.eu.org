{"title":"Early occurrence of lion (Panthera spelaea) at the Middle Pleistocene Acheulean site of Notarchirico (MIS 16, Italy)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.3639?af=R","date":1720420898000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The long sedimentary sequence of Notarchirico has yielded evidence of one of the earliest Acheulean manifestations in Europe and of recurrent hominin occupation, spanning from the end of the interglacial MIS 17 to the glacial MIS 16 (~695–610 ka). Here, we report the new discovery of a lion, <i>Panthera spelaea</i>, from the site, based on a metatarsal from layer A. This part of the sequence dates to ~660–612 ka (MIS 16, <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar age). Therefore, Notarchirico's lion represents the earliest confirmed occurrence of the species in southwestern Europe, although older findings are known from adjacent areas. Lions and several other large mammal species dispersed into Europe during the Early–Middle Pleistocene Transition, which also witnessed the spread of the Acheulean. Ecological and behavioural adaptability was probably key, for hominins and other species, to cope with the intense and recurrent environmental fluctuations that occurred during this period.</p>","author":"Alessio Iannucci, \nBeniamino Mecozzi, \nAntonio Pineda, \nRaffaele Sardella, \nMarco Carpentieri, \nRivka Rabinovich, \nMarie‐Hélène Moncel","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Quaternary Science: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e4cb264adfd99de4695eda5f992d61d2819971c444b4237b1e7b12202742678e","entryHash":"80cae56103632d28c7c643f2607eebe7caeeedce870a20a74a9e20cfb20c895c","category":"Environment"}
