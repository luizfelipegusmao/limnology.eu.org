{"title":"An analysis of the factors influencing consumer viewpoints in online shopping","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1263/v1","date":1721182968000,"content":"Most consumer purchases are influenced by their evaluation of a product's advantages, disadvantages, and emotional components. Research in psychology and marketing indicates that customer emotions play a role at different stages of the purchasing process. This study aims to identify the elements that may influence consumer feelings when purchasing high-end cosmetics. To explore the various aspects of customer emotions, a qualitative study was conducted using in-depth semi-structured interviews with 23 users of luxury cosmetics and health products in Telegram groups. This research uncovered multiple emotional dimensions and pinpointed factors that could elicit emotions in the target market. The next step, based on collective consensus, was to determine the variables impacting customer emotions. At this stage, the panel included 15 experts in marketing, psychology, luxury cosmetics import businesses active on digital platforms, and managers of luxury cosmetics and hygiene groups in online environments. Through a three-step consensus method, experts identified and assessed 36 factors affecting customer emotions based on their significance and perceived impact. These factors were then categorized into three groups: personal variables, group and product variables, and contextual variables.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"889b1b0b726910504d8bf26dff05792a8fc7308e22ff8aaeffa09a041e6362db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
