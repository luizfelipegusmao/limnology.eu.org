{"title":"Investigation of the Effect of Spray Dryer Encapsulation on Oleuropein from Olive Leaf Extracts Prepared at Two Different pH Levels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0838/v1","date":1723527623000,"content":"This study employed High-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with Diode Array De-tector and Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS) to characterize bioactive compounds in olive leaf extracts. The analysis revealed a diverse metabolic profile, predominantly composed of tyrosol, flavonoids, and hydroxycinnamic acid. The antioxidant activity of the extracts demonstrated their efficacy, with variations observed between neutral and acidic pH conditions. Encapsulation was explored as a preservation method, successfully maintaining the integrity of phenolic compounds in both liquid and powdered forms. All four extracts have an undeniable antimicrobial effect. Moreover, the antibacterial activity tested on E. coli ATCC 25922 and S. aureus ATCC 25923 strains significantly improved post-encapsulation, particularly for the acidic pH extract. The findings suggest that encapsulation can potentially conserve and/or enhance the antimicrobial activity of olive leaf extract, paving the way for developing functional products with improved shelf life and nutritional properties. Further investigations are recommended to elucidate underlying mecha-nisms and optimize encapsulation processes to maximize the benefits of olive leaf extract in di-verse applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8404a94b9c787f19e669cff801894ab88954cc50b1706177042eb964604092a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
