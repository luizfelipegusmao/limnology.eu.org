{"title":"Anchor chains—A simple low‐cost device to assist passage of small‐bodied mass fish","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4347?af=R","date":1721092809000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Attention has been placed on a variety of barriers that hinder fish passage in modern times. The most prevalent fish barriers were culverts which have negatively impacted waterway connectivity and fish habitats. For small-bodied mass fish, high barrel velocities and turbulence have reduced fish swimming performance because of their weak swimming capabilities. In the present study, physical testing was conducted under controlled flow conditions to assess the extent and magnitude of turbulence characteristics, secondary flow and low-velocity zones in a 0.5-m-wide box culvert barrel. Two cases were investigated; a reference case consisting of a smooth rectangular channel and a low-cost design solution to improve upstream fish migration consisting of a single galvanized anchor chain fitted within a smooth rectangular channel. The single anchor chain was positioned towards one corner of the channel to induce asymmetric flow, reducing overall energy losses and enhancing the existing low-velocity zone in the adjacent channel corner. The anchor chain induced a strong turbulent flow motion away from the anchor chain, characterized by higher Reynolds stress and turbulent kinetic energy, along with a distinct channel flow asymmetry. Conversely, the low-velocity zone, between the anchor chain and the bottom channel corner, was significantly expanded with reduced longitudinal mean velocities and turbulent scales. Whilst the anchor chain link contributed to some complex localized wake flow, the anchor chain also influenced the distributions of normal turbulent stresses (v'<sub>z</sub>\n<sup>2</sup> – v'<sub>y</sub>\n<sup>2</sup>), which in turn influenced the location of secondary flow cells. This secondary flow redirected low momentum fluid into the low-velocity zones, setting the conditions for the favorable upstream passage of small-bodied mass fish species.</p>","author":"Jason Harley, \nHui Ling Wong, \nHubert Chanson","siteTitle":"Wiley: River Research and Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"dd8f8dcb48cf1db6f6edba43098839a842d88bad9f088e9d186fa05ae3366ba7","entryHash":"a66906b1969cb448fb21cc053fa3d80315184730ac9b04871c906b91d620fb37","category":"Environment"}
