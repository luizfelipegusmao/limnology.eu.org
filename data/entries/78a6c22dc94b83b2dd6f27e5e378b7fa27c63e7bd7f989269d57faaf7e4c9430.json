{"title":"Synthetic Jet Actuators for Active Flow Control: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1798/v1","date":1729732845000,"content":"A synthetic jet actuator (SJA) is a fluidic device often consisting of a vibrating diaphragm that alters the volume of a cavity to produce a synthesized jet through an orifice. The cyclic ingestion and expulsion of the working fluid leads to a zero-net mass-flux and the transfer of linear momentum to the working fluid over an actuation cycle, leaving a train of vortex structures propagating away from the orifice. SJAs are a promising technology for flow control applications due to their unique features, such as no external fluid supply or ducting requirements, short response time, low weight, and compactness. Hence, they have been the focus of many research studies over the past few decades. Despite these advantages, implementing an effective control scheme using SJAs is quite challenging due to the large parameter space involving several geometrical and operational variables. This article aims to explain the working mechanism of SJAs and provide a comprehensive review of the effects of SJA design parameters in quiescent conditions and crossflow.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78a6c22dc94b83b2dd6f27e5e378b7fa27c63e7bd7f989269d57faaf7e4c9430","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
