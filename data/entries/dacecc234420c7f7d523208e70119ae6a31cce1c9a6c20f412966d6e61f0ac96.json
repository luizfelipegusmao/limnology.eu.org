{"title":"Design and Implementation of an Energy Selector for Laser-Accelerated Protons","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0354/v1","date":1715095370000,"content":"Laser-plasma interactions of ultra-short laser pulses with solid targets can generate highly intense pulses of protons and ions with energies of several MeV. The spectra of these particles are spread over a wide range following a Maxwellian distribution. We report on the design and testing of a magnetic chicane for the selection of protons within a limited energy window. It consists in two successive, anti-parallel dipole fields generated by cost-effective, permanent C-magnets with customized configuration and longitudinal positions. The chicane has been implemented into the target vessel of a petawatt laser facility under constraints on the direction of the incoming laser beam and guidance of the outgoing particles through a vacuum port. The separation of protons and carbon ions within distinct energy intervals has been demonstrated and compared to a ray tracing code.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dacecc234420c7f7d523208e70119ae6a31cce1c9a6c20f412966d6e61f0ac96","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
