{"title":"Unveiling the Emergency Use Authorization of COVID‚Äê19 Vaccines: Safety, Efficacy and Public Trust","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1204/v1","date":1726473900000,"content":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) has led to an initiative to develop safe and effective vaccines for public health safety. In December 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) administered an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Other vaccines from Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna, and AstraZeneca shortly followed. This paper aims to examine the EUA process for COVID-19 vaccine approvals, including the requirements for the safety and efficacy of data, along with the role of the FDA and EMA in the approval process. Further, public concerns about vaccine approvals, including issues on the approval process's safety, efficacy, and speed, were also discussed. Using qualitative analysis of the extracted studies, trends and insights into the factors influencing public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, such as vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, were discussed. Overall, a transparent and rigorous regulatory process for vaccine approval is critical for education efforts between policymakers, vaccine developers, and the public to address concerns for increased population vaccine uptake.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"489049cc8812fd3e81d270b60792dca7548d9392a5b9efc80d8d6a3a7407d59a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
