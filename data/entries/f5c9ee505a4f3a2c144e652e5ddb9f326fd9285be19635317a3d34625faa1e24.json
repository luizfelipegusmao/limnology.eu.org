{"title":"Analysis of Studies on Digital Strategy: A Bibliometric Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2428/v1","date":1727765247000,"content":"This article examines empirically the research on digital strategy, addressing its temporal evolution, sources of scientific production, countries and organizations generating knowledge, and the topics investigated. It highlights key authors and journals from 1991 to 2023, contributing to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9. Methodologically, traditional bibliometric laws and computational tools (VOSviewer software) were applied for data processing. The results show an exponential increase in publications from 2005 to 2022 with a critical mass in digital strategy studies, concentrated in 11 journals and 83 authors with 2 or more publications. The main organizations leading scientific production in this field are in the USA. Finally, the primary Web of Science categories for the leading journals are Business, Management, and Psychology. The research examines the use and adoption of digital strategies in marketing, the impact of digital transformation on business models, and the challenges it poses for human resources. In addition, the challenges arising from the impact of COVID-19, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the integration of digital strategies in public administration should continue to be addressed. Finally, industrial digital transformation and the challenges of Big Data in higher education have less connection with other key concepts analyzed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5c9ee505a4f3a2c144e652e5ddb9f326fd9285be19635317a3d34625faa1e24","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
