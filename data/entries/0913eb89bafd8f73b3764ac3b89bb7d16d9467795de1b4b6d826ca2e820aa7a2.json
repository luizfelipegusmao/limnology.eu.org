Several samples of melilite–nepheline paralava and other thermally altered (metamorphosed) sedimentary rocks contain troilite (FeS), metallic iron (Fe0), kamacite (Ni-bearing Fe0), taenite (Ni-rich Fe0), barringerite or allobogdanite (Fe2P), schreibersite (Fe3P), steadite (Fe4P = eutectic α-Fe+Fe3P), wüstite (FeO), and cohenite (Fe3C). The paralava matrix includes a fragment composed of magnesiowüstite–ferropericlase (FeO–MgO solid solution), as well as of spinel (Mg,Fe)Al2O4 and forsterite. The highest-temperature mineral assemblage belongs to a xenolithic remnant, possibly Fe-rich sinter: molten ash left after underground combustion of coal seams. The crystallization temperatures of the observed iron phases were estimated using phase diagrams for the respective systems: Fe–S for iron sulfides and Fe–P for iron phosphides. Iron monosulfide (high-temperature pyrrhotite) with inclusions of Fe0 underwent solid-state conversion into troilite at 140 °C. Iron phosphides in inclusions from the early growth zone of anorthite–bytownite in melilite–nepheline paralava crystallized from &lt; 1370 to 1165 °C (Fe2P), 1165–1048 °C (Fe3P), and","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0913eb89bafd8f73b3764ac3b89bb7d16d9467795de1b4b6d826ca2e820aa7a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
