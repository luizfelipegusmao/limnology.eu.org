{"title":"A New Air Assisted Flare Tip Design for Managing Gas Flare Emissions (CFD Analysis)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2027/v1","date":1721960773000,"content":"Recently, flares have been considered as a major source of air pollution from the petroleum refining industry. The United Nations have instigated an international effort related to the management of flare emissions to reduce the global warming impact related to flaring. Eliminating or removing the need for gas flares is difficult because these devices are generally used as safety devices to allow combustion of flammable gases in a controlled fashion which supports safe operation. However, reducing flaring is generally possible using well designed efficiently operated flare equipment. In general, flare performance can be enhanced following the API-521 methodology and using assist- media including air and steam to achieve smokeless operation. This present work will discuss flare emissions in petroleum refining industry, and a method to manage flare emissions. Moreover, this work will discuss flare Combustion Efficiency (CE) and Distraction and Removal Efficiency (DRE) in terms of efficient flare operation. This work uses actual operating flare data, published previously, will be used in this work together with the CFD Code C3d. This code, developed at the USDOE Sandia National Laboratory is based on a standard LES methodology to conduct transient flare analysis is used to simulate flare operation to estimate flame shape and emissions produced. In this work, a new air-assisted flare tip design which uses the Coanda effect to improve flare operation was analysed. This new flare design reduces the emission rate that demonstrates the design effectiveness. The analysis considers a flare 1m high and (6\") diameter in the centre of a 4m*4m*4m domain. Boundary conditions considering no cross wind and an ambient temperature of 300K. The initial condition is a hydrostatic pressure profile across the computational domain. In the air assist simulation, stoichiometric ratio will be a variable and therefore more than one case was considered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b9504c92622dc7b9ea9b8691c67649a78f2ebd71167b946582f6fa25c97e3d94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
