Beyond its practical significance, it serves as a classic model for exploring the mechanisms underlying the absorption and reaction of adsorbates on heterogeneous catalysts. Palladium (Pd) is widely used as heterogeneous catalyst for both hydrogenation and oxidation reactions. Despite extensive research on water-forming hydrogen oxidation over Pd surfaces, the intermediate steps of this reaction remain elusive, hindered by the complex interplay among adsorption, diffusion, and variables such as temperature and pressure [<a href=\"#ozae044.796-B2\">2-3</a>]. Additionally, hydrogen atoms can easily penetrate the Pd lattice, migrating among interstitial sites and potentially leading to saturation through continuous diffusion. This results in the formation of PdH<span>x</span>, adding complexity to understanding the hydrogen oxidation reaction mechanisms on the Pd surface.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"19739b78ff1b3e542390bb11acc3eaf731cfb130d90500b5f22ea6a6b547934d","category":"Environment"}
