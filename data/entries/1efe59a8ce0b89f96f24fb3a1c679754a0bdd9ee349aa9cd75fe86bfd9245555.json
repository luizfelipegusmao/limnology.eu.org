{"title":"A pharmacist-led interprofessional medication adherence program improved adherence to oral anticancer therapies: The OpTAT randomized controlled trial","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304573","date":1717768800000,"content":"<p>by Carole Bandiera, Evelina Cardoso, Isabella Locatelli, Khalil Zaman, Antonella Diciolla, Antonia Digklia, Athina Stravodimou, Valérie Cristina, Veronica Aedo-Lopez, Ana Dolcan, Apostolos Sarivalasis, Hasna Bouchaab, Jérôme Pasquier, Jennifer Dotta-Celio, Solange Peters, Dorothea Wagner, Chantal Csajka, Marie Paule Schneider</p>\r\nBackground <p>Oral anticancer therapies such as protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) are increasingly prescribed in cancer care. We aimed to evaluate the impact of a pharmacist-led interprofessional medication adherence program (IMAP) on patient implementation (dosing history), persistence (time until premature cessation of the treatment) and adherence to 27 PKIs prescribed for various solid cancers, as well as the impact on patients’ beliefs about medicines (BAM) and quality of life (QoL).</p> Methods <p>Patients (n = 118) were randomized 1:1 into two arms. In the intervention arm, pharmacists supported patient adherence through monthly electronic and motivational feedback, including educational, behavioral and affective components, for 12 months. The control arm received standard care plus EM without intervention. All PKIs were delivered in electronic monitors (EMs). Medication implementation and adherence were compared between groups using generalized estimating equation models, in which relevant covariables were included; persistence was compared with Kaplan‒Meier curves. Information on all treatment interruptions was compiled for the analysis. Questionnaires to evaluate BAM and QoL were completed among patients who refused and those who accepted to participate at inclusion, 6 and 12 months post-inclusion or at study exit.</p> Results <p>Day-by-day PKI implementation was consistently higher and statistically significant in the intervention arm (n = 58) than in the control arm (n = 60), with 98.1% and 95.0% (Δ3.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference 2.5%; 3.7%) implementation at 6 months, respectively. The probabilities of persistence and adherence were not different between groups, and no difference was found between groups for BAM and QoL scores. No difference in BAM or QoL was found among patients who refused versus those who participated. The intervention benefited mostly men (at 6 months, Δ4.7%, 95% CI 3.4%; 6.0%), those younger than 60 years (Δ4.0%, 95% CI 3.1%; 4.9%), those who had initiated PKI more than 60 days ago before inclusion (Δ4.5%, 95% CI 3.6%; 5.4%), patients without metastasis (Δ4.5%, 95% CI 3.4%; 5.7%), those who were diagnosed with metastasis more than 2 years ago (Δ5.3%, 95% CI 4.3%; 6.4%) and those who had never used any adherence tool before inclusion (Δ3.8%, 95% CI 3.1%; 4.5%).</p> Conclusions <p>The IMAP, led by pharmacists in the context of an interprofessional collaborative practice, supported adherence, specifically implementation, to PKIs among patients with solid cancers. To manage adverse drug events, PKI transient interruptions are often mandated as part of a strategy for treatment and adherence optimization according to guidelines. Implementation of longer-term medication adherence interventions in the daily clinic may contribute to the improvement of progression-free survival.</p> Trial registration <p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04484064.</p>","author":"Carole Bandiera","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1efe59a8ce0b89f96f24fb3a1c679754a0bdd9ee349aa9cd75fe86bfd9245555","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
