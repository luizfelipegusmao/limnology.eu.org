{"title":"Mapping the Influence of Light Intensity on the Transgenerational Genetic Architecture of Arabidopsis thaliana","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0193/v1","date":1719911374000,"content":"Light is a crucial environmental factor that influences the phenotypic development of plants. Despite extensive studies on the physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms of the impact of light on phenotypes, genetic investigations regarding light-induced transgenerational plasticity in Arabidopsis thaliana remain incomplete. In this study, we used Arabidopsis thaliana as the material, then gathered phenotypic data regarding leaf number and plant height under high- and low-light conditions from two generations. In addition to the developed genotype data, a functional mapping model was used to locate a series of significant SNPs. Under low-light conditions, a noticeable adaptive change in the phenotype of leaf number in the second generation suggests the presence of transgenerational genetic effects in Arabidopsis thaliana under environmental stress. Under different lighting treatments, 33 and 13 significant genes associated with transgenerational inheritance were identified, respectively. These genes are largely involved in signal transduction, technical hormone pathways, light responses, and the regulation of organ development. Notably, genes identified under high-light conditions more significantly influence plant development, whereas those identified under low-light conditions focus more on responding to external environmental stimuli.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bfc7e332fd5e4ecebab059dea87de8f5366b00904f327b5d01646af03496e29c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
