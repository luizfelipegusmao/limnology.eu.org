{"title":"Significant benthic fluxes of bioavailable dissolved amino acids to the ocean: Results from the East/Japan Sea","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10363?af=R","date":1705151776000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved amino acid (TDAA) in seawater and sediment porewater of the Ulleung Basin in the East/Japan Sea. The DOC and TDAA concentrations were 1.1- and 1.4-fold higher in the euphotic zone, and 11- and 43-fold higher in sediment porewater, respectively, than those in the deep ocean. Consequently, in the deep ocean, TDAA and DOC input fluxes from porewater were 2- and 0.4-fold of those from the euphotic zone, respectively. This larger contribution of benthic flux for TDAA and its shorter residence time in the benthic boundary layer (BBL) (1.3 ± 0.9 yr) seem to result in steep TDAA increases in the BBL, although DOC concentrations remained relatively uniform throughout the entire deep ocean. AA-derived indices also show enhanced bioavailability of dissolved organic matter in the BBL. Benthic inputs seem to supply a significant amount of bioavailable TDAA to the deep ocean, fueling microbial activity.</p>","author":"Hyekyung Park, \nGuebuem Kim, \nSung‐Han Kim, \nJae Seong Lee","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Letters: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e3d6bd1d0a248694da65f62e7591c05124a8fbc5456d1cafb66209dfd7ae6238","entryHash":"a07b93fad6a002be6a224210fcce0952d48946b72932ceee7bc5304d281d7cc2","category":"Environment"}
