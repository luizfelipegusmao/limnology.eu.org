{"title":"Evaluation of innovation primacy in cross-regional central cities: Evidence from the Huaihai Economic Zone in China (2010–2020)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299951","date":1709906400000,"content":"<p>by Qin-Xia Liu</p>\r\n\r\nWith the intensification of global economic competition, innovation has become one of the core elements of vigorous development in various regions. Improving the innovation ability of cross-regional central cities is the main factor influencing whether a region can achieve economic and social development. In this paper, an innovation primacy index system is designed according to the links of the innovation value chain, and the innovation advantages and empirical effects are comprehensively analyzed by using the point-to-point method, entropy weight method, gravity model and two-way fixed effect model. Based on the data of 8 cities in the core area of the Huaihai Economic Zone from 2010 to 2020 in China, Xuzhou’s innovation primacy ranks first in the core area of the Huaihai Economic Zone, which accords with its status as the central city of the region. Its index has been rising, and its development trend is also good. However, the overall innovation ability of the core area of the Huaihai Economic Zone is unbalanced; the overall economic foundation is not solid enough. In terms of knowledge innovation, R&amp;D innovation and industrial innovation, the industrialization level, around the activation of Xuzhou city vitality, enhances the Xuzhou innovation radiation drive, leading to a decrease in the Huaihai Economic Zone. Finally, some corresponding suggestions on innovation primacy have been proposed for the city of the Huaihai Economic Zone.","author":"Qin-Xia Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9960184206126415333e9a72bcb6eee2c0189492b49e3f0a34f96c84414334a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
