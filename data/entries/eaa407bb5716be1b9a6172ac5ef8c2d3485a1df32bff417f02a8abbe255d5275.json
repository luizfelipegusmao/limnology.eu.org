{"title":"Community-Acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae KPC Invasive Infection: Argentine Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0750/v1","date":1720525848000,"content":"The incidence of infections due to carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) is rising worldwide. We present the case of a 48-year-old female patient, diabetic, with previous episodes of urinary tract infections that was admitted due to pyelonephritis, later identified to be caused by KPC and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both the patient and her family had no strong epidemiological link with the healthcare system, and for this reason, this case stands out in regional literature since similar reports are scarce and therefore constitutes a reason for alert in health institutions. Further studies are needed in order to ascertain the real incidence of these infections in community settings in Latin America and the Caribbean.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eaa407bb5716be1b9a6172ac5ef8c2d3485a1df32bff417f02a8abbe255d5275","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
