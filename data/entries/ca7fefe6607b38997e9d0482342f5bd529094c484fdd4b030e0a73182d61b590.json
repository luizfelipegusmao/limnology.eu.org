{"title":"The General Solution to a Classical Matrix Equation AXB=C over the Dual Split Quaternion Algebra","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1535/v1","date":1711450283000,"content":"In this paper, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for solving a dual split quaternion matrix equation AXB=C, and present the general solution expression when solvability is achieved. As an application, we delve into the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of Hermitian solution to this equation by using a newly defined real representation method. Furthermore, we obtain the solutions for the dual split quaternion matrix equations AX=C and XB=C. Finally, we provide a numerical example to demonstrate the findings of this paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca7fefe6607b38997e9d0482342f5bd529094c484fdd4b030e0a73182d61b590","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
