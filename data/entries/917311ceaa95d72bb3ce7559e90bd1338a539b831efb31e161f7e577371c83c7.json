{"title":"Pragmatic De-noising of Electroglottographic Signals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1637/v1","date":1711517911000,"content":"In voice analysis, the electroglottographic (EGG) signal has long been recognized as a useful complement to the acoustic signal, if only when the vocal folds are actually contacting, such that this signal has an appreciable amplitude. However, phonation can occur also without vocal fold contacting, as in breathy voice, in which case the EGG amplitude is low, but not zero. It is of great interest to identify the transition from non-contacting to contacting, because this will substantially change the nature of the vocal fold oscillations; yet that transition is not in itself audible. The magnitude of the normalized peak derivative of the EGG signal is a convenient indicator of contacting, but no current EGG hardware has a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio of the derivative. The textbook techniques of spectral thresholding and static notch filtering are straightforward to implement, can run in real time, and can mitigate several noise problems in EGG hardware.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"917311ceaa95d72bb3ce7559e90bd1338a539b831efb31e161f7e577371c83c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
