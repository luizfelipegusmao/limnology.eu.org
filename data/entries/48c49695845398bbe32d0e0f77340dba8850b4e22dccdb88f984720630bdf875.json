A critical factor for reaching these targets is reducing the substantial overpotential associated with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Hydroxides have been identified as the active phase on metals, metal oxides, and their derivatives for OER. Among these, nickel-iron (NiFe) hydroxide anodes are regarded as a cost-effective and comparable catalytic alternative to IrO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.1046-B1\">1</a>]. Ni hydroxides, in the absence of Fe, exhibit poor catalytic performance for OER [<a href=\"#ozae044.1046-B2\">2</a>]. However, the local environment and topology of active Fe sites remains a subject of considerable debate, with inconsistencies attributed to issues with the mixed phase or poorly crystalline samples, thus leading to conflicting conclusions for the atomic structure of NiFe hydroxides, and a difficulty in locating active sites [<a href=\"#ozae044.1046-B3\">3-5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"48c49695845398bbe32d0e0f77340dba8850b4e22dccdb88f984720630bdf875","category":"Environment"}
