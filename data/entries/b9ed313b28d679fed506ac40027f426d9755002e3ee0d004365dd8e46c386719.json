{"title":"Quantitative evaluation of the drivers of species richness in a Mediterranean ecosystem (Cape, South Africa)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/133/5-6/801/7274639?rss=1","date":1694736000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>Mediterranean ecosystems have a high vascular plant species richness (SR) relative to their surface area. This SR, representing the balance between speciation and extinction, has been attributed to multiple mechanisms that result in both high rates of speciation and/or low rates of extinction. An abiding question is, however, what is special about Mediterranean ecosystems that enables this high SR? Apart from the long-term climatic stability of the region, SR has also been related to resource availability, the many individuals hypothesis, resource spatial heterogeneity, temporal heterogeneity and biotic feedbacks.<div>Methods</div>Spatial patterns of species richness were related to climatic, edaphic and biotic variables and to spatial variability within the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) of South Africa. Boosted regression tree models were used to explore the strength of relationships between SR and environmental predictors related to each hypothesized mechanism.<div>Key Results</div>Water availability (i.e. precipitation) was a stronger predictor of SR than potential evapotranspiration or temperature. Scarcity of nutrients was also related to SR. There was no indication that SR was related to the density of individuals and only temporal heterogeneity induced by fire was related to SR. Spatial heterogeneities of climatic, edaphic and biotic variables were strongly associated with SR. Biotic interactions remain difficult to assess, although we have some evidence for a putative role in regulating SR.<div>Conclusions</div>While the lack of ecosystem-resetting disturbances (e.g. glaciation) is undoubtedly a key requirement for high species accumulation, predictably, no one explanation holds the key to understanding SR. In the GCFR high SR is the product of a combination of adequate water, nutrient scarcity, spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and possibly biotic feedbacks.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"b9ed313b28d679fed506ac40027f426d9755002e3ee0d004365dd8e46c386719","category":"Environment"}
