{"title":"ON A NEW INNOVATIVE STEAM-BASED METHOD FOR TEACHING CYCLOIDAL CURVES IN ENGINEERING HIGHER EDUCATION","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1510/v1","date":1726822091000,"content":"Robotics offers innovative possibilities at all levels of education, which should be considered when planning the teaching process for certain topics of engineering mathematics in higher education. In this paper, we present a new teaching-learning technique using STEAM-based methods to explore the properties of cycloidal curves for Computer Science Engineering BSc students. Frontal teaching, which is part of the tradition of higher education, has been complemented with teaching methods that meet the generational needs of students: problem-based learning, integration of STEAM-based methods and project-based learning. We have developed a new methodological model that combines the advantages of the traditional teaching method with new forms of teaching that have proven to be effective in teaching Generation Z. The four-stage methodological model uses a variety of didactical approaches because each stage applies a different type of learning technique to make the learning process interesting, motivating and effective. One of the main pillars of the model is the use of Desmos dynamic geometry software to create animations, and the other is the use of educational robotics to support visualisation. The implementation of educational robotics and its potential for teaching cycloidal curves is discussed in detail. The effectiveness of the method was investigated with first-year undergraduate students in computer science engineering. Quantitative studies were carried out to test the effectiveness of the new teaching technique. The experimental results strongly indicate the value of using the four-stage methodological model to implement active learning in the field of cycloidal curves.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40d67f9e7ae7283db558d0f02da98b8620d29f334f1cda5323e612417e0303fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
