{"title":"Psychometric evaluation of the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) over the course of the pandemic in a large German general population sample","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309587","date":1724767200000,"content":"<p>by Julia Petersen, Elmar Brähler, Nora Hettich-Damm, Markus Schepers, Jochem König, Karl Lackner, Norbert Pfeiffer, Manfred E. Beutel</p>\r\nBackground <p>The Brief Resilience Coping Scale (BRCS) is a brief instrument suitable for epidemiological studies. The aims of this paper were to analyze changes in BRCS depending on time, sex, age group, relationship status, as well as risk of poverty, to test the psychometric properties including test-retest reliability and measurement invariance, and to determine associations with psychosocial stress, depressiveness, anxiety, social support, as well as subjective mental and physical health. As the data from this study was collected during the pandemic, an additional sensitivity analysis was performed with pre-pandemic data.</p> Methods <p>A longitudinal study of resilience and distress in a large-sized community sample was performed at one pre-pandemic (T0) and three pandemic time points (T1-3). Resilient coping was assessed by the 4-Item short form of the BRCS, distress by the PHQ-9 and GAD-2.</p> Results <p>BRCS decreased between the first and the second and increased at the third pandemic time point. The scale had a good internal consistency. Test-retest correlation coefficients ranged from 0.527 to 0.589. Higher resilient coping was found in younger participants, participants not at-risk-of-poverty and in males. Stability was higher in those with a partner, and at-risk-of-poverty. Significant negative associations with psychosocial stress, loneliness, depressiveness, anxiety, social support, as well as subjective and physical health and SES underscored the construct validity.</p> Conclusion <p>Overall, findings underscore that resilient coping is a dynamic construct with considerable stability. The scale showed good psychometric properties including test-retest reliability over four months to two years. We found that it is not only important to describe the level of resilient coping, but also its stability.</p>","author":"Julia Petersen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1623b20675348e26717c2215db5bd65c27e15e8737def5b196b4027a61a8206c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
