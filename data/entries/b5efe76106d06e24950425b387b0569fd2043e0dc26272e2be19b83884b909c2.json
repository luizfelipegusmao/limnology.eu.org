{"title":"Estimation of Pointing Errors of Large Radio Telescopes under Solar Radiation Based on Digital Twin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0306/v1","date":1712147296000,"content":"The pointing accuracy of large radio telescopes is affected by antenna structure errors, installation errors, servo errors, gravity, and varying environmental factors. It is hard to estimate the pointing error of radio telescopes under solar radiation via the traditional multi-parameter static pointing models,  due to the time-varying characteristics of the dynamic pointing error. There is still no effective way to estimate the dynamic pointing error of large radio telescopes under solar radiation up to now. To estimate the dynamic pointing error of large radio telescopes under solar radiation, a new way based on digital twin(DT) is tried in this paper. The operational framework of the DT system of large radio telescopes is introduced first. Then, the Wuqing 70-m radio telescope(WRT70) is taken as the research object, the digital models of which are created. Finally, the reliability of the WRT70's DT system is verified and the dynamic pointing error of WRT70(staying at the position of the elevation angle of 90° and the azimuth angle of 180°) on two sunny days in different seasons is estimated by the created DT system. The research results show that the pointing error of large radio telescopes under solar radiation fluctuates greatly and the seasonal differences are very striking. The maximum elevation pointing error of WRT70 under solar radiation around the winter solstice is over 40 arcsec, which should never be ignored. The way is feasible to estimate the dynamic pointing error of large radio telescopes staying at a specific position under solar radiation via constructing a DT system in this paper, but it is not yet able to estimate effectively the dynamic pointing error of large radio telescopes being in action. It is expected to establish a dynamic pointing error model and calibrate the dynamic pointing errors of large radio telescopes being in action by DT technology in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5efe76106d06e24950425b387b0569fd2043e0dc26272e2be19b83884b909c2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
