{"title":"Therapeutic Applications of Aptamers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1428/v1","date":1716360891000,"content":"Affinity reagents, or target-binding molecules, are quite versatile and are major workhorses in molecular biology and medicine. Antibodies are the most famous and frequently used type and they have been used for a wide range of applications, including laboratory techniques, diagnostics, and therapeutics. However, antibodies are not the only available affinity reagents and they do have significant drawbacks, including laborious and costly production. Aptamers are one potential alternative that have a variety of unique advantages. They are single stranded DNA or RNA molecules that can be selected for binding to many targets including proteins, carbohydrates, and small molecules â€“ for which antibodies typically have low affinity. There are also a variety of cost-effective methods for producing and modifying nucleic acids in vitro without cells, whereas antibodies typically require cells or even whole animals. While there are also significant drawbacks to using aptamers in therapeutic applications, including low in vivo stability, aptamers have had success in clinical trials for treating a variety of diseases and two aptamer-based drugs have gained FDA approval. Aptamer development is still ongoing, which could lead to additional applications of aptamer therapeutics, including antitoxins, and combinatorial approaches with nanoparticles and other nucleic acid therapeutics that could improve efficacy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70caa9d98bef0787486ed9b9a191943e309a1e760482c8b9c6e4f4884b25d762","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
