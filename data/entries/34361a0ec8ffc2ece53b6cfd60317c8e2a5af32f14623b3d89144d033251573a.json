{"title":"Modeling of the 4th Generation Toyota Prius Traction Machine as the Reference for Future Designs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1110/v1","date":1723657420000,"content":"The automotive market is very competitive and presents a demand for the consistent improvement of the used technologies and reduction of the product cost and dimensions with each product model iteration. Hence, it is important to have access to well-defined reference designs of high quality products, in order to evaluate the new ideas and technologies. This paper provides the readers with a numerical model of such a high quality product, i.e., the IPMSM type traction motor from the 4th generation of the Toyota Prius hybrid transaxle. In the introductory section, the brief history of the Prius model is given together with the references to the reverse engineering reports. Afterwards, the machine dimensions, material properties and winding configuration are described. Then, the model is validated with the torque measurements at constant speed. In the next chapters the simulation results are presented and the numerical source data are supplied to the reader. Finally, the design philosophy of the Toyota drive is briefly discussed in comparison with the BMWi3 drive and the results are concluded in the last section.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"34361a0ec8ffc2ece53b6cfd60317c8e2a5af32f14623b3d89144d033251573a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
