{"title":"Morphological Changes Induced by TKS4 Deficiency Can Be Reversed by EZH2 Inhibition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0787/v1","date":1710337050000,"content":"Background: The scaffold protein tyrosine kinase substrate 4 (TKS4) undergoes tyrosine phos-phorylation by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway via Src kinase. The TKS4 deficiency in humans is responsible for the manifestation of a genetic disorder known as Frank-Ter Haar syndrome (FTHS). Based on our earlier investigation, the absence of TKS4 triggers migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenomena while concurrently suppressing cell proliferation in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells. This indicates that TKS4 may play a unique role in the progression of cancer. In this study, we demonstrated that the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and the histone methyltransferase of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) are involved in the migration, invasion, and EMT-like changes in TKS4-deficient cells (KO). EZH2 is responsible for the maintenance of the trimethylated lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). \n\nMethods: We performed the transcriptome sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation, protein and RNA quantitative studies, cell mobility, invasion, and proliferation studies combined with/without EZH2 activity inhibitor 3-deazanoplanocine (DZNep)\n\nResults: We detected an elevation of global H3K27me3 levels in the TKS4 KO cells, which could be reduced with treatment with DZNep, an EZH2 inhibitor. Inhibition of EZH2 activity reversed the phenotypic effects of the knockout of TKS4, reducing the migration speed and wound healing capacity of the cells as well as decreasing the invasion capacity, while the decrease in cell prolif-eration became stronger. In addition, inhibition of EZH2 activity also reversed most epithelial and mesenchymal markers. We investigated the wider impact of TKS4 deletion on the gene expression profile of colorectal cancer cells using transcriptome sequencing of wild-type and TKS4 knockout cells, particularly before and after treatment with DZNep. Additionally, we observed changes in the expression of several protein-coding genes and long non-coding RNAs that showed a recovery in expression levels following EZH2 inhibition. \n\nConclusions: Our results indicate that the removal of TKS4 causes a notable disruption in the gene expression pattern, leading to the disruption of several signal transduction pathways. Inhibiting the activity of EZH2 can restore most of these transcriptomics and phenotypic effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"845547a5f71887b63581b897be4e18da0777ad80de0636910a7cf9b261ee75b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
