The aims of this study were to analyze the impact of ITDM and NTIDM on the incidence of all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE- cardiovascular death, non-fatal infarction, non-fatal stroke and tagert vessel revascularization) in the eight-year follow-up of STEMI patients with a reduced ejection fraction (EF). \nMethod: we analysed 2,230 STEMI patients with EF","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"694533cb2d9ec0b0a117a9a26f1056026bbaa4423c4bff6978ebbb1f3fcd3c32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
