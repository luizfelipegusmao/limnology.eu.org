{"title":"Navigating Digital Government Transformation: The Influence of Machine Learning on Rational Decision-Making within E-government","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0539/v1","date":1712580315000,"content":"In the field of business environments, the integration of novel artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has been identified in the literature and theoretical discourse as an essential catalyst for enhancing the decision-making processes. In the contemporary landscape of digital transformation, the application of these techniques becomes essential, despite encountering various hurdles that impede their seamless integration into the rational decision-making process within e-government, which constitutes a critical component of digital government initiatives. This study explores whether similar advancements can be observed within the e-government sector and investigates the impact of using machine learning (ML) as a technique of artificial intelligence on rational decision-making (RDM). Employing an empirical research approach, the study utilized a quantitative methodology, relying on an electronically structured questionnaire survey administered to 163 employees in the e-government sector in Jordan through purposive random sampling. Data analysis was conducted using the SPSS v25 program, complemented by a media-tion analysis using AMOS v23 software. The research findings revealed a significant contribution of using machine learning to enhance rational decision-making and trust levels, with trust positively impacting RDM. Trust was identified as a beneficial mediator in the relationship between machine learning and rational decision-making. Despite certain limitations, this study's outcomes offer substantial insights for researchers and government policy-makers alike, contributing to the advancement of sustainable practices in the e-government domain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a09b1bab60094098374259a514bfe27e0c0d1a89e57dbed1e946143b6819633","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
