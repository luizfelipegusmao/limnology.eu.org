{"title":"Converting the energy of sea waves into electrical energy","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14342?af=R","date":1705049682000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The study is highly relevant as ocean waves hold significant potential for producing electricity. Improvements in production, usage and rectification of research errors are crucial for meeting the energy demands of diverse consumers. The aim of this work is to put forward recommendations for eliminating design and implementation errors in wave energy conversion systems, specifically for offshore power plants, and to analyze their performance. Various methods were employed, including the analytical method, classification method, functional method, statistical method, synthesis method, and others. During the study, the characteristics and differences of ocean waves were observed, along with an analysis of the errors that can occur during the operation of offshore power plants designed for wave energy production and their associated causes. Uncertainties affecting the development of these power stations were identified, and the potential of sea waves as an energy resource was examined. Recommendations for enhanced regulation were put forward. The practicality lies in applying the identified findings to rectify errors in offshore power stations that use sea waves. This guarantees reliable operation by considering various factors and assists in recommending the optimal use of energy resources.</p>","author":"Assylkanym Kassayeva, \nAknur Balekova, \nKalyy Yerzhanov","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"6018414295f015d169328cf4c9b4ae3751f4f889b4d9f353048a19cce5547e1d","category":"Environment"}
