{"title":"A Novel Practical Approach for Directly Assessing COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy against Hospitalization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0338/v1","date":1722926233000,"content":"We revisit a 2023 JAMA-published analysis of data from patients admitted for either COVID-19 or influenza to U.S. Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals in the fall/winter of 2022-2023. We note that baseline characteristics between the cohorts were similar, and the difference in vaccination rates was minimal, even after propensity score weighting. Had the vaccines been even minimally effective, significant differences in vaccination percentages would be expected. These findings call into question any efficacy claims associated with either the COVID-19 or influenza vaccines. Furthermore, the lack of efficacy of the influenza vaccines in reducing hospitalization is consistent with an earlier detailed study that found the same lack of efficacy, further validating the current result. This suggests that comparing vaccination rates between those hospitalized for different vaccine-preventable diseases can serve as a practical method for validating the vaccine efficacy claims of different vaccines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"48f86bf909992f0d813afbc7211adca7228696995f881970b9c899055c4e8c33","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
