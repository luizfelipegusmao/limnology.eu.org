{"title":"Investigation of Various Toxigenic Genes, Antibiotic and Disinfectant Resistance Profiles in Staphylococcus aureus Originating from Raw Milk","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2232/v1","date":1727570621000,"content":"This study investigated the toxigenic genes and antimicrobial resistance profiles Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from 260 raw milk samples collected from dairy farms in TÃ¼rkiye. Results indicated that 60.7% of staphylococcal enterotoxin genes (sea, seb, sed, seg, sei, sej, sek, seq, sem, seo, and seu) and 21.4% of the tst and eta genes were positive, with most enterotoxin-positive samples carrying more than one gene. The genes sec, see, seh, sel, sen, sep, and etb were not identified in any samples. The prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (mecA, blaR, blaI, blaZ, vanA, ermT, tetK, aac/aph, ant, dfrA, tcaR, IS256, and IS257) was high at 89.2%, with bla being the most frequently detected gene (75%). The mecA gene was present in 14.2% of samples, while tcaR was detected in 78.5%. Nevertheless, the mecC was not identified. Disinfectant resistance genes (qacA/B, qacC, qacJ, smr) were detected in 21.4% of the samples. The results of the disc diffusion test showed that 64% of strains were resistant to penicillin G and ampicillin, with additional resistance found for cefoxitin, teicoplanin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, and other antibiotics. These findings highlight a significant public health and food safety risk associated with raw milk due to the presence of S. aureus strains with toxigenic genes and high antimicrobial resistance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d5d59f5e2029fa887f1b82228432e67f8de4b82f513399f827ba10579d9a6cd8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
