{"title":"Industrialization in Construction Companies &ndash; a Benchmark Study on Manufacturing Companies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0227/v1","date":1712142917000,"content":"Productivity has been modest in construction due to many reasons, especially project-specific operations and fragmentation. The main aim of this research is to map the challenges towards industrialization in construction through a comparative study of the manufacturing industry. An inductive approach and a qualitative method are followed by applying semi-structured inter-views, and node-based thematic analysis. The key elements of industrialization in mature man-ufacturing companies are benchmarked. The findings indicate a specific order of steps for indus-trialization in construction. Data and information management with achieved systematization have been sources of productivity in manufacturing companies. However, the systematization starts from the offering, construction companies need to define their offering, that is the products, and define their respective data. Only accurate and good quality data on products enables the systematization of order delivery processes, which are the engine for a companyâ€™s success or failure. Continuous efficiency improvement is only possible with systematized processes and respective data related to the processes. The originality involves clarifying the industrialization of construction companies via products, respective data, and processes considering industrialized manufacturing companies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b83ccbe39c942065f6e572be6daecad6a94b25f8bf8aa92e8e40b865a0273fcf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
