{"title":"Development of Energy-Based Site-Specific Correlations to Evaluate Liquefaction Potential","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10706-023-02646-8","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Liquefaction of soil is a phenomenon where effective stresses get reduced due to the generation of excess pore-water pressures during earthquake shaking. This is manifested by loss of soil stiffness and shear strength. It is a general practice to evaluate the liquefaction potential using EPP generation and single or double amplitude shear strain of 3% or 5%, respectively, using either a stress-based or strain-based approach. The energy-based approach is also preferred by a few researchers, which quantifies the capacity of soil in terms of dissipated energy during an earthquake. In the present investigation, a series of strain-controlled cyclic triaxial experiments are conducted on Solani sand to explore the potential for liquefaction utilizing an energy-based approach. Estimations were performed for varied parameters, including effective confining pressure, strain amplitude, diameter, relative density, and frequency, at appropriate intervals. A relationship is proposed between the dissipated energy per unit volume and the controlling parameters that influence soil liquefaction potential. The experimental investigations are not directly applicable to the field conditions. To overcome these lacunae, a numerical approach is proposed to simulate the experiments, validated, and utilized to simulate the field conditions. For this purpose, a set of six near-field and six far-field ground motions corresponding to the targeted designed spectrum are selected, and the energy experienced on soil samples during these earthquakes is evaluated. Besides, the implication of variation between the energy dissipated by the tested soil to get liquefied and the energy imparted to the on-site soil during earthquake shaking is also discussed.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"af09e772beb1b34386e09458e6a316b3d2f244a4faac8a7735d9ab409b69f784","category":"Environment"}
