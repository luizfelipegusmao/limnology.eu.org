{"title":"Comprehensive Assessment of the Multi-cropping Effect on the Agroecosystems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1814/v1","date":1711691097000,"content":"Multi-cropping is becoming an increasingly popular approach in agriculture to tackle major and complex agroecosystem problems such as biodiversity and soil fertility losses, erosion and degradation, increased greenhouse gas emissions, etc. Comprehensive assessment of the impact of multi-cropping intensity on the agroecosystem is a new and still under-researched approach that provides a better understanding of the impact of the individual indicators studied on the overall functioning of the biodiversed agroecosystems. Data from a stationary field experiment with multi-cropping at the Vytautas Magnus University, Experimental Station between 2020 and 2022 were used to achieve this objective. The study included maize, hemp and faba bean as single, binary, and ternary crops. A complex assessment approach (CEI value) was used to determine the impact of these diversified crops on the agroecosystem, the interrelationships between the main indicators and the strength of their effects. It was found that the most positive effect on agroecosystem had ternary maize-hemp-faba bean crop. The effectiveness of other crops was from 2 to 35% less. The lowest one was calculated for the maize-faba bean crop.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3610cf0f3b1aa684932c18bece1f1d3eb2147de210bd76bef3a038b63ebbb3f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
