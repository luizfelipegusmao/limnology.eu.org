{"title":"Navigating the Spectrum: A Comprehensive Review of HIV Detection Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0831/v1","date":1715595965000,"content":"The timely and accurate detection of HIV infection is pivotal in stemming the tide of this global pandemic and facilitating early treatment initiation. This review offers a comprehensive examination of the diverse array of methods employed for HIV detection, spanning traditional serological assays to cutting-edge technologies such as nucleic acid amplification, biosensor innovations, and artificial intelligence-driven diagnostics. Each method is scrutinized in terms of its principles, applications, strengths, and limitations. By integrating these complementary approaches and fostering collaboration across disciplines, researchers and clinicians gain a multifaceted understanding of HIV infection, enabling them to navigate the complexities of the virus with precision and insight. Through a multidisciplinary lens, encompassing immunology, molecular biology, engineering, and public health, this review aims to inform future directions in HIV detection, ultimately guiding efforts towards personalized, precise, and accessible diagnostics for all individuals affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"234210214f126301e099f55f87e8079fa56b14fccdb00e7e43b4e17a723e0de3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
