{"title":"Chinese herbal medicine for post-viral fatigue: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300896","date":1711029600000,"content":"<p>by Le-Yan Hu, An-Qi Cai, Bo Li, Zheng Li, Jian-Ping Liu, Hui-Juan Cao</p>\r\nBackground <p>Fatigue is a common symptom after viral infection. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is thought to be a potential effective intervention in relieving fatigue.</p> Purpose <p>To assess the effectiveness and safety of CHM for the treatment of post-viral fatigue.</p> Study design <p>Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).</p> Methods <p>The protocol of this systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022380356). Trials reported changes of fatigue symptom, which compared CHM to no treatment, placebo or drugs, were included. Six electronic databases and three clinical trial registration platforms were searched from inception to November 2023. Literature screening, data extraction, and risk bias assessment were independently carried out by two reviewers. Quality of the included trials was evaluated using Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4, mean difference (MD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was used for estimate effect of continuous data. Heterogeneity among trials was assessed through <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> value.</p> Results <p>Overall, nineteen studies with 1921 patients were included. Results of individual trial or meta-analysis showed that CHM was better than no treatment (MD = -0.80 scores, 95%CI -1.43 to -0.17 scores, <i>P</i> = 0.01, 60 participants, 1 trial), placebo (MD = -1.90 scores, 95%CI -2.38 to -1.42 scores, <i>P&lt;0</i>.<i>00001</i>, 184 participants, 1 trial), placebo on basis of rehabilitation therapy (MD = -14.90 scores, 95%CI -24.53 to -5.27 scores, <i>P</i> = 0.02, 118 participants, 1 trial) or drugs (MD = -0.38 scores, 95%CI -0.48 to -0.27 scores, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%, <i>P</i>&lt;0.00001, 498 participants, 4 trials) on relieving fatigue symptoms assessing by Traditional Chinese Medicine fatigue scores. Trials compared CHM plus drugs <i>to</i> drugs alone also showed better effect of combination therapy (average MD = -0.56 scores). In addition, CHM may improve the percentage of CD4 T lymphocytes and reduce the level of serum IL-6 (MD = -14.64 scores, 95%CI 18.36 to -10.91 scores, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%, <i>P</i>&lt;0.00001, 146 participants, 2 trials).</p> Conclusion <p>Current systematic review found that the participation of CHM can improve the symptoms of post-viral fatigue and some immune indicators. However, the safety of CHM remains unknown and large sample, high quality multicenter RCTs are still needed in the future.</p>","author":"Le-Yan Hu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dcf253f307ed88c95e4bdf2cb0df52786478663eb622ac9208a5cf5297fd427d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
