OSBG-treated mice showed significant amelioration in recognition and spatial memory deficits compared to the scopolamine group. OSBG could decrease acetylcholinesterase activity in a tissue-dependent fashion but not in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in contrast, OSBG administration resulted in significant upregulation superoxide dismutase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, downregulation of malondialdehyde and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 in the tissues. Finally, at the genus level, we observed that the OSBG interventions increased the relative abundance of probiotics (e.g., <i>Barnesiella, Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Clostridium_XlVb</i>) and decreased pernicious bacteria such as <i>Eisenbergiella</i> and <i>Intestinimonas</i>, compared to the Alzheimer's disease mouse model group. Herein, our results demonstrate that OSBG restores the composition of the scopolamine-induced intestinal microbiota in mice, providing homeostasis of gut microbiota and providing evidence for microbiota-regulated therapeutic potential.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Our results showed for the first time a clear role for OSBG in improving scopolamine-induced memory impairment by inhibiting cholinergic dysfunction in a tissue-dependent manner. Additionally, OSBG administration relieved oxidative stress by activating the Keap-1/Nrf2 pathway and modulating the gut microbiota. Collectively, OSBG may be a promising target for neuroprotective antioxidants for improving memory and cognition in Alzheimer's disease patients. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Weiyin Xu, \nPeng Yu, \nSimeng Shao, \nZhaoyang Xie, \nYi Wu, \nJianing Liu, \nTianyang Xu, \nGuangzhi Cai, \nHongmei Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"bfc525f67bcdf64e6f0176b65dcc997af38b1e909b2dfc79f56281c8e9e78af0","category":"Environment"}
