{"title":"Assessment of Skeletal Muscle Alterations and Circulating Myokines in MASLD Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1598/v1","date":1719223252000,"content":"Aim: To determine the prevalence of skeletal muscle alterations (SMA) in patients with meta-bolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and to assess the significance of circulating myokines as potential biomarkers of SMA in patients with MASLD. Material and methods: Measurements of both skeletal muscle strength and skeletal muscle mass parameters, anthropometric and metabolic features as well as serum levels of different myokines were per-formed in a cohort of 62 MASLD patients and then compared according to the stage of liver fi-brosis and hepatosteatosis degree both diagnosed by transitional elastography. Results: No sig-nificant differences were found in skeletal muscle strength and skeletal muscle mass in MASLD patients stratified according to the stage of liver fibrosis. Noteworthy, serum levels of FGF21 were significantly higher in MASLD patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis (F3-F4) than in those with lower stages of hepatic fibrosis (F0-F2) (197.49±198.27 pg/ml vs 95.62±83.67 pg/ml, p=0.049, respectively). MASLD patients with severe hepatosteatosis (S3) had significantly higher serum levels of irisin (1116.87±1161.86 pg/ml) than those with lower grades (S1-S2) (385.21±375.98 pg/ml, p=0.001).  \nConclusion: SMA were uncommon in our MASLD patients, particularly in those with lower stages of liver fibrosis. An increase in serum FGF21 was detected in patients with a higher stage of fibrosis with possible therapeutic implications in MASLD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3aa8e8101e7ecbe037bcd22d3fd511f2d36b3074b4a5c7cb48786fc785e04ac7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
