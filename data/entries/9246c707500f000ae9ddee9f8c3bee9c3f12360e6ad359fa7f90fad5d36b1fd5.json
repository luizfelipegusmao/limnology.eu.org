{"title":"Trend of prevalence and characteristics of preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm): Nationwide population-based survey between 2010 and 2019","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307302","date":1721743200000,"content":"<p>by Hyunji Choi, Chul-Ho Oak, Mann-Hong Jung, Tae-Won Jang, Sung-Jin Nam, Taemin Yoon</p>\r\nPurpose <p>This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, trends, and factors of preserved ratio with impaired spirometry (PRISm) by using a nationally representative sample.</p> Patients and methods <p>The datasets of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010–2019 were used: of total 32,949 participants aged ≥40 and no missing data on spirometry, 24,523 with normal, 4,623 with obstructive, and 3,803 with PRISm were identified. PRISm was defined as FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ≥70% and FEV<sub>1</sub>% of the predicted value (%pred) &lt;80. PRISm-lower limit of normal (LLN) was defined when FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ≥LLN and FEV<sub>1</sub>  Results <p>Estimated average prevalence of PRISm was 10.4% (PRISm-LLN 11.1%). Joinpoint regression analyses found a relatively stable trend of PRISm for both fixed ratio and LLN. The multivariable-adjusted logistic regression model showed female sex, BMI ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, metabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, abdominal obesity, low HDL-choleterol, hypertension, and diabetes were associated with the increased probability of PRISm.</p> Conclusion <p>Whenever a PRISm pattern is identified in a clinical context, it may be necessary to measure absolute lung volumes to investigate underlying physiological abnormalities and to identify factors that is modifiable.</p></p>","author":"Hyunji Choi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9246c707500f000ae9ddee9f8c3bee9c3f12360e6ad359fa7f90fad5d36b1fd5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
