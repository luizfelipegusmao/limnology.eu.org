This provides fertile ground for those who demand that climate policy should address such embodied emissions. There are different design options for policies targeting embodied emissions. Such differences affect which groups can be mobilized in their favour. This paper shows that procurement standards which target intermediate products can mobilize the support of relatively low carbon producers of high carbon materials, while product standards which target final products can mobilize the support of producers of relatively low carbon materials and knowledge-intensive service providers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Oxford Open Climate Change Current Issue","siteHash":"00d34e28b1e6fdd64576c95b4b9bf33bcd15bb32fadd247b4a29ecaac9c1ad73","entryHash":"f41bfb607779f2c8918078634c3628983d99b13fa0372b4400cccf88b9656ebd","category":"Environment"}
