{"title":"Cartographic Visualisation of Light Pollution Measurements","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2227/v1","date":1727443999000,"content":"Light pollution of the night sky is a phenomenon increasingly observed around the world and reported in the form of thematic maps. The major contributor to light pollution is ill-adjusted or inappropriately designed artificial lighting by outdoor light sources. The phenomenon occurs mainly over urban areas, but affects both the urban environment and the areas adjacent to it. The problem of excessive artificial light emission at night and the negative effects it causes has already become so serious and global in its impact that effective and comprehensible methods of cartographic presentation of this phenomenon have been explored. The literature on the subject provides examples of how to present the results of measurements of light pollution of the night sky, but these have been developed using different colour scales, often in discretionary ranges and units of measurement. This paper presents an overview of the measurement scales and units found in the literature to describe the phenomenon of light pollution that obscures the night sky. A proposal of the authorâ€™s color scale for the presentation of the phenomenon was proposed and shown by example. The differences between measurement scales and how they affect interpretation of results are discussed. Furthermore, a recommendation is made for a standardised method of cartographic visualisation of the spatial distribution and presentation of light smog measurement results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d61e008cc73467a4ef246b615525e5edb26afd4d2b25908f827ac9d423f8fbc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
