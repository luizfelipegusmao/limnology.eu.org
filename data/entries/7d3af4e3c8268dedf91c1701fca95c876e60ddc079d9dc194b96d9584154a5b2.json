{"title":"Environmental Concern and Eco-Entrepreneurial Intention: The Mediating Effects of Nature-Based Solutions and Self-Efficacy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1692/v1","date":1721630112000,"content":"Environmental responsibility is crucial in both consumption and production processes. Increasing environmental concerns of societies require eco-innovative and nature-based solutions (NBS) for entrepreneurs. Young people's intentions as potential innovators and entrepreneurs on eco-entrepreneurship with mediating effects have not been investigated is a shortcoming in the literature. This study was conducted with 920 respondents from a public university (Düzce University) students to determine the underlying motivations of eco-entrepreneurship intentions using structural equation modeling (SEM) and bootstrap methodology. SEM results show that environmental concerns have a positive direct effect (β=0.62) on students’ eco-entrepreneurship intention. This study can serve the several sustainable development goals (SDGs) making suggestions for the efficient and effective use of production factors in terms of environmentally responsible behavior. Study results provide data for sustainable business applications and eco-innovative thinking. Study results intend the direction of modern environmental governance, policy makers and SEM developers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d3af4e3c8268dedf91c1701fca95c876e60ddc079d9dc194b96d9584154a5b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
