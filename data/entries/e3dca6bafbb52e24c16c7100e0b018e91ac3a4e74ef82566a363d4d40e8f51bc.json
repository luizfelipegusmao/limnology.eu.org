{"title":"Thermochromic Polymers in Food Packaging: A Comprehensive Systematic Review and Patent Landscape Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0246/v1","date":1725366256000,"content":"This study addresses the gap in research on the application of thermochromic polymers (TPs) in food packaging and their potential for real-time temperature monitoring, aiding in the assessment of food quality and shelf-life. TPs exhibit a visible color change in response to temperature varia-tions. A comprehensive systematic review (SR) across multiple engineering peer-review databases using predefined terms was conducted. Additionally, international patent databases were inves-tigated using the same predefined terms. Independent experts reviewed the methodology to identify and address potential biases. A total of 288 eligible articles and 922 patents were identified.  After a duplicate selection and extraction process according to the inclusion criteria, four related full-text publications were selected from the initial 288 articles, and five relevant patents were selected from the 922 patents.  The qualitative review suggests that TPs hold significant promise as food packaging materials due to their unique physical properties. The study concludes that TPs offer valuable properties for the food packaging industry, meriting further investigation to exploit their benefits fully.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3dca6bafbb52e24c16c7100e0b018e91ac3a4e74ef82566a363d4d40e8f51bc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
