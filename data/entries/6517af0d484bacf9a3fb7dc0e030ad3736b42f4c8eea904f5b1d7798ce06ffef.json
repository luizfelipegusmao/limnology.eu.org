{"title":"Responses of peritubular macrophages and the testis transcriptome profiles of peripubertal and adult rodents exposed to an acute dose of MEHP","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/198/1/76/7479712?rss=1","date":1702944000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Exposure of rodents to mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) is known to disrupt the blood-testis barrier and cause testicular germ cell apoptosis. Peritubular macrophages (PTMφ) are a newly identified type of testicular macrophage that aggregates near the spermatogonial stem cell niche. We have previously reported that MEHP exposure increased the numbers of PTMφs by 6-fold within the testis of peripubertal rats. The underlying mechanism(s) accounting for this change in PTMφs and its biological significance is unknown. This study investigates if MEHP-induced alterations in PTMφs occur in rodents (PND 75 adult rats and PND 26 peripubertal mice) that are known to be less sensitive to MEHP-induced testicular toxicity. Results show that adult rats have a 2-fold higher basal level of PTMφ numbers than species-matched peripubertal animals, but there was no significant increase in PTMφ numbers after MEHP exposure. Peripubertal mice have a 5-fold higher basal level of PTMφ compared with peripubertal rats but did not exhibit increases in number after MEHP exposure. Further, the interrogation of the testis transcriptome was profiled from both the MEHP-responsive peripubertal rats and the less sensitive rodents via 3′ Tag sequencing. Significant changes in gene expression were observed in peripubertal rats after MEHP exposure. However, adult rats showed lesser changes in gene expression, and peripubertal mice showed only minor changes. Collectively, the data show that PTMφ numbers are associated with the sensitivity of rodents to MEHP in an age- and species-dependent manner.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"6517af0d484bacf9a3fb7dc0e030ad3736b42f4c8eea904f5b1d7798ce06ffef","category":"Environment"}
