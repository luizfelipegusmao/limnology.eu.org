{"title":"Cemented Calcar-Guided Short-Stem Prostheses in Geriatric Patients: Short-Term Results from a Prospective Observational Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0484/v1","date":1720437034000,"content":"Both cementless and cemented stems have exhibited favorable long-term outcomes in total hip arthroplasty. Nonetheless, in elderly patients, cemented hips offer an advantage because of their reduced risk of periprosthetic fractures.\nThe present study aimed to assess the initial outcomes of 28 patients who underwent unilateral cemented total hip arthroplasty utilizing the calcar-guided A2 stem (Artiqo GmbH, LÃ¼dinghausen, Germany). Various types of antibiotic-loaded cement were employed. Demographic data, comorbidities, and standardized clinical assessment tools, including the Harris Hip Score, were utilized during the follow-up. Radiographic assessments included preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up imaging to evaluate subsidence, osteolysis, and bone resorption.\nThe results indicated that among the 28 patients, 5 withdrew consent, and 2 patients passed away from unrelated causes. Additionally, one prosthesis was explanted because of undersizing of the cement stopper, resulting in an inadequate cement mantle. As a result, 20 patients underwent a 1-year follow-up, revealing noteworthy enhancements in clinical scores, with no instances of radiolucent lines or osteolysis.\nIn summary, our short-term experience with this particular cemented short-stem design yielded promising results, exhibiting excellent functional outcomes and no aseptic loosening attributable to the stem. Further clinical studies and registry data are essential to corroborate these findings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76f79b4fb8304631d2fc73b5209a2d1dbbe631f61062f16c7eeeadb8a55b0f7d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
