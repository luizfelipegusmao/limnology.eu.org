{"title":"Comprehensive Review on the Impact of Chemical Composition, Plasma Treatment, and Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) Irradiation on the Electrical Properties of Organosilicate Films","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0106/v1","date":1719831595000,"content":"Organosilicate glass (OSG) films are a vital component in modern electronic devices, with their electrical properties playing a crucial role in device performance. This comprehensive review systematically examines the influence of chemical composition, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation, and plasma treatment on the electrical properties of OSG films. Through an extensive survey of literature and experimental findings, we elucidate the intricate interplay between these factors and the resultant alterations in electrical conductivity, dielectric constant, and breakdown strength of OSG films. Key focus areas include the impact of diverse organic moieties incorporated into the silica matrix, the effects of VUV irradiation on film properties, and the modifications induced by various plasma treatment techniques. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying mechanisms governing these phenomena, shedding light on the intricate molecular interactions and structural rearrangements occurring within OSG films under different environmental conditions. This review not only consolidates existing knowledge but also identifies gaps in understanding and suggests avenues for future research, thereby advancing our comprehension of OSG film behavior and paving the way for enhanced performance in next-generation electronic and photonic devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd0d6bc91404273ebcc1ddf4eb188be63876b1cb1ce6be27da1ab08d9741f2aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
