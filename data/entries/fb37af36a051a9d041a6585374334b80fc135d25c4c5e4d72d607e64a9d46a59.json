{"title":"Changes in mechanical properties at the muscle level could be detected by Nakagami imaging during <i>in-vivo</i> fixed-end contractions","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308177","date":1726236000000,"content":"<p>by Andrea Monte, Po-Hsian Tsui, Paola Zamparo</p>\r\n\r\nIn this study, we investigated the capability of the Nakagami transformation to detect changes in vastus lateralis muscle-tendon stiffness (<i>k</i>) during dynamic (and intense) contractions. <i>k</i> was evaluated in eleven healthy males using the gold-standard method (a combination of ultrasound and dynamometric measurements) during maximal and sub-maximal voluntary fixed-end contractions of the knee extensors (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of maximum voluntary force), while Nakagami parameters were analysed using the Nakagami transformation during the same contractions. Muscle-belly behaviour was investigated by means of B-mode ultrasound analysis, while Nakagami parameters were obtained in post-processing using radiofrequency data. <i>k</i> was calculated as the slope of the force-muscle-belly elongation relationship. Three contractions at each intensity were performed to calculate the intra-trial reliability and the coefficient of variation (CV) of the Nakagami parameters. At all contraction intensities, high values of intra-trial reliability (range: 0.92â€“0.96) and low CV (&lt;9%) were observed. <i>k</i> and Nakagami parameters increased as a function of contraction intensity, and significant positive correlations were observed between these variables. These data suggest that changes in mechanical properties (e.g., stiffness) at the muscle level could be investigated by means of Nakagami parameters.","author":"Andrea Monte","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fb37af36a051a9d041a6585374334b80fc135d25c4c5e4d72d607e64a9d46a59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
