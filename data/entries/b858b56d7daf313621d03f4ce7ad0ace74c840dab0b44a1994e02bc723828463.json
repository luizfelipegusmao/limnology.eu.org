{"title":"Educator perceptions of the complex needs of young people in Pupil Referral Units: An exploratory qualitative analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310633","date":1726754400000,"content":"<p>by Dennis Kaip, Nigel Blackwood, Sarah Kew-Simpson, Alice Wickersham, Joel Harvey, Hannah Dickson</p>\r\nBackground <p>Alternative education provision such as Pupil Referral Units support young people who have been excluded from mainstream school settings and often from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, there is limited research to date exploring educators’ perceptions of the complex needs of young people in PRUs, and the extent to which PRUs as currently configured can meet such needs.</p> Methods <p>Between March 2019 and October 2020 twenty-two participants holding various educational roles from five different Pupil Referral Units across London and Southeast England were interviewed. The interviews aimed to explore the participants’ experiences of working with students in PRU’s and examine some of the challenges that they might encounter. Semi-structured interviews were analysed using Reflexive thematic analysis.</p> Results <p>The three identified themes and their sub-themes highlighted the complex needs of these young people and identified significant barriers to effective service provision. The first theme ‘Complexities of PRU population’ highlighted the challenges that young people in PRUs face and perceived systemic short falls in addressing such complexity. The second theme ‘Challenges of the PRU environment’ highlights the frustrations that educators experience when it comes to providing adequate support to young people in PRU’s, the absence of agency support, and the uncertainty that these educational settings can bring. The third theme ‘Peer Group Influences’ highlights the impact of peer groups from beyond the classroom on engagement within the classroom.</p> Conclusions <p>Despite the clear complex needs of young people in PRUs, staff reported feeling ill-equipped to support these individuals and lacked access to effective inter-agency support. Participants reported that pupils’ mental health difficulties were exacerbated by exclusion and reintegration practices, an over-zealous focus on educational outcomes and the impact of gang influences on their school lives. Implications include more specific mental health training for staff working in PRU’s, improved inter-agency working and the incorporation of trauma-informed approaches in educational practice.</p>","author":"Dennis Kaip","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b858b56d7daf313621d03f4ce7ad0ace74c840dab0b44a1994e02bc723828463","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
