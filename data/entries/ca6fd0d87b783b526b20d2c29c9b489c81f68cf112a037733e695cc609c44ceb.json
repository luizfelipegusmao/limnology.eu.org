{"title":"Solute Hardening and Softening of BCC Metals: Excerpts from an Early Life with Terry Mitchell","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.513/7720112?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>A quasi-nostalgic review in three parts: (1) One of the early research areas in which Terry Mitchell made a major impact involved critical experiments and insightful modeling of the mechanical behavior, dislocations, and dislocation substructures of body centered cubic metals. He and his students (to mention a few: Spitzig, Raffo, Webb, Smialek) were able to characterize the strength of bcc refractory metals and the corresponding dislocation substructures determined expertly by transmission electron microscopy. They eventually demonstrated the additive but also interacting roles of the Peierls stress of screw dislocations and dislocation-interstitial solute interactions at temperatures below about 0.15T<sub>m</sub>. Raffo’s thesis involving experiments on Ta-base substitutional solid solutions was one of the first investigations to disclose solute softening of bcc metals. Terry’s initial analysis of solute softening was in terms of an ‘intrinsic’ solute-induced reduction in Peierls stress of screw dislocations. (2) Through my background in the thermodynamics of solute-solute interactions in bcc-metal solid solutions and an interest in expanding this work into mechanical behavior, Terry’s research expertise became a natural starting point for our nearly two-decade collaboration. The specific collaboration on solute softening went from my initial suggestion that ‘extrinsic’ solute-solute interactions involving unintended interstitial solute impurities might play a role, to our joint experimental demonstrations that these extrinsic interactions often caused the phenomenon, to an eventual understanding, more Terry’s than mine, that there are instances in different materials when either intrinsic or extrinsic softening (or both) occur. Part of our collaboration culminated in the 1973 Gibala-Mitchell Scripta Metallurgica paper “Solid Solution Softening and Hardening.” This paper came down hard in favor of extrinsic mechanisms, perhaps too hard as outlined briefly herein. (3) In the times since the Scripta Met. paper, the understanding of solute softening has evolved. Mechanical data on very high purity bcc metals and alloys or materials in which remnant interstitial solutes are well-gettered by modest Ti additions show evidence of an operative intrinsic softening. At the same time, other experiments on carefully prepared high-purity binary and ternary alloys have shown instances where the high-purity binary alloys exhibit only solute hardening, while similar high-purity ternary alloys that contain at least one interstitial solute exhibit solute softening in a slightly displaced yield stress-temperature space. I will review some key experimental results by our students and other investigators and comment on how recent modeling and computational materials research are bringing fresh insight into this phenomenon. Everything said and shown will incorporate, directly or indirectly, my fond and thankful memories of knowing and collaborating with my good friend Terry Mitchell.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ca6fd0d87b783b526b20d2c29c9b489c81f68cf112a037733e695cc609c44ceb","category":"Environment"}
