{"title":"Genomic analysis reveals phylogeny of Zygophyllales and mechanism for water retention of a succulent xerophyte","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/617/7591235?rss=1","date":1706486400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Revealing the genetic basis for stress-resistant traits in extremophile plants will yield important information for crop improvement. <span>Zygophyllum xanthoxylum</span>, an extant species of the ancient Mediterranean, is a succulent xerophyte that can maintain a favorable water status under desert habitats; however, the genetic basis of this adaptive trait is poorly understood. Furthermore, the phylogenetic position of Zygophyllales, to which <span>Z. xanthoxylum</span> belongs, remains controversial. In this study, we sequenced and assembled the chromosome-level genome of <span>Z. xanthoxylum</span>. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Zygophyllales and Myrtales form a separated taxon as a sister to the clade comprising fabids and malvids, clarifying the phylogenetic position of Zygophyllales at whole-genome scale. Analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data revealed multiple critical mechanisms underlying the efficient osmotic adjustment using Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> as â€œcheap\" osmolytes that <span>Z. xanthoxylum</span> has evolved through the expansion and synchronized expression of genes encoding key transporters/channels and their regulators involved in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> uptake, transport, and compartmentation. It is worth noting that ZxCNGC1;1 (cyclic nucleotide-gated channels) and ZxCNGC1;2 constituted a previously undiscovered energy-saving pathway for Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Meanwhile, the core genes involved in biosynthesis of cuticular wax also featured an expansion and upregulated expression, contributing to the water retention capacity of <span>Z. xanthoxylum</span> under desert environments. Overall, these findings boost the understanding of evolutionary relationships of eudicots, illustrate the unique water retention mechanism in the succulent xerophyte that is distinct from glycophyte, and thus provide valuable genetic resources for the improvement of stress tolerance in crops and insights into the remediation of sodic lands.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"885fe0de97c690e0c768d591771aaa3dc99cb7278b4f2e46b44ee96f3dce87b7","category":"Environment"}
