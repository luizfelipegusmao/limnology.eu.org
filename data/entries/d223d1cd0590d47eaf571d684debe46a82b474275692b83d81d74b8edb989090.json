{"title":"Ceramic membrane filtration of water samples from Ain Fayda Lake and cement factory (Al‐Ain), United Arab Emirates","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14268?af=R","date":1709812904000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This article presents a Ceramic Membrane-based Produced Water Treatment Technology and its application to water samples from Al-Ain (Abu Dhabi Emirate, United Arab Emirates). The samples were collected during the summer of 2022 from Ain Fayda (lake water) and Al-Ain cement factory (groundwater). This study investigates the effectiveness of the ceramic membrane for treating water samples and removing solid particles. A dead-end filtration mode with a filtration flux of 3 m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>/d was used. For the Ain Fayda Lake water sample, the transmembrane pressure during filtration reached 120 kPa (temperature adjusted to 25°C); air blowing was used to reduce the transmembrane pressure to around 70 kPa and Total Suspended Solids were reduced from 1.4 to &lt;1 mg/L during 160 min of filtration. For the Al-Ain cement factory water sample, the transmembrane pressure during filtration reached 160 kPa (temperature adjusted to 25°C); air blowing reduced the transmembrane pressure to around 65 kPa and the Total Suspended Solids from 9.1 to &lt;1 mg/L during 130 min of filtration. Both water samples belong to the Na-Cl water type. Overall, this work shows the effectiveness of the Ceramic Membrane-based Produced Water Treatment Technology for reducing Total Suspended Solids in sampled waters; thus, we recommend this approach for treating surface waters in Al-Ain to improve the environment and possible usage in agriculture.</p>","author":"Hakim Saibi, \nNakamura Arata, \nKawamura Kazuyuki, \nBalqees Mohamed, \nNouf Alblooshi, \nShama Almheiri","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"d223d1cd0590d47eaf571d684debe46a82b474275692b83d81d74b8edb989090","category":"Environment"}
