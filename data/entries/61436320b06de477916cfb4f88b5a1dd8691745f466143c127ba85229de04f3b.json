{"title":"Investigation of Water Hammer Effect on the Transmission Main Pipeline of\nSu’ula -Manda Water Supply Schemes, Afar, Ethiopia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1213/v1","date":1726475634000,"content":"This research delves into the water hammer occurrences, in the transmission pipeline of the SMD (Manda Daba) Multi Village Water Supply Schemes in Afar, Ethiopia. It utilizes simulation software, Bentley HAMMER version 8i to assess transient flow issues and the effectiveness of protective measures. The study pinpoints high risk areas in Scenario 1 marked by pressure spikes, negative pressures and frequent cavitation highlighting the importance of efforts. Prior to safeguards significant pressures reaching 288.27 m H₂O and minimum pressures dropping as low as 9.98 m H₂O are observed. In Scenario 2 where protective measures are implemented notable enhancements are seen with pressures ranging from 121.38 m H₂O to 150.49 m H₂O improved safety levels and substantial reductions in minimum pressures at pump stations.\nMoreover the study delves into Scenario 3 which explores pipe materials and diameters to provide insights, for pipeline design standards. It emphasizes how protective measures effectively mitigate water hammer effects while also highlighting cost saving potential by incorporating 2000 liter hydro tanks at pump stations. This integration leads to decreased pipeline collapses and maintenance expenses underscoring the significance of addressing challenges pinpointing failure causes and offering solutions to enhance system performance and strengthen reliability within the SMD water supply system","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61436320b06de477916cfb4f88b5a1dd8691745f466143c127ba85229de04f3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
