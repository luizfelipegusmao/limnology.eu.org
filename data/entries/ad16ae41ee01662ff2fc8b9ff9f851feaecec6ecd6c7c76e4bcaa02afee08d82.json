{"title":"AI-Driven Optimization of Urban Logistics in Smart Cities: Integrating Autonomous Vehicles and IoT for Efficient Delivery Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0396/v1","date":1725517223000,"content":"Urban logistics is a critical component of smart city initiatives, aiming to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of goods delivery in densely populated areas. This paper explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to optimize urban logistics. By leveraging real-time data from IoT-enabled infrastructure and AI-driven analytics, we propose a framework for dynamic route planning, traffic signal control, and predictive demand management for delivery services.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad16ae41ee01662ff2fc8b9ff9f851feaecec6ecd6c7c76e4bcaa02afee08d82","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
