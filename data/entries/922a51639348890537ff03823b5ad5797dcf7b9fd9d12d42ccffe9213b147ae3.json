{"title":"Seroprevalence of Dengue Virus Infection in Ghana: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2377/v1","date":1727693234000,"content":"Background: Dengue virus (DENV) infection poses a serious yet underaddressed public health challenge in many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. The epidemiology of DENV in Ghana is not well understood despite heightened risks due to suitable climatic conditions and the presence of competent vectors.\nAim: We aimed to systematically review studies reporting dengue virus seroprevalence in Ghana and pool estimates through meta-analysis.\nMethods: PRISMA guidelines were followed to search the literature using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases from inception to September 24, 2024. Studies presenting primary DENV seroprevalence data among Ghanaian populations were included. Quality was assessed using JBI tools. Meta-analyses estimated pooled prevalence with 95% CIs using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was evaluated using I2 statistic.\nResults: A total of 9 studies met the selection criteria, with 8 studies involving febrile patients and 1 involving blood donors. The pooled seroprevalence rates were 33% (95% CI: 16–50%) for IgG, 6% (95% CI: 0–12%) for IgM, 2% (95% CI: 0–3%) for DENV RNA, and 32% (95% CI: 0–68%) for IgG/IgM combined. Notably, the IgG seroprevalence exhibited substantial heterogeneity (I2=99%). DENV-2 and DENV-3 were the predominant serotypes identified.\nConclusion: This review established the prevalence and circulation of DENV in serogroups in Ghana. Higher seropositivity and heterogeneity underscore the need for standardized large-scale surveillance to optimize disease characterization and guide control. Integrating dengue preven-tion into existing vector control programs could help reduce risks in Ghana.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"922a51639348890537ff03823b5ad5797dcf7b9fd9d12d42ccffe9213b147ae3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
