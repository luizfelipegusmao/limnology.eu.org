However, most supports for single atom (SA) incorporation exhibit non-uniform physical dimensions and random surface arrangements [<a href=\"#ozae044.788-B1\">1</a>]. The effects of support characteristics, such as size, shape, exposed facets, and grain boundaries on the structure and stability of SAs, remain largely unexplored. Closed gas cell systems for in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) present a promising approach to investigate the dynamic evolution of subnanometric metal species under various gaseous conditions, up to atmospheric pressure and 1000Â°C [<a href=\"#ozae044.788-B2\">2</a>]. Nonetheless, the inherent instability of single atoms under the electron beam has limited the direct observation of their structural dynamics. Consequently, two critical questions for single-atom catalysts (SACs) remain unresolved: how the support structure influences single atom stability, and how to directly observe the dynamics of single atoms using in situ electron microscopy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fff90d044ad2f4b6735a99bbfaca39b499d328fe99badc3f571d35de95378813","category":"Environment"}
