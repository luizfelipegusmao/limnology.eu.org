Mainstream products were developed by leading manufacturers such as 3M, with well-known brand names including Thermofax<sup>TM</sup> and Dual Spectrum [<a href=\"#ozae044.064-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.064-B2\">2</a>]. Federal government agencies in the United States were among the early adopters. As a result, many government records printed on these media were accessioned into the National Archives and Records Administration’s (NARA’s) holdings. Within decades, visible degradation became obvious, including background browning, increasing fragility and vulnerability to tearing, among others. Risk of irretrievable information losses became a concern. This presentation reports part of the outcomes from NARA’s systematic investigations into the preservation risks to holdings printed on historic thermal recording media, specifically the risk of light fading under museum display or in archival research rooms.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4ae98799c53b463ca3c2a30094b955cc200ad0cc0f8e5d8eea3f4490249f0db5","category":"Environment"}
