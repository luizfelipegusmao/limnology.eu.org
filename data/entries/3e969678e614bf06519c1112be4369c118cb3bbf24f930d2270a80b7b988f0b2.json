{"title":"324 Use of organoids as in vitro model to study intestinal function","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/132/7757412?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Organoids are tridimensional structures cultured in the lab from stem cells. Organoids have been developed for many different organs, particularly those with Lgr5+ stem cells. The organs of the digestive system belong to this group of organs and to date, organoids have been established from all the digestive tract tissues and organs including liver, gall bladder and pancreas. Although most protocols to generate organoids have focused on human and mouse organs, organoids from domestic and production animals like dogs, cats, rabbits, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and horses are actively used in research. In this presentation, the principles of developing intestinal organoids will be covered, along with a summary of how they have been used to address intestinal function and disease in our lab and by others. In our lab, we use swine enteroids (intestinal organoids) to study the intestinal epithelial responses to nutrients and pathogens. We have explored differential responses of the intestinal epithelium to organic and inorganic sources of dietary zinc, and we are currently investigating the mechanism of pathogenesis of <span>Lawsonia intracellularis</span>, the causative agent of porcine intestinal adenopathy. We will also discuss methods for modeling intestinal physiology using enteroids, and the advantages and challenges of working with swine enteroids.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"3e969678e614bf06519c1112be4369c118cb3bbf24f930d2270a80b7b988f0b2","category":"Environment"}
