Electron diffraction is the most common method to solve for unknown or partially known crystal structures, as it provides direct and interpretable feedback on the orientation of crystal grains under the beam [<a href=\"#ozae044.947-B1\">1</a>]. However, it remains a challenge to determine the crystal structure of a new material or even a new phase of an existing material. Analysis of such materials commonly requires manual exploration and comparison with simulated diffraction patterns. This is often a time consuming process with no obvious start point when many similar structures are possible, and this method cannot be used to determine crystal structure or orientation from structures not included in the diffraction libraries. Therefore, we have developed a machine learning model to determine the crystal structure of a material from its electron diffraction pattern.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"14b42ea72c05c64a1b95ff2bdb84ba810530f42f43808f49513b5829d36a6f20","category":"Environment"}
