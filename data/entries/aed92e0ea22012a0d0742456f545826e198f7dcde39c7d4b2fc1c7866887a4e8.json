{"title":"Review: Toward sustainable management of groundwater in the deserts of Egypt","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10040-023-02738-y","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>To achieve its ambitious plans to reclaim its deserts through mega projects, Egypt is heavily relying on fossil or little-recharged groundwater. This article revisits the results and methodologies of the studies conducted over the last two decades on groundwater management and uses in the Western Desert. Most previous studies aimed at simulating different groundwater abstraction scenarios by modeling local areas in aquifer systems, but with poor definitions of boundary conditions and limited historical data. Studies were constrained by the unavailability of data, access difficulties, and high collection costs in desert lands. Thus, to propose reliable sustainable groundwater resources development plans and recommendations for future protection strategies, an open-access monitoring network representing regional aquifers is needed. More investigations based on extensive field visits are essential to monitor environmental, economic, and social conditions, identify constraints, and learn lessons for reclaiming desert lands. Moreover, this review highlighted the need to frame a rational strategy for the long-term sustainable exploitation of non-renewable groundwater in the aquifer systems of Egypt and develop an appropriate exit strategy for desert communities in case of serious water resource depletion.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"aed92e0ea22012a0d0742456f545826e198f7dcde39c7d4b2fc1c7866887a4e8","category":"Environment"}
