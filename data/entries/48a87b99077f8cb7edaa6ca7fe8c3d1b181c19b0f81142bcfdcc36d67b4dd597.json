Our behavioral analyses revealed that triploid Pacific bluefin tuna (<i>Thunnus orientalis</i>) larvae exhibit lower sensitivity to light compared to diploids. Furthermore, histological analyses revealed a reduction in the number of ganglion cells and an increase in their size in the retinas of triploid <i>T. orientalis</i> larvae. Our findings provide the first evidence indicating that triploidization reduces sensory perception during the larval stage of fish.</p>","author":"Takao Hayashida, \nKentaro Higuchi, \nKogen Okita, \nToshinori Takashi, \nYukinori Kazeto, \nKoichiro Gen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"48a87b99077f8cb7edaa6ca7fe8c3d1b181c19b0f81142bcfdcc36d67b4dd597","category":"Environment"}
