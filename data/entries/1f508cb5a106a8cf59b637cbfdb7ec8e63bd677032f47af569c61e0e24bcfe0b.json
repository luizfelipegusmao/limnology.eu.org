{"title":"Thermospermine Is an Evolutionarily Ancestral Phytohormone Required for Organ Development and Stress Responses in Marchantia Polymorpha","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/3/460/7511241?rss=1","date":1704412800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Thermospermine suppresses auxin-inducible xylem differentiation, whereas its structural isomer, spermine, is involved in stress responses in angiosperms. The thermospermine synthase, ACAULIS5 (ACL5), is conserved from algae to land plants, but its physiological functions remain elusive in non-vascular plants. Here, we focused on Mp<span>ACL5</span>, a gene in the liverwort <span>Marchantia polymorpha</span>, that rescued the dwarf phenotype of the <span>acl5</span> mutant in <span>Arabidopsis</span>. In the Mp<span>acl5</span> mutants generated by genome editing, severe growth retardation was observed in the vegetative organ, thallus, and the sexual reproductive organ, gametangiophore. The mutant gametangiophores exhibited remarkable morphological defects such as short stalks, fasciation and indeterminate growth. Two gametangiophores fused together, and new gametangiophores were often initiated from the old ones. Furthermore, Mp<span>acl5</span> showed altered responses to heat and salt stresses. Given the absence of spermine in bryophytes, these results suggest that thermospermine has a dual primordial function in organ development and stress responses in <span>M. polymorpha</span>. The stress response function may have eventually been assigned to spermine during land plant evolution.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"1f508cb5a106a8cf59b637cbfdb7ec8e63bd677032f47af569c61e0e24bcfe0b","category":"Environment"}
