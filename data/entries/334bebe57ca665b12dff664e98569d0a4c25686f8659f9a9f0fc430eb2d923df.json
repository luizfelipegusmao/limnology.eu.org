{"title":"The Current State of Cell Viability Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0758/v1","date":1726019046000,"content":"Cell viability refers to the proportion of living, healthy cells within a given population. This information is crucial in any cell-based research, especially in toxicology. Over the past century, numerous methods for assessing cell viability have been developed. These methods can be categorized into five main types: non-invasive cell structure damage, invasive cell structure damage, cell growth, cellular metabolism, and cell membrane potential. Each method operates on different principles and has its own advantages and disadvantages, making it essential for researchers to choose the method that best fits their experimental design. Despite the variety of cell viability methods available, most rely on indirect measurements of cell viability, which may compromise their accuracy. In this sense, there is insufficient information regarding their accuracy, highlighting the need for researchers to investigate the accuracy of both existing and future methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"334bebe57ca665b12dff664e98569d0a4c25686f8659f9a9f0fc430eb2d923df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
