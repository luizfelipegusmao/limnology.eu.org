{"title":"Pentoxifylline and Norcantharidin Modify p62 Expression in 2D and 3D Cultures of B16F1 Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0934/v1","date":1713169248000,"content":"3D cell cultures have improved the evaluation of drugs for cancer therapy, due to their high similarity to solid tumors. In melanoma, autophagy appears to show a dual role depending on the progression of the disease. p62 protein has been proposed for the evaluation of autophagic flux since its expression is an indicator of the state of autophagy. Pentoxifylline (PTX) and Norcantharidin (NCTD) are drugs that have been shown to have anticancer effects in various types of cancer. In this work, B16F1 mouse melanoma cell line was used, from which two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures and three-dimensional (3D) organoids were carried out using the hanging drop technique. The expression of p62 was determined by western blot and immunofluorescences. Our results indicate that pentoxifylline reduces p62 expression in both types of culture. While Norcantharidin increases its expression in 3D cultures at 24 h. Therefore, these drugs could have a potential therapeutic use for the regulation of autophagy in melanoma, depending on the state of evolution of the disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9fb42a81b8c07e7194507379bc313f56ac94192bf1360ff9e89ed943d54e0ec7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
