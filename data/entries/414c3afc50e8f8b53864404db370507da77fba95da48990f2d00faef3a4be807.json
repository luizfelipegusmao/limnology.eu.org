{"title":"A Universal Image Compression Sensing-Encryption Algorithm Based on DNA-Triploid Mutation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1958/v1","date":1716985218000,"content":"As the fast growth of information technology (IT), the safety of image transmission and the storing of images are increasingly concerned. Traditional image encryption algorithms have certain limitations in transmission and security, so there is an urgent need for a secure and reliable image encryption algorithm. A universal compression sensing (CS) image encryption (IE) algorithm based on DNA-triploid mutation (DTM) is presented in this paper. Firstly, by using CS algorithm an image is compressed while obtaining a range of chaotic sequences by iteration of chaotic map. Then DNA sequences are generated by encoding the image, and based on the DTM, new mutant DNA sequences are generated according to specific rules. Next, the chaotic sequences are operated at the DNA level to do confusion and diffusion operations on the image to ensure the security of the data. At last, DNA decoding is carried out to obtain the compressed-encrypted image. Both simulation experiments and performance tests fully show that a high level of security and reliability of the proposed algorithm in protecting image privacy is achieved.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"414c3afc50e8f8b53864404db370507da77fba95da48990f2d00faef3a4be807","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
