{"title":"Whole-Genome Deep Sequencing of the Healthy Adult Nasal Microbiome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0811/v1","date":1712827678000,"content":"This study aimed to determine shifts in microbial populations regarding richness and diversity from daily use of a popular over-the-counter nasal spray.  In addition, the finding of nasal commensal bacterial species that overlap with the oral microbiome may prove to be potential probiotics for the “gateway microbiomes.” Nasal swab samples were obtained before and after using the most popular over-the-counter (OTC) nasal spray in 10 participants aged 18–48 years. All participants were healthy volunteers with no significant medical histories. The participants were randomly assigned a number by randomizing software and consisted of five men and five women. The sampling consisted of placing a nasal swab atraumatically into the nasal cavity, which is similar to the sampling performed for COVID-19 testing, with only very slight discomfort, if any. The samples were preserved and sent to Northwestern University Sequencing Center for whole-genome deep sequencing. After 21 days of OTC nasal spray use twice daily, the participants returned for further nasal microbiome sampling. The microbial analysis included all bacteria, archaea, viruses, molds, and yeasts via deep sequencing for species analysis. The Northwestern University Sequencing Center utilized artificial intelligence analysis to determine shifts in species and strains following nasal spray use that resulted in changes in diversity and richness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f5fdf270ce173a3db16b94d94cbaab9b19b1cb5bb499929561fbea151cc1453","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
