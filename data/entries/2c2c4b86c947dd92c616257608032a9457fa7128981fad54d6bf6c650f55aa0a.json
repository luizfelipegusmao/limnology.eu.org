{"title":"Simulated Practice Learning Experience in a Virtual Environment: An Innovative Pedagogical Approach to Practice Learning for Nursing Students","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1951/v1","date":1729776980000,"content":"Background/Objectives: In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors implemented an innovative and alternative approach to practice learning for a Cohort of Year One Adult and Mental Health student nurses.  The evaluation aimed to explore the effectiveness of virtual practice learning as a viable alternative to traditional practice placements and the impact on the student practice learning experience. \nMethods: All year one student nurses attending the four Simulated Practice Learning Experience (SPLE) weeks were invited to participate and complete a generated questionnaire within the virtual environment on their final day of each week. The evaluation employed a mixed methods approach to evaluate the effectiveness of the SPLE on student satisfaction and their overall practice learning experience. \nResults: A mean total of 205 student nurses completed the questionnaire, achieving a response rate of 98-100%.  Students reported an overall satisfaction score of 88%, highlighting their preparedness and positive feedback on the organisation, delivery, and content of the SPLE.  Qualitative analysis revealed key themes, including the development of transferable skills and personal growth, the value of peer learning, the benefits of a virtual environment, and appreciation of service user and healthcare professional input. Students reported significant personal growth, improved communication skills, and a deeper understanding of holistic care through interactive and collaborative learning experiences. \nConclusions: This evaluation underscores the innovative potential of virtual practice learning to enhance nursing education, emphasising the importance of integrating emerging technologies and diverse pedagogical approaches. The findings suggest that SPLEs can effectively prepare nursing students for the complexities of clinical practice while addressing the evolving demands of healthcare education. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to assess the sustained impact of virtual learning on clinical experiences and professional development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c2c4b86c947dd92c616257608032a9457fa7128981fad54d6bf6c650f55aa0a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
