{"title":"Assessing the Opportunities and Risks of DUS and VCU Variety Testing for Sustainable Production through SWOT Analysis Results","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2210/v1","date":1722324551000,"content":"Within the European Union (EU), new plant varieties, to be included at the Common catalog of a member state, has to be registered at the national list, after plant variety testing processes to establish whether the candidate variety is distinguishable, uniform and stable (DUS) and meets the requirement of the cultivation or use value requirement (VCU). Technical development, climate change and changing consumer needs, including the detection of GMOs, necessitate the innovation of plant variety testing methods. Within the EU-funded \"InnoVar\" project, it has been sent out questionnaires to several countries, which were aimed at analyzing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of the current methods and with their help it is possible to have look for a new direction, opportunity and strategy, which can incorporate together with the innovation results into the development of the new methods. Our study confirmed that the SWOT analysis could be used to achieve the set goals; according to the answers to the questionnaires, it became necessary to introduce new characters (e.g. cold tolerance) and new test methods (molecular markers, precision techniques, organic farming) into the variety testing procedures. The development of high-yielding, disease and/or pest-resistant plant varieties with good adaptability and the accurate evaluation of genotypes play a crucial role in ensuring that farmers can access high-performing plant varieties and contribute to sustainable food production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f131f43dab5051f1637f9258d8059c75f725ed4178640d949dd50db4938a466","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
