The magnitude of these effects depends on how climate change and rising CO<span>2</span> affect P cycling. Some effects are well established. First, P limitation often constrains CO<span>2</span> fertilization, and rising CO<span>2</span> often exacerbates P limitation. Second, P limitation and P constraints to CO<span>2</span> fertilization are more common in warmer and wetter sites. Models that couple P cycling to vegetation generally capture these outcomes. However, due largely to differences between short-term and long-term dynamics, the patterns observed across climatic gradients do not necessarily indicate how climate change over years to decades will modify P limitation. These annual-to-decadal effects are not well understood. Furthermore, even for the well-understood patterns, much remains to be learned about the quantitative details, mechanisms, and drivers of variability. The interface between empirical and modeling work is particularly ripe for development.</p></div>","author":"Duncan N.L. Menge, Sian Kou-Giesbrecht, Benton N. Taylor, Palani R.
