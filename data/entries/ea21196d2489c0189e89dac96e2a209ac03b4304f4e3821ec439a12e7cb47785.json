{"title":"Multi-Link Prediction for mmWave Wireless Communication Systems using Liquid Time-Constant Networks, Long Short-term Memory, and Interpretation using Symbolic Regression","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0128/v1","date":1719880532000,"content":"A significant challenge encountered in mmWave and Sub-terahertz systems used in 5G and 1 the upcoming 6G networks is the rapid fluctuation in signal quality across various beam directions. Extremely high-frequency waves are highly vulnerable to obstruction, making even slight adjustments in device orientation or the presence of blockers capable of causing substantial fluctuations in link quality along a designated path. This issue poses a major obstacle because numerous applications with low-latency requirements necessitate precise forecasting of network quality from many directions and cells. The method that is proposed in this research demonstrates an avant-garde approach for assessing the quality of multi-directional connections in mmWave systems by utilizing the Liquid Time Constant network (LTC) instead of the conventionally used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technique. The methodâ€™s validity was tested through an optimistic simulation involving the monitoring of multi-cell connections at 28 GHz in a scenario where humans and various obstructions were moving arbitrarily. The results with LTC are significantly better than those obtained by conventional approaches such as LSTM. The latter resulted in a test Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 3.44 dB, while the former, 0.25 dB, demonstrating a 13-fold improvement. For better interpretability and to illustrate the complexity of prediction, an approximate mathematical expression is also fitted to the simulated signal data using Symbolic Regression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea21196d2489c0189e89dac96e2a209ac03b4304f4e3821ec439a12e7cb47785","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
