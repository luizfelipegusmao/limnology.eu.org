{"title":"A Phosphatidyl Conjugated Telomerase-Dependent Telomere-Targeting Nucleoside Demonstrates Colorectal Cancer Direct Killing and Immune Signaling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2316/v1","date":1727600817000,"content":"Telomerase and telomeres are crucial in cancer cell immortalization, making them key targets for anticancer therapies. Currently, 6-thio-dG combined with the anti-PD1 inhibitor Cemiplimab is under Phase 2 clinical investigation (NCT05208944) in NSCLC patients resistant to prior immunotherapies. This study presents the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel bimodular conjugate molecules combining telomere-targeting nucleoside analogs and phosphatidyl diglyceride groups. Among them, dihexanoyl-phosphatidyl-THIO (diC6-THIO) showed high anticancer activity with sub-ÂµM EC50 values in vitro across various cancer cell lines. In mouse colorectal cancer models, diC6-THIO demonstrated strong anticancer effects alone and in combination with PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Administration of this compound resulted in the efficient formation of Telomere dysfunction Induced Foci (TIFs) in vitro, indicating an on-target, telomerase-mediated telomere-modifying mechanism of action for the molecule. Systemic treatment also activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells while reducing regulatory T cells, indicating immune system enhancement. These findings highlight diC6-THIO as a promising telomere-targeting prodrug with dual effects on telomere modification and immune activation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc03c75c65470881da8985080f3a3fdb75fdd24f807b3ab0777115cacba46fd9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
