{"title":"Practical Path for Developing &ldquo;New Quality Productive Forces&rdquo; Driven by the Digital Economy in China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1201/v1","date":1718696294000,"content":"In China, \"new quality productive forces\" have become an important focus for high-quality development; accelerating this development is an important task for the Chinese government in 2024. Such development relies on the traction of the digital economy. In view of this, developing “new quality productive forces” driven by the Chinese digital economy requires focusing on blocking points, such as the insufficient vitality of data, inadequate algorithmic regulation, the uneven distribution of computing power resources and the immature market environment. In order to dredge these blocking points, it is necessary to establish basic rules on data, strengthening algorithm supervision, building a national integrated computing power network, and optimizing the market environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da8696f277a921d1a611f22aab0412dd0eef3cd8b97b4a2ad51ad15f5786e748","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
