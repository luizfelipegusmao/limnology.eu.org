{"title":"Subgrid Turbulent Flux Models for Large Eddy Simulations of Diffusion Flames in Space Propulsion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0102/v1","date":1711976665000,"content":"Subgrid scale models for unresolved turbulent fluxes are investigated with a focus on combustion for space propulsion applications. An extension to the gradient model is proposed, introducing a dependency on the local burning regime. The dynamic behavior of the model's coefficients is investigated, and scaling laws are studied. The discussed models are validated using a DNS database of a high-pressure turbulent fuel-rich methane-oxygen diffusion flame. The operating point and turbulence characteristics are selected to resemble those of modern combustors for space propulsion applications to support the future usage of the devised model in this context.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46f62757237a2dafb28b5c88bda8fb89db7dd9ffc357ced2e7ee89e1253a5968","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
