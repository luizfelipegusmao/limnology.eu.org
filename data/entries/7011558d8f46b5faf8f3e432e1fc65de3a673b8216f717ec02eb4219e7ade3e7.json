{"title":"Population genetic diversity and structure of Tephritis angustipennis and Campiglossa loewiana (Diptera: Tephritidae) based on COI DNA barcodes in the three-river source region, China","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae075/7716307?rss=1","date":1721260800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Tephritis angustipennis</span> (Diptera: Tephritidae) and <span>Campiglossa loewiana</span> (Diptera: Tephritidae) are phytophagous pests in China. Their damage has significantly impacted the collection and cultivation of germplasm resources of native Asteraceae plants. However, the genetic characteristics and structure of their population are unclear. This study focused on the highly damaging species of <span>T. angustipennis</span> and <span>C. loewiana</span> collected from the three-river source region (TRSR). We amplified the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (mt<span>COI</span>) gene sequences of these pests collected from this area and compared them with <span>COI</span> sequences from GenBank. We also analyzed their genetic diversity and structure. In <span>T. angustipennis</span>, 5 haplotypes were identified from 5 geographic locations; the genetic differentiation between France population FRPY (from Nylandia, Uusimaa) and China populations GLJZ (from Dehe Longwa Village, Maqin County), GLDR (from Zhique Village, Dari County), and GLMQ (from Rijin Village, Maqin County) was the strongest. GLJZ exhibited strong genetic differentiation from GLDR and GLMQ, with relatively low gene flow. For <span>C. loewiana</span>, 11 haplotypes were identified from 5 geographic locations; the genetic differentiation between the Chinese population GLMQ-YY (from Yangyu Forest Farm, Maqin County) and Finnish population FDNL (from Nylandia, Uusimaa) was the strongest, with relatively low gene flow, possibly due to geographical barriers in the Qinghai–Tibet plateau. Only 1 haplotype was identified across GLDR, GLMQ, and GLBM. High gene flow between distant locations indicates that human activities or wind dispersal may facilitate the dispersal of fruit flies and across different geographic. Geostatistical analysis suggested a recent population expansion of these 2 species in TRSR. Our findings provide technical references for identifying pests in the TRSR region and theoretical support for managing resistance, monitoring pest occurrences, analyzing environmental adaptability, and formulating biological control strategies for Tephritidae pests on Asteraceae plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"7011558d8f46b5faf8f3e432e1fc65de3a673b8216f717ec02eb4219e7ade3e7","category":"Environment"}
