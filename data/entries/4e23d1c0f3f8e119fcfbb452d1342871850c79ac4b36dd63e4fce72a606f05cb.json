Among all different automated experiment (AE) attempts, human in the loop automated experiment (hAE) shows the advantage of combining the great computing capabilities of machines with the creativity of humans[<a href=\"#ozae044.1010-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1010-B2\">2</a>]. In a typical hAE workflow, human operators provide the reward function to define the goal of the experiment and experiment policy to guide the behavior of the machines. hAE for scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been proven successful in the form of deep kernel learning (DKL) for piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM)[<a href=\"#ozae044.1010-B3\">3</a>] and combinatorial library exploration[<a href=\"#ozae044.1010-B4\">4</a>]. It not only offers high-throughput characterization of materials, but also enables studying systems with huge amounts of data that human researchers cannot handle. In this talk, we will present our realization of AE on an Asylum Research Jupiter SPM system integrated with remote high-performance based computer control (ISAACS) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4e23d1c0f3f8e119fcfbb452d1342871850c79ac4b36dd63e4fce72a606f05cb","category":"Environment"}
