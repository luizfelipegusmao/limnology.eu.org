{"title":"Wood you believe it? Experimental addition of nonnative wood enhances instream habitat for native dryland fishes","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4334?af=R","date":1720153748000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Flow alteration and riparian vegetation encroachment are causing habitat simplification with severe consequences for native fishes. To assess the effectiveness of enhancing simplified habitat in a large dryland river, we experimentally added invasive wood at 19 paired treatment and reference (no wood added) subreaches (50–100 m) within the main channel of the San Juan River. Using a before-after-control-impact design, we sampled fishes and macroinvertebrates, and quantified habitat complexity. After wood addition, total native fish densities were 2.2× higher in treatments compared with references, whereas total nonnative fish densities exhibited no response. Macroinvertebrate densities were 6.8× higher, and habitat complexity increased in treatments. Counts of geomorphic features in treatments increased from 1 to a maximum of 11 following wood addition, while the number of features in references remained unchanged. Wood addition has potential to instigate natural riverine processes, ultimately enhancing native fish habitat by increasing macroinvertebrate densities and habitat complexity in dryland rivers. Water overallocation and increasing aridity will continue to challenge efforts to improve habitat conditions with environmental flows alone, and managers might consider integrating non-flow alternatives like addition of abundant, invasive wood to reduce habitat simplification.</p>","author":"Benjamin J.
