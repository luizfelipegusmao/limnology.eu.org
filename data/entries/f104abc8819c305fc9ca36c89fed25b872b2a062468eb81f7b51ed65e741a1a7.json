{"title":"Can Peripheral Vertigo Be Predicted?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0458/v1","date":1715159662000,"content":"Background and Objectives: Peripheral vertigo is one of the most common symptoms for which patients are seen by a neurologist in the emergency room. Symptoms of peripheral vertigo can range from lightheadedness to an illusion of spinning. On average, vertigo is diagnosed for older patients as its predicting factors from medical history are yet to be determined. The objective of the study was to predict peripheral vertigo based on medical history and risk factors. Materials and Methods: A prospective case-control study at the Neurology Department of Lithuanian University Hospital was conducted. 71 patients diagnosed with vertigo and 43 controls was included. They completed questionnaires and underwent evaluation by neurologists or otolaryngologists, with statistical analysis performed using IBM SPSS Statistics. Results: 58% of vertigo patients were diagnosed with peripheral vertigo, with significant predictors including age (&amp;gt;60), motion sickness, height intolerance, gastroesophageal reflux disease and dyslipidemia, leading to the development of a risk assessment table for the peripheral vertigo prediction. Conclusions: This study suggest that early identification of these predictors could enhance peripheral vertigo management, while further research with larger cohorts is needed to validate and expand upon these findings, emphasizing the importance of considering medical history and risk factors for predicting peripheral vertigo and improving patient care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f104abc8819c305fc9ca36c89fed25b872b2a062468eb81f7b51ed65e741a1a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
