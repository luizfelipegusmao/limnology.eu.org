{"title":"Design of Lipid Nanoparticles of mRNA Vaccine against Respiratory Syncytial Virus by Bioinformatics in Egypt","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0723/v1","date":1712733722000,"content":"Background:\nRespiratory syncytial virus[ RSV] is a lethal overwhelming defectiveness that influences people all over the world. The infection gets down in the lower respiratory tract and does not disperse to the remainder of the body. \nThe objective of the study:\nBioinformatics was used to create an mRNA vaccine against the Respiratory syncytial virus( RSV).\nMethodology:\nLipid nanoparticle vaccines containing the Respiratory syncytial virus's surface fusion protein's mRNA were created for the current screening experimental investigation. Lipid nanoparticles[ LNP] with a particle size of around 90 nanometres that were created using the hot micro-emulsion process comprise the current vaccine delivery system. In stages 1 and 2 of clinical trials, the immunogenicity of the current mRNA RSV vaccine was evaluated.\nResults:\nThe current vaccine demonstrated 81% immunogenicity in animal testing, but only 69% in stages 1 and 2 of clinical trials. Its side effects were manageable. The results persisted for a while. In the current trial, the vaccination proved effective as a preventative measure against RSV  infection. The current immunization lacks antibody-dependent enhancement, which causes non-protective antibodies to develop. These non-neutralizing antibodies worsen infection by enhancing viral entrance and replication in the host cells, activating cytokines and the complement cascade through the production of immunological complexes, or both. However, the current LPN-RSV mRNA vaccine of the surface fusion protein resulted in theÂ formation of potent neutralizing antibodies with persistent protection, especially for newborns and elderly individuals who get the ideal dose regimen. \nConclusion:\nThe invention of the LNP-mRNA RSV vaccine, which might prevent RSV-caused bronchiolitis and fatal pneumonia, made the current study promising","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b44554148b4f6adff6fbac18213d2728045570a03403e1660cbe7fb9361900c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
