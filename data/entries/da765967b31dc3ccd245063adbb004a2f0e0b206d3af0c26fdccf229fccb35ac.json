{"title":"Combination of Hydrolysable Tannins and Zinc Oxide on Enterocyte Functionality: In Vitro Insights","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0499/v1","date":1715167509000,"content":"In the symptomatic treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, high dosages of zinc oxide (ZnO) were conventionally employed. However, concerns regarding the potential for microbial resistance and ecological detriment have arisen due to the excessive application of this compound. These concerns highlight the urgency to minimize the use of ZnO and to explore sustainable nutritional solutions. Hydrolysable tannins (HTs), known for their role in traditional medicine for acute gastrointestinal issues, emerge as a promising alternative. This study examined the combined effect of food-grade HTs and lower ZnO concentration on relevant biological functions of Caco-2 cells, a widely used model of the intestinal epithelial barrier. We found that, when used together, ZnO and HTs (ZnO/HTs) enhanced tissue repair and improved epithelial barrier function, normalizing the expression and functional organization of tight junction proteins. Finally, the ZnO/HTs combination strengthened enterocyte defence against oxidative stress induced by inflammation stimuli. In conclusion, combining ZnO and HTs may offer a suitable and practical approach for decreasing ZnO levels in veterinary medical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da765967b31dc3ccd245063adbb004a2f0e0b206d3af0c26fdccf229fccb35ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
