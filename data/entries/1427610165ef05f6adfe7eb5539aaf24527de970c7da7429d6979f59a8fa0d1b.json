Using single-cell sequencing, we demonstrate that these 2 programs are segregated in distinct subpopulations in melanocytes of human and zebrafish skin. The coexistence of these 2 cell states in cultured melanocytes suggests possible cell autonomy. Luria–Delbrück fluctuation test reveals that the initial establishment of these states is stochastic. Tracking of pigmenting cells ascertains that the stochastically acquired state is faithfully propagated in the progeny. A systemic approach combining single-cell multi-omics (RNA+ATAC) coupled to enhancer mapping with H3K27 acetylation successfully identified state-specific transcriptional networks. This comprehensive analysis led to the construction of a gene regulatory network (GRN) that under the influence of noise, establishes a bistable system of pigmentation and proliferation at the population level. This GRN recapitulates melanocyte behaviour in response to external cues that reinforce either of the states. Our work highlights that inherent stochasticity within melanocytes establishes dedicated states, and the mature state is sustained by selective enhancers mark through histone acetylation. While the initial cue triggers a proliferation response, the continued signal activates and maintains the pigmenting subpopulation via epigenetic imprinting. Thereby our study provides the basis of coexistence of distinct populations which ensures effective pigmentation response while preserving the self-renewal capacity.","author":"Ayush Aggarwal","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"1427610165ef05f6adfe7eb5539aaf24527de970c7da7429d6979f59a8fa0d1b","category":"Environment"}
