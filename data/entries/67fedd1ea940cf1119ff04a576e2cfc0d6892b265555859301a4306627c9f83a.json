These capabilities enable studies of the interplay between fundamental properties of matter such as charge, spin and local chemistry, at the atomic scale. Provided the scattering geometry is carefully chosen to maximize signal [<a href=\"#ozae044.738-B2\">2</a>], it is now possible to study quasiparticles such as phonons in materials at atomic resolution, including at single atom defects [<a href=\"#ozae044.738-B3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.738-B4\">4</a>]. However, going beyond vibrational spectroscopy, there are many other excitations, including magnons, whose nanoscale signature may be detected with similar experimental strategies, possibly even down to the atomic scale.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"67fedd1ea940cf1119ff04a576e2cfc0d6892b265555859301a4306627c9f83a","category":"Environment"}
