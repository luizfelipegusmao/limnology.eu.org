{"title":"Isotherm Maps of Extreme Temperature Actions for Steel-Concrete Composite Girder in Plateau and Cold Area","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1631/v1","date":1729583110000,"content":"In order to accurately assess the temperature action and effect of steel-concrete composite girder bridges in plateau and cold area, this paper investigated nearly 50 years of historical meteorological data from 26 meteorological observation stations in the Tibet region of China, and numerical simulation of the temperature field of the composite girder was carried out by using the most unfavorable extreme meteorological conditions of each meteorological station as the boundary, respectively. The most unfavorable values of effective temperature and positive and negative vertical temperature gradients were obtained. The geographical variability of the temperature actions at different meteorological stations was analyzed, and the contour maps of the extreme values of the effective temperature and temperature gradient actions were further obtained by using the spatial interpolation method. The study shows that the effective temperature of the composite girder is significantly affected by the climatic environment, and the isotherm map can visualize the geographical distribution law of the effective temperature extremes of the concrete box girder. The maximum and minimum effective temperatures in Tibet range from 18.28 ℃ to 42.27 ℃ and from -41.07 ℃ to 4.71 ℃ respectively, with a geographic variability of 23.99 ℃ and 45.78 ℃ respectively. The maximum regional difference of positive and negative temperature gradient reaches 11.32 ℃ and 7.69 ℃ respectively. Referring to the Chinese specification and the European specification of the composite girder's temperature role in the value, the highest effective temperature and positive temperature gradient in most of the areas in Tibet is too conservative, and the lowest effective temperature and negative temperature gradient is not safe enough, which may lead to the composite girder bridges with cracking of the concrete deck slabs and the disease of the bearings and expansion joints.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a64981fcfbed7af327edfc73f1132bd084b221155283348cbce3d7854b06704","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
