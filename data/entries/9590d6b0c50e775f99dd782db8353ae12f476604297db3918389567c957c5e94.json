{"title":"Assessment of the Drought Regime in SA, Based on Drought and Vegetation Indices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0232/v1","date":1722848668000,"content":"Drought affects human and natural systems, human and animal life and health, and socioeconomic activities. Drought consequences depend on its type and class, but also on the preparedness and resistance of communities to this climate disturbance. In the last decades, droughts accounted for about 16% of the total number of disasters but were responsible for 95% of the number of deaths and 26% of economic losses in Africa. This study aims to assess the drought regime in Southern Africa based on drought and vegetation indices. The SPI and SPEI were calculated at different timescales, using ERA5 data for the 1971 – 2020 period. The spatiotemporal distribution of drought descriptors was analyzed and compared with the patterns of the NDVI, EVI and VCI vegetation indices. The results reveal (i) the occurrence of droughts of various classes and at different timescales throughout the study period and region, (ii) high spatial variability in the number, duration, severity and intensity of drought, which tends to decrease with increasing timescale, (iii) high spatial-temporal agreement between drought and vegetation indices that confirm the dryness of vegetation during drought. These results aim to support policymakers in defining legislation to manage drought and water resources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9590d6b0c50e775f99dd782db8353ae12f476604297db3918389567c957c5e94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
