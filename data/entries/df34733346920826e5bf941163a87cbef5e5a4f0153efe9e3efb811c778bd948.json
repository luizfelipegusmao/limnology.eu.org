{"title":"Transcription factors RhbZIP17 and RhWRKY30 enhance resistance to Botrytis cinerea by increasing lignin content in rose petals","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/5/1633/7511340?rss=1","date":1704412800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The petals of ornamental plants such as roses (<span>Rosa</span> spp.) are the most economically important organs. This delicate, short-lived plant tissue is highly susceptible to pathogens, in large part because the walls of petal cells are typically thinner and more flexible compared with leaf cells, allowing the petals to fold and bend without breaking. The cell wall is a dynamic structure that rapidly alters its composition in response to pathogen infection, thereby reinforcing its stability and boosting plant resistance against diseases. However, little is known about how dynamic changes in the cell wall contribute to resistance to <span>Botrytis cinerea</span> in rose petals. Here, we show that the <span>B. cinerea</span>-induced transcription factor RhbZIP17 is required for the defense response of rose petals. RhbZIP17 is associated with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and binds to the promoter of the lignin biosynthesis gene <span>RhCAD1</span>, activating its expression. Lignin content showed a significant increase under gray mold infection compared with the control. <span>RhCAD1</span> functions in the metabolic regulation of lignin production and, consequently, disease resistance, as revealed by transient silencing and overexpression in rose petals. The WRKY transcription factor RhWRKY30 is also required to activate <span>RhCAD1</span> expression and enhance resistance against <span>B. cinerea</span>. We propose that RhbZIP17 and RhWRKY30 increase lignin biosynthesis, improve the resistance of rose petals to <span>B. cinerea</span>, and regulate <span>RhCAD1</span> expression.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"df34733346920826e5bf941163a87cbef5e5a4f0153efe9e3efb811c778bd948","category":"Environment"}
