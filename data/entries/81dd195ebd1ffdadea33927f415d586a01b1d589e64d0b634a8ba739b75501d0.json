{"title":"Comparative Analysis of Shapley Values Enhances Transcriptomics Insights across Some Common Uterine Pathologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0931/v1","date":1713166403000,"content":"Uterine pathologies pose a challenge to womenâ€™s health on a global scale. Despite extensive research, the causes and origin of some of these common disorders are not well defined yet. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome data from diverse datasets encompassing relevant uterine pathologies such as endometriosis, endometrial cancer and uterine leiomyomas. Leveraging the Comparative Analysis of Shapley values (CASh) technique, we demonstrate its efficacy in improving the outcomes of classical differential expression analysis on transcriptomic data derived from microarray experiments. CASh integrates the Microarray game algorithm with Bootstrap resampling, offering a robust statistical framework to mitigate the impact of potential outliers in the expression data. Our findings unveil novel insights into the molecular signatures underlying these gynecological disorders, highlighting CASh as a valuable tool for enhancing the precision of transcriptomics analyses in complex biological contexts. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of gene expression patterns and potential biomarkers associated with these pathologies, offering implications for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"81dd195ebd1ffdadea33927f415d586a01b1d589e64d0b634a8ba739b75501d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
