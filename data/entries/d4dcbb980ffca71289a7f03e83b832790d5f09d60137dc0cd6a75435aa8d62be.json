In the pursuit of looking for alternative, environmentally friendly pesticides, the potential use of two naturally occurring sesquiterpenes, <i>α</i>-bisabolol and bisabolol oxide A, as bactericides or acaricides, was investigated against three gram-positive and three gram-negative bacteria, and the eggs and larvae of the cattle tick <i>Hyalomma scupense</i>, respectively. The primary targeted site of synthetic insecticides is acetylcholinesterase (AChE), so the inhibitory activity of both sesquiterpenes was evaluated. Then, molecular docking and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) studies were performed to gain insight into their binding mode in the AChE active site.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Bisabolol oxide A showed good activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Escherichia coli,</i> and <i>Salmonella enteritidis</i> with inhibition zones ranging from 16 to 34 mm and minimal inhibitory concentration (CIM) of 3.125  mg mL<sup>−1</sup>. Ovicidal and larvicidal assays revealed promising activity of <i>α</i>-bisabolol and bisabolol oxide A against <i>H. scupense,</i> with bisabolol oxide A being more effective against larval ticks with lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) value of 0.78%. Both compounds also displayed potent anti-AChE activity with inhibition concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of 37.09 and 28.14 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Furthermore, <i>α</i>-bisabolol and bisabolol oxide A exhibited good and comparable docking scores (−7.289 and −7.139 Kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>, respectively) and were found to accommodate in the active-site gorge of AChE via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Bisabolol oxide A and, to a lesser degree, <i>α</i>-bisabolol are active against bacteria and ectoparasites and may represent an economical and sustainable alternative to toxic synthetic pesticides to control pathogens. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Dhouha Alimi, \nManel Hraoui, \nAzhar Hajri, \nWael Taamalli, \nSlimen Selmi, \nHichem Sebai","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"d4dcbb980ffca71289a7f03e83b832790d5f09d60137dc0cd6a75435aa8d62be","category":"Environment"}
