{"title":"Relationship of Oxidative Balance Score to Gallstone Prevalence and Gallbladder Surgery in American Adults: Evidence from NHANES 2017&ndash;2020","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1457/v1","date":1729243483000,"content":"Background: Gallstones represent a common gastrointestinal disorder, affecting approximately 10-20% of the global population. Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of gallstones; however, there remains a lack of effective clinical indicators to predict their formation. This study addresses this gap by investigating the relationship between oxidative balance score (OBS) and the incidence of gallstones and gallbladder surgery, utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2017 to 2020. Methods: This study investigated the association between OBS and the occurrence of gallstones and gallbladder surgery by analyzing data from NHANES for the period 2017â€“2020, adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex, race, and comorbidities. Various statistical analyses were applied, including multivariate logistic regression, subgroup analyses, and smoothed curve-fitting models.Results: The results revealed a significant negative correlation between OBS and the risks of both gallstones and gallbladder surgery, with each one-unit increase in OBS associated with a 2.6% reduction in gallstone risk (OR=0.974, 95% CI: 0.958-0.990) and a 3.3% reduction in the risk of gallbladder surgery (OR=0.967, 95% CI: 0.950-0.983). Subgroup analyses confirmed the consistency of these associations across various demographic and health-related factors. Furthermore, a dose-response relationship was observed between higher OBS and a reduced risk of gallbladder surgery.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a higher OBS is associated with a lower incidence of gallstones and reduced rates of gallbladder surgery, offering new insights into the link between oxidative stress levels and gallstone formation as well as surgical intervention. The findings underscore the potential of OBS as a valuable tool for identifying at-risk populations and informing personalized prevention strategies for gallstone disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7349474388fa2c95007997e55bd2689f67fd793e2666c80b8dec466ee539ba2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
