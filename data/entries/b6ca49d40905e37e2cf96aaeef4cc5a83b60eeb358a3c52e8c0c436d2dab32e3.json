{"title":"A Platform Technology for VR Biofeedback Training under Operant Conditioning for Functional Lower Limb Weakness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2520/v1","date":1722411564000,"content":"Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a complex condition that involves a disruption in the brain's ability to properly integrate sensory input and prior expectations, leading to motor dysfunction in functional motor disorders (FMD). This study investigates the role of sensory attenuation and the sense of agency in FMD, focusing on how these mechanisms can be leveraged for therapeutic interventions. Sensory attenuation, the brain's ability to predict and reduce the intensity of self-generated sensory inputs, is impaired in FMD, leading to a reduced sense of agency. This impairment disrupts motor control and contributes to the perception of involuntary movements.We propose using a bipedal reaching virtual reality (VR) task combined with a haptic ankle device to explore and potentially rehabilitate these impairments. In this task, foot positions are represented by VR objects, with initial weighting favoring the unaffected limb. This weighting gradually shifts to the affected limb as its involvement increases under operant conditioning. The task occasionally introduces perturbations to probe motor-related processing and feedback correction, providing a sensitive measure of visuomotor control. Additionally, we incorporate neuroimaging techniques, specifically functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG), to monitor brain activity and assess the effectiveness of these interventions. This approach aims to enhance understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying FND and develop targeted therapies that improve motor control by leveraging the interplay between sensory attenuation and amplification.Our findings could provide valuable insights into the treatment of FND, emphasizing the importance of feedback modulation and the integration of modern technologies like VR and haptic feedback in therapeutic interventions. This research has the potential to significantly improve the prognosis and quality of life for individuals with FND.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6ca49d40905e37e2cf96aaeef4cc5a83b60eeb358a3c52e8c0c436d2dab32e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
