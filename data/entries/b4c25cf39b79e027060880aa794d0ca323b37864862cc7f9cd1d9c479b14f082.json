{"title":"ECONOMIC BURDEN OF OBESITY IN HUNGARY Estimation About Obesity Related Public Health Care Expenditures and out of Pocket Payments in 2019 and 2022","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0754/v1","date":1728528510000,"content":"Background. Obesity is an important threat to national and global public health in terms of prevalence and economic burden due to the obesity-related complications (ORCs) and morbidities. Aim of this study is to calculate the obesity related public expenditures in Hungary, to estimate the expenses and contribution of patients in 2019 (before) and in 2022 (after) the covid-pandemic.Method. The National Health Insurance Fund is the only health-care financing agency in a single-payer social-insurance system in Hungary, managing all of the public payments. Expenditures related to the patients with obesity and more frequent co-morbidities were requested from the national database. Financing of the inpatient (hospital) and the outpatient (secondary or ambulatory care) providers, reimbursement for prescription of medicines and healing aids were collected. Lower and upper thresholds were estimated, representing the prevalence of the respective morbidities among obese persons. The upper values were used in the final estimation, because many of other obesity related morbidities and treatments were not included in the calculation. Results. Obesity-related morbidities represent 10-12 % of all cases in the public health care system. National public health care expenses could be about 144 Billion HUF (444 Million EUR) for 2019 and 133 Billion HUF (393 Million EUR). These sums represent 7-11% of the national spending for health care provision, without sick leave expenditures. The co-payment of patients was estimated 34 Billion HUF (104 Million EUR) and 43 Billion HUF (109 Million EUR), respectively. Public expenditures and co-payments related to diabetes Type2, and hypertension were the highest. The public and individual expenditures together represents 0.3-0.4% of the Hungarian GDP.This study presents whole national database which is appropriate for reliable calculation. Reducing of high expenses could be possible by weight maintenance, preferable as early prevention, and weight reduction among persons living with obesity at individual level. Beside these, more efforts are needed in the education and public health policy. To calculate the cost of obesity, to improve homogeneity and comparability an international consensus is required on standardized methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4c25cf39b79e027060880aa794d0ca323b37864862cc7f9cd1d9c479b14f082","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
