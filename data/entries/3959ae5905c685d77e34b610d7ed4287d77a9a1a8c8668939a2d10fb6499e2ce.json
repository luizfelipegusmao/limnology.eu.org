{"title":"Heteropolyacids@Silica Heterogeneous Catalysts to Produce Solketal from Glycerol Acetalization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1537/v1","date":1711434468000,"content":"The composites of heteropolyacids (H3PW12, H3PMo12) incorporated into amine-functionalized silica materials, were used for the first time as heterogeneous catalysts in the valorisation of glycerol (a large waste from biodiesel industry) by acetalization reaction with acetone. The polyoxotungstate catalyst H3PW12@AptesSBA-15 presented higher catalytic efficiency than the phosphomolybdate, with 97% of conversion with 97% of solketal selectivity, after 60 min at 25 °C, or 91% of glycerol conversion and the same selectivity, after 5 min, performing the reaction at 60 ºC. A relation of catalytic performance and acidity of the catalyst is here presented. Furthermore, the stability of the solid catalyst was investigated and discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3959ae5905c685d77e34b610d7ed4287d77a9a1a8c8668939a2d10fb6499e2ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
