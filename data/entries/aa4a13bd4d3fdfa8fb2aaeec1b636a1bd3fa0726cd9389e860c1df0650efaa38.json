This study evaluates the effectiveness of PBTs in identifying clinically significant conditions in an outpatient setting. Methods: This single-center retrospective study involved patients who received neuraxial blockade from January 2020 to August 2023. We extracted medical information and laboratory data from the electronic medical records during the pre-procedural period. Through multivariate regression analysis, we identified patient factors associated with abnormal laboratory results. Results: Advanced age (OR, 1.021; p = 0.026) and a history of cancer (OR, 2.359; p = 0.016) were significantly associated with elevated CRP levels (&gt;0.30 mg/dL). Severe hyperglycemia (â‰¥200 mg/dL) was found in 24 patients (3.88%), with a history of cancer being a strong predictor (OR, 6.764; p &lt; 0.001). No significant abnormalities were observed in PT or PTT.
