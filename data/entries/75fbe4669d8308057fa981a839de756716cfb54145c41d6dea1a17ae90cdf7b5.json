{"title":"Influence of Sonication on the Molecular Characteristics of Carbopol&reg; and Its Rheological Behavior in Aqueous Dispersions and Microgels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0259/v1","date":1717577873000,"content":"The effect of sonication on the molecular characteristics of poliacrylic acid (Carbopol® Ultrez 10) and its rheological behavior in aqueous dispersions and microgels containing 0.25 wt. % of the polymer was analyzed in this work by rheometry, weight-average molecular weight (Mw) measurements via static light scattering (SLS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and confocal microscopy. For this, the precursor dispersion and the microgels were sonicated in a commercial ultrasound bath at constant power and different times. We observed a softening of the microgel microstructure consisting of a systematic decrease in its shear modulus, yield stress and viscosity with increasing sonication time, while their overall Herschel-Bulkley (H-B) behavior was preserved. SLS measurements evidenced a reduction of Mw of polyacrylic acid with sonication time. Separately, FTIR measurements indicate that sonication produces scission in the C-C links of the Carbopol® backbone, which results in chains with the same chemistry but lower molecular weight. Finally, confocal microscopy measurements revealed a concomitant diminution of the size of the microsponge domains with sonication time, which is reflected in a softer microstructure resulting from reduction of the molecular weight of polyacrylic acid. The present results indicate that both the microstructure and the rheological behavior of Carbopol® microgels, in particular, and complex fluids in general, may be manipulated or tailored by high-power ultrasonication.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75fbe4669d8308057fa981a839de756716cfb54145c41d6dea1a17ae90cdf7b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
