{"title":"Research Trends of Thermogravimetric Pyrolysis of carnauba (Copernicia prunifera) and Thermokinetic Models Based on the Bibliometric Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0897/v1","date":1728646399000,"content":"This study presents a bibliometric analysis of thermogravimetric pyrolysis of carnauba biomass (Copernicia prunifera), a palm tree native to northeastern Brazil, belonging to the Arecaceae family. The objective was to analyze the scientific production and methods used to evaluate the kinetic parameters of biomass pyrolysis. A bibliographic survey was conducted using the Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases. The results were analyzed using VOSviewer and Bibliometrix software, which facilitated the generation of clusters and tables of scientific production. The analyses covered a range of variables, including authors, co-authors, countries of affiliation, academic institutions, journals, and keywords. The search yielded 1,983 articles, and after the application of exclusion criteria, 919 articles were retained, forming the basis for the bibliometric analysis. The data provided a more detailed and accurate overview of thermogravimetric pyrolysis of carnauba research and identified areas for further study. Furthermore, it was possible to ascertain which universities and researchers have devoted the most effort to this line of research, the principal findings, and areas that require further investment to complement existing research. Additionally, the study indicated the suitability of the Friedman kinetic method for determining kinetic parameters in biomass pyrolysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0eb9ef9db0dcbba5f6172a66022062ced67195886d7424ab567e84a976dd439","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
