{"title":"Effect of baicalin and baicalin-bovine serum albumin nanoparticle against bendiocarb exposure in rats","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae134/7748244?rss=1","date":1725321600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of baicalin and baicalin-bovine serum albumin nanoparticles against bendiocarb exposure in rats.<div>Methods</div>Eighty male Wistar Albino rats aged 4–6 weeks were used. Corn oil (vehicle) alone was administered to the control group. To other groups, BSA-nanoparticle equivalent to that binding baicalin at a dose of 20 mg/kg.bw, 20 mg/kg.bw baicalin, baicalin-BSA nanoparticle equivalent to that binding baicalin at a dose of 20 mg/kg.bw, 4 mg/kg.bw bendiocarb, combination of 4 mg/kg.bw bendiocarb and 20 mg/kg.bw baicalin, combination of 4 mg/kg.bw bendiocarb and BSA-nanoparticle equivalent to that binding baicalin at a dose of 20 mg/kg.bw and combination of 4 mg/kg.bw bendiocarb and baicalin-BSA nanoparticle equivalent to that binding baicalin at a dose of 20 mg/kg.bw was administered to animals by oral gavage with vehicle for 21 days, after which organs (liver, kidney, brain, testes, heart and lung) and blood samples were collected. Blood/tissue oxidative stress (MDA, NO, GSH, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, GR, GST, G6PD), serum biochemical (glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, BUN, creatinine, uric acid, total protein, albumin, LDH, AST, ALT, ALP and <span>pseudocholinesterase</span>) and liver and kidney apoptotic/anti-apoptotic (caspase 3, 9, p53, Bcl-2 and Bax) parameters were evaluated. Body weights/organ weights and plasma/liver bendiocarb analyses were obtained.<div>Conclusion</div>While bendiocarb administered alone caused oxidative stress/tissue damage, baicalin and baicalin-BSA nanoparticle showed a mitigating effect. However, this effect was more pronounced in the baicalin-BSA nanoparticle group. BSA-nanoparticle alone did not have a significant effect in reversing the adverse effect caused by bendiocarb.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"a5e8e3e971449c854d3031081720b120e2a1155d39f54cd6f91b374e40f88f65","category":"Environment"}
