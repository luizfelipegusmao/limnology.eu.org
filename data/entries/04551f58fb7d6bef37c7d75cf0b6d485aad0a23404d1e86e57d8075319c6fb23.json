{"title":"Software Development Process Considerations in Drones’ GNSS-Denied Navigation Project","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0552/v1","date":1720210596000,"content":"Plato defined a quality as “some degree of perfection” [49]. Studies on quality have unveiled the internal and external quality factors [17] that significantly impact product quality [4]. Internal factors are invisible to the end customer and are dependent on overall work organisation by the development team [17]. This work organisation is called “the process” [11],[33].\nIn this article, we will discuss how to address the drone-dedicated software development process to support system verification and ensure product quality by supporting quality characteristics and therefore increase software development awareness and control. We will discuss the process's influence on overall work activities and relationships between those activities by addressing the software development process utilised in the drone-dedicated GNSS-denied navigation system development project.\nThe result was observable after three weeks of starting the software development. It was focused on better team awareness, faster task completion, lower number of development mistakes, and better and faster change response than we observed in other projects that didn’t follow the predefined process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04551f58fb7d6bef37c7d75cf0b6d485aad0a23404d1e86e57d8075319c6fb23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
