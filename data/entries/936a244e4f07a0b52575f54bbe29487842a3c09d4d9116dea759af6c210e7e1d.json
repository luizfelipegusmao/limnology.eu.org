{"title":"Motherhood in the Making: Key Determinants of Parenthood Motivation in Young Adult Women","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1302/v1","date":1726648180000,"content":"Demographic changes are often prone to purely social perspectives, while individual differences are overlooked. This research examines the role of attachment and emotional intelligence in childbearing motivation. In total, 234 female students participated in an online survey, including sociodemographic data, adult attachment, emotional competencies, and parenting-related variables. Statistical analyses revealed that the students express positive and negative childbearing motivation almost equally and moderately. They were both linked to religiosity and emotional management. We further explore the differences in relationship status and address the role of religious beliefs. The demographic measures identified as most important include healthcare availability for both mother and child, subsiding housing loans or rent and encouraging fathers to become more actively involved in the care of infants. These emerging trends deserve further investigation and social incentives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"936a244e4f07a0b52575f54bbe29487842a3c09d4d9116dea759af6c210e7e1d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
