Compound 1 consists of the coordination polymer (CP) [[Cd(L)2(H2O)2](NO3)2·4H2O]∞, in which CdII ions are bridged by the neutral L antiperiplanar N-ligands in a wavy ribbon fashion developing along the c-axis. Two trans-disposed water molecules complete the pseudo-octahedral coordination geometry of the metal ion. The crystal packing of 1 revealed the interplay between π-π stacking interactions and an intricate hydrogen-bonded network involving oxalamides, nitrates and water molecules. The donor properties of L and the intermolecular interactions in compound 1 are interpreted based on hybrid-DFT calculations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aaa477116949b3e73f0a07a7996e8591b0e8a088c5ddbac8a2328a72c91c972c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
