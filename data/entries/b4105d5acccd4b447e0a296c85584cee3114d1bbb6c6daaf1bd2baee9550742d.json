{"title":"Imaging plant metabolism in situ","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/6/1654/7331171?rss=1","date":1698364800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has emerged as an invaluable analytical technique for investigating the spatial distribution of molecules within biological systems. In the realm of plant science, MSI is increasingly employed to explore metabolic processes across a wide array of plant tissues, including those in leaves, fruits, stems, roots, and seeds, spanning various plant systems such as model species, staple and energy crops, and medicinal plants. By generating spatial maps of metabolites, MSI has elucidated the distribution patterns of diverse metabolites and phytochemicals, encompassing lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, phenolics, terpenes, alkaloids, vitamins, pigments, and others, thereby providing insights into their metabolic pathways and functional roles. In this review, we present recent MSI studies that demonstrate the advances made in visualizing the plant spatial metabolome. Moreover, we emphasize the technical progress that enhances the identification and interpretation of spatial metabolite maps. Within a mere decade since the inception of plant MSI studies, this robust technology is poised to continue as a vital tool for tackling complex challenges in plant metabolism.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"b4105d5acccd4b447e0a296c85584cee3114d1bbb6c6daaf1bd2baee9550742d","category":"Environment"}
