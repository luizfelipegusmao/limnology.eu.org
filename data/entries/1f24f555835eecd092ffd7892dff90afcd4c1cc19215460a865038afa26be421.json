It is directly exposed to extremely harsh environmental conditions, including high-flux of low-energy He-plasma, high temperature, neutron irradiation, and stress. One of the critical safety concerns in fusion reactors involves aggressive high-temperature oxidation of tungsten divertor in case of loss-of-vacuum accidents (LOVAs) and loss-of-coolant accidents (LOCAs). In our prior research, we presented the pioneering in-situ observation of thermal oxidation of high-purity fusion tungsten using 1 bar environmental TEM (ETEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.856-B1\">1</a>]. Here, we explore the oxidation behavior of W nanofuzz, a prevalent and significant surface morphology alteration resulting from high-flux, low-energy He-plasma exposure [<a href=\"#ozae044.856-B2\">2</a>], employing a combination of conventional thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and innovative 1 bar ETEM technique.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1f24f555835eecd092ffd7892dff90afcd4c1cc19215460a865038afa26be421","category":"Environment"}
