{"title":"76 Camera vision grading and objective tenderness outcomes of steers fed lubabegron fumarate for the final 56 d of the feeding period","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/225/7757340?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Limited research has compared no beta-agonist, ractopamine and lubabegron in feedlot cattle. We evaluated carcass quality and yield variables using a camera grading instrument and also examined objective tenderness outcomes. Treatments were negative control (no beta-ligand; CON), Optaflexx (ractopamine hydrochloride, 300 mg·steer<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup> for 35 d; OPT), and Experior (lubabegron fumarate, 36 mg·steer<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup> for 56 d + 4 d removal; 0EXP) fed for 198 d. Additional EXP treatments investigated total days on feed (DOF) of 184 d (-14EXP), 212 d (+14EXP) and 226 d (+28EXP). Carcasses (n = 2,517) were instrument graded 24 h post-mortem. Longissimus tenderness and lipid content were evaluated in a subset (n = 361) of carcasses via slice shear force and ether extract. Statistical analyses were conducted using mixed models; pen was the experimental unit, treatment was the fixed effect, block was a random effect, and means were separated with the Tukey-Kramer adjustment. Longissimus muscle area (LMA) was 4.0 to 6.2 cm<sup>2</sup> larger (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) for steers fed EXP compared with CON, which did not differ from OPT. Weight corrected LMA (LMA:HCW) was 1.3 cm<sup>2</sup>/100 kg larger (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) for -14EXP compared with CON. Marbling score was 31 to 39 points lower (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) for -14EXP compared with CON and OPT, whereas 0EXP, +14EXP and +28EXP were similar to CON and OPT. Total number of fat pieces within the longissimus did not differ (<span>P</span> = 0.11) across treatments, however number of fat pieces in the lateral one-half of the longissimus decreased (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.03) for -14EXP and +28EXP, whereas +14EXP tended (<span>P</span> = 0.09) to decrease compared with CON. Total meat area was 3.7 percentage points greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) for -14EXP compared with CON; +14EXP and +28EXP tended (<span>P</span> = 0.07) to be greater than CON. Total fat area was 1.6 to 1.8 percentage points less (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.02) for 0EXP, +14EXP, and +28EXP when compared with CON. Compared with CON, dorsal-ventral longissimus distance increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) by 3.3 to 5.4% for -14EXP, 0EXP, +14EXP and +28EXP. Medial-lateral longissimus distance increased 1.9 to 2.5 % (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) for +14EXP and +28EXP compared with CON, whereas -14EXP tended (<span>P</span> = 0.08) to increase. Percentage intramuscular fat (IMF) was similar (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.44) for +14EXP, +28EXP, and OPT compared with CON, whereas 0EXP tended (<span>P</span> = 0.09) to be less. Marbling score and IMF were moderately correlated (r = 0.66). Slice shear force values were 20.1% greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.02) for +14EXP compared with CON, whereas 0EXP tended (<span>P</span> = 0.09) to be greater and +28EXP, -14EXP and OPT were similar (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.28) to CON. These findings illustrate the effect of EXP on carcass traits and tenderness in feedlot cattle.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"ec414810f6570a98c50ebdce35bbfc01012f988b16e10da0719a54084887b397","category":"Environment"}
