{"title":"Optimization of Lead-Free Sn-Based Perovskite Solar Cells using SCAPs-1D Simulation Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0524/v1","date":1718087603000,"content":"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are vital for their optical and electrical properties, with lead-based PSCs reaching a remarkable efficiency of 26.1%, while tin-based counterparts achieve 18.71%. Due to lead's toxicity, there's a push for alternatives like tin. However, tin-based PSCs suffer from stability issues and high defect density states, necessitating the development of cost-effective, high-performance, and eco-friendly alternatives. In this study, we designed a hetero-junction architecture using MASnI3-based Perovskite, opti-mized with SCAPs-1D. After exhaustive analysis, our device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.18%, with enhanced parameters including Voc of 0.09323V, Jsc of 30.8360 mA/cm2, and FF of 84.10%. Recombination rates, particularly Shockley-Read Hall recom-bination, were significantly reduced. Parametric analyses, encompassing absorber layer thickness, band gap, defect density, doping concentration, and operating temperature, in-dicate potential efficiency enhancements. This underscores the viability of Sn-based PSCs as a cost-effective, efficient, and environmentally benevolent alternative to lead-based counterparts, promising advancements in future research and development efforts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51737eb70b97b0dab21e76851ccafadf2e12fb4c5d44cb92ee0494e987200250","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
