{"title":"Effect of dietary β‐glucan supplementation on growth performance, body composition, intestinal microbes, and capacity against pathogen of golden trevally (Gnathanodon speciosus, family Carangidae)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13037?af=R","date":1707993399000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The efficacy of dietary β-glucan supplementation in golden trevally (<i>Gnathanodon speciosus</i>) was evaluated. The fish were fed five different diets supplemented with 0%, 0.05%, 0.10%, 0.20%, and 0.40% β-glucan for 56 days. After 56 days of culture, survival was the highest when the fish were fed a 0.10% β-glucan diet. Growth rates were higher in fish fed diets supplemented with all β-glucan levels. Lymphocytes increased when the fish were fed a diet supplemented with 0.05% β-glucan, and thrombocytes increased when the fish were fed 0.2% and 0.4% β-glucan-supplemented diets. The total aerobic bacteria count in the gut of golden trevally was higher (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and the total <i>Vibrio</i> counts in the gut of golden trevally were lower (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) when the fish were fed any level of β-glucan. Flesh protein content was higher and flesh lipid content was lower when fish were fed β-glucan-supplemented diets at levels greater than 0.1%. When challenged with <i>Streptococcus iniae</i>, fish fed diets containing 0.10% or 0.20% β-glucan exhibited the highest survival rates. The current results suggest that supplementation with 0.05 to 0.2% β-glucan in the diet would be beneficial for the culture of the golden trevally.</p>","author":"Hoang Do‐Huu, \nSang Minh Huynh, \nHue Thi Nguyet Nguyen, \nKy Xuan Pham","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"bca3ec24d29cf3307d835252404d4db41fdf901e4443420791cbbcad808618b4","category":"Environment"}
