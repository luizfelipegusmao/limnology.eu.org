{"title":"Implementation of a Freeware Scada System for a Continuous/Alternate Voltage Microgrid","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1859/v1","date":1729750170000,"content":"Microgrids represent small-scale energy generation units with low cost-effectiveness, making use of renewable resources, such as photovoltaic and wind energy. These systems can operate both in connection with and independent from the primary power grid. The widespread adoption and expansion of microgrids are increasingly vital in light of the global shift towards minimizing fossil fuel consumption and promoting cleaner energy sources. Similar to conventional electrical networks, microgrids require Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems to ensure sustained and reliable operation.\nIn support of the proliferation and growth of microgrid networks, this paper proposes the implementation of an open-source SCADA system. This system, being platform-independent, significantly reduces the costs associated with microgrid implementation, thus aligning with the principles of social responsibility. The proposed SCADA system will be deployed on a simulated microgrid, featuring both photovoltaic and wind energy sources, and will include a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) synchronization system for grid connection. The simulation will be carried out using the Matlab-Simulink environment, leveraging the power systems library. \nThe interface between Matlab and SCADA is done using an OPC Server. Additionally, the SCADA system will interface with an SQL database to facilitate the archiving of historical data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab10744a29bc94ecae0a1baf8584f7656b92ccb1958dfd30c6a8f8dfa928ac1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
