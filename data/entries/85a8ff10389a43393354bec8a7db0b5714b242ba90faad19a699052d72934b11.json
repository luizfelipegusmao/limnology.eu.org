The disease is suggested to cause schistosomiasis-induced sexual and reproductive health problems among males. The study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of MGS, sexual and reproductive health problems that could be caused by MGS among adult males in Mtama district. A community-based cross-sectional study using quantitative methods was carried out among males aged â‰¥ 18 years in selected households. Semen and urine samples were collected from each participant to establish the prevalence of MGS and urogenital schistosomiasis respectively. Semen quality was macroscopically and microscopically assessed. Urine samples were analyzed using filtration technique. A structured questionnaire interview was carried out to collect socio-demographic data, sexual and reproductive health information. Descriptive statistics were used to provide a summary of each variable. The prevalence (proportions) were presented in percentages and their respective 95% confidence intervals. A total of 223 adult males participated in this study. The prevalence of MGS and urogenital schistosomiasis were 5.8% (95% CI; 3.1%-9.0%) and 22.4% (95% CI; 16.6%-27.8%) respectively. The prevalence of <i>Schistosoma haematobium</i> eggs in semen was found high among young adults 12/129 (9.3%, 95% CI; 4.9%-15.7%), who never attended to school 6/35 (17.1%, 95% CI; 6.6%-33.6%), petty traders 4/26 (15.4%, 95% CI; 4.4%-34.9%), never impregnated woman 9/70 (12.9%, 95% CI: 6.6%-33.6%), experienced pain during ejaculation 4/17 (23.5%, 95% CI; 4.9%-15.7%), and with brownish semen 2/5 (40%, 95% CI; 4.9%-15.7%). According to the findings, MGS, like urogenital schistosomiasis, is prevalent in southern Tanzania. The disease is prevalent among males with some reproductive and sexual issues. This highlight the need for more research to investigate the association of MGS and male reproductive and sexual health for improved health services among males.","author":"Twilumba Makene","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"85a8ff10389a43393354bec8a7db0b5714b242ba90faad19a699052d72934b11","category":"Environment"}
