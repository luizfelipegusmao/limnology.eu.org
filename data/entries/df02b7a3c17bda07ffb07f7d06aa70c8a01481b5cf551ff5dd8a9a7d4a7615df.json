{"title":"On the Roles of Protein Intrinsic Disorder in the Origin of Life and Evolution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2346/v1","date":1727678996000,"content":"Obviously, the discussion of different factors that could have contributed to the origin of life and evolution represents a clear speculation, since there is no way to check the validity of the most of the related hypotheses on practice, as the corresponding events are not only already happened, but took place in a very distant past. However, there are a few undisputable facts obviously present at the moment, such as the existence of a broad variety of living forms and the abundant presence of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or hybrid proteins containing ordered domains and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in all those living forms. Since it seems that the currently existing living forms have originated from a common ancestor, their variety represents a result of evolution. Therefore, one could ask a logical question of what role(s) those structure-less and highly dynamic but vastly abundant and multifunctional IDPs/IDRs might have in evolution. This study represents an attempt to consider various ideas pertaining to the potential roles of protein intrinsic disorder in origin of life and evolution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df02b7a3c17bda07ffb07f7d06aa70c8a01481b5cf551ff5dd8a9a7d4a7615df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
