{"title":"A Terminal Residual Vibration Suppression Method of A Robot Based on Joint Trajectory Optimization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0678/v1","date":1720506296000,"content":"Vibration problems have become one of the most important factors affecting robot performance. To this end, a terminal residual vibration suppression method based on joint trajectory optimization is proposed to improve the accuracy and stability of robot motion. Firstly, based on the characteristics of the friction nonlinearity due to joint coupling and physical feasibility of dynamic parameters, a semidefinite programming method is used to identify dynamic parameters with actual physical meaning, thereby obtaining an accurate dynamic model. Then, based on the result of the residual vibration time domain analysis, a joint trajectory optimization model with the goal of minimizing joint tracking error is established. The Chebyshev collocation method is used to discretize the optimization model. The dynamic model is used as the optimization constraint, and barycentric interpolation is used to obtain the optimized joint motion trajectory. Finally, industrial robot experiments prove that the vibration suppression method proposed in this article can reduce the maximum acceleration amplitude of residual vibration by 62% and the vibration duration by 71%. Compared with the input shaping method, the method proposed in this paper can reduce the terminal residual vibration more effectively and ensure the consistency of running time and trajectory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7593476ba53f148088a3860541d93829a8d7f4c8f0d686ae6ebbc75a1905ddc2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
