This study tested a combination of protection motivation and cultural values theories using structural equation modeling. A sample among rangeland's users was selected and the sample size was determined using Cochrane's (1963) formula to be 289. Data for this study were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 20) and AMOS (version 20). The results showed that the conceptual model of this study had a good fit with the data. The combination of the two theories showed good potential in predicting the pro-environmental intention of rangeland users (51%) compared with previous researches. The results revealed that risk perception, maladaptation, and belief in land degradation directly influence rangeland's pro-environmental intention.</p>","author":"Neamat Allah Madadizadeh, \nHossein Arzani, \nSeyed Akbar Javadi, \nSeyed Hamid Movahed Mohammadi, \nMohammad Hossein Razzaghi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"d8019802c4aa0f566c5e473c57899497a5669125f00af847c37537d90df1acf2","category":"Environment"}
