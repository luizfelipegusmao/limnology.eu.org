{"title":"Effects of Exogenous Monobutyrin on Human Primary Osteoblasts: Growth, Differentiation and Mechanisms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0908/v1","date":1728637311000,"content":"Here we report that exogenous monobutyrin at the concertation of 0.1, 0.05 and 0.01% w/v have direct and indirect inhibitory effects on bone forming cells, osteoblasts (OBs) derived from primary culture of trabecular bone specimens obtained from healthy subjects undergoing orthopedic surgery. Monobutyrin inhibited OB cell growth, alkaline phosphatase activity and bone mineralization. Monobutyrin affected OB morphology by increasing cell sizes and relatively shortening the cytoplasm processes. The OBs treated with monobutyrin failed to reach confluence in either a short or long culture period. The major growth factors associated with osteogenesis were down-regulated, for example, BMPs and SMADs negatively responded to the exposure of monobutyrin. The activation of phosphorylation of histone H3 at the serine 10 site (S10) was significantly suppressed in OBs exposed to monobutyrin. This is the first study of exogenous monobutyrin in human OBs demonstrating that monobutyrin inhibits OB growth, cell differentiation, BMPs and SMADs gene expression, and phosphorylated histone H3 protein.  Results from this study may be useful in understanding the physiological roles and mechanisms of actions of monobutyrin during the development, formation, and repair of bones.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b499de7d607236bf2bb968282699d5cf0d37e9f9331b6a7367dbe533640b666","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
