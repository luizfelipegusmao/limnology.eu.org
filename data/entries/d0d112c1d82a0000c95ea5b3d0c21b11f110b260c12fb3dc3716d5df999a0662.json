{"title":"The Fine Thread between Stability and Randomness of the Non-stationary D/M/1 Queue&rsquo;s GI/M/1 Pointwise of Stationary Fluid Flow Approximation Model with Application Ultra-Low Latency of Autonomous Driving Service","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0649/v1","date":1715333155000,"content":"The current work reveals the fine tuning between stability zones and randomness of GI/M/1 Pointwise Stationary Fluid Flow Approximation (PSFFA) model of the non-stationary D/M/1 queueing system. More specifically, this clearly provides more insights into developing a contemporary PSFFA theory that unifies non-stationary queueing theory with chaos theory and fields in both theoretical physics and chaotic systems. This opens new grounds for stability analysis of non-stationary queueing systems. A notable application of GI/M/1 queueing model to achieve ultra-low latency of autonomous driving service is highlighted. Concluding remarks associated with future avenues of research are given.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d0d112c1d82a0000c95ea5b3d0c21b11f110b260c12fb3dc3716d5df999a0662","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
