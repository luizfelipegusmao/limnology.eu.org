{"title":"First principles calculation of interface interactions and photoelectric properties of ZnSe/SnSe heterostructure","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304032","date":1716559200000,"content":"<p>by Yang-Yang Zhao, Si-Yuan Sheng</p>\r\n\r\nHeterostructure engineering is an effective technology to improve photo-electronic properties of two dimensional layered semiconductors. In this paper, based on first principles method, we studied the structure, stability, energy band, and optical properties of ZnSe/SnSe heterostructure change with film layer. Results show that all heterostructures are the type-II band arrangement, and the interlayer interaction is characterized by van der Waals. The electron concentration and charge density difference implies the electron (holes) transition from SnSe to monolayer ZnSe. By increasing the layer of SnSe films, the quantum effects are weakened leading to the band gap reduced, and eventually show metal properties. The optical properties also have obvious change, the excellent absorption ability of ZnSe/SnSe heterostructures mainly near the infrared spectroscopy. These works suggest that ZnSe/SnSe heterostructure has significant potential for future optoelectronic applications.","author":"Yang-Yang Zhao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"df25e0b3d00c530d964fe24f644cef5c7018fa0a573d0b0bf9736b357b727aa9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
