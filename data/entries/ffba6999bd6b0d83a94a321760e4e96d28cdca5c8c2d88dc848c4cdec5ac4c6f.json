{"title":"Quercetin and kaempferol from saffron petals alleviated hydrogen peroxide‐induced oxidative damage in B16 cells","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13887?af=R","date":1726578234000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Saffron petals are usually considered as waste after saffron harvest. However, saffron petals contain many important phytochemical components (e.g. quercetin and kaempferol), which may alleviate oxidative damage in human cells.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The contents of flavonoids and crocin in different parts of saffron were analyzed. The protective effects of flavonoids from saffron on oxidative damage of B16 cells were investigated. Saffron stigma contained high contents of crocin and picrocrocin, whereas flavonoid content (quercetin, 4.03 ± 0.33 mg g<sup>−1</sup> DW; kaempferol, 47.80 ± 0.60 mg g<sup>−1</sup> DW) was higher in saffron petals than in other parts. Incubation of B16 cells with quercetin (10–30 μmol L<sup>−1</sup>) and kaempferol (20–30 μmol L<sup>−1</sup>) obtained from saffron extracts could significantly increase the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and the activity of NADPH:dehydrogenase quinone-1 (NQO1) to alleviate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative damage. Quercetin was better than kaempferol in increasing NQO1 activity and T-AOC. Quercetin extracted from saffron petals could induce NQO1 expression through regulating kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 signaling pathway to protect B16 cells from oxidative damage.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The content of kaempferol-3-<i>O</i>-sophoroside and quercetin-3-<i>O</i>-sophoroside was higher in saffron petals than in other parts of saffron. The kaempferol and quercetin obtained from saffron petals could enhance the activity of antioxidant enzyme NQO1 and T-AOC in B16 cells. This indicated that saffron petals, as a potential functional food, may prevent diseases caused by oxidative stress. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yao Zhang, \nYucui Gong, \nJiayun Hu, \nLe Zhang, \nMaría José Benito, \nDurbek Usmanov, \nSabir Z Nishanbaev, \nXinjie Song, \nLigen Zou, \nYuanfeng Wu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"ffba6999bd6b0d83a94a321760e4e96d28cdca5c8c2d88dc848c4cdec5ac4c6f","category":"Environment"}
