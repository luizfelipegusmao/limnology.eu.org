{"title":"Molecules That Have Rarely Been Studied in Lymphatic Endothelial Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2067/v1","date":1727329413000,"content":"A number of standard molecules are used for the molecular and histological characterization of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) such as Lyve1, Podoplanin (D2-40), VEGFR3, Prox1 and CD31. The number of molecules whose mutations cause lymphatic malformations or primary congenital lymphedema is considerable, but the majority of these diseases have not yet been characterized at the molecular level. Therefore, there is still considerable scope for molecular and functional studies of the lymphatic vasculature. Using RNASeq, we have previously characterized LECs under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We used this information to compare it with immunohistochemical data. We carried out some of the immunohistology ourselves, and systematically studied the Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/). Here we describe molecules that are expressed at RNA and protein levels in LECs, hoping to stimulate future functional studies of these molecules.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04edccba60842f74c5458d2041aa560cf964aeafc4e2376955fa30d9a5007c0a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
