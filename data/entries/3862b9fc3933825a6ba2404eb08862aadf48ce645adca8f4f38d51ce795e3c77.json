This study assessed the Eco-efficiency of disinfectants based on the NBR ISO 14045:2014. Primary data were collected from Brazilian producers, while secondary data were obtained from patents and the Ecoinvent database. The system boundaries encompassed cradle-to-consumer use. The selling price was adopted as the product system value indicator (economic analysis). Raw materials production had the greatest impact on the environmental performance of disinfectants A (Antibacterial, surfactant and preservative) and C (Antibacterial, surfactant and opacifier). Disinfectant B, in addition to raw materials production (Antibacterial, opacifier and surfactant), also experienced significant impacts from consumer transport. These critical processes represent more than 60% of the overall impacts in both categories. The Eco-efficiency matrix (profile) related environmental and economic indicators. All disinfectants occupied quadrants three or four, indicating high impact on the environmental categories. Disinfectant C had the highest Eco-efficiency while disinfectant B had the lowest, mainly due to its product system value. Sensitivity analysis indicated environmentally viable changes in the products' composition, such as replacing the antibacterial, surfactant, preservative, and opacifier. Energy and water consumption did not significantly impact the assessed products.</p>","author":"Italo Emmanoel Mesquita Oliveira de Moura, \nElaine Aparecida da Silva","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"3862b9fc3933825a6ba2404eb08862aadf48ce645adca8f4f38d51ce795e3c77","category":"Environment"}
