{"title":"Nitrogen-Mineralization of Selected Organic Materials and Their Combined Effects with Nitrogen Fertilizer on Spinach Yield","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2088/v1","date":1717135820000,"content":"A 2-month incubation study was carried out using two soil types to determine nitrogen mineralization of different inorganic-organic amendments. The following seven treatments (T) were established; T1 = control, T2 = 5 g of dry algae per kg of soil (100%DA), T3 = 136g of agri-mat per kg of soil (100%GA), T4 = 61 g of ground grass per kg of soil (100%GG), T5 = 2.5 g of dry algae + 2.5 g of nitrogen fertilizer (NF) per kg of soil (50%DA50NF), T6 = 50%GA50NF, T7 = 50%GG50NF. Three samples per treatment were drawn at 0, 3, 7, 15, 30, 45, and 60 days for mineral-N determination. A 2-month glasshouse experiment was established afterwards with the following five treatments: T1 = Control, T2 = 50%DA, T3 = 50%GA, T4 = 50%GG, and T5 = 100NF. The results indicated that nitrogen mineralization was significantly higher in organic-inorganic amendments compared to sole organic amendments. The percentage differences ranged from 157% to 195%. The 50%DA treatment increased spinach yield by 20.6% in sandy loam and 36.5% in loam soil. It is difficult to fully recommend the 50%DA treatment without field-scale evaluation, but it is a promising option to be considered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"06cd6a42c732410787461c6f913c362e313f39656dd30ff8d822e89a059940b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
