{"title":"Physical, Chemical, Mineralogical, and Toxicological Characterization to Identify Heavy Metals Hg, As, Pb, CD, and Zn in Active and Inactive Tailings in the Arequipa Region, Peru","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0326/v1","date":1728032795000,"content":"The mining industry is a fundamental pillar of economic development in Peru, but mine tailings can generate contamination by toxic heavy metals such as Hg, As, Pb, Cd, and Zn, affecting health, flora, and fauna. This research aimed to characterize the physical, chemical, mineralogical, and toxicological properties of active and passive tailings in the Arequipa region of Peru to identify and quantify the presence of these heavy metals. Analytical techniques, such as granulometry, ICP, TCLP, SEM, and EDS were used to obtain detailed information about the characteristics of the tailings. The results showed significant variability in particle size distribution, as well as differences in mineralogical composition, including the presence of valuable and potentially toxic minerals. This study will allow corrective actions to be taken to prevent, minimize, or remediate potential negative impacts in the region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c5d6df11fe9d17ea8b311517d96b77134daefe7d5325de434b929c509e2904b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
