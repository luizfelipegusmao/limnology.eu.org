{"title":"Enhancing Dispersive Soil: An Experimental Study on the Efficacy of Microbial, Electrokinetics, and Chemical Approaches","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1692/v1","date":1729588650000,"content":"This study investigates the influence of four soil improvement methods—microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP), electrokinetics (EK), chemical additives, and a combination of EK and chemical additives—on the dispersivity, mechanical properties, and microstructure of dispersive soil. A series of tests was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods on dispersive soil. Both the original and treated soil samples were tested to assess changes in soil properties, including dispersivity, plasticity, pH, unconfined compressive strength (UCS), shear strength, and microstructure. Dispersivity was assessed using pinhole tests, crumb tests, double hydrometer tests, and exchangeable sodium percentage tests. The experimental results indicate that the combined EK and chemical additives method significantly reduces the dispersivity and plasticity of the dispersive soil compared to the other methods, leading to improved UCS. The EK and chemical additive methods individually demonstrate effective modification under a voltage of 48V and an additive content of 4%, respectively, enhancing the shear strength of the dispersive soil. MICP does not significantly improve the dispersivity of dispersive soil, it does enhance the shear strength of the treated soil, with a particularly notable increase in the internal friction angle. Overall, the combined method shows more remarkable improvements in the dispersive soil than any single method. In summary, the combination of EK and chemical additives has significant potential for improving the dispersivity and mechanical properties of dispersive soil.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9fe6436131dd9368f6ddc1a3ef3f54c9bbea875a8a83ee6c297dee16d6ff5587","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
