{"title":"A 3D Numerical Model to Estimate Lightning Types for PyroCb Thundercloud","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0112/v1","date":1714635535000,"content":"Pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) thunderclouds, produced from extreme bushfires, can initiate frequent cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning strikes containing extended continuing currents. This, in turn, can ignite new spotfires and inflict massive harm on the environment and infrastructures. This study presents a 3D numerical thundercloud model for estimating the lightning of different types and its striking zone for the conceptual tripole thundercloud structure which is theorized to elucidate the lightning phenomenon in pyroCb storms. More emphasis is given to the lower positive charge structure thundercloud to thoroughly examine various electrical parameters including the longitudinal electric field, electric potential, and surface charge density. The simulation outcomes on pyroCb thunderclouds with a tripole structure confirm the presence of negative longitudinal electric field initiation at the cloudâ€™s lower region. This initiation is accompanied by enhancing the lower positive charge region, resulting in an overall positive electric potential increase. Consequently, negative surface charge density appears underneath the pyroCb thundercloud which has the potential to induce positive cloud-to-ground (+CG) lightning flashes. The suggested model would establish the basis for identifying the potential area impacted by lightning and could also be expanded to analyze the dangerous conditions that may arise in wind energy farms or power substations in times of severe pyroCb events.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ceb1c738478a932c6812ce5e4db7b4d02acb012e091244c8366d99938b56477","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
