{"title":"Fabrication of a Microfluidic-Based Device Coated with Polyelec-Trolyte-Capped-Titanium Dioxide to Couple High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry for Mercury Speciation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1178/v1","date":1721039419000,"content":"Mercury (Hg) is a toxic element impacting on biological systems and ecosystems. Because the toxicity of Hg species is highly dependent on concentration levels and chemical forms, sensitive identification of chemical forms for Hg, i.e., Hg speciation, is of major significance in providing meaningful information about the source of Hg exposure. In this study, a microﬂuidic-based device made of high clarity poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was fabricated. Then titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO2) were attached to the treated channel interior with the aid of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC). After coupling the nano-TiO2-coated microﬂuidic-based photocatalyst-assisted reduction device (the nano-TiO2-coated microﬂuid-ic-based PCARD) with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), a selective and sensitive hyphenated system for Hg specia-tion was established. Validation procedures demonstrated that the method could be satisfactorily applied to the determination of mercuric ion (Hg2+) and methylmercury ion (CH3Hg+) in both human urine and water samples. Remarkably, the zeta potential measured clearly indicated the PDADMAC-capped nano-TiO2 with predominance of positive charges indeed provided steady force for firm attachment to the negatively charged device channel. The cause for the durability of the nano-TiO2-coated microﬂuidic-based PCARD was clarified thus.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2822e6fffff21691db2be3dacd97d1c073dcbf76380ad80545e2f404dd95022d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
