{"title":"Integrating Embodied Social Presence Theory and Process Virtualization Theory to assess business process virtualizability: The mediating role of embodied co-presence","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305423","date":1718373600000,"content":"<p>by Juan Yang, Hualong Fang</p>\r\n\r\nIn the digital era, the integration of technology within business processes is pivotal for organizational efficiency. This study investigates the impact of IT characteristics-specifically IT representation, IT reach, and monitoring capability-on the virtualizability of business processes, utilizing the frameworks of Embodied Social Presence Theory (ESPT) and Process Virtualization Theory (PVT). Our objective is to explore how these IT characteristics, through the mediation of embodied co-presence, enhance business process virtualizability in the context of collaborative tools. Addressing a gap in existing literature, we propose that beyond facilitating virtualization, IT characteristics deeply influence virtual processes by integrating human-centric experiences of co-presence. To examine this, we analyzed data from 311 Korean employees with remote work experience during the COVID-19 pandemic using Smart-PLS 4. Our findings indicate that IT representation and IT reach significantly contribute to business process virtualizability, mediated by embodied co-presence. Surprisingly, monitoring capability did not significantly affect either embodied co-presence or process virtualizability, challenging initial assumptions. This study bridges ESPT and PVT to offer new insights into the roles of IT characteristics in process virtualization, highlighting the importance of human-centric IT design. The results provide valuable guidance for businesses and developers of collaborative tools, underscoring the need to enhance virtual work environments through technology that fosters a sense of presence and collaboration.","author":"Juan Yang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"128bf3b9ffa93f5c14429c4b7389bfa72feb2c2cb7f9474279a5de50fa0e1b22","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
