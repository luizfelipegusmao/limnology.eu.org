{"title":"Prenatal Sonographic Diagnosis and Postnatal Outcomes of Fetal Intracranial Hemorrhage: Two Case Reports","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0491/v1","date":1717988672000,"content":"BackgroundIntracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in pregnancy, estimated at 1 in 10,000 cases, presents significant diagnostic challenges prenatally despite advanced imaging techniques such as ultrasound (US) and MRI. Detecting ICH is crucial for pregnancy management and future treatment decisions aimed at improving fetal survival and reducing brain damage. This report presents the diagnosis and outcomes of two cases of prenatal ICH.Cases presentationThe first case involves a 30-year-old pregnant woman with irregular prenatal care diagnosed with ICH at 32 weeks of gestation via US and MRI. She chose to continue the pregnancy, delivering a 3160g male infant at 36 weeks via cesarean section. Following NICU care including resuscitation and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, the infant was discharged. Subsequent examinations showed a reduction in ventricle size. In the second case, a 27-year-old woman taking acenocoumarol for a mechanical heart valve developed fetal subdural hemorrhage detected by US and MRI. She opted to terminate the pregnancy, resulting in a stillborn male infant weighing 1530g.ConclusionFetal ICH presents with varying severity and prognostic implications, diagnosed and graded using US. Fetal cranial MRI may help clarify the etiology. Management remains controversial, with termination of pregnancy potentially warranted in severe cases due to poor prognosis. Further research is needed to refine management and improve outcomes in fetal ICH.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4e59ba4104ca784cc4f3384d7f50baefc2bc852b02216b66721bfb03755aa76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
