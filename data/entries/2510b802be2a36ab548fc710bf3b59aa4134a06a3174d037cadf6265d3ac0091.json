{"title":"Characterization of the complete mitochondrial genome of <i>Desmaulus extinctorium</i> (Littorinimorpha, Calyptraeoidea, Calyptraeidae) and molecular phylogeny of Littorinimorpha","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301389","date":1711634400000,"content":"<p>by Yanwen Ma, Biqi Zheng, Jiji Li, Wei Meng, Kaida Xu, Yingying Ye</p>\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of determining the placement of Calyptraeidae within the Littorinimorpha, we hereby furnish a thorough analysis of the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of <i>Desmaulus extinctorium</i>. This mitogenome spans 16,605 base pairs and encompasses the entire set of 37 genes, including 13 PCGs, 22 tRNAs and two rRNAs, with an evident AT bias. Notably, <i>tRNA</i><sup>Ser1</sup> and <i>tRNA</i><sup>Ser2</sup> lack dihydrouracil (DHU) arms, resulting in an inability to form a secondary structure. Similarly, <i>tRNA</i><sup>Ala</sup> lacks a TÎ¨C arm, rendering it incapable of forming a secondary structure. In contrast, the remaining tRNAs demonstrate a characteristic secondary structure reminiscent of a cloverleaf. A comparison with ancestral gastropods reveals distinct differences in three gene clusters (or genes), encompassing 15 tRNAs and eight PCGs. Notably, inversions and translocations represent the major types of rearrangements observed in <i>D</i>. <i>extinctorium</i>. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates robust support for a monophyletic grouping of all Littorinimorpha species, with <i>D</i>. <i>extinctorium</i> representing a distinct Calyptraeoidea clade. In summary, this investigation provides the first complete mitochondrial dataset for a species of the Calyptraeidae, thus providing novel insights into the phylogenetic relationships within the Littorinimorpha.","author":"Yanwen Ma","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2510b802be2a36ab548fc710bf3b59aa4134a06a3174d037cadf6265d3ac0091","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
