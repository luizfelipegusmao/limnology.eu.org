{"title":"Depth of Defect Detection in Immersive Environments through Ultrasonic Sensor Data Analysis and Recommender System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1424/v1","date":1729262218000,"content":"The study investigates using a recommender system to improve the accuracy of depth of defect (DoD) estimation in immersive steel samples. The proposed method can enhance prediction performance and be applied across various industries like water, oil, and gas. The recommender system is trained on experimental data from an immersive wedge sample and then evaluated on test data from a different sample to demonstrate its potential for precise and non-invasive DoD detection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72c0fa172c54de4505cb0d33f57bf3cea7be33b911f666362afd713721e24678","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
