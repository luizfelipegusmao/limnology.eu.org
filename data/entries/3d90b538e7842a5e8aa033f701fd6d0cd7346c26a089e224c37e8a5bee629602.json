{"title":"Epigenetic Diversity and the Evolutionary Potential of Wild Populations","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.70011?af=R","date":1729579490000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Fast-paced selective pressures imposed by climate change and anthropogenic activities call for adaptive evolutionary responses to emerge at ecological timescales. However, the evolution and heritability of genomic variation underlie mechanistic constraints, which dictate a slower pace of adaptation exclusively relying on standing genetic variation and novel mutations. Environmentally responsive epigenetic mechanisms can allow acclimatisation and adaptive phenotypes to arise faster than DNA sequence-based mechanisms alone. Nevertheless, the knowledge gap between identifying epigenetic marks and effectively deeming them functional is still wide in a natural context and often outside the scope of model organisms. With this Special Issue, we aimed to narrow this gap by presenting a compilation of original research articles, reviews and opinions on the topic of epigenetics in wild populations. We contextualised this collection within the overarching topic of conservation biology, as we firmly propose that epigenetic research can significantly enhance the effectiveness of conservation measures. Contributions highlighted the putative role of epigenetic variation in the acclimatisation and adaptive potential of species and populations directly and indirectly affected by climatic shifts and anthropogenic actions. They further exemplified how epigenetic variation can be used as biomarkers for monitoring variations in physiology, phenology and behaviour. Lastly, reviews and perspective articles illustrated the past and present of epigenetic research in wild populations while suggesting future research avenues.</p>","author":"Miguel Baltazar‐Soares, \nAlice Balard, \nMelanie J.
