{"title":"Development and Control of Biofilms in Diabetic Foot Infections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0061/v1","date":1727780198000,"content":"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a multifactorial pathophysiologic condition that occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Approximately 9.1 to 26.1 million people are affected by DFUs annually. This condition can lead to progressive foot infections and, ultimately, foot amputation. Various microbes contribute to DFUs, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli can form biofilms composed of complex matrices that create a protective shield around the microorganisms, enhancing their survival and resistance to treatment. Biofilm formation is a critical virulence factor directly associated with the onset and persistence of DFUs. It not only complicates the clinical management of these ulcers but also facilitates antibiotic resistance, necessitating a comprehensive approach to treatment. Effective management strategies must therefore target biofilm formation and the virulence factors associated with these pathogens. By addressing these elements, conventional antibiotics can be rendered more effective in treating diabetic foot ulcers. This approach aims not only to promote wound healing but also to address underlying causes and prevent further complications. This article seeks to highlight the significance of biofilm formation in DFUs, explore methodologies for studying this condition, as well as discuss demographic considerations and treatment options.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00a7ec93242a02021eb1011ef2587660c296df681c38694dd2591b95767caad1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
