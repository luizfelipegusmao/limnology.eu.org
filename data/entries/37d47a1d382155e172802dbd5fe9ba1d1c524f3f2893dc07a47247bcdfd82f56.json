The enhanced flexibility in terms of scattering range detection in comparison with STEM is one of the reasons that led to the increased interest in 4D-STEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.120-B1\">1</a>]. Supported by the recent evolution of pixelated detectors, 4D-STEM currently allows for the recording of the complete electron scattering range at speeds commensurate with traditional STEM experiments [<a href=\"#ozae044.120-B2\">2</a>]. With the possibility of flexible reconstruction of virtual STEM images with arbitrary detector shapes, contrast optimization for sample regions with different scattering cross-sections is envisioned. This study delves into the optimization of contrast in virtual 4D-STEM images, employing both user-guided and machine-learning (ML) optimization approaches.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"37d47a1d382155e172802dbd5fe9ba1d1c524f3f2893dc07a47247bcdfd82f56","category":"Environment"}
