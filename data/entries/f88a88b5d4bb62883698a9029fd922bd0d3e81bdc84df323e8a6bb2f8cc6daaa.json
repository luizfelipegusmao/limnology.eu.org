{"title":"Effects of Sand Burial Depth on Bivalve Species Predation by the Invasive Blue Crab, Callinectes sapidus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0152/v1","date":1714713617000,"content":"In the Ebro Delta, the abundance of burrowing bivalves has dramatically decreased, with the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, being blamed by shellfish collectors. Trends from 2010 evidence a decrease in the capture of clams (Ruditapes spp.) before 2016 (start of blue crab fisheries), although further decline of both clam and cockle (Cerastoderma glaucum) occurred in 2018. In contrast, captures of razor clam (Ensis siliqua) have increased by 3.6-fold since 2016. Predation risk for these taxa with contrasting burrowing capacities (1.7 ± 0.3cm, 0.4 ± 0.2cm, and 26.3 ± 0.1cm, respectively), was assessed using predation preference (N= 5 tanks; 5 individuals of each species) and no-choice experiments (N= 5 tanks; 15 individuals) in the absence and in the presence of sand. Results showed that in the absence of sand, the razor clam, was fully preyed in 24h, clams in 96h, and cockles reached 60% after 144h. Conversely, when sand was present, only 4% of razor clams were predated, while clams and cockles reached 60-100% in 120-144h. No-choice results featured similar patterns depending on substrate availability. Overall, clams and cockles appear to be greatly vulnerable to blue crab predation, whereas the razor clam may escape thanks to its deeper burrowing capacity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f88a88b5d4bb62883698a9029fd922bd0d3e81bdc84df323e8a6bb2f8cc6daaa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
