{"title":"Understanding interaction in problematic dementia and social care encounters: Protocol for a micro-level study combining video-ethnography and Conversation Analysis (CA)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305069","date":1718373600000,"content":"<p>by John Chatwin, Katherine Ludwin, Danielle Jones, Alison Bravington</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>It is well established that the actions and behaviour of dementia care workers are fundamental to the wellbeing of the people they care for. Not only do they deal with basic healthcare needs, but they also perform a vital psycho-social function by providing–through their regular presence–an underlying continuity for residents. This has been shown to improve well-being, particularly for those in the advanced stages of dementia. It has also been suggested that there are additional psycho-social benefits of such contact which can directly influence the need for anti-psychotic medication. However, unlike most other healthcare and medical settings, the specialised and often difficult interactions that dementia care workers handle every day have not yet been the subject of detailed micro-level analysis. This is particularly significant because much of the impact that care-workers have relates to the way in which they interact with the people they care for. Not having a clear understanding of how their interactions ‘work’ at the micro-level–particularly ones that are specific to dementia care settings, and that care workers report to be difficult or challenging–means that any training interventions that are developed may not resonate with their real-world experience, and ultimately run the risk of failing. This video-based observational study aims to provide a detailed micro-exploration of problematic and challenging interactions involving care-workers and people living with dementia.</p> Setting and methods <p>The study is based in the UK and will involve up to 20 dementia care staff and 60 people living with dementia. Fieldwork will be conducted in 5 dementia care home and community-based dementia day care settings using naturalistic observational methods (primarily video-ethnography). Data will be analysed using Conversation Analysis (CA).</p>","author":"John Chatwin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5c7b7ad2d0a8b91857d796ff1a8a930511e637e26a81a30df35d6dd2c37a44d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
