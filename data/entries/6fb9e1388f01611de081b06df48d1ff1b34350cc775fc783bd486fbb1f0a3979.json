{"title":"PTSD Increases Risk for Hypertension Development Through PVN Activation and Vascular Dysfunction in Sprague Dawley Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0756/v1","date":1725951277000,"content":"This study investigates the impact of single prolonged stress (SPS), a model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), on cardiovascular responses, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) activity, and vascular function to elucidate the mechanisms linking traumatic stress to hypertension. Although SPS did not directly cause chronic hypertension in male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, it induced acute but transient increases in blood pressure and heart rate and significantly altered the expression of hypertension-associated genes, such as vasopressin, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), and FOSL1 in the PVN. Notably, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) were predominantly elevated in the pre-autonomic regions of the PVN, colocalizing with AT1R- and FOSL1-expressing cells, suggesting that oxidative stress amplifies sympathetic activation and stress responses. SPS also triggered vascular inflammation, evidenced by increased mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα and IL1β) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the aorta, and impaired vascular reactivity to vasoconstrictor and vasodilator stimuli, reflecting compromised vascular function. These findings suggest that SPS sensitizes neuroendocrine, autonomic, and vascular pathways, creating a state of cardiovascular vulnerability that could pre-dispose individuals to hypertension when exposed to additional stressors. Understanding these mechanisms provides critical insights into the pathophysiology of stress-related cardiovascular disorders and underscores the need for targeted therapeutic interventions that address oxidative stress and modulate altered PVN pathways to mitigate the cardiovascular impact of PTSD and related conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6fb9e1388f01611de081b06df48d1ff1b34350cc775fc783bd486fbb1f0a3979","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
