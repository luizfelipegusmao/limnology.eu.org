{"title":"Ageing of a Poly(vinyl Acetate)-Based White Glue and Its Durability in Contemporary Artworks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0866/v1","date":1710687616000,"content":"Poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAC) is a ubiquitous polymer in various industrial applications, including paints and adhesives. While extensive research has focused on understanding the degradation mechanisms of PVAC-based paint, under different environmental conditions, limited attention has been paid to the long-term stability of PVAC-based white glues, especially when used in artworks. This study investigates the accelerated degradation of a commercial PVAC-based white glue considered as representive of this class of materials as used in contemporary artworks, to predict its durability and assess its behavior in art objects. Through accelerated aging experiments and comparison with natural aging observed in artworks, the study reveals the formation of chromophores and the release of plasticizer as key degradation processes. Despite minimal structural modifications in PVAC, the loss of plasticizer leads to an increase in glass transition temperature, affecting the adhesive's cohesive strength and contributing to detachment of materials in artworks. The findings underscore the importance of preventive conservation measures to mitigate degradation issues in PVAC-based artworks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60a2034ef0edcfa43209271c98867310fd1c0e1c0ce00bb9993eae9a57082d6f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
