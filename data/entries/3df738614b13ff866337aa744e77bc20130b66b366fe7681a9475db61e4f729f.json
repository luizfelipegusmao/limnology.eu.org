{"title":"Genetic Diversity of Subtropical Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] Genotypes Based on SSR Markers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1954/v1","date":1719824149000,"content":"Knowledge of the genetic diversity of the available germplasm is an important foundation for crop conservation, management, and improvement. Successful breeding strategies rely on a sound understanding of the genetic diversity of the crop germplasm. This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the genetic diversity of 49 soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] genotypes using SSR markers as well as to evaluate parental potential of these genotypes in cultivar improvement. The bulk of the genotypes were developed in the national soybean breeding program in Zimbabwe between 1940 and 2013. The genetic diversity and relatedness were estimated using 30 SSR markers and produced 5 clusters that generally matched the pedigree information of the germplasm. The SSR analysis detected a total of 135 alleles. The polymorphic information content ranged from 0.10 to 0.77 with a mean of 0.45. The SSR primer, Satt012 was the most informative. The SSR marker analysis showed a wide genetic diversity in the germplasm. To date, there are no reports regarding the genetic diversity analysis of soybean germplasm in Zimbabwe. The genotypes, EL41 and EL7; EL41 and EL1; as well as EL41 and EL42 were the most divergent thus, indicating their potential use as parental lines in the genetic improvement of soybean in the region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3df738614b13ff866337aa744e77bc20130b66b366fe7681a9475db61e4f729f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
