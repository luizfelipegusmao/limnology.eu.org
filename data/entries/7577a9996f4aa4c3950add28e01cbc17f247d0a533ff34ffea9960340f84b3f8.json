{"title":"Phytogenic effects of Marrubium vulgare on the growth performance of weaned piglets: biochemical parameters and liquid chromatographic–electrospray ionization–mass spectrometric profile of plant and animal serum","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13799?af=R","date":1723103397000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Multidrug-resistant bacteria in humans have prompted the search for alternative solutions derived from herbal medicines that can substitute antibiotics in livestock production. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the phytogenic properties of <i>Marrubium vulgare</i> infusion (MVI) on weaned pigs. Thirty animals were randomly divided into five groups of six animals, each receiving a physiological solution, clenbuterol and the infusion extract at doses of 0.01 (MVI 1%), 0.1 (MVI 10%) and 0.2 (MVI 20%) mg kg<sup>−1</sup> for 28 days. Biochemical parameters and the liquid chromatographic–electrospray ionization–mass spectrometric (LC-ESI-MS) chemical profiles of the infusion extract and animal serum were studied.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The doses MVI 1 and 10% led to weight gain higher than the controls. No significant changes were noted in the biochemical parameters including erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume and others. Evaluation of enzymatic levels in blood revealed no significant changes. LC-ESI-MS data of MVI showed the presence of 34 secondary metabolites, and successive chromatographic purification of MVI yielded marrubiin and apigenin as major components. LC-ESI-MS data of animal serum showed the presence of a diterpene, a flavonoid and diverse cholic acid derivatives.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Results indicated the doses MVI 1 and 10% promote weight gain with no significant alterations in blood biochemicals, and liver and kidney function. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ana Caroline da Silva, \nGuinter Silva Da Cunha, \nTiago Tizziani, \nValfredo Schlemper, \nLouis P Sandjo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"7577a9996f4aa4c3950add28e01cbc17f247d0a533ff34ffea9960340f84b3f8","category":"Environment"}
