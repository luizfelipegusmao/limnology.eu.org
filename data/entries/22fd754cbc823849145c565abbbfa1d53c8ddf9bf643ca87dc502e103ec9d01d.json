{"title":"Dosage optimization for reducing tumor burden using a phenotype-structured population model with a drug-resistance continuum","link":"https://academic.oup.com/imammb/article/41/1/35/7614350?rss=1","date":1708905600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Drug resistance is a significant obstacle to effective cancer treatment. To gain insights into how drug resistance develops, we adopted a concept called fitness landscape and employed a phenotype-structured population model by fitting to a set of experimental data on a drug used for ovarian cancer, olaparib. Our modeling approach allowed us to understand how a drug affects the fitness landscape and track the evolution of a population of cancer cells structured with a spectrum of drug resistance. We also incorporated pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling to identify the optimal dosages of the drug that could lead to long-term tumor reduction. We derived a formula that indicates that maximizing variation in plasma drug concentration over a dosing interval could be important in reducing drug resistance. Our findings suggest that it may be possible to achieve better treatment outcomes with a drug dose lower than the levels recommended by the drug label. Acknowledging the current limitations of our work, we believe that our approach, which combines modeling of both PK and drug resistance evolution, could contribute to a new direction for better designing drug treatment regimens to improve cancer treatment.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Mathematical Medicine and Biology: A Journal of the IMA Current Issue","siteHash":"8e41cf2ed671fc83106bccd712981630d68940d521d41091ba0f730fc4a24554","entryHash":"22fd754cbc823849145c565abbbfa1d53c8ddf9bf643ca87dc502e103ec9d01d","category":"Environment"}
