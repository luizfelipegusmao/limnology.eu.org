{"title":"OsRH52A, a DEAD-box protein, regulates functional megaspore specification and is required for embryo sac development in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/4802/7655354?rss=1","date":1713571200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The development of the embryo sac is an important factor that affects seed setting in rice. Numerous genes associated with embryo sac (ES) development have been identified in plants; however, the function of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family genes is poorly known in rice. Here, we characterized a rice DEAD-box protein, RH52A, which is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm and highly expressed in the floral organs. The knockout mutant <span>rh52a</span> displayed partial ES sterility, including degeneration of the ES (21%) and the presence of a double-female-gametophyte (DFG) structure (11.8%). The DFG developed from two functional megaspores near the chalazal end in one ovule, and 3.4% of DFGs were able to fertilize via the sac near the micropylar pole in <span>rh52a</span>. RH52A was found to interact with MFS1 and ZIP4, both of which play a role in homologous recombination in rice meiosis. RNA-sequencing identified 234 down-regulated differentially expressed genes associated with reproductive development, including two, <span>MSP1</span> and <span>HSA1b</span>, required for female germline cell specification. Taken together, our study demonstrates that <span>RH52A</span> is essential for the development of the rice embryo sac and provides cytological details regarding the formation of DFGs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"cd6f49e427625071b76154bb9410d29f9b770c825c4b90952c736f2987d5a950","category":"Environment"}
