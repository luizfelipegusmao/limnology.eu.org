Currently, pharmacological therapies for myocardial fibrosis are limited, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches. The particulate guanylyl cyclase B (GC-B) receptor possesses beneficial antifibrotic actions through the binding of its natural ligand C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and the generation of the intracellular second messenger, cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP). These actions include the suppression of fibroblast proliferation and reduction in collagen synthesis. With its abundant expression on fibroblasts, the GC-B receptor has emerged as a key molecular target for innovative CVD therapeutics. However, small molecules that can bind and potentiate the GC-B/cGMP pathway have yet to be discovered. From a cell-based high-throughput screening initiative of the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository and hit-to-lead evolution based on a series of structure–activity relationships, we report the successful discovery of MCUF-42, a GC-B-targeted small molecule that acts as a positive allosteric modulator (PAM). Studies herein support MCUF-42's ability to enhance the binding affinity between GC-B and CNP. Moreover, MCUF-42 potentiated cGMP levels induced by CNP in human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) and notably also enhanced the inhibitory effect of CNP on HCF proliferation. Together, our findings highlight that MCUF-42 is a small molecule that can modulate the GC-B/cGMP signaling pathway, potentially enhancing the antifibrotic actions of CNP. Thus, these data underscore the continued development of GC-B small molecule PAMs as a novel therapeutic strategy for targeting cardiac fibrosis and CVD.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"01a703b4343094c2aedb7d77e4f2e5417b1b35830c51466195a84f044dd378cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
