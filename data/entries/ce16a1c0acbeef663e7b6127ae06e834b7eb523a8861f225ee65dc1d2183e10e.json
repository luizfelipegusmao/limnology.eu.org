Unfortunately, pure Cr suffers from poor room temperature ductility and formability, with early attempts at improving the ductility of Cr-based alloys included alloying additions like Re (up to 40 at%) proved to be cost-prohibitive [<a href=\"#ozae044.275-B5\">5</a>] – limiting scalability and widespread adoption. However, as the temperature limits of current Ni-based superalloys are reached, there has been renewed interest in the development of new (and ductile) Cr-based alloys for next generation aerospace and energy generation applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.275-B6\">6–8</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ce16a1c0acbeef663e7b6127ae06e834b7eb523a8861f225ee65dc1d2183e10e","category":"Environment"}
