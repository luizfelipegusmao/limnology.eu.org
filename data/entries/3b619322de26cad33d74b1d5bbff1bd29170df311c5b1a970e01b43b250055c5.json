{"title":"Determination of relative bioavailability of copper from copper glycinate in growing beef steers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae105/7712691?rss=1","date":1720742400000,"content":"<span><div>ABSTRACT</div>Chelated copper (<strong>Cu</strong>) sources, such as Cu glycinate (<strong>CuGly</strong>), may be more bioavailable relative to Cu sulfate (<strong>CuSO</strong><sub><strong>4</strong></sub>) when fed to ruminants under antagonistic pressure. The objective of this study was to determine the bioavailability of CuGly (GemStone Cu; Phibro Animal Health) relative to CuSO<sub>4</sub> in steers fed a diet supplemented with 0.3% sulfur and 2 mg molybdenum/kg of dry matter (<strong>DM</strong>). Sixty Angus crossbred steers (<span>n</span> = 12 per treatment) averaging 288 ± 4.85 kg were enrolled in a 90-d study and fed a corn silage-based diet with one of five Cu supplementation strategies, including no supplemental Cu <strong>(CON</strong>), 5 or 10 mg supplemental Cu from CuSO<sub>4</sub>/kg DM, and 5 or 10 mg supplemental Cu from CuGly/kg DM. Steers were housed in pens equipped with GrowSafe feed bunks (GrowSafe Systems Ltd., Airdire, AB, Canada), with six steers per pen. Growth performance, liver Cu, and plasma Cu were analyzed in the MIXED procedure of SAS 9.4 (SAS Inst. Inc, Cary, NC) with orthogonal contrasts to compare CON vs. 5 mg Cu/kg DM, CON vs. 10 mg Cu/kg DM, 5 vs. 10 mg Cu/kg DM, and CuSO<sub>4</sub> vs. CuGly. Copper indices were regressed against Cu intake and slopes were calculated using the GLM procedure SAS. Dietary Cu supplementation did not affect steer body weights on days 0, 28, 56, or 90 (<span>P </span>≥ 0.52), average daily gain, dry matter intake, or gain:feed (<span>P </span>≥ 0.36). Final plasma Cu concentration did not differ between CON vs. 5 mg Cu/kg DM (<span>P </span>= 0.79), CON vs. 10 mg Cu/kg DM (<span>P</span> = 0.65), or 5 vs. 10 mg Cu/kg DM (<span>P </span>= 0.39). Steers receiving CuSO<sub>4</sub> tended to have greater final plasma Cu concentrations than those receiving CuGly (<span>P </span>= 0.08). Initial liver Cu concentration averaged 374 mg Cu/kg DM, which is considered highly adequate. No steers reached deficient Cu status by the end of the 90-d period. Control steers had lesser final liver Cu concentrations than supplemented steers (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.04). Steers receiving 10 mg supplemental Cu/kg DM had greater liver Cu concentrations than those receiving 5 mg supplemental Cu/kg DM (<span>P </span>= 0.01). Copper source had no effect on final liver Cu concentrations (<span>P</span> = 0.57) and based on liver Cu and Cu intake the bioavailability of CuGly was similar to CuSO<sub>4</sub> (115%; <span>P</span> = 0.27). The initially high Cu status and the fact that cattle did not become Cu deficient may have impacted the relative bioavailability results, and more research is needed to investigate the role initial Cu status and antagonistic pressure play in the bioavailability of chelated Cu sources.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"3b619322de26cad33d74b1d5bbff1bd29170df311c5b1a970e01b43b250055c5","category":"Environment"}
