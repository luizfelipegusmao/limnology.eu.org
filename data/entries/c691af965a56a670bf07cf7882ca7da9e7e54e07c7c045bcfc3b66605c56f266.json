{"title":"Virtual Prototyping Based Development of Stepper Motor Design","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0619/v1","date":1728425292000,"content":"The study presents a methodology, used in the design development of stepper motors. The methodology unites virtual and physical techniques to assess the structure under development at its various design stages. Virtual prototyping is used twice, at the concept and early design stages. Concept check aims to give more general directions for further design development, while the simulations at the detailed design stage allow assessing various design parameters at a high level of confidence. The testing of a physical prototype is used to validate simulation results. It is also used to check the design just before it's finished. The presented methodology is demonstrated in an industrial use case for stepper motor development for hydraulic valve application.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c691af965a56a670bf07cf7882ca7da9e7e54e07c7c045bcfc3b66605c56f266","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
