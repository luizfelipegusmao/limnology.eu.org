{"title":"Exploring Maillard reaction markers and melanoidins to investigate toxicological and antioxidant profiles of optimized expanded snacks from corn/common bean mixtures","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13730?af=R","date":1720701493000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Extrusion cooking of cereal-legume flour mixture is an innovative strategy to introduce nutrient-enriched ready-to-eat snacks to the market. However, this thermal process triggers the formation of compounds that could impact safety aspects of these products. Maillard reaction markers and the end products known as melanoidins were evaluated to assess the toxicological and bioactive profiles of extruded snacks from corn-plus-common-bean-flour combinations. Different molecular weight fractions were isolated and purified to analyze their antioxidant activity and to investigate the role of melanoidins.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The snack formulated with an 84:16 ratio of corn:common bean flours exhibited an enhanced toxicological profile. It displayed the lowest levels of acrylamide and furanic compounds, along with reduced blockage of lysine residues in the protein. Extrusion increased the antioxidant activity of uncooked flours (30 to 64%) and total phenolic compounds (26 to 50%), and decreased the available lysine (−72.7 to −79.5%). During the fractionation process, it was established that compounds within the range of 3–10 kDa made the greatest contribution to antioxidant activity. The fraction greater than 10 kDa, which included melanoidins, displayed 7 to 33% lower antioxidant activity. The purification of the fraction greater than 10 kDa revealed that pure melanoidins represented approximately one-third of the antioxidant activity in that fraction. Non-covalent adducts linked to the melanoidin core therefore had a relevant role in the antioxidant action of formulated snacks.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This investigation illustrates the importance of considering both potential risks and associated benefits of compounds formed during the Maillard reaction while developing new extruded snacks. © 2024 The Author(s).
