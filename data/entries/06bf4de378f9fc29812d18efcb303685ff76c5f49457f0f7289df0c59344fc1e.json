This study explores the relationships between county-level factors and COVID-19 mortality outcomes in the U.S. from 2020 to 2023, focusing on disparities in healthcare access, vaccination coverage, and socioeconomic characteristics. We conduct multi-variable rolling regression analyses to reveal associations between various factors and COVID-19 mortality outcomes, defined as Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Overall Mortality to Hospitalization Rate (OMHR), at the U.S. county level. Each analysis examines the association between mortality outcomes and one of the three hierarchical levels of the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), along with other factors such as access to hospital beds, vaccination coverage, and demographic characteristics. Our results reveal persistent and dynamic correlations between various factors and COVID-19 mortality measures. Access to hospital beds and higher vaccination coverage showed persistent protective effects, while higher Social Vulnerability Index was associated with worse outcomes persistently. Socioeconomic status and vulnerable household characteristics within the SVI consistently associated with elevated mortality. Poverty, lower education, unemployment, housing cost burden, single-parent households, and disability population showed significant associations with Case Fatality Rates during different stages of the pandemic. Vulnerable age groups demonstrated varying associations with mortality measures, with worse outcomes predominantly during the Original strain. Rural-Urban Continuum Code exhibited predominantly positive associations with CFR and OMHR, while it starts with a positive OMHR association during the Original strain. This study reveals longitudinal persistent and dynamic factors associated with two mortality rate measures throughout the pandemic, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities. The findings emphasize the urgency of implementing targeted policies and interventions to address disparities in the fight against future pandemics and the pursuit of improved public health outcomes.","author":"Fardin Ganjkhanloo","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"06bf4de378f9fc29812d18efcb303685ff76c5f49457f0f7289df0c59344fc1e","category":"Environment"}
