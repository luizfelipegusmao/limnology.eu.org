{"title":"101 Effects of moderate exercise regimen on reproductive development of replacement beef heifers reared in drylots at a high stocking density","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/35/7617989?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This experiment evaluated growth and reproductive development of beef heifers reared at a high stocking density and provided with access to an exercise area. The experiment was replicated over 2 yr, with a total of 180 Angus × Brahman heifers. Each year, 90 heifers were ranked by age (264 ± 1 d) and body weight (BW; 200 ± 2 kg) on d 0, and assigned to a) 1 of 6 drylot pens (10 × 14 m pens; 10 heifers/pen) resulting in a stocking density of 14 m<sup>2</sup>/heifer (DENS), or b) 1 of 3 paddocks (2-ha paddocks; 10 heifers/paddock) resulting in a stocking density of 2,000 m<sup>2</sup>/heifer (CON). On d 15, 3 DENS pens were randomly selected and given access to an exercise area (DENS-EX) for 1 h three times weekly. Negligible forage was available for CON heifers, whereas all heifers received the same limit fed diet which averaged 13 kg/heifer daily of a corn-based diet. Heifer shrunk BW was recorded after 16 h of feed and water withdrawal on d -3 and 225 for BW gain calculation. Heifer temperament (chute score, exit velocity, and temperament score) were evaluated on d 0 and 225. Heifers were also fitted on d 0 with a pedometer behind their shoulder and an ear tag (CowManager, Select Sires, Plain City, OH) to record behavioral responses. Each week, pedometer results were recorded, and blood samples were collected for puberty evaluation via plasma progesterone. Heifers from CON had more (P &lt; 0.05) steps per week compared with DENS and DENS-EX (23,973, 6,706, and 12,354 steps/week, respectively; SEM = 1,247), and DENS-EX heifers had more (P &lt; 0.05) steps per week compared with DENS. Heifers from CON spent more (P &lt; 0.05) time ruminating and eating compared with DENS and DENS-EX. No treatment effects (P ≥ 0.91) were detected for heifer BW gain (0.820, 0.815, and 0.824 kg/d for CON, DENS, and DENS-EX, respectively; SEM = 0.016). Heifers from DENS had greater (P ≤ 0.05) exit velocity and temperament score on d 225 compared with DENS-EX and CON. Heifers from DENS experienced delayed puberty attainment (treatment x day; P &lt; 0.01) compared with DENS-EX and CON. A greater (P ≤ 0.05) proportion of CON heifers were pubertal by day 105 compared with DENS and DENS-EX (30.0, 11.6, and 15.0%, respectively; SEM = 6.5), whereas a greater (P &lt; 0.05) proportion of CON and DENS-EX heifers were pubertal by d 154 compared with DENS (61.7, 66.7, and 43.3%, respectively; SEM = 6.5). Results from this experiment demonstrate that providing heifers with an exercise area alleviated the negative effects associated with high stocking density on their reproductive development.
