Soybean, however, is vulnerable to ozone pollution, leading to low performance and yield. As ozone pollution is projected to increase, a crucial task is understanding how ozone damages soybean and soil microbes, which could reveal a crisis in underground ecosystems. This study demonstrates how long-term ozone pollution profoundly degrades plant and soil health by altering plant-microbe-soil interactions. The findings highlight the urgency for adaptive strategies against future food and economic losses resulting from ozone damage.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) threatens agroecosystems, yet its long-term effects on intricate plant-microbe-soil interactions remain overlooked. This study employed two soybean genotypes of contrasting O<sub>3</sub>-sensitivity grown in field plots exposed elevated O<sub>3</sub> (eO<sub>3</sub>) and evaluated cause-effect relationships with their associated soil microbiomes and soil quality. Results revealed long-term eO<sub>3</sub> effects on belowground soil microbiomes and soil health surpass damage visible on plants. Elevated O<sub>3</sub> significantly disrupted belowground bacteria-fungi interactions, reduced fungal diversity, and altered fungal community assembly by impacting soybean physiological properties. Particularly, eO<sub>3</sub> impacts on plant performance were significantly associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, undermining their contribution to plants, whereas eO<sub>3</sub> increased fungal saprotroph proliferation, accelerating soil organic matter decomposition and soil carbon pool depletion. Free-living diazotrophs exhibited remarkable acclimation under eO<sub>3</sub>, improving plant performance by enhancing nitrogen fixation. However, overarching detrimental consequences of eO<sub>3</sub> negated this benefit. Overall, this study demonstrated long-term eO<sub>3</sub> profoundly governed negative impacts on plant-soil-microbiota interactions, pointing to a potential crisis for agroecosystems. These findings highlight urgent needs to develop adaptive strategies to navigate future eO<sub>3</sub> scenarios.</p>","author":"Kaile Zhang, \nRodolfo Zentella, \nKent O.
