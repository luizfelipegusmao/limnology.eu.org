{"title":"The Role of Blockchain Technology in Enhancing Supply Chain Transparency in Italy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1405/v1","date":1716457637000,"content":"Purpose: This study aims to investigate the role of blockchain technology in enhancing supply chain transparency in Italy.Design/Methodology/Approach: A quantitative research approach was employed, with data collected through a structured questionnaire distributed to 240 companies across various industries in Italy. The questionnaire focused on assessing blockchain adoption rates, interoperability standards, stakeholder collaboration, regulatory support, cost considerations, and perceived impacts on supply chain transparency.Findings: The findings reveal high levels of blockchain adoption among surveyed companies, with strong positive correlations observed between blockchain adoption and interoperability standards, stakeholder collaboration, and regulatory support. However, challenges such as cost considerations and potential trade-offs between interoperability and transparency were also identified. Overall, blockchain technology shows promise in improving supply chain transparency in Italy.Research Limitations/Implications: This study is limited by its focus on a specific geographical context (Italy) and the use of self-reported data. Future research could explore the dynamics of blockchain adoption in other regions and employ objective measures to assess supply chain transparency.Practical Implications: The findings offer practical insights for businesses and policymakers aiming to leverage blockchain technology to enhance supply chain transparency and efficiency.Social Implications: Blockchain adoption has the potential to foster greater trust and accountability within supply chains, benefiting various stakeholders including consumers, producers, and regulators.Originality/Value: This study contributes to the growing body of literature on blockchain technology in supply chain management, particularly within the Italian context, by providing empirical evidence on its adoption and impact on transparency.Limitations: Despite the robust methodology employed, limitations include the reliance on self-reported data and the exclusion of qualitative insights.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"564dbf4bedad40b5ad371919ecf5131e7c196b9377e6a06647ce4eb49807bbcd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
