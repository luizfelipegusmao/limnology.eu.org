{"title":"Genetic Analysis of 252 Index Cases with Inherited Retinal Diseases Using a Panel of 351 Retinal Genes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0581/v1","date":1718110866000,"content":"Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are extremely heterogeneous with at least 350 causative genes, complicating the process of genetic diagnosis. We analyzed samples of 252 index cases with IRDs using the Blueprint Genetics panel for “Retinal Dystrophy” that includes 351 genes. The cause of disease could be identified in 55% of cases. A clear difference was obtained between newly-recruited cases (74% solved) and cases that were previously analyzed by panels or whole exome sequencing (26% solved). As for the mode of inheritance, 75% of solved cases were autosomal recessive (AR), 10% were X-linked, 8% were autosomal dominant, and 7% were mitochondrial. Interestingly, in 12% of solved cases, structural variants (SVs) were identified as the cause of disease. The most commonly identified genes were ABCA4, EYS and USH2A, and the most common mutations were MAK-c.1297_1298ins353 and FAM161A- c.1355_1356del. In line with our previous IRD carrier analysis, we identified heterozygous AR mutations that are not the cause of disease in 36% of cases. The studied IRD panel was found to be efficient in gene identification. Some variants were mis-interpreted by the pipeline and therefore multiple analysis tools are recommended to obtain more accurate annotation of potential disease-causing variant.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0f3fa19309ecd790dfb15edf0021839c75f5b941d46b0992aa5926f92df10689","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
