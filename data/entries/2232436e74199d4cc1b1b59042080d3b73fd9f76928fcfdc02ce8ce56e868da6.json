(2023)</a> found a warm-up effect whereby singing at high rates during the dawn chorus subsequently increases song performance in Adelaideâ€™s warblers (<span>Setophaga adelaidae</span>), as evaluated by two metrics of vocal performance (their Figures 4a and 4c). These two metrics are based on trade-offs between singing (1) long notes and short inter-note intervals (gaps) or (2) short gaps and wide changes in frequency between notes (gap bandwidth). Such trade-offs between song traits suggest physiological limitations whereby the performance of both traits cannot be maximized simultaneously. The two metrics were computed with reference to a quantile regression (QR) line of (1) gap duration on note duration or of (2) gap duration on gap bandwidth. Distances to these QR lines were then used to assess how much songs approached a performance boundary and, thus, infer how demanding they are to sing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Behavioral Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"1db0533e04d0549951ccffff4320904ff6ab62ef3f2aa22718600b7dc255e125","entryHash":"2232436e74199d4cc1b1b59042080d3b73fd9f76928fcfdc02ce8ce56e868da6","category":"Environment"}
