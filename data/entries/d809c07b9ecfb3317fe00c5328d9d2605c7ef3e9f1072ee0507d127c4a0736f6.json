{"title":"Study on the Macro-Fine Mechanical Behavior of Ores Flow Based on Discrete Element Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0877/v1","date":1710510060000,"content":"The accompanying mechanical behavior during the flow of ore-rock dispersion is an important factor leading to the instability and failure of the orepass in the ore storage section. It is of great significance to accurately understand the instability characteristics of the well wall in the ore section, during the ore drawing process by understanding the flow characteristics and internal mechanical transfer mechanism of ore-rock dispersion. Using the discrete element method to analyze the flow characteristics, contact compactness, stress distribution characteristics and contact force probability distribution of the ore-rock dispersion, it realizes the quantitative characterization of the damage degree of ore-rock flow, and reveals the damage mechanism of mine storage wall. The results show that: (1) The friction between ore-rock particles, between ore-rock and well wall is an important reason for the change of the macroscopic flow form of ore-rock from “one” to “V” type. (2) The compactness and stress concentration of ores are increasing with the increase of storage depth, which is shown that with the increase of storage depth, the greater the probability of well wall instability. (3) The probability distribution of contact force strength between particles decreases exponentially in the whole process of ore drawing, in which the strong chain plays a major role in the stability of the dispersion system. (4) The number of overpressure and the overpressure coefficient can be used to quantitatively characterize the wall damage degree under the action of ore-rock flow. The dynamic side pressure decreases periodically in the form of exponential fluctuations, and the dynamic load formed by the ore-rock flow mainly played a role in the lower area of the ore storage section.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d809c07b9ecfb3317fe00c5328d9d2605c7ef3e9f1072ee0507d127c4a0736f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
