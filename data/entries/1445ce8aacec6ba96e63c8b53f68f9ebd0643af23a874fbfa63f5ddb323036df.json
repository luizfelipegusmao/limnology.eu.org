{"title":"A Study on Burden of Iron Deficiency Anemia in Anemic Overweight and Obese Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1306/v1","date":1713780733000,"content":"The study, conducted at the Department of Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College and associated Lok Nayak Hospital, aimed to investigate the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia among anaemic overweight and obese individuals. Fifty participants were included after screening and consent, undergoing socio-demographic assessment, clinical evaluation, and laboratory investigations. Middle to old-aged individuals predominated (Mean ± SD: 54.54 ± 11.32 years), with females comprising 62%. All subjects were obese (mean BMI: 37.27 ± 5.71 kg/m²), with common comorbidities including hypertension (68%), diabetes (36%), and obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (32%). Nutritional deficiencies, particularly iron deficiency, were prevalent, affecting 62% of subjects, with 48% having iron deficiency alone. Anemia of chronic illness was observed in 38%. Laboratory parameters showed low hemoglobin (8.53 ± 1.23 g/dL), MCV (78.75 ± 10.13 fL), and elevated ESR (20.56 ± 21.47 mm/hour) and CRP levels (4.71 ± 3.32 mg/dL), indicating inflammation. Correlation analyses revealed negative associations between BMI and serum iron/ferritin and positive associations with serum hepcidin. The study underscores the significance of addressing nutritional deficiencies and monitoring iron status in obese populations, suggesting potential associations between obesity and iron metabolism. Further research is needed to explore these relationships for clinical management implications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1445ce8aacec6ba96e63c8b53f68f9ebd0643af23a874fbfa63f5ddb323036df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
