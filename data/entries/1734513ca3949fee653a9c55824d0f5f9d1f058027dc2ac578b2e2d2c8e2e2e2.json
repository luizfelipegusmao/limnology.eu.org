Here, we estimate global N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from livestock manure during 1890–2020 using the tier 2 approach of the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Global N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from livestock manure increased by ~350% from 451 [368–556] Gg N year<sup>−1</sup> in 1890 to 2042 [1677–2514] Gg N year<sup>−1</sup> in 2020. These emissions contributed ~30% to the global anthropogenic N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the decade 2010–2019. Cattle contributed the most (60%) to the increase, followed by poultry (19%), pigs (15%), and sheep and goats (6%). Regionally, South Asia, Africa, and Latin America dominated the growth in global emissions since the 1990s. Nationally, the largest emissions were found in India (329 Gg N year<sup>−1</sup>), followed by China (267 Gg N year<sup>−1</sup>), the United States (163 Gg N year<sup>−1</sup>), Brazil (129 Gg N year<sup>−1</sup>) and Pakistan (102 Gg N year<sup>−1</sup>) in the 2010s. We found a substantial impact of livestock productivity, specifically animal body weight and milk yield, on the emission trends. Furthermore, a large spread existed among different methodologies in estimates of global N<sub>2</sub>O emission from livestock manure, with our results 20%–25% lower than those based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. This study highlights the need for robust time-variant model parameterization and continuous improvement of emissions factors to enhance the precision of emission inventories. Additionally, urgent mitigation is required, as all available inventories indicate a rapid increase in global N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from livestock manure in recent decades.</p>","author":"Lei Zhang, \nShufen Pan, \nZhiyun Ouyang, \nJosep G.
