{"title":"Elementary Particles and Their Interaction with Space-Time Curvature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.0809/v4","date":1716792080000,"content":"This article begins with exploring fundamental limits in the universe. It examines key principles, such as the uniformity of physical laws and Energy conservation, that lead to the principles of maximum speed, locality, and maximum density. These universal limits govern physical phenomena, culminating in very interesting results.They led to the exploration of Quantum black holes. Quantum black holes are relativistically revolving miniature charged black holes consisting of a single core at the highest possible density. They are the only structures small enough to keep all charges quantized (including gravitational charges). I then demonstrated that quarks and leptons comprise smaller entities - the Quantum Black Holes. Exploring these elementary particles reveals that they release their Energy outward, altering the curvature of nearby space-time and providing new insights. We can characterize movements and processes in local space-time with four sets of equations representing the four charge types and one set representing Dark Matter. By the end of the article, I prove that Quantum black holes explain the quantization of gravity, the nature of Luminous and dark Matter, the Mass, size, and (quantized) charges quantities of elementary particles and the nature of neutrino oscillations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"80733b4fc9ea63c8f6f37635fb3e03d4907a520a9ef6f5373ced0e195b42dd2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
