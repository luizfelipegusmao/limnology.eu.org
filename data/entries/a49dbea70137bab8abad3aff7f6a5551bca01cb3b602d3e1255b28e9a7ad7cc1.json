In order to assess the evaluation of China’s carbon reduction progress with the promise made on the Paris Agreement, it is crucial to monitor the carbon flux intensity from coal-fired power plants. Previous studies have calculated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from point sources based on Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 and -3 (OCO-2 and OCO-3) satellite measurements, but the factors affecting CO<sub>2</sub> flux estimations are uncertain. In this study, we employ a Gaussian Plume Model to estimate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from three power plants in China based on OCO-3 XCO<sub>2</sub> measurements. Moreover, flux uncertainties resulting from wind information, background values, satellite CO<sub>2</sub> measurements, and atmospheric stability are discussed. This study highlights the CO<sub>2</sub> flux uncertainty derived from the satellite measurements. Finally, satellite-based CO<sub>2</sub> emission estimates are compared to bottom-up inventories. The satellite-based CO<sub>2</sub> emission estimates at the Tuoketuo and Nongliushi power plants are ∼30 and ∼10 kt d<sup>−1</sup> smaller than the Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide (ODIAC) respectively, but ∼10 kt d<sup>−1</sup> larger than the ODIAC at Baotou.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"a49dbea70137bab8abad3aff7f6a5551bca01cb3b602d3e1255b28e9a7ad7cc1","category":"Environment"}
