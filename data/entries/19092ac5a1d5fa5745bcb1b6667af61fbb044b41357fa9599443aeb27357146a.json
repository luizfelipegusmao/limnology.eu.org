The graphical abstract demonstrates the practical application of SWIS and strategies for improving N pollutant removal performance.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Subsurface wastewater infiltration systems (SWISs) are suggested to be a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method for sewage treatment. However, a comprehensive summary of the relevant mechanisms and optimization methods for nitrogen (N) removal in SWIS is currently lacking. In this review, we first summarize the N transformation mechanisms in SWIS. The impact of operational parameters on the N removal efficiency is then delineated. To enhance pollutant removal and minimize resource wastage, it is advisable to maintain a wet–dry ratio of 1:1 and a hydraulic loading rate of 8–10 cm/day. The organic load should be determined based on influent characteristics to optimize the balance between sewage treatment and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emission. Finally, various strategies and modifications have been suggested to enhance pollutant removal efficiency and reduce N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in SWIS, such as artificial aeration, supply electron donors, and well-designed structures. Overall, greater emphasis should be placed on the design and management of SWIS to optimize their co-benefits while effectively controlling N pollution.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nSWISs are often considered black boxes with their efficiency depending on hydraulic characteristics, biological characteristics, and substrate properties.\nBiological nitrification coupled with denitrification is considered to be the major N removal process.\nIncreasing the reduction of N<sub>2</sub>O to the inert N<sub>2</sub> form is a potential mechanism to mitigate global warming.\nStrategies such as artificial aeration, supply electron donors, and well-designed structures are suggested to improve N removal performance.\n</p>","author":"Xulun Zhou, \nHaibo Li, \nAng Wang, \nXueyan Wang, \nXi Chen, \nChenxi Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"19092ac5a1d5fa5745bcb1b6667af61fbb044b41357fa9599443aeb27357146a","category":"Environment"}
