{"title":"Audio Deep Fake Detection with Sonic Sleuth Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0744/v1","date":1725951648000,"content":"Information dissemination and preservation are crucial for societal progress, especially in the technological age. While technology fosters knowledge sharing, it also risks spreading misinformation. Audio deep fakes, convincingly fabricated audio using Artificial intelligence (AI), exacerbate this issue. We present Sonic Sleuth, an AI model for detecting audio deepfakes. Our approach leverages Deep Learning (DL) for a robust detection model. Meticulous data preprocessing and rigorous experimentation with various models led to the implementation of the most effective solution with a custom CNN model. Our comprehensive testing resulted in a highly accurate model (98.27% accuracy, 0.016 EER) trained on a substantial dataset of real and synthetic audio. In addition to an 84.92% accuracy and 0.085 EER on an external dataset, these results demonstrate Sonic Sleuthâ€™s potential as a powerful tool against audio misinformation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16ca4f9c8780704a20792f56fbf8332fcb75bf1a2cb76fc1a99617f022bf90dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
