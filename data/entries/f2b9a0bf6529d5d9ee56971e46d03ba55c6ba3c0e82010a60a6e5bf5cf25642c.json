This study presents a novel approach for investigating the effect of crude oil and MNPs on the cardiac system of fish. We used salmonid larvae and cardiac cell cultures derived from hearts of salmonid fish and exposed them to environmental stressors. Following exposure to plastic particles or crude oil, the larvae exhibited some variation in contraction rate. In contrast, significant alterations in the contraction rate were observed in all cardiac cell cultures. The greatest differences between the control and treatment groups were observed in cardiac cell cultures derived from older brown trout. Following 7 days of exposure to MNPs or crude oil in Atlantic salmon larval hearts or cardiac cell cultures, there were only minor responses noted in mRNA expression of the selected marker genes. These findings show the use of a novel in vitro technique contributing to the existing body of knowledge on the impact of MNPs and crude oil on the cardiovascular system of salmonids and the associated risk.</p>","author":"Torben Krebs, \nJulia Bauer, \nSarah Graff, \nLukas Teich, \nMarkus Sterneberg, \nMarina Gebert, \nHenrike Seibel, \nBettina Seeger, \nDieter Steinhagen, \nVerena Jung‐Schroers, \nMikolaj Adamek","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"f2b9a0bf6529d5d9ee56971e46d03ba55c6ba3c0e82010a60a6e5bf5cf25642c","category":"Environment"}
