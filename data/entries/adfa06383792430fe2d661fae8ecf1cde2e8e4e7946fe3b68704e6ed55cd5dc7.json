Rare video footage provides tentative evidence that immature males in at least one species (the magnificent bird of paradise) may also bypass these mating preferences by employing 'sneak' mating tactics. One alternative explanation is that females engage in homosexual matings, which is generally rare in polygynous birds.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The bewildering courtship phenotypes of male birds of paradise (<i>Paradisaedae</i>) represent a classic example of sexual selection through mate choice. While the majority of sexual selection studies have focused on either mate choice or intrasexual competition, males across a variety of taxa adopt alternative mating tactics as additional means of obtaining fertilization when they are otherwise unable to. For example, across various polygynous birds, subordinate males engage in sneak copulations, which may offset the fitness costs of prolonged subordinate periods. Despite exhibiting strong mating skews and male delayed plumage maturation, reports of sneak copulation in the birds of paradise are exceedingly rare. After reviewing an extensive video collection of courtship interactions, we found examples of mountings by female-plumaged birds in three birds of paradise species: the Western parotia <i>Parotia sefilata</i>, Carola's parotia <i>Parotia carolae</i>, and the magnificent bird of paradise <i>Cicinnurus magnificus</i>. While homosexual mountings by females have been documented previously in Lawes' parotia <i>P. lawesii</i>, adult males in the magnificent bird of paradise violently attacked intruding female-plumaged birds attempting to mount receivers, suggesting that they may be immature males engaging in alternative mating tactics. Overall, the rare video footage described here is suggestive of two fascinating, yet unexplored phenomena in polygynous birds: alternative mating tactics and female homosexual behaviour.</p>","author":"Thomas MacGillavry, \nClaudia Janiczek, \nLeonida Fusani","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ethology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7a94182f50d5fe321f60efa1a57eebe5c3e6a74d1fa25ba04a906a999025c0b6","entryHash":"adfa06383792430fe2d661fae8ecf1cde2e8e4e7946fe3b68704e6ed55cd5dc7","category":"Environment"}
