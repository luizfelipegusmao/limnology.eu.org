{"title":"The Potential of DC Immunotherapy in Improving Proteinuria in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0862/v1","date":1720608173000,"content":"Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) is a common complication of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and a major risk factor for end-stage kidney disease. The immune system plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of DKD, involving infiltration of immune cells in the kidney, upregulation of in-flammatory mediators, downregulation of anti-inflammatory mediators, and disturbance in ad-hesion molecules and growth factors. Dendritic cells are professional antigen-presenting cells acting as a bridge connecting innate and adaptive immune responses. DC is also capable of modulating inflammation. Autologous dendritic cells can be made by in vitro differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes and then utilized as a cell-based therapy. Cell-based therapy for DKD is currently focused on utilizing the anti-inflammatory properties of stem cells. However, research suggests unsatisfactory results due to several limitations. This article highlights the possibility of using DC as a cell-based therapy for DKD through its role in controlling inflammation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb56e1cfc2d6c28e210d2815bf9c5e9366ab8689a0d425456978f11449593008","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
