{"title":"Calibrating acceleration transmitters to quantify the seasonal energetic costs of activity in lake trout","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15916?af=R","date":1725429536000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Bioenergetics models are powerful tools used to address a range of questions in fish biology. However, these models are rarely informed by free-swimming activity data, introducing error. To quantify the costs of activity in free-swimming fish, calibrations produced from standardized laboratory trials can be applied to estimate energy expenditure from sensor data for specific tags and species. Using swim tunnel respirometry, we calibrated acceleration sensor-equipped transmitting tags to estimate the aerobic metabolic rates (<i>Ṁ</i>O<sub>2</sub>) of lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>) at three environmentally relevant temperatures. Aerobic and swim performance were also assessed. Like other calibrations, we found strong relationships between <i>Ṁ</i>O<sub>2</sub> and acceleration or swimming speed, and jackknife validations and data simulations suggest that our models accurately predict metabolic costs of activity in adult lake trout (~5% algebraic error and ~20% absolute error). Aerobic and swim performance metrics were similar to those reported in other studies, but their critical swimming speed was lower than expected. Additionally, lake trout exhibited a wide aerobic scope, suggesting that the avoidance of waters ≥15°C may be related to selection for optimal growing temperatures. The ability to quantify the free-swimming energetic costs of activity will advance our understanding of lake trout ecology and may yield improvements to bioenergetics model.</p>","author":"Connor Reeve, \nKurtis A.
