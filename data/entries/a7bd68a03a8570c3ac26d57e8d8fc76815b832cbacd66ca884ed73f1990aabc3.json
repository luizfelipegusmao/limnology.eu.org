{"title":"Comparison of Using GeoGebra and Python to Discover the Motion of Device in a Well-Known Physical Experimental Instrument&mdash;Looking into Vibration-Damping Devices in the Scanning Tunneling Microscope","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0172/v1","date":1722592629000,"content":"In this study, we focus on the vibration-damping devices within the renowned physical experimental apparatusâ€”STM. Utilizing GeoGebra software and Python, we meticulously elucidate the principle by which the vibrations of the damper are damped in a magnetic field, thereby achieving the vibration-damping functionality of the entire system. This approach not only fosters a clear physical conceptualization but also ensures the acquisition of accurate and comprehensive knowledge. Furthermore, the inquiry demonstrates the process of problem clarification facilitated by the use of software tools and then we compare the power of the widlely programming language--Python and the GeoGebra.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7bd68a03a8570c3ac26d57e8d8fc76815b832cbacd66ca884ed73f1990aabc3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
