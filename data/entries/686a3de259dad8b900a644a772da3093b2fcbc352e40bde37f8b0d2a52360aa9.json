{"title":"Enhancing Antioxidant Capacity and Oxidative Stability of Cooked Sausages Through Portulaca oleracea (Purslane) Supplementation: A Natural Alternative to Synthetic Additives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0373/v1","date":1728265313000,"content":"In this study, Portulaca oleracea (purslane) was investigated as a potential antioxidant supplement in cooked sausages, with a focus on its effects on lipid oxidation, fatty acid composition, and antioxidant activity. The fatty acid profile of the sausages enriched with 1.2% of purslane powder, revealed a 1.3-fold increase in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential omega-3 fatty acid. Improved oxidative stability during refrigerated storage was observed, with peroxide values of 10.9 meq/kg in the sausages with purslane by day 10, compared to 12.5 meq/kg in the control sausages. Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values, reflecting lipid peroxidation, were also significantly lower in the sausages with purslane. The antioxidant capacity was significantly enhanced in the sausages containing purslane, which demonstrated a Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) of 13.5 mg GAE/g, whereas the control sausages showed undetectable FRAP levels. Additionally, the DPPH radical scavenging activity in the sausages with purslane was 21.70%, compared to 13.73% in the control. These findings suggest that purslane not only improves the nutritional profile of meat products by increasing beneficial fatty acids but also provides substantial protection against oxidative spoilage. Portulaca oleracea offers a promising natural alternative to synthetic antioxidants, enhancing both the shelf life and quality of processed meats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"686a3de259dad8b900a644a772da3093b2fcbc352e40bde37f8b0d2a52360aa9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
