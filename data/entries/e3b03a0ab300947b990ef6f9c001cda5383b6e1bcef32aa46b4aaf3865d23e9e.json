{"title":"Early-Stage IM Treatment with the Host-Derived Immunostimu-Lant CPDI-02 Increases Curative Protection of Healthy Outbred Mice Against Subcutaneous Infection with CA-MRSA USA300","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0290/v1","date":1728022323000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) greatly complicates treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI). It was previ-ously found that subcutaneous (SQ) treatment with the mononuclear phagocyte (MP)-selective activator, complement peptide-derived immunostimulant-02 (CPDI-02; formerly EP67), increases prophylaxis of outbred CD-1 mice against SQ infection with CA-MRSA. Here, we determined if treatment with CPDI-02 also increases curative protection. Methods: Female CD-1 mice were challenged SQ with CA-MRSA USA300 LAC then CPDI-02 or inactive scCPDI-02 was administered by a topical, SQ, IM, or IV route at 6- or 24-hrs post-challenge. Dermal abscess sizes were compared over 10 days and CA-MRSA burden, neutrophils, MP, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were compared in dermal abscesses. CPDI-02 PK and distribution in female CD-1 mice were compared after IM or IV dosing and CPDI-02 toxicity was determined by IM dose escalation and repeat IM dosing in male and female CD-1 mice. Results: Repeat IM treatment with CPDI-02 starting at 6-hrs post-challenge decreased maximum abscess surface area, CA-MRSA burden, and time to resolu-tion, whereas repeat treatment by the topical, SQ, or IV route had no effect. Starting CPDI-02 treatment at 24-hrs post-challenge was ineffective regardless of route. Single IM treatment with CPDI-02 starting at 6-hrs post-challenge was as effective as repeat IM treatment, increased systemic exposure, and decreased initial levels of IL-1Î² and increased MP in dermal abscesses. CPDI-02 was tolerated to between 130-170 mg/kg for single IM dosing and 65-130 mg/kg for repeat IM dosing with males being more tolerant. Conclusions: Single early-stage IM treatment with CPDI-02 may increase curative protection against SSTI caused by CA-MRSA or other pathogens controlled by activated MP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3b03a0ab300947b990ef6f9c001cda5383b6e1bcef32aa46b4aaf3865d23e9e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
