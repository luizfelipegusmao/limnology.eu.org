By intentionally introducing or controlling defects, one can tailor electrical, mechanical, thermal, and optical properties to meet specific performance requirements [<a href=\"#ozae044.575-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.575-B2\">2</a>]. Hence, it is crucial to understand the nature and type of defects present in crystals. Another important aspect is to study the defects during heterostructure engineering [<a href=\"#ozae044.575-B3\">3</a>] and its propagation from template nanostructure to heterostructure. Direct visualization of defects is challenging due to their dynamic nature and potential overlap with other features. In this regard, recent advances in microscopy and imaging techniques continue to improve our ability to study nanomaterials at atomic levels [<a href=\"#ozae044.575-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f58f5e33dfec1234f8fe7d69c800d11f3993b95a18f0c416eeca46d5b8105c8c","category":"Environment"}
