The main objective of the present study was to develop and validate two Human Activity Recognition models. One trained on data from typically developing children (n = 63), the second also including data from children with Cerebral Palsy (n = 16), engaging in standardised activities and free play. Our data was collected using accelerometers and ground truth was established with video annotations. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the influence of window settings on model performance. Utilizing the Extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) classifier, twelve sub-models were created, with 1-,3- and 5-seconds windows, with and without overlap. Both Human Activity Recognition models demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities (&gt;92%) for standardised activities for both typically developing and Cerebral Palsy. From all window sizes, the 1-second window performed best for all test groups. Accuracy was slightly lower (&gt;75%) for the Cerebral Palsy test group performing free play activities. The impact of window size and overlap varied depending on activity. In summary both Human Activity Recognition models effectively predict standardised activities, surpassing prior models for typically developing and children with Cerebral Palsy. Notably, the model trained on combined typically developing children and Cerebral Palsy data performed exemplary across all test groups. Researchers should select window settings aligned with their specific research objectives.","author":"Marte Fossflaten Tørring","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"834cfe4a74faf8ae5932509ab2db9f23b188a6005d540208a04bf7d3fe432bcb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
