{"title":"Akkermansia muciniphila for the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity: A Meta-Analysis of Animal Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1618/v1","date":1724307955000,"content":"More than half of the states in the U.S. report that over 30% of adults are obese. Obesity increases the risk of many chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and can even reduce oneâ€™s lifespan. Similarly, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes follows a comparable trend. As a result, researchers are striving to find solutions to reduce obesity rates, with a particular focus on gut health, which has been previously linked to both obesity and type 2 diabetes. Recent studies suggest that Akkermansia muciniphila(AKK) may have a positive probiotic effect on preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes and obesity. We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of 15 qualified animal studies investigating the effects of AKK administration as a probiotic. The statistical analyses showed that AKK administration significantly reduced body weight gain by 10.4% and fasting blood glucose by 21.2%, while also significantly improving glucose tolerance by 22.1% and increasing blood insulin levels by 26.9%. However, our analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity between the control and experimental groups across all subgroups. Overall, AKK appears to be effective at reducing the onset of type 2 diabetes and diet-induced obesity. Long-term studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these beneficial effects, as the current animal studies were of short duration (less than 20 weeks).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d45a5cedc8efad09859f7c7b1cb445b364700b26c8a385709dcc200b3f111abb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
