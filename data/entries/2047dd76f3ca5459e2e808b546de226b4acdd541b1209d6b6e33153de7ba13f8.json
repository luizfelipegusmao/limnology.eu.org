{"title":"State-of-Health Estimation Based on a Partial Discharge Method for Electric Vehicle Battery Management System into MIL Environment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1392/v1","date":1729161746000,"content":"Accurate estimation of the state of health (SOH) of batteries for automotive applications, particularly in electric vehicle battery management systems (EV-BMS), is still under study and is highly relevant to ensure battery system availability. This paper proposes a comprehensive SOH estimation method that goes beyond the methods that are based on the estimation of the battery available capacity by the integral of the current, or the estimation of the increase of the internal resistance of the battery. The SOH estimator is based on a partial capacity discharge method and a linear state of charge (SOC) observer based on an equivalent electrical circuit model. This method uses readily available manufacturer data and is designed for real-time applications. The proposed method was tested and validated with three different automotive battery technologies in a Model-In-Loop (MIL) environment with OPAL-RT platform, utilizing voltage and current measurements of pulsed discharge current profiles at temperature-controlled conditions and an electric vehicleâ€™s driving profile.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2047dd76f3ca5459e2e808b546de226b4acdd541b1209d6b6e33153de7ba13f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
