The irradiation evaluation of the prepared graphite was carried out by 7 MeV Xe26+ ion irradiation and the microstructural changes of the graphite were investigated with IG-110 as a comparison. The graphitization degree of NSPG was higher than that of IG-110, though it was not subjected to an impregnation process. Under low-dose ion irradiation (","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5edcfee4fed5ad2cb04f3bcea9799bacc4058ca08a2933181ec7b7e0b3958922","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
