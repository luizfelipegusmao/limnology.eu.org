{"title":"Take it to the Limit and Then Some: The Importance of Seeking Out New Challenges for Personal and Professional Growth","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ae/article/70/2/64/7688530?rss=1","date":1717718400000,"content":"<span>The idea for this article came to me as I was driving home from another disappointing performance in my new hobby: showing dogs. A simple desire for a heat-tolerant running companion led my husband and me to fall down the rabbit hole of purebred dogs, showing for conformation, and performance dog sports. Showing dogs is surprisingly technical. In addition to training and socializing your dog for competition, you, the handler, must learn the skills to present your dog correctly. This does not come naturally to me. I still have to think very hard about each step needed: how to hold the lead, which paws to reposition and in what order, where and how I need to move in the ring, all while being watched by a crowd of experienced “dog fanciers.” It is humbling, to say the least. I often leave shows completely flustered and frustrated, but when my dog and I do well (or even just all right), it’s exciting! When handled well, our dog is often ranked very highly by the judge, so when I fail to perform, it is on me to learn from my mistakes and try to do better next time. I am thankful to have met a wonderful, supportive group of mentors and friends that have guided us in this strange new world. My skills as a handler have improved over the past year, but I am still very much a novice.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"American Entomologist Current Issue","siteHash":"718e0ce511af4548d0dc98d99e3fcb2a0cedb968506172cfd4871c3567f613f2","entryHash":"3aac79225b135dbb76ba8d8f8b2ec9f9ec1b2e603bd76f0a3e62e916c8cceee3","category":"Environment"}
