{"title":"Protein C Pretreatment Protects Endothelial Cells from SARS-CoV-2-Induced Activation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2133/v1","date":1717150626000,"content":"SARS-CoV-2 can induce vascular dysfunction and thrombotic events in patients with severe COVID-19; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind these effects remain largely unknown. In this study, we used a combination of experimental and in silico approaches to explore the mechanisms behind the vascular and thrombotic events in COVID-19. Single-cell RNA-sequencing data from patients with COVID-19 and healthy subjects were obtained from the publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository. In addition, HUVECs were treated with inactivated protein C before exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection or a severe COVID-19 serum. An RT-qPCR array containing 84 related genes was used, and the candidate genes obtained were evaluated. Activated protein C levels were measured using an ELISA kit. We identified at the single-cell level the expression of several pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulation genes in endothelial cells from the patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, we demonstrated that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 promoted transcriptional changes in HUVECs that were partly reversed by the activated protein C pretreatment.  We also observed that the serum of severe COVID-19 had a significant amount of activated protein C that could protect endothelial cells from serum-induced activation. In conclusion, activated protein C protects endothelial cells from pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant effects during exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9c35ec646a9e218924824c179e875aa00a7b4442e33307bb2fbaf42586ac7ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
