{"title":"The Ingestion of High Sucrose during a Critical Period of Development in Rats Leads to Inflammation and to Promotion of the Secretory Phenotype in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0346/v1","date":1725434900000,"content":"Neonatal rats that receive sucrose during a critical postnatal period (CP, days 12 to 28) develop hypertension by the time they reach adulthood. Changes during this period could contribute to inflammation and be associated with variations in the vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) phenotype. We studied changes in inflammatory pathways that could underlie the expressions of the secretory phenotype in the VSMC in the thoracic aorta of rats that received sucrose during CP. We analyzed histological changes in the aorta and expressions of the COX-2, TLR4, iNOS, eNOS, MMP-2, -9, β-, α-actin, and TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β expressions, and fatty acids by gas chromatography. The aortic wall presented disorganization, decellularization, wavy elastic fibers and increase in the lumen area. The COX-2, TLR4 expressions, TNF-α and IL-6 were increased, but iNOS, MMP-2 and -9 tended to increase and eNOS and arachidonic acid tended to decrease, con increase in oleic acid in CP in comparison with control group. There is a transient hypertension at the end of the CP that is accompanied by an inflammation and a change in the phenotype of VSMC to the secretory phenotype. The inflammatory changes could act as epigenetic signals to determine the hypertension development during adulthood.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ddf664bde99bc2f2235d978478f4587c7f668c391c665c9abb3cc15aa8e3cb5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
