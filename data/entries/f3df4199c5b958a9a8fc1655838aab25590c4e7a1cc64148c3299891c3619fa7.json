An augmented mean group estimator was used to compute the long-run coefficients. The findings indicate that positive shocks in international collaboration in green technology development mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. In contrast, adverse shocks in international collaboration in green technology development have an escalating effect on carbon dioxide emissions. The outcomes also imply that renewable energy consumption, domestic green innovation, digital economy, and contractionary fiscal policy were negatively associated with carbon dioxide emissions, whereas gross domestic product and expansionary fiscal policy were positively associated with carbon dioxide emissions. It is suggested that governments should have a balanced fiscal policy, lining up their goals for economic expansion and ecological responsibility and using the potential of the digital economy and domestic green innovation to drive green outcomes.</p>","author":"Zhao Jing","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"f3df4199c5b958a9a8fc1655838aab25590c4e7a1cc64148c3299891c3619fa7","category":"Environment"}
