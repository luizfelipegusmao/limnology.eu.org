These factors lead to multi-scale variations in aircraft targets, making high-precision real-time detection of small targets in complex backgrounds a significant challenge for the detection algorithms. Hence, this paper introduces a real-time aircraft target detection algorithm for remote sensing imaging using an improved lightweight attention mechanism that relies on the YOLOv7 framework (SE-CBAM-YOLOv7). The proposed algorithm replaces the standard convolution (Conv) with a lightweight convolutional SEConv to reduce the computational parameters and accelerate the detection process of small aircraft targets, thus enhancing real-time onboard processing capabilities. Besides, the SEConv-based SPPCSPC (Spatial Pyramid Pooling and Connected Spatial Pyramid Convolution) module extracts image features. It improves detection accuracy while the feature fusion section integrates the CBAM hybrid attention network, forming the CBAMCAT module. Furthermore, it optimizes small aircraft target features in channel and spatial dimensions, improving the model's feature fusion capabilities. Experiments on public remote sensing datasets reveal the proposed SE-CBAM-YOLOv7 improves detection accuracy by 3% and mAP value by 4.2% compared to YOLOv7, significantly enhancing the detection capability for small-sized aircraft targets in satellite remote sensing imaging.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3836b68c10fb346a8307b3a8fc410d2e68639d74eb494378562fdab763ecab0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
