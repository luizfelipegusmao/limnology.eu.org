Although neonicotinoids are believed to be toxic only to insects, their developmental neurotoxicity in mammals is a concern. Therefore, we examined the effects of developmental exposure to neonicotinoids on immune system in the brain and post-developmental behaviors in this study. Imidacloprid or clothianidin was orally administered to dams at a dosage of 0.1â€‰mg/kg/day from embryonic day 11 to postnatal day 21. Imidacloprid decreased sociability, and both imidacloprid and clothianidin decreased locomotor activity and induced anxiety, depression and abnormal repetitive behaviors after the developmental period. There was no change in the number of neurons in the hippocampus of mice exposed to imidacloprid. However, the number and activity of microglia during development were significantly decreased by imidacloprid exposure. Imidacloprid also induced neural circuit dysfunction in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus during the early postnatal period. Exposure to imidacloprid suppressed the expression of csf1r during development. Collectively, these results suggest that developmental exposure to imidacloprid decreases the number and activity of microglia, which can cause neural circuit dysfunction and abnormal behaviors after the developmental period. Care must be taken to avoid exposure to neonicotinoids, especially during development.</p>","author":"Kaede Namba, \nTakashi Tominaga, \nYasuhiro Ishihara","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"3194dab5cd937442fd19a080e250716a71f760a97a0c217e600c51dec08b8f7e","category":"Environment"}
