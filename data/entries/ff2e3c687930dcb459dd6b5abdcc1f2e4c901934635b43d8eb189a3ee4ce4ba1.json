{"title":"Marketing Mix of Rattan Business in Nepal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0623/v1","date":1718088270000,"content":"This paper examines the marketing mix of rattan canes businesses, with a focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Rattan cane enterprises rely on both domestic and international sources for raw materials, and the market is largely unorganized, with individual-level operations dominating the industry. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the marketing mix in relation to the 7Ps framework, which includes price, product, place, promotion, people, process, and physical evidence. A simple random sampling method was employed to select participants from rattan processing enterprises. A questionnaire survey was then conducted among 46 rattan entrepreneurs, representing a total of 66 enterprises, including rattan processing industries, rattan traders, and Community Forest User Groups. The findings of the study indicate that, among the seven Ps, place and process are relatively stronger aspects of service delivery, while price and people are considered moderate. However, product, promotion, and physical evidence are identified as weak areas in terms of service delivery within the rattan business. It is concluded that rattan processing industries continue to rely on traditional tools and technologies, which has resulted in a lack of competitiveness in penetrating both national and international markets. Furthermore, poorly segmented distribution channels have hindered their sales efforts, while limited promotional activities have restricted awareness of their products among potential customers. In conclusion, the study highlights the need for rattan businesses to modernize their operations and adopt more effective marketing strategies in order to enhance their competitiveness and expand their market reach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff2e3c687930dcb459dd6b5abdcc1f2e4c901934635b43d8eb189a3ee4ce4ba1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
