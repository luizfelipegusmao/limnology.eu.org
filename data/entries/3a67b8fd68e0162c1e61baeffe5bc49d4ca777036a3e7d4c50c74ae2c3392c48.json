{"title":"The field assessment of quiescent egg populations of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus during the dry season in Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico, has the potential to significantly impact vector control strategies by providing insights into potential in-situ vector reinfestations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2076/v1","date":1724913664000,"content":"The lack of a Dengue vaccine and pharmacological antiviral drugs has made Vector Control Programs the primary resource in the fight against arboviral diseases. Although Integrated Management and Control programs implement intense control measures for adult, pupal, larval, and breeding sites during outbreaks, there is a lack of studies to understand the role of the vector egg stage in disease dynamics. This study aimed to assess the dry season quiescent Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus egg populations in houses and backyards in the tropical city of Tapachula, southern Mexico. Two hundred fifty ovitraps were placed in 125 homes in the Las Americas neighborhood. A total of 7,290 eggs were collected from 211 (84.4%) ovitraps, with 4,031 (71.1%) identified as Aeâ€”aegypti, and 1,636 (28.8%) as albopictus, respectively. Eighty-three larval sites were sampled with desiccated eggs during the dry season; most of them were described as trash-like because larvicides are only used for larger containers of 5-10 L. Evolutionary characteristics for the two species include rapid and delayed hatching of eggs, ambient-regulated quiescence, the ability of the embryo to survive for a more extended period intra-seasonally, and the sticking of egg walls to container walls. This demands urgent operational research to achieve successful egg-proof larval container methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a67b8fd68e0162c1e61baeffe5bc49d4ca777036a3e7d4c50c74ae2c3392c48","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
