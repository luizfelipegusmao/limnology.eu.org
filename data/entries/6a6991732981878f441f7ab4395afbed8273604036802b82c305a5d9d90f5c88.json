{"title":"Piezoelectric Micromachined Microphone with High Acoustic Overload Point and with Electrically Controlled Sensitivity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0164/v1","date":1717501683000,"content":"Nowadays, the most advanced micromachined microphones on the market are based on a capacitive coupling principle. Capacitive micro-electro-mechanical systems-based (MEMS) microphones resemble their millimetric counterparts, both in function and in performances. The most advanced MEMS microphones reached a competitive level compared to commonly used measuring microphones in most of the key performance parameters except the acoustic overload point (AOP). In an effort to find a solution for measurement of high-level acoustic fields, microphones with piezoelectric coupling principle have been proposed. Such novel microphones exploit the piezoelectric effect of a thin layer of aluminum nitride, which is incorporated in their diaphragm structure. In these microphones fabricated with micromachining technology, no fixed electrode is necessary, in contrast to capacitive microphones. This specificity significantly simplifies both the design and the fabrication and opens the door for a new improvement of the acoustic overload point as well as harsh environmental applications. Several variations of piezoelectric structures together with an idea leading to electrically controlled sensitivity of MEMS piezoelectric microphone are discussed in the paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a6991732981878f441f7ab4395afbed8273604036802b82c305a5d9d90f5c88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
