{"title":"Perception of Mangrove Social-Ecological System Governance in Southeastern Cuba","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0444/v1","date":1720092285000,"content":"This study examined local communities' perceptions of mangroves in coastal southeastern Cuba. A variety of methods were employed, including mixed and structured questionnaire surveys, interviews with key informants, and document reviews. Data were gathered from 334 respondents living in communities adjacent to four mangrove social-ecological systems (SESs). The analysis focused on five variables: community use of mangrove resources, ecosystem services, threats to the ecosystem, management activities, and social-ecological relationships. To qualitatively assess the influence of social-ecological relationships and governance, a matrix was created based on anthropogenic activities identified by respondents and their perceptions of ecosystem services. The results indicated that while local people recognize the uses and ecosystem services of mangroves, they do not rely on them for their livelihoods. They also showed moderate to full awareness of management responsibilities and activities at each site. The most commonly identified threats were climate change, drought, and deforestation. Three types of social-ecological relationships were identified based on the characteristics of the communities, their economic activities, and their impacts on the mangroves: urban-industrial, rural-agricultural, and rural-agricultural/tourism. Finally, the research proposed a set of five recommendations and eight associated indicators to ensure that mangrove management framework become more inclusive and participatory, thereby contributing to the articulation of mangrove SES governance in the southeastern region of Cuba.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"178ef6fbe860d4155cd251f953d0090035ad63fc0bd4fe692ab38bcd63ab37f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
