{"title":"Sustainable Tropical Architecture and Building Energy Regulations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1699/v1","date":1724488203000,"content":"Tropical regions face significant energy challenges due to climatic conditions. This study investigates the interplay between sustainable architecture and building energy regulations in mitigating these challenges. The study aims to assess the effectiveness of existing building energy regulations in promoting sustainable architecture in tropical climates and identify key architectural strategies and regulatory frameworks for optimizing energy efficiency in tropical buildings. A comparative analysis of building regulations and case studies of sustainable buildings in selected tropical regions is conducted. The findings reveal that current regulations often must be revised to address tropical climates' unique energy demands. Incorporating passive design principles, renewable energy systems, and material selection is crucial for energy efficiency. It is recommended that building energy regulations be strengthened to mandate sustainable design strategies and provide incentives to promote the adoption of energy-efficient technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f47c021a36a85a85a718b6bf458ce698a345c73a7c34d375f81ddfd943dfd91","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
