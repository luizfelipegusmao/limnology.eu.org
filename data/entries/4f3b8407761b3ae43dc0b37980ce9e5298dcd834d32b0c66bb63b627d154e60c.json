{"title":"137 Impact of dietary soybean-mediated trypsin inhibitor concentrations on nursery pig performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/109/7664957?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Antinutritional factors associated with soybeans and soy products, such as trypsin inhibitor proteins, have been shown to hinder amino acid bioavailability and, consequently, affect the growth performance of pigs. Thus, our objective was to assess the impact of dietary trypsin inhibitor units (TIU; expressed as TIU/mg of feed) on nursery pig performance and health. Sixty barrows [5.56 Â± 0.65 kg body weight (BW), Camborough (1050) x 337, (PIC, Hendersonville, TN)], freshly weaned and 19 to 21 d of age were randomly selected and allotted across six dietary treatments (10 pigs/treatment) in a randomized complete block design. All pigs were individually penned with ad libitum access to water and feed. Diets were administered in two phases directly post-weaning, spanning 14 and 28 d, respectively, and the entire test period extended for 42 d. Within each phase, diets were formulated to be isocaloric, with uniform NDF and SID lysine concentrations. In both phases, TIU were incrementally adjusted by the inclusion of soybean meal, raw ground soybeans, soybean oil, and soyhulls to attain a target TIU/mg feed of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. All diets were analyzed for active TIU/mg. Pig BW and feed disappearance were measured at the start and end of each phase to compute average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain to feed ratio (G:F). Fecal consistency was assessed daily in phase 1. Pig was the experimental unit and data were analyzed with the effect of diet, including the linear and quadratic contrasts, evaluating dietary TIU levels. The average analyzed TIU/mg over both diet phases were 0.38, 0.54, 1.85, 3.16, 3.90, and 5.79 TIU/mg diet, respectively. Fecal consistency scores did not differ across diets. At the end of phase 1, BW decreased from 8.7 to 6.9 kg as TIU/mg diet increased from 0.38 to 5.79 (linear <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Similarly, by d 42, BW decreased from 25.3 to 15.5 kg with the increase in dietary TIU/mg from 0.38 to 5.79 (linear <span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001). Both phase 1 and 2 showed a decrease in average daily gain (ADG) and G:F as TIU increased (linear <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). ADFI exhibited a decreasing trend in phase 1 (linear <span>P</span> = 0.079) and a decrease in phase 2 (linear <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) as dietary TIU increased. No quadratic responses were reported for ADG and G:F. Overall, as TIU increased, ADG, ADFI, and G:F were reduced, with 5.79 TIU/mg feed resulting in a decrease of these parameters by 8 to 22% (linear <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, increasing TIU levels in the diet had detrimental effects on nursery pig performance. The most significant negative impacts on growth, feed intake, and feed efficiency were observed in diets containing 3.16 to 5.79 TIU/mg feed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"4f3b8407761b3ae43dc0b37980ce9e5298dcd834d32b0c66bb63b627d154e60c","category":"Environment"}
