While conventional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) achieves atomic resolution, it falls short in simultaneously depicting strain and stacking in van der Waals materials. To address this, we utilized dual 4D-STEM modalities: nanobeam diffraction and multislice ptychography, to map out micron-scale domain structures and atomic layer configurations with varying stacking sequences of the 2D vdW SnSe.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8931d804d9f27d9c7177045dd0c6086313b13c222ae6e73a18186fe8f0c579ef","category":"Environment"}
