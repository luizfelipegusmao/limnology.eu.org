{"title":"Validity and reproducibility of a food frequency questionnaire to determine dietary intakes among Lebanese athletes","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311617","date":1729692000000,"content":"<p>by Nagham Sannan, Tatiana Papazian, Zeina Issa, Nour El Helou</p>\r\nBackground and objective <p>Nutrition is a basic need for athletes; thus, adequate dietary intake is crucial for maintaining overall health, facilitating training adaptations and boosting athletic performance. Accurate dietary assessment tools are required to minimize the challenges faced by athletes. This study verifies the validity and reproducibility of a 157 item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) among Lebanese athletes. This is the only Arabic questionnaire in Lebanon that estimates food consumption for athletes which can also be used in Arabic speaking countries. There has been no previous validated food frequency questionnaire that estimated food consumption for athletes in Lebanon.</p> Methods <p>A total of 194 athletes were included in the study to assess the validity of the food frequency questionnaire against four days dietary recalls by comparing the total nutrient intake values from the food frequency questionnaire with the mean values of four 24-hour dietary recalls using Spearman correlation coefficient and Bland Altman plots. In order to measure the reproducibility, the intra class correlation coefficients were calculated by repeating the same food frequency questionnaire after one month.</p> Results <p>The intra-class correlation coefficient between the two-food frequency questionnaires ranged from average (0.739 for carbohydrates) to good (0.870 for energy (Kcal)), to excellent (0.919 for proteins) concerning macronutrients and ranged from average (0.688 for vitamin D), to excellent (0.952 for vitamin B12), indicating an acceptable reproducibility. Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficients of dietary intake estimate from the food frequency questionnaire and the four dietary recalls varied between 0.304 for sodium, 0.469 for magnesium to 0.953 for caloric intake (kcal). Bland-Altman plots illustrated a percentage of agreement ranging between 94.3% for fats to 96.4% for proteins.</p> Conclusion <p>This food frequency questionnaire has a reliable validity and reproducibility to evaluate dietary assessments and is an appropriate tool for future interventions to ensure the adoption of adequate eating strategies by athletes.</p>","author":"Nagham Sannan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bc8dba4e4f74793989fa2987bc9b683f88e6363318719e48da104775a19f2788","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
