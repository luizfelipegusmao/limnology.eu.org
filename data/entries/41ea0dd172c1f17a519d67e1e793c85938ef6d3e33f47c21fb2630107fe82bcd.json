{"title":"A long noncoding RNA functions in pumpkin fruit development through S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/940/7615931?rss=1","date":1709078400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in various biological processes. However, the regulatory roles of lncRNAs underlying fruit development have not been extensively studied. The pumpkin (<span>Cucurbita</span> spp.) is a preferred model for understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating fruit development because of its variable shape and size and large inferior ovary. Here, we performed strand-specific transcriptome sequencing on pumpkin (<span>Cucurbita maxima</span> “Rimu”) fruits at 6 developmental stages and identified 5,425 reliably expressed lncRNAs. Among the 332 lncRNAs that were differentially expressed during fruit development, the lncRNA MSTRG.44863.1 was identified as a negative regulator of pumpkin fruit development. MSTRG.44863.1 showed a relatively high expression level and an obvious period-specific expression pattern. Transient overexpression and silencing of MSTRG.44863.1 significantly increased and decreased the content of 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid (a precursor of ethylene) and ethylene production, respectively. RNA pull-down and microscale thermophoresis assays further revealed that MSTRG.44863.1 can interact with <span>S</span>-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase (SAMS), an enzyme in the ethylene synthesis pathway. Considering that ethylene negatively regulates fruit development, these results indicate that MSTRG.44863.1 plays an important role in the regulation of pumpkin fruit development, possibly through interacting with SAMS and affecting ethylene synthesis. Overall, our findings provide a rich resource for further study of fruit-related lncRNAs while offering insights into the regulation of fruit development in plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"41ea0dd172c1f17a519d67e1e793c85938ef6d3e33f47c21fb2630107fe82bcd","category":"Environment"}
