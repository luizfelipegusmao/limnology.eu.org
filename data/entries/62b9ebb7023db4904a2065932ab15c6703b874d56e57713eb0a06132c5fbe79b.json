{"title":"Rethinking Cancer Initiation, Promotion, and Progression: Senescence, Endopolyploidy and Meiosis as Players in a Stress-Induced Regenerative Cell Cycle","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0650/v2","date":1724066420000,"content":"Many definitions of cancer have been proposed over the years to explain cancer’s origins and pathophysiology, but the disease is too variable to allow any single description to completely encompass all of the myriad traits. A true, unifying theory of cancer must not only reveal how all known carcinogens contribute toward malignancy, but must also elucidate why cancers occur predominately in older patients, why they express so many similar behaviors, as well as account for each cancer’s individual variations. A conceptual reorganization of decades of cancer data may reveal the fundamental process that underlies the malignant transformation of cells, which not only provides a new understanding of the etiology of cancers, but also helps to interpret the subsequent events that occur after transformation, which is of significant clinical interest. The revised concepts of initiation, promotion, and progression suggest that cancer is a failed or incomplete attempt at regeneration that occurs when ordinary cellular events unintentionally coincide over time to force the use of a DNA repair pathway that is normally restricted for use in germ cells.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62b9ebb7023db4904a2065932ab15c6703b874d56e57713eb0a06132c5fbe79b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
