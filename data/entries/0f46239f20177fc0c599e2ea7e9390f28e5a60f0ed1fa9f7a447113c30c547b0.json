However, we lack reliable and reproducible methods for efficient protoplast regeneration for tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>) cultivars. Here, we optimized cell and tissue culture methods for protoplast isolation, microcallus proliferation, shoot regeneration, and plantlet establishment of the tomato cultivar Micro-Tom. A thin layer of alginate was applied to protoplasts isolated from third to fourth true leaves and cultured at an optimal density of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> protoplasts/ml. We determined the optimal culture media for protoplast proliferation, callus formation, <span>de novo</span> shoot regeneration, and root regeneration. Regenerated plantlets exhibited morphologically normal growth and sexual reproduction. The entire regeneration process, from protoplasts to flowering plants, was accomplished within 5 months. The optimized protoplast regeneration platform enables biotechnological applications, such as genome engineering, as well as basic research on plant regeneration in <span>Solanaceae</span> species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"0f46239f20177fc0c599e2ea7e9390f28e5a60f0ed1fa9f7a447113c30c547b0","category":"Environment"}
