{"title":"Alignment of Consumers&rsquo; Expected Brain Benefits from Food and Supplements with Measurable Cognitive Performance Tests","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0002/v1","date":1714550031000,"content":"Consumers often cite cognitive improvements as reasons for making dietary changes or using dietary supplements, a motivation that if leveraged could greatly enhance public health.  However, rarely is it considered whether standardized cognitive tests that are used in nutrition research are aligned to outcomes of interest to the consumer. This knowledge gap presents a challenge to the scientific substantiation of nutrition-based cognitive health benefits. Here we combined qualitative consumer research and expert group methodology to (1) understand how consumers comprehend the potential benefits of nutrition for brain health, and (2) determine the alignment between consumers' articulated brain benefits and validated tests and tools.  We derived a ‘Consumer Taxonomy of Cognitive and Affective Health in Nutrition Research’ which describes the cognitive and affective structure from the consumers' perspective.  Experts agreed that validated tests exist for some consumer benefits including focused attention, sustained attention, episodic memory, energy levels, and anxiety. Prospective memory, flow, and presence represented novel benefits that require the development and validation of new tests and tools.  Closing the gap between science and consumers, and fostering co-creative approaches to nutrition research, are critical to the development of products and dietary recommendations that support realizable cognitive benefits that benefit public health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"809331e1f7ef18448c9034c5420afea0f27c9c0a531e7422d174e4caa009d7d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
