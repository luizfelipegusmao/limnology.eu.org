{"title":"Pulsatile Flow in Elastic Pipes: An Experimental Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0719/v1","date":1720507444000,"content":"This article examines experiments with elastic material, specifically the deformation of an elastic tube under hydrostatic pressure with a constant flow of fluid inside. This flow induces a pulsatile movement within the elastic tube. Preliminary results are compared with a theoretical model that combines longitudinal and transverse waves. During the experiment, images at various stages of deformation were captured and analyzed. The objective is to better understand the behavior of elastic materials under these conditions and validate the proposed theoretical model through detailed experimental observations, providing a deeper insight into the dynamics of deformation in deformable materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5282b0034d11b12caa798823a51158ade5d61c015d97b621e78211a06fbbec98","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
