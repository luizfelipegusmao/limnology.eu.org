{"title":"Combined exposure to CO2 and H2S significantly reduces the performance of the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica: Evidence from a volcanic vent","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10368?af=R","date":1721135799000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Although seagrasses are expected to thrive in future acidified oceans by overcoming low CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion into plant tissues, the co-occurrence of environmental stressors may affect their growth. Volcanic CO<sub>2</sub> vents are often associated with toxic gases and metal-rich fluids representing ideal sites to assess the effects of multiple stressors. We evaluated the response of <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> growing near shallow CO<sub>2</sub> vents characterized by H<sub>2</sub>S spill-out by comparing meadow structure and phenology to an area with no gas emissions. Seagrass descriptors at meadow, shoot and leaf level indicated that <i>P. oceanica</i> experienced stressful conditions at the vent area, in clear contrast to the flourishing features of <i>P. oceanica</i> previously described at CO<sub>2</sub> vents with no evidence of toxic inputs. Furthermore, the reduction in both leaf Î´<sup>34</sup>S and growth at the vent area indicates that sulfide intrusion occurs and affects seagrass growth performance, dampening the expected beneficial effects of high CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p>","author":"Geraldina Signa, \nValentina Sciutteri, \nAgostino Tomasello, \nValentina Costa, \nSilvia Casabianca, \nGiovanna Cilluffo, \nCristina Andolina, \nSalvatrice Vizzini","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Letters: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e3d6bd1d0a248694da65f62e7591c05124a8fbc5456d1cafb66209dfd7ae6238","entryHash":"84337235e8b2417594293f3a298bb5d87c37c2a09ed0e9eb35941cbc087b8b09","category":"Environment"}
