We developed two race-agnostic computable phenotypes that assess kidney health among 139,152 subjects admitted to the University of Florida Health between 1/2012–8/2019 by removing the race modifier from the estimated GFR and estimated creatinine formula used by the race-adjusted algorithm (<i>race-agnostic algorithm 1)</i> and by utilizing 2021 CKD-EPI refit without race formula (<i>race-agnostic algorithm 2</i>) for calculations of the estimated GFR and estimated creatinine. We compared results using these algorithms to the race-adjusted algorithm in African American patients. Using clinical adjudication, we validated race-agnostic computable phenotypes developed for preadmission CKD and AKI presence on 300 cases. Race adjustment reclassified 2,113 (8%) to no CKD and 7,901 (29%) to a less severe CKD stage compared to race-agnostic algorithm 1 and reclassified 1,208 (5%) to no CKD and 4,606 (18%) to a less severe CKD stage compared to race-agnostic algorithm 2. Of 12,451 AKI encounters based on race-agnostic algorithm 1, race adjustment reclassified 591 to No AKI and 305 to a less severe AKI stage. Of 12,251 AKI encounters based on race-agnostic algorithm 2, race adjustment reclassified 382 to No AKI and 196 (1.6%) to a less severe AKI stage. The phenotyping algorithm based on refit without race formula performed well in identifying patients with CKD and AKI with a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 97%–100%) and 99% (95% CI 97%–100%) and a specificity of 88% (95% CI 82%–93%) and 98% (95% CI 93%–100%), respectively. Race-agnostic algorithms identified substantial proportions of additional patients with CKD and AKI compared to race-adjusted algorithm in African American patients. The phenotyping algorithm is promising in identifying patients with kidney disease and improving clinical decision-making.","author":"Tezcan Ozrazgat-Baslanti","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"16508386f42fb542c2d8620bea7dc0f2ace03b6c36d9a6dcebf281056deb97b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
