{"title":"Health, Performance Ratings and Approachability of 50&ndash;60 Year Old Sedentary Adults (ActIv-Study): Key Insights for Health Economy and Exercise Promotion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0745/v1","date":1715579726000,"content":"Despite significant prevention efforts, the numbers of physically inactive individuals, chronic illnesses, exhaustion syndromes and sick leaves are increasing. A still unresolved problem with exercise promotion is the low participation of sedentary persons. This collective term covers heterogeneous subgroups. Their engagement with movement campaigns and resistance to change are influenced by numerous factors. Our aim was to analyse survey data on health, performance, lifestyle habits and the approachability to physical activity campaigns obtained from the Germany-wide ActIv survey. From 2,888 study participants aged 50-60 years, 668 persons were categorised into the subgroups \"never-athletes\", \"sports-dropouts\", \"always-athletes\" and \"sports-beginners\". Large and significant group differences were found for BMI, assessment of quality of life, health and fitness, risk factors and health problems. 42.5% of \"never-athletes\" and 32.5% of \"sports-dropouts\" did not state any barriers to sport. There are substantial disparities between the non-athlete groups in terms of their motivation to exercise. In contrast, there are comparatively minor differences in motivation between \"sports-dropouts\" and \"sports-beginners\", whose health and fitness are the primary motivators for sport. Our analyses suggest that (i) negative health and performance trends cannot be compensated by appeals for voluntary participation in exercise programmes and (ii) powerful incentive systems are required.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d837ae230bcd82d9ead0c6f0badc5d78355bc0445feeb1ae2c32b1dc4a158d4b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
