{"title":"Search for True Ternary Fission in the Reaction 40Ar+208 Pb","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1396/v1","date":1726655850000,"content":"The true ternary fission, the fission of a nucleus into three fragments of nearly equal mass, is an elusive and poorly known process influenced by shell effects. It has been envisaged an increase of the probability of this process with respect to the binary fission, very low in spontaneous and neutron-induced fission, by adopting heavy-ion induced reactions due to the possibility to increase the fissility parameter and the excitation energy of the compound nuclei. Nuclei with mass number around A=250, accessible in heavy-ion induced reactions, are favorable and should be investigated. It is still debated if the process takes place in a single step, direct ternary fission, or in two steps, sequential ternary fission. The purpose of this work is to define experimental conditions and observables that allow the disentangling of the products from the direct and sequential ternary fission as well as from the usual most probable binary fission. This step is essential to gain insight on the ternary fission dynamics and on the binary to ternary fission competition. The method proposed here is to simulate the kinematics of the ternary and binary fission processes to compute the energy distributions and angular correlations of direct and sequential ternary fission products, as well as those of binary fission. The reaction taken as benchmark is 40Ar+208Pb at 230 MeV supposed to form the 248Fm* compound nucleus. The simulation results have been filtered by considering the response function of a multi-coincidence detection system virtually constructed using the Geant4 simulation toolkit. The simulations support the possibility to separate the products of different multimodal fission decays with the proposed setup that consequently represents an effective tool to get insight on ternary fission from the observables selected.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9d8b02cc90cdff0aee1b89b6f8706c66d809847ffa815b7dc718088ed521342","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
