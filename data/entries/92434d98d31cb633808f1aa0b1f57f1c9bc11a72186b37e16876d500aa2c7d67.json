{"title":"A Dual-Module System for Copyright-Free Image Recommendation and Infringement Detection in Educational Materials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2285/v1","date":1727674151000,"content":"Images are widely used in educational materials due to their ability to effectively convey complex concepts. However, unauthorized image use often leads to legal issues related to copyright infringement. To address this issue, we introduce a dual-module system designed specifically for educators. The first module, a copyright infringement detection system, leverages deep learning techniques to verify the copyright status of images. It employs a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) model to extract meaningful features from copyrighted images and compares them against user-provided images. If infringement is suspected, the second module, an image retrieval system, recommends alternative copyright-free images using a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based hashing model. Evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates the system's effectiveness, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.812 on the Flickr25k dataset. Furthermore, a user study with 65 teachers indicates high satisfaction levels, particularly in addressing copyright concerns and ease of use. Our system significantly aids educators in creating educational materials compliant with copyright regulations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92434d98d31cb633808f1aa0b1f57f1c9bc11a72186b37e16876d500aa2c7d67","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
