{"title":"Convenient Preparation, Thermal Properties and X-Ray Structure Determination of 2,3-Dihydro-5,6,7,8-tetranitro-1,4-benzodioxine (TNBD): a Promising High Energy Density Material (HEDM)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0833/v1","date":1712901839000,"content":"Abstract: : 2,3-dihydro-5,6,7,8-tetranitro-1,4-benzodioxine (TNBD), molecular formula =C8H4N4O10 is a completely nitrated in aromatic ring 1,4-benzodioxane derivative. The con-venient method of TNBD synthesis was developed (yield=81 %). The detailed structure of this compound has been investigated by X-ray crystallography. The results of differential thermal analysis (DTA) obtained with twice re-crystallized material showed onset at 247 and isoterm at 288 0C, with further total degradation at 300 0C. The experimental density 1,85 g/cm3 of TNBD was determined by X-ray crystallography. The spectral properties of TNBD (NMR, FT-IR, Ra-man) were explored. The detonation properties of TNBD calculated by EXPLO 5 code was slightly superior in comparison to standard high energy material - tetryl (detonation velocity of TNBD - 7727 m/s; detonation pressure - 278 kbar; tetryl â€“ 7570 m/s and 226.4 kbar at 1.614 g/cm3, or 260 kbar at higher density - 1.71 g/cm3. The obtained preliminary results might suggest TNBD can be a potential thermostable high energy and density material (HEDM).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"077fcd240889732512cff92181cb64012037b421fe840957b9caa9b15a38097a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
