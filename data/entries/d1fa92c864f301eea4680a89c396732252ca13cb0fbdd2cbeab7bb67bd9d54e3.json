In ex-periment (Exp.) 1, one hundred sixty-eight Nellore bulls (initial bodyweight (BW) 410 ± 8 kg) were allocated to 24 pens in a completely randomized block design. In Exp. 2, thirty Nellore bulls (Initial BW 410 ± 3 kg) were allocated to a collective pen in a completely randomized design. Three treatments were applied: Control (CTL): Sodium monensin (26 mg/kg of dry matter, DM), M3NOP: CTL with 3-NOP (100 mg/kg DM) and Combo: 3-NOP (100 mg/kg DM) with essential oils (100 mg/kg DM), 25-Hydroxy-Vit-D3 (0.10 mg/kg DM), organic chromium (4 mg/kg DM), and zinc (60 mg/kg DM). In Exp 1, bulls in Combo had greater (P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1fa92c864f301eea4680a89c396732252ca13cb0fbdd2cbeab7bb67bd9d54e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
