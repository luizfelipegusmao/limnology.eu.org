{"title":"Signsability: Enhancing Communication Through Sign Language App","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0125/v1","date":1722563319000,"content":"The integration of sign language recognition systems into digital platforms has the potential to bridge communication gaps between the deaf community and the broader population. This paper introduces an advanced Israeli Sign Language (ISL) recognition system designed to interpret dynamic motion gestures, addressing a critical need for more sophisticated and fluid communication tools. Unlike conventional systems that focus solely on static signs, our approach incorporates both Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques to analyze and translate dynamic gestures captured in real-time video. We provide a comprehensive account of our preprocessing pipeline, detailing every stage from video collection to the extraction of landmarks using MediaPipe, including the mathematical equations used for preprocessing these landmarks and the final recognition process. The dataset utilized for training our model is unique in its comprehensiveness and is publicly accessible, enhancing the reproducibility and expansion of future research. The deployment of our model on a publicly accessible website allows users to engage with ISL interactively, facilitating both learning and practice. We discuss the development process, the challenges overcome, and the anticipated societal impact of our system in promoting greater inclusivity and understanding.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6ddce9d63a160f02d62949d157cc57c76e1f02943a6640cc61977d43667fd61","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
