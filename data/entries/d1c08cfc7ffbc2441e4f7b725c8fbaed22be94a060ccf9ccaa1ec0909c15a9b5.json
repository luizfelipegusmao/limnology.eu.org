{"title":"Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi as a Salt Bioaccumulation Mechanism in a Neotropical Halophytic Fern to Establish in Saline Soils","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1252/v1","date":1729064301000,"content":"Acrostichum aureum is a halophytic pantropical invasive fern growing in mangroves and swamps. Its association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has been reported in Asia. AMF and their symbiosis (AM) commonly colonise the absorption organs of terrestrial plants worldwide. Fur-thermore, AMF/AM are well known for their capacity to bioaccumulate toxic elements and to alleviate biotic and abiotic stress (e.g. salinity stress) in their hosts. However, how AMF are in-volved in the halophytism of A. aureum, and the structures where NaCl accumulates remains unknown. This study shows that A. aureum forms AM in Neotropical thermal margins of natural ponds, NaCl accumulation occurs inside AMF vesicles, and CaSO4 precipitates in colonised roots. Therefore, AM would be contributing to the halophytic nature of this fern, allowing it to thrive in saline and thermal environments by capturing NaCl from fern tissues, compartmentalizing it inside its vesicles and precipitating CaSO4.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1c08cfc7ffbc2441e4f7b725c8fbaed22be94a060ccf9ccaa1ec0909c15a9b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
