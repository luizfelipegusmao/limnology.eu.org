{"title":"Genetic Polymorphisms of Il-18 and Their Association with Infectious Diseases &ndash; an Update","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0539/v1","date":1725717074000,"content":"Cytokines play a substantial role in the pathophysiology of infectious diseases. Consequently, genetic polymorphisms in cytokine genes can have profound effect on the susceptibility to or protection from infections and also influence the clinical manifestations, disease severity as well as outcome.  The objective of this brief narrative review is to provide an update on the recent research findings on the role of genetic polymorphisms of IL-18, a recently discovered cytokine on certain infectious diseases of public health relevance. The current review suggests there is a significant impact of IL-18 polymorphisms on different infectious diseases. The presence of  G and T alleles at position -656 is suggested to have a probable protective effect against VL. The −137G/−607C (GC) and −137C/−607C (CC) haplotypes in the promoter region are associated with increased susceptibility to severe malarial anemia. SNPs rs544354 and rs574429 (GC) are linked to a higher risk of P. falciparum infection and increased parasitemia. The -137 C/C genotype and -137 G allele (with G/G genotype) are associated with faster progression to AIDS. In contrast, the IL-18 genotype does not seem to affect overall HIV susceptibility but influences disease progression. The G and GG genotypes at position -137 and allele A at position -607 are likely associated with protection against HBV infection. Conversely, the C allele at position -137 is linked to increased susceptibility to HBV infections. The GG genotype of IL-18 -137 G &gt; C variant is associated with increased susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). The AC genotype of IL-18 -607A&gt;C has been linked to PTB susceptibility, particularly in patients with co-morbid diabetes mellitus. SNPs −137G/C, 113T/G, and +127C/T are associated with susceptibility to H. pylori infection, indicating that these genetic variants may influence the risk of H. pylori-related diseases. There are conflicting results in studies conducted in different populations (e.g., genetic polymorphism, studies conducted in India and China against HBV infection) highlighting the need for further research with larger sample sizes to resolve discrepancies. Due to the variability in findings, extensive studies in diverse populations are needed to better understand the impact of IL-18 polymorphisms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ddb76dac3bc826599848f14d9246545de1150766a3444ad360a07caa91f09c79","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
