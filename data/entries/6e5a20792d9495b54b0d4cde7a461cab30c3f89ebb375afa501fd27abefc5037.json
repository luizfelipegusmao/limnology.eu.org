{"title":"Beta-Hydroxybutyric Acid as a Template for the X-ray Powder Diffraction Analysis of Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1850/v1","date":1721798412000,"content":"In this paper we report the possibility of using the X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) technique to detect the gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) as its sodium salt in different beverages but because it is not possible to freely buy them, beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) and its sodium salt (NaBHB) were used as a model to fine tune an X-ray diffraction method for the qualitative analysis of the sodium salt of GHB. The method requires a small quantity of beverage, and an easy sample preparation, that consists only in the NaOH addition to the drink and a subsequent drying step. The dry residue obtained can be easily analyzed with XRPD using a single crystal X-ray diffractometer to exploit its high sensitivity that allows very fast patterns collection. Several beverages with different NaBHB:NaOH molar ratios were tested and the results show that NaBHB is detected in all drinks analyzed when NaBHB:NaOH molar ratio is 1:50 using characteristic peak at very low 2Î¸ values that permits to detect its presence also in complex beverage matrices. Moreover, depending on the NaOH amount added, shifting and/or splitting of the characteristic peak of the NaBHB salt was observed, and the origin of this behavior was investigated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e5a20792d9495b54b0d4cde7a461cab30c3f89ebb375afa501fd27abefc5037","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
