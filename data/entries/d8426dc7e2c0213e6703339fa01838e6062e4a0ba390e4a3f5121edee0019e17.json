A total of 48 athletes of both sexes from Women’s Artistic Gymnastics, Men’s Artistic Gymnastics, and Hoop Sport (mean ± standard deviation, age 12.50 ± 2.67 years, body mass 43.16 ± 11.00 kg, height 150.15 ± 11.91 cm). Anthropometric data were obtained using the ISAK protocol. The somatotype was analyzed using the Heath-Carter method. The results indicate significant differences in fat, bone, and residual mass, as well as in the proportions of endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy (p &lt;0.05). The somatocard revealed that most athletes were classified as endomorphic mesomorph or ectomorphic mesomorph, with variations between groups. Positive and negative correlations were identified between the anthropometric variables, somatotype, body composition, and global flexibility. All positions of the global flexibility battery test showed negative correlations with residual mass, indicating that the greater the range of flexibility, the lower the residual mass.","author":"Mirvana Elizabeth González Macías","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d8426dc7e2c0213e6703339fa01838e6062e4a0ba390e4a3f5121edee0019e17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
