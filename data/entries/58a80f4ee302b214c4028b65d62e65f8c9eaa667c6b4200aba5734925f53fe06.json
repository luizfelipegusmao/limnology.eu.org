Molecular or atomistic mechanistic understanding of nucleation, growth, and structural transformations of materials have not achieved enough at the nanoscale or below [<a href=\"#ozae044.802-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.802-B2\">2</a>]. It is mainly because of a lack of appropriate analytical methods that can obtain in-situ structural information with a spatial resolution at such small length scale along with sub-msec temporal resolution. The liquid cell EM offers an opportunity to directly observe diverse classes of chemical reactions of materials nucleation, crystallization, to diverse types of phase transformations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"58a80f4ee302b214c4028b65d62e65f8c9eaa667c6b4200aba5734925f53fe06","category":"Environment"}
