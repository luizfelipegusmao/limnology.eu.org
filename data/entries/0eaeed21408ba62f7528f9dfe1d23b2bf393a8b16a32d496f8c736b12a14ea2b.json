{"title":"Implementation of Quality Function Deployment to Improve Online Learning and Teaching in Higher Education Institutes of Engineering in Oman","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0759/v1","date":1725951667000,"content":"In this digital era, online learning and teaching is an important platform for college and university learners which required many technical facilities and in depth knowledge to have learning process effectively. Students and teachers in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) were forced to grapple with the inevitability of shifting to online classes due to the advantages of effective distance learning or for large learning group. In the case of Oman, there have been some efforts to integrate alternative learning mechanisms such as online and mobile education in the past but not followed the scale in the post pandemic world. This study seeks to utilize the principles of Total Quality Management (TQM) through the implementation of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) as a way to better understand the experiences of Omani teachers and students from HEIs. A voice of customer from teachers and students have been collected and recorded. In this regard, 165 staff and 355 students from HEIs of Engineering participated in the survey. After the survey, a house of quality analysis was done to analyze the requirements based on how strongly they are related to the standard learning outcomes expected from HEIs in Oman. The results show that more attention is required in online education in the Sultanate of Oman before it is implemented as a major part in learning and teaching.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0eaeed21408ba62f7528f9dfe1d23b2bf393a8b16a32d496f8c736b12a14ea2b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
