{"title":"The China Coastal Front from Himawari-8 AHI SST data — Part 2: South China Sea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0568/v1","date":1723129510000,"content":"High-resolution (2 km) high-frequency (hourly) SST data from 2015-2021 provided by the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Japanese Himawari-8 geostationary satellite were used to study spatial and temporal variability of the China Coastal Front (CCF) in the South China Sea. The hourly SST data were processed with the Belkin and O’Reilly (2009) algorithm to generate long-term mean monthly maps of SST gradient magnitude (GM) and frontal frequency (FM). The horizontal structure of CCF was investigated from cross-frontal distributions of SST along 11 fixed lines that allowed to determine inshore and offshore boundaries of the CCF and calculate the CCF strength defined as the total cross-frontal step dSST = Offshore SST – Inshore SST. Combined with the results of Part1 of this study (Belkin, Lou, Yin, 2023), where the CCF was documented in the East China Sea, the new results reported in this paper allowed the CCF to be reliably traced from the East China Sea via Taiwan Strait into the northern South China Sea and farther west up to the east coast of Hainan Island.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"159a5bcf2a9264dd7041735cb0903875d2d91f012d6959cf0de0e85419d1f819","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
