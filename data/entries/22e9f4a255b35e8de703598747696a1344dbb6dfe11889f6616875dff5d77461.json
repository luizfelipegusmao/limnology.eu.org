{"title":"Real-World Evidence Evaluating Teclistamab in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma: A Systematic Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0776/v1","date":1728546425000,"content":"Teclistamab (TEC) is the first B-cell maturation antigen-directed bispecific antibody approved by the European Medicines Agency and Food and Drug Administration for triple-class exposed relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). As TEC is increasingly being used in real-world (RW) settings, this study sought to gather existing RW evidence on effectiveness, safety, healthcare resource utilization, and clinical practices associated with TEC. A systematic literature review was performed to identify RW observational studies of adults with RRMM treated with TEC. Sixty-one records representing 41 unique studies were included; sample sizes ranged from 8 to 572 patients. Where reported, median follow-up ranged from 2.3 to 33.6 months and more than 65% of patients would have been ineligible for the pivotal trial of TEC (MajesTEC-1) in all but one study. Across populations with â‰¥50 patients, overall response rates ranged from 50 to 66% and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) rates ranged from 18 to 64%. Tocilizumab use for CRS management was reported in 14 studies, with two indicating lower CRS rates (13% and 26%) when used prophylactically. Survival and infection outcomes showed wide variability due to short follow-up in most studies. Overall, early RW effectiveness and safety outcomes of TEC were comparable to findings from MajesTEC-1.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22e9f4a255b35e8de703598747696a1344dbb6dfe11889f6616875dff5d77461","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
