Ultrasound grayscale images and temperature data from multiple sampling points were collected. The machine learning method of random forests was used to train the selected texture features, obtaining temperature prediction models for sampling points and the entire ultrasound imaging area. The accuracy of the algorithm was assessed by measuring the area of the hyperechoic area in the porcine liver tissue cross-section and ultrasound grayscale images.</p> Results <p>The model exhibited a high degree of accuracy in temperature prediction and the identification of coagulation zone. Within the test sets for the 15 W and 20 W power groups, the average absolute error for temperature prediction was 1.14°C and 4.73°C, respectively. Notably, the model’s accuracy in measuring the area of coagulation was higher than that of traditional ultrasonic grey-scale imaging, with error ratios of 0.402 and 0.182 for the respective power groups. Additionally, the model can filter out texture features with a high correlation to temperature, providing a certain degree of interpretability.</p> Conclusion <p>The temperature prediction model proposed in this study can be applied to temperature monitoring and coagulation zone range assessment in microwave ablation.</p>","author":"Yan Xiong","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9ffa92420380bfab565daa85440f585dd8ed998a845cf2e831ad9ed7a2961d2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
