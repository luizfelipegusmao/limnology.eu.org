{"title":"Assessment of B-type natriuretic peptide as an early predictor of mortality in acutely poisoned patients with cardiotoxicities","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae122/7726918?rss=1","date":1722729600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>Cardiotoxicity is a major toxic effect induced by several types of drugs. An electrocardiogram is done routinely in cardiovascular drug exposures. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is the usual biomarker for diagnosing myocardial injury. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a well-established predictor of disease state in suspected heart failure.<div>Aim</div>The study aimed to assess BNP’s role as an early predictor of mortality compared with cTnI and ECG changes in acutely poisoned patients with cardiotoxicities.<div>Methodology</div>This study enrolled 70 patients with acute cardiotoxicity by drugs and toxins known to cause cardiac injury admitted to Tanta University Poison Control Center (TUPCC). Collected data included socio-demographic data, toxicological history, vital signs, ECG changes, Poison Severity Score (PSS), BNP, and cTnI serum levels.<div>Result</div>Patients were classified as survivors and non-survivors. Significantly more delay time was recorded in non-survivors. Moreover, vital signs were significantly abnormal in non-survivors. There was no statistical significance regarding the initial ECG abnormalities between survivors and non-survivors. BNP and cTnI levels were significantly higher among non-survivors. For mortality prediction, BNP had good predictive power (AUC = 0.841) with 100% sensitivity and 79.7% specificity while cTnI had an acceptable predictive power (AUC = 0.786), with 83.3% sensitivity and 78.1% specificity with insignificant difference between both biomarkers.<div>Conclusion</div>BNP and cTnI levels can predict mortality in acute cardiotoxicity compared to ECG which has no statistically significant prediction. BNP has a higher discriminatory power than cTnI for the prediction of mortality.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"fb2e4ef7a931245f2d46f1f2f9502332f301f6a371d264e5c700973c71976630","category":"Environment"}
