{"title":"An 8x8 CMOS Optoelectronic Readout Array of Short-Range LiDAR Sensors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1837/v1","date":1727162536000,"content":"This paper presents an 8x8 channel optoelectronic readout array (ORA) realized in a 180-nm CMOS process for the applications of short-range light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors. We propose several circuit techniques in this work including an amplitude-to-voltage (A2V) converter that reduces the notorious walk-errors by intensity compensation, and a time-to-voltage (T2V) converter that acquires the linear slope of the output signals by exploiting a charging circuit, thus extending the input dynamic range significantly from 5 uApp to 1.1 mApp, i.e. 46.8 dB. These results correspond to the maximum detection range of 8.2 meters via the action of the A2V converter and the minimum detection range of 56 centimeters with the aid of the proposed T2V converter. Optical measurements utilizing an 850-nm laser diode confirm that the proposed 8 x 8 ORA with 64 on-chip avalanche photodiodes (APDs) can successfully recover the narrow 5-ns light pulses even at the shortest distance of 56 centimeters. Hence, this work provides a potential CMOS solution for low-cost, low-power short-range LiDAR sensors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93986271ed2f2fcd643327b1dcd5413ef41a709cfa236ba7a901b086ccf8e401","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
