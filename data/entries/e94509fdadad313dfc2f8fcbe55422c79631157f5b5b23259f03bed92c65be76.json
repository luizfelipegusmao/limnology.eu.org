{"title":"Enhancing EQ-5D-5L sensitivity in capturing the most common symptoms in post COVID-19 patients: an exploratory cross-sectional study with focus on fatigue, memory/concentration problems and dyspnea dimensions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0602/v1","date":1712646081000,"content":"This study aimed to determine whether the EQ-5D-5L tool captures the most common persistent symptoms, such as fatigue, memory/concentration problems and dyspnea in patients with post COVID-19 conditions, and if adding these symptoms improves the explained variance of the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In this exploratory cross-sectional study, two cohorts of Swedish patients (n=177) with a history of COVID-19 infection answeared a questionnaire covering sociodemographic characteristics, clinical factors and HRQoL assessed using EQ-5D-5L with the Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS). Spearman rank correlation and multiple regression analyses were employed to investigate the extent to which the most common persistent symptoms such as fatigue, memory/concentration problems and dyspnea were explained by the EQ-5D-5L. The explanatory power of EQ-5D-5L for EQ-VAS was also analysed, both with and without inclusion of symptom(s). We found that the EQ-5D-5L dimensions partly captured fatigue and memory/concentration problems but performed poorly in capturing dyspnea. Specifically, the EQ-5D-5L explained 55% of the variance in memory/concentration problems, 47% in fatigue and only 14% in dyspnea. Adding fatigue to the EQ-5D-5L increased the explained variance of the EQ-VAS by 5.7%, while the addition of memory/concentration problems and dyspnea had a comparatively smaller impact on the explained variance. Our study highlights the EQ-5D-5Lâ€™s strength in capturing fatigue and memory/concentration problems in post COVID-19 patients. However, it also underscores the challenges in assessing dyspnea in this group. Fatigue emerged as a notably influential symptom, significantly enhancing the EQ-5D-5L's predictive ability to for the EQ-VAS score in these patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e94509fdadad313dfc2f8fcbe55422c79631157f5b5b23259f03bed92c65be76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
