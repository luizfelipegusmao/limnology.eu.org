{"title":"Towards a better understanding of anticipatory postural adjustments in people with Parkinson’s disease","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300465","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by Jana Seuthe, Anna Heinzel, Femke Hulzinga, Pieter Ginis, Kirsten E. Zeuner, Günther Deuschl, Nicholas D’Cruz, Alice Nieuwboer, Christian Schlenstedt</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Previous studies have shown that anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) are altered in people with Parkinson’s disease but its meaning for locomotion is less understood. This study aims to investigate the association between APAs and gait initiation, gait and freezing of gait and how a dynamic postural control challenging training may induce changes in these features.</p> Methods <p>Gait initiation was quantified using wearable sensors and subsequent straight walking was assessed via marker-based motion capture. Additionally, turning and FOG-related outcomes were measured with wearable sensors. Assessments were conducted one week before (Pre), one week after (Post) and 4 weeks after (Follow-up) completion of a training intervention (split-belt treadmill training or regular treadmill training), under single task and dual task (DT) conditions. Statistical analysis included a linear mixed model for training effects and correlation analysis between APAs and the other outcomes for Pre and Post-Pre delta.</p> Results <p>52 participants with Parkinson’s disease (22 freezers) were assessed. We found that APA size in the medio-lateral direction during DT was positively associated with gait speed (p&lt;0.001) and stride length (p&lt;0.001) under DT conditions at Pre. The training effect was largest for first step range of motion and was similar for both training modes. For the associations between changes after the training (pooled sample) medio-lateral APA size showed a significant positive correlation with first step range of motion (p = 0.033) only in the DT condition and for the non-freezers only.</p> Conclusions <p>The findings of this work revealed new insights into how APAs were not associated with first step characteristics and freezing and only baseline APAs during DT were related with DT gait characteristics. Training-induced changes in the size of APAs were related to training benefits in the first step ROM only in non-freezers. Based on the presented results increasing APA size through interventions might not be the ideal target for overall improvement of locomotion.</p>","author":"Jana Seuthe","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"570c9733f0aad16423e8664415e022bbbc31cd15f888b58a651f471865027f45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
