{"title":"Homogeneous Projective Coordinates for the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs Group","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0126/v1","date":1717483671000,"content":"This paper studies the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group in homogeneous\nprojective coordinates, because it is then possible to write all\ntransformations of such a group in a manifestly linear way.\nThe 2-sphere metric, Bondi-Metzner-Sachs metric, asymptotic Killing\nvectors, generators of supertranslations, \nas well as boosts and rotations of Minkowski spacetime, are\nall re-expressed in homogeneous projective coordinates. \nLast, the integral curves of vector fields which generate supertranslations\nare evaluated in detail. This work prepares the ground for more advanced\napplications of the differential geometry of asymptotically flat\nspacetimes in projective coordinates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbd23c02da6e9fd5f709d71dca72e4fb3a817a7569e531e2916f933b7e9c67a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
