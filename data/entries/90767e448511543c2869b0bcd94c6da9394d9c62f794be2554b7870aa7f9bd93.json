{"title":"A Case for the Optimization of Ophthalmic Care by Leveraging 3-D Printing: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2133/v1","date":1724926489000,"content":"Over 2.2 billion people across the globe face significant barriers to accessing essential ophthalmic care, with elderly, rural, and refugee populations being disproportionately affected. These obsta-cles deepen existing disparities in eye care. 3D printing is a novel technology that has the potential to transform the field and improve access through alleviating many patient-specific barriers. This article delves into the evolution of 3D printing within ophthalmology, highlighting its current ap-plications and future potential. It explores various 3D printing techniques and biomaterials, dis-cussing their effectiveness in creating advanced solutions such as bioengineered corneas, ocular prosthetics, and innovative treatments for dry eye syndrome. Additionally, 3D printing has rev-olutionized drug delivery systems for conditions like glaucoma, retinal diseases, and for ocular brachytherapy. Despite its promise, the integration of 3D printing into clinical practice presents challenges, which the article addresses alongside strategies for overcoming them. By mapping out the technological advancements and challenges, this review offers a roadmap for enhancing global eye care accessibility and improving patient outcomes on a global scale.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90767e448511543c2869b0bcd94c6da9394d9c62f794be2554b7870aa7f9bd93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
