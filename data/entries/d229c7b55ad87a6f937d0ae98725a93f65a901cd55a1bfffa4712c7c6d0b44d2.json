{"title":"Psychology of Peace: Insights from the Srimad Bhagavad-Gita","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2353/v1","date":1727699908000,"content":"This article delves into the psychological dimensions of peace as articulated in the Srimad Bhagavad-Gita, an ancient Indian scripture. Through its dialogue between Lord Krishna and the warrior Arjuna, the Bhagavad-Gita presents profound insights into achieving inner peace, managing conflict, and fostering a peaceful society. The text aligns with contemporary psychological constructs such as self-realization, mindfulness, emotional regulation, and prosocial behavior. Additionally, it addresses how the teachings enhance social engagement and disengagement, as well as cognitive, affective, mental, and physical regulation. The Bhagavad- Gita's bidirectional question-answering approach motivates, reasoning, and rationality, decision- making and goal-directed behavior. This analysis demonstrates the relevance of these ancient principles in addressing modern psychological challenges, providing a holistic framework for understanding and cultivating peace. Ultimately, the treatise portrays peace as a reflection of safety, security, and social well-being, making its teachings profoundly relevant today.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d229c7b55ad87a6f937d0ae98725a93f65a901cd55a1bfffa4712c7c6d0b44d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
