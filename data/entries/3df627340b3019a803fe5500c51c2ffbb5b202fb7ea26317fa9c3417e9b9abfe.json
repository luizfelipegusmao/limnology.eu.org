{"title":"The Impact of Green Supply Chain Practices on the Performance of New Energy Vehicle Enterprises&mdash;Taking &ldquo;B&rdquo; Company as an Example","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1818/v1","date":1724657433000,"content":"At present, under the background of high-quality development and the “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality” goal, China’s economic structure, industrial structure and energy structure have all begun green transformation and upgrading. The supply chain has become an important starting point for energy conservation and carbon reduction. In this context, enterprises have also ushered in huge environmental risk challenges and innovative development opportunities. This paper adopts Entropy-Weighted TOPSIS comprehensive evaluation method to analyze the green supply chain performance of \"B\" company, a new energy leading company, based on the theory of green development and corporate social responsibility. By establishing a green supply chain evaluation criteria system including four dimensions of finance performance, environment performance, operation performance and innovation performance, the weight of each evaluation criterion is objectively analyzed and calculated, and the green supply chain performance of \"B\" company from 2018 to 2022 is ranked. Based on this, comprehensive evaluations and sub-dimension evaluation are carried out and suggestions for improvement are put forward. At the same time, we hope to help other new energy vehicle companies optimize their own green supply chain practice mode.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3df627340b3019a803fe5500c51c2ffbb5b202fb7ea26317fa9c3417e9b9abfe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
