{"title":"Empathy for the Partner Eliminates the Endowment Effect","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1743/v1","date":1714120157000,"content":"The endowment effect is a long-standing and powerful effect in behavioral economics whereby human beings consistently overvalue objects to which they have been endowed when compared to prices potential buyers are willing to offer. This effect is considered by most behavioral economists to be irrational, even becoming so maladaptive that it becomes inimical to one’s own self or societal interests. The ability to interfere with this endowment process, however, would allow us to reduce these disadvantageous outcomes and improve decision-making skills. Based on the psychology of empathy-based altruism, we predicted that people would give more to their transaction partner, even at a current cost to themselves (i.e., altruism), if they felt empathic concern for them. Applying methods from existing empathy-altruism studies, two pilot studies successfully eliminated or reversed the endowment effect when participants believed their partner was in either physical (N = 156) or emotional (N = 278) pain, compared to control conditions. A pre-registered, in-person study directly contrasted physical pain, emotional pain, and control partners (N = 106) and replicated the ability of both pain conditions to neutralize the endowment effect by concurrently increasing buyer prices and decreasing seller prices. People’s generosity toward those in need can be harnessed to release them from an often troubling and disadvantageous need to hold onto items of little use or value, which could benefit others.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8735c77a3aec70a91e1c655f588e459841dd573428f462dad6a2b13ab4f9f65f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
