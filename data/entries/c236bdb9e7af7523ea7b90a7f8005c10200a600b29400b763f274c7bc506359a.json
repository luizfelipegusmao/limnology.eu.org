Despite this, they are not well understood due to their multiscale nature, which limits the use of molecular models and calls for a mesoscopic approach such as the celebrated Canham–Helfrich one. Unfortunately, such a model cannot handle topological transitions, hiding the crucial involved forces and the appearance of the experimentally observed hemifused intermediates. In this work, we describe the membrane as a diffuse interface preserving the Canham–Helfrich elasticity. We show that pivotal features of the hemifusion pathway are captured by this mesoscopic approach, e.g. a (meta)stable hemifusion state and the fusogenic behavior of negative monolayer spontaneous curvatures. The membrane lateral stress profile is calculated as a function of the elastic rigidities, yielding a coarse-grained version of molecular models findings. Insights into the fusogenic mechanism are reported and discussed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"c236bdb9e7af7523ea7b90a7f8005c10200a600b29400b763f274c7bc506359a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
