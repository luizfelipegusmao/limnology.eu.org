{"title":"Tensor modeling of MRSA bacteremia cytokine and transcriptional patterns reveals coordinated, outcome-associated immunological programs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae185/7664540?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Methicillin-resistant <span>Staphylococcus aureus</span> (MRSA) bacteremia is a common and life-threatening infection that imposes up to 30% mortality even when appropriate therapy is used. Despite in vitro efficacy determined by minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints, antibiotics often fail to resolve these infections in vivo, resulting in persistent MRSA bacteremia. Recently, several genetic, epigenetic, and proteomic correlates of persistent outcomes have been identified. However, the extent to which single variables or their composite patterns operate as independent predictors of outcome or reflect shared underlying mechanisms of persistence is unknown. To explore this question, we employed a tensor-based integration of host transcriptional and cytokine datasets across a well-characterized cohort of patients with persistent or resolving MRSA bacteremia outcomes. This method yielded high correlative accuracy with outcomes and immunologic signatures united by transcriptomic and cytokine datasets. Results reveal that patients with persistent MRSA bacteremia (PB) exhibit signals of granulocyte dysfunction, suppressed antigen presentation, and deviated lymphocyte polarization. In contrast, patients with resolving bacteremia (RB) heterogeneously exhibit correlates of robust antigen-presenting cell trafficking and enhanced neutrophil maturation corresponding to appropriate T lymphocyte polarization and B lymphocyte response. These results suggest that transcriptional and cytokine correlates of PB vs. RB outcomes are complex and may not be disclosed by conventional modeling. In this respect, a tensor-based integration approach may help to reveal consensus molecular and cellular mechanisms and their biological interpretation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"14cf69a9bf3fd09c928ff9fede5f439128404f8583f905703f5dbf99f3d20916","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
