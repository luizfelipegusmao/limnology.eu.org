{"title":"From Behavior Modes to Fundamental Questions to Answer through System Dynamics Modeling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0644/v1","date":1725865278000,"content":"This is a methodological contribution to reference mode development in system dynamics model conceptualization. Existing behavior mode taxonomies-developed for various modeling phases-provide no comprehensive method for mode classification based on an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive modes, and derivation of questions the simulation model should answer. Novice modelers need such guidance. The article proposes a conceptual framework for systemic behavior with a hierarchical taxonomy of elementary, composite, and overlaid modes. A structured method identifies the intervals of each respective mode, orders them into episodes and then condenses the variablesâ€™ episodes to systemic episodes. Each transition then gives rise to a fundamental question for the model under development. Three classical cases illustrate the application and contrast the proposed taxonomy to others in the extant literature. The article then discusses some validation criteria referring to reference modes and their link to the dynamic hypothesis, current limitations, and questions for further research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b8cba404b25fa4ec5c0d2fc7c15bdff22935ea2e203e5ec76ed30fc4bb338e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
