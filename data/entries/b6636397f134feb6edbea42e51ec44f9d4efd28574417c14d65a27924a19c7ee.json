{"title":"Effects of Electroless Deposition Conditions on the Hydrogen Generation Kinetics of Co-Fe-P Catalysts via Hydrolysis of Ammonia Borane Solution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2144/v1","date":1724921041000,"content":"This study investigates the fabrication and optimization of Co-Fe-P catalysts on Cu foam using electroless deposition, focusing on their hydrogen generation efficiency. Deposition times were varied from 1 to 10 minutes, resulting in spherical Co-Fe-P particles growing from sub-micron to several microns in size. The optimal hydrogen generation rate of 27.66 ml/min was achieved with a 5-minute deposition. Extending the deposition to 10 minutes led to particle aggregation, reducing the efficiency per unit weight. The impact of bath temperatures from 30°C to 60°C was also assessed, with temperatures of 50°C and above promoting the development of larger 3D structures and increasing Fe and P contents (~9.3 wt.% and 10 wt.%). This enhanced hydrogen generation, peaking again at 27.66 ml/min. NaOH concentrations were varied from 0.5 M to 0.9 M, showing that concentrations over 0.8 M improved catalyst morphology and performance, increasing hydrogen generation to 10.03 ml/min. Among substrates tested, Co-Fe-P on Cu foam demonstrated the highest hydrogen generation rate due to better catalyst distribution and surface area. The study underscores the importance of deposition conditions and substrate choice in optimizing Co-Fe-P catalysts for hydrogen generation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6636397f134feb6edbea42e51ec44f9d4efd28574417c14d65a27924a19c7ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
