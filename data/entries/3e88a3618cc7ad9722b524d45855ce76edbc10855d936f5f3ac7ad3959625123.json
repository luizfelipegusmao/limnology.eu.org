{"title":"On the Reality of the Time State","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1648/v1","date":1711524119000,"content":"In this paper, a proof similar to the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph (PBR) theorem is given to prove that time in quantum theory is not epistemic but has ontological reality. For this, we Ô¨Årst discuss how time can be encoded as an intrinsic property of a quantum system. We prepare a quantum state containing time as an intrinsic property and show by a PBR-type proof that time cannot be an epistemic notion. In fact, the PBR theorem implies an ontic notion of time. Indeed, if the quantum state is a physical property, then quantum state reduction is a physical process involving information destruction. In this case, quantum probabilities are intrinsic probabilities without epistemic origin, and they generate a genuinely new sequence of events. This novelty introduced by quantum probabilities can be interpreted as time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e88a3618cc7ad9722b524d45855ce76edbc10855d936f5f3ac7ad3959625123","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
