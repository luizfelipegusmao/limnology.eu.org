{"title":"Otoliths as chemical archives through ontogeny reveal distinct migratory strategies of Atlantic halibut within the Gulf of St. Lawrence","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/7/1221/7704578?rss=1","date":1719964800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In marine fishes of commercial interest, defining habitat use and migration strategies through ontogeny can help better understand the structure and dynamics of harvested populations and guide their management. The present study relied on otolith chemistry to identify three contingents within the Atlantic halibut (<span>Hippoglossus hippoglossus</span>) stock in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL). We differentiated two chemical signatures from otolith edges, one for shallow (&lt;100 m) and another one for deep (&gt;100 m) waters. By identifying transitions between the deep and shallow habitats, we found that most halibut display migrations from the deep waters to shallow waters during the first 3 years of life. After reaching maturity, most halibut distributing in northern regions of the GSL became full-time residents in deep areas of the GSL. In contrast, halibut found in summer on the shallow plateau of the southern GSL displayed migrating behaviour between shallow (summer) and deep (winter) waters throughout their lives, either on an annual or irregular basis. Overall, our results demonstrate that otolith chemical signatures serve as natural markers of geographically distinct marine environments, facilitating the identification and reconstruction of environmental histories of long-lived marine fishes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"8eadc0a173cf94f735b50d244a7e9deb8401c4301b13baac89b5ae1f2f724dc1","category":"Environment"}
