{"title":"Evaluating the Impact of Cloud Computing on SMEs Performance: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0882/v1","date":1726044044000,"content":"In recent times, the adoption of cloud computing by small and medium-sized 9 enterprises (SMEs) has become a crucial issue. These businesses face substantial difficulties in 10 accessing reliable and affordable IT infrastructure due to economic constraints and technological 11 restrictions. Hybrid cloud computing solutions which incorporate Infrastructure as a Service 12 (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) offer a feasible approach to 13overcoming these challenges. This study proposes a systematic literature review of cloud 14 computing's impact on SME performance emphasizing cost-efficiency, reliability, and 15 competitive advantages, using the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 16 Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. The inclusion criteria are bounded by (1) publication date 17 between 2014 and 2024, (2) English-language publications, (3) research focused on cloud 18 computing for SMEs, and (4) studies with a clear analytical framework for evaluating SME 19 performance. Following this process, 90 eligible research studies were included. The average 20 total cost for cloud services varies significantly, with operational costs reflecting the scalability 21 of the services and the specific needs of SMEs. This analysis offers valuable guidance for SMEs 22 and stakeholders in optimizing cloud-based strategies for enhanced performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"65b5b9985fd5aa935bafe5928ec9bcc602335c499723ce386beb0b95320fe2d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
