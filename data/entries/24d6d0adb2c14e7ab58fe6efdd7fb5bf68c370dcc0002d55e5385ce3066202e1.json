{"title":"Atomic Engineering: Electron Microscope as a Manufacturing Tool","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.757/7720031?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Atomic Engineering (AE) – creating and synthesizing structures atom-by-atom at room-temperature – pushes the material design and device creation process to the era of angstrom-scale after the nanoscale. Many fields, like quantum information, quantum sensing, single-atom catalysis, nanopore DNA sequencing, water purification, are all built upon atomic-level structures or defects. The birth of AE is symbolized by the construction of the “IBM” logo using Xe atoms via scanning tunneling microscope. However, since then, the STM-enabled technologies did not extend AE further to the device-level as a result of two critical issues: (1) Ultra-low temperature and ultra-high vacuum are required; (2) Single-probe maneuvering is extremely time-consuming. On the other hand, atomic devices and quantum materials should have the following properties to extend the utilities of atomic-engineered materials: (1) stable at room temperature, (2) spatially uniform, (3) controlled on-demand, and (4) having tailored properties. To address these issues and further develop highly controlled atomic structures, new ways to control atoms and atomic-level defect structures are required.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"24d6d0adb2c14e7ab58fe6efdd7fb5bf68c370dcc0002d55e5385ce3066202e1","category":"Environment"}
