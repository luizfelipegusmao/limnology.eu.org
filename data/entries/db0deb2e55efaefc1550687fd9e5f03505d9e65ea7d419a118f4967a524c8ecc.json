{"title":"Virtual Tour Models as an Efficient Counterpart to BIMs in Spatial Immersion for IoT Distant Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0395/v1","date":1717670776000,"content":"This study explores the integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Virtual Tours in the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, focusing on Facility Management (FM) and Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS). The research addresses the need for different levels of detail in BIMs across various building phases and the potential of Virtual Tours as a complement to BIMs in IoT-based FM. The studyâ€™s methodology includes a literature review, a pilot-demonstrator case study, installation of monitoring and IoT control devices, execution of BIMs and Virtual Tour models, and development of links between system elements. The case study is based on the Controlled Environments for Living Lab Studies (CELLS), a unique facility designed for flexible monitoring and remote-control processes. The findings of this research could provide valuable insights into the potential of Virtual Tours to complement and connect to BIMs within a life cycle perspective, enhancing the usability of digital twins for nontrained users and contributing to the evolution of the AEC industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db0deb2e55efaefc1550687fd9e5f03505d9e65ea7d419a118f4967a524c8ecc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
