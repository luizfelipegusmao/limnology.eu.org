{"title":"Mechanisms and Morphological Time Scales of Avulsed Channel Process on the Modern Yellow River Delta","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036544?af=R","date":1724127251000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The modern Yellow River Delta (YRD) has witnessed frequent channel avulsions followed by the morphological processes of “wandering- short-lived braiding -merging” in history. However, process-based investigation and relevant physics behind these processes remain poorly constrained. The present study complements the understanding for this evolution through numerical experiments. This is achieved by applying a two-dimensional (2-D) depth-averaged fully coupled morphodynamic model that considers the feedbacks of sediment-laden flow and bed deformation to a schematized fan-shaped YRD. Under an uneven bed of uniform sediment, the avulsed processes of “wandering- short-lived braiding -merging” during new channel routing on the YRD are satisfactorily reproduced by the present modelling in terms of the time evolution of planar channel pattern and channel length. Moreover, the mechanisms of the avulsed evolution have been elucidated through factor analysis on delta slope, incoming flow-sediment conditions and artificial trenching, etc. It is suggested that morphological stability could be reached when a single meandering channel is finally sustained, of which the time scale is 4–8 years echoing the documented data of abandoned channels on the YRD. In addition, quantitative criteria have been advocated to help distinguishing the sub-stages of the avulsed evolution together with the characteristic pattern judgement. Based on the above, implications for the YRD management are discussed.</p>","author":"Wei Li, \nLehong Zhu, \nPeng Hu, \nNiansheng Cheng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"92e6434e00c186f1017cbdbc0ea6f6636a9d974078d3519587bd2046fdf261f6","category":"Environment"}
