As a methylotrophic yeast, <span>Pichia pastoris</span> uses methanol as its carbon and energy source. Previously, the formation of alcohol oxidase (AOX) crystalloids in peroxisomes was observed by electron microscopy [<a href=\"#ozae044.385-B2\">2</a>], and the structures of isolated AOX complexes were investigated by single particle cryo-EM or x-ray crystallography [<a href=\"#ozae044.385-B3\">3</a>]. However, there have not been studies that visualized the close-to-native subcellular structures of the <span>Pichia pastoris</span> cells induced with methanol in vivo. In this work, we investigated the cytoplasmic regions of vitreously frozen Pichia pastoris cells by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and 3D map segmentation analysis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ef0e972fccf973b11407a2d007cd9380f4106ee9539c22fd0ab25b2ed2aa99d4","category":"Environment"}
