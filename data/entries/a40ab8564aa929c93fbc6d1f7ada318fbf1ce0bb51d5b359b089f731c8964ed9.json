{"title":"Dual-Polarized Dipole Antenna with Wideband Stable Radiation Patterns Using AMC Reflector","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1562/v1","date":1716884465000,"content":"This paper presents a wideband dual-polarized dipole antenna structure operating at 1.7-3.8 GHz (76.4%). For a traditional 4G dipole antenna which covers the band 1.71 GHz- 2.69 GHz, it’s difficult to maintain the satisfactory impedance matching and normal stable radiation patterns within the 5G sub-6 GHz band 3.3-3.8 GHz, which mainly due to the fixed antenna height is no longer a quarter-wavelength. To solve this, a connected-ring-shaped metasurface structure is proposed and deployed to operate as an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC). As a result, stable antenna radiation patterns are obtained within the whole band 1.7-3.8 GHz. For verification, this wideband dipole antenna using AMC is implemented and tested. The measured results show that the proposed antenna has an impedance bandwidth of 80.7% (1.7-4.0 GHz). It has an average measured in-band realized gain of 7.0±1.0 dBi and a stable 70∘±5∘ half power beam width (HPBW) within the 4G/5G-sub 6GHz bands 1710-2690 MHz and 3300-3800 MHz.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a40ab8564aa929c93fbc6d1f7ada318fbf1ce0bb51d5b359b089f731c8964ed9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
