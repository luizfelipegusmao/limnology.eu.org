{"title":"Effects of Faba bean protein isolate on rheological properties of pork myofibrillar protein gels and quality characteristics of pork Low‐Fat model sausages","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13484?af=R","date":1711194249000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>This study aimed to assess the effect of faba bean (<i>Vicia faba</i> L.) protein isolate (FBPI) on the rheological properties of pork myofibrillar protein gels (MPGs) and the quality characteristics of pork low-fat model sausages (LFMSs).</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Pork MPGs with 5 or 10 g kg<sup>−1</sup> FBPI had higher cooking yield, gel strength, and viscosity compared with control. The addition of FBPI to MPGs increased the protein surface hydrophobicity and decreased sulfhydryl groups. Furthermore, adding FBPI to MPGs changed the protein profile and microstructure. The cooking loss and expressible moisture of LFMSs with 5, 10, or 15 g kg<sup>−1</sup> FBPI were lower than those of control and showed similar results to those with 15 g kg<sup>−1</sup> soy protein isolate (SPI). Hardness values of LFMSs with FBPI and SPI were no different, and were higher than those of control.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The addition of FBPI potentially improves rheological properties of MPGs and the functional properties of LFMSs, including water-holding capacity and textural properties.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
