This study investigates the properties of various Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods, critically comparing their results in evaluating the performance of consumer goods companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). The analysis utilizes financial ratios, with weights derived using Buckley's Column Geometric Mean Method, a fuzzy ranking approach. The study concludes by comparing TOPSIS, VIKOR, and ELECTRE methods, determining the final rankings of these companies, and interpreting these rankings based on financial ratios over a five-year period (2016-2020).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9417403097510717462570525b768187eb89e066dabfb9bda68a8a16a914aa08","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
