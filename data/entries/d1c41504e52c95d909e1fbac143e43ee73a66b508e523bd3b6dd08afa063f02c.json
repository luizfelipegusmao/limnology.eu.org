The results show that: (1) Under the condition of constant external load, the maximum displacement of pile foundation increases with the increase of eccentricity; (2) With the increase of concrete strength, the maximum displacement decreases gradually, but the corresponding maximum stress is roughly the same; (3) The height of the rock cave has a great influence on the bearing capacity of the pile foundation. In the construction process, it is necessary to minimize or avoid passing through the area with higher karst caves.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1c41504e52c95d909e1fbac143e43ee73a66b508e523bd3b6dd08afa063f02c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
