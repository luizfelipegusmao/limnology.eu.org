{"title":"PSEUDO-ETIOLATION IN LIGHT proteins reduce greening by binding GLK transcription factors","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1722/7459194?rss=1","date":1701734400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Knocking out genes encoding proteins that downregulate the accumulation of pigments may lead to increases in crop quality and yield. PSEUDO-ETIOLATION IN LIGHT 1 (PEL1) downregulates the accumulation of carotenoids in carrot and chlorophyll in Arabidopsis and rice and may inhibit GOLDEN 2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors. <span>PEL1</span> belongs to a previously unstudied gene family found only in plants. We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock out each member of the 4-member <span>PEL</span> gene family and both <span>GLK</span> genes in Arabidopsis. In <span>pel</span> mutants, chlorophyll levels were elevated in seedlings; after flowering, chloroplasts increased in size, and anthocyanin levels increased. Although the chlorophyll-deficient phenotype of <span>glk1 glk2</span> was epistatic to <span>pel1 pel2 pel3 pel4</span> in most of our experiments, <span>glk1 glk2</span> was not epistatic to <span>pel1 pel2 pel3 pel4</span> for the accumulation of anthocyanins in most of our experiments. The <span>pel</span> alleles attenuated growth, altered the accumulation of nutrients in seeds, disrupted an abscisic acid-inducible inhibition of seedling growth response that promotes drought tolerance, and affected the expression of genes associated with diverse biological functions, such as stress responses, cell wall metabolism hormone responses, signaling, growth, and the accumulation of phenylpropanoids and pigments. We found that PEL proteins specifically bind 6 transcription factors that influence the accumulation of anthocyanins, GLK2, and the carboxy termini of GLK1 and <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span> myeloblastosis oncogene homolog 4 (AtMYB4). Our data indicate that the PEL proteins influence the accumulation of chlorophyll and many other processes, possibly by inhibiting GLK transcription factors and via other mechanisms, and that multiple mechanisms downregulate chlorophyll content.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"ef8ee3a44d18ecc7dd21cc6421318bb9564c40ee6c32e8e529c262bf59e67f53","category":"Environment"}
