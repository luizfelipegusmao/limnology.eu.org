{"title":"HydroSAR: A Cloud-Based Service for the Monitoring of Inundation Events in the Hindu Kush Himalaya","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1640/v1","date":1719219302000,"content":"The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) is one of the most flood-prone regions in the world, yet heavy cloud cover and limited in-situ observations have hampered efforts to monitor the impact of heavy rainfall, flooding, and inundation during severe weather events. This paper introduces HydroSAR, a Sentinel-1 SAR-based hazard monitoring service that was co-developed with in-region partners to provide year-round, low-latency weather-hazards information across the HKH. The paper describes the end-user focused concept and overall design of the HydroSAR service. It introduces the main processing algorithms behind HydroSARâ€™s broad product portfolio, which includes qualitative visual layers as well as quantitative products measuring surface water extent and water depth. We summarize the cloud-based implementation of the developed service, which is providing capability to scale automatically with event size. A performance assessment of our quantitative algorithms is described, demonstrating capabilities to map flood extent and water depth at an accuracy of &gt;90% and","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97b644f55468652143625ff684673fc7358c180317e973af6ebbdba56f7a55c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
