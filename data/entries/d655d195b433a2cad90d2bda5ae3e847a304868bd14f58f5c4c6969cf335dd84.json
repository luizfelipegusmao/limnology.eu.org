This surge in data generation necessitates sophisticated analytical methodologies capable of not just processing this data, but more critically, of extracting significant insights into the material properties and mechanisms at play. This challenge is compounded by the vast array of possible analytical paths and the intricate tuning of parameters, making the identification of an optimal workflow a daunting task. The development of workflows that can interpret recorded data or analyze streaming data in active learning —be it images, spectra, or hyperspectral data—into human-understandable formats becomes imperative.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d655d195b433a2cad90d2bda5ae3e847a304868bd14f58f5c4c6969cf335dd84","category":"Environment"}
