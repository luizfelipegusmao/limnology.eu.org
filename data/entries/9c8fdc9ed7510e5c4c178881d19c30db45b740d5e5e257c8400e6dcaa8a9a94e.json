{"title":"Comparison of three unionid mussel species in removing green microalgae grown in recirculating aquaculture system effluent","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05547-w","date":1725148800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Global increase in aquaculture production has created a need to reduce its environmental impacts. Nutrients could be recycled especially at land-based recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) by cultivating green microalgae in aquaculture effluent. However, microalgae are difficult to harvest. As a multi-trophic solution, mussels could be used in harvesting microalgae. We tested three European freshwater mussels (duck mussel <em>Anodonta anatina</em>, swan mussel <em>A. cygnea</em>, and swollen river mussel <em>Unio tumidus</em>) for filtering two common green microalgae (<em>Monoraphidium griffithii</em> and <em>Selenastrum</em> sp.) grown in RAS effluent. Mussels decreased microalgal concentrations in the tanks 42–83% over three consecutive trials. Algal concentrations at the end of each trial were lowest for both microalgae in tanks containing <em>Anodonta</em> mussels. Clearance rates were higher for <em>Anodonta</em> mussels than for <em>U. tumidus</em>. Mussels biodeposited more microalgae to tank bottoms when <em>M. griffithii</em> was filtered. Ammonium concentration decreased or did not change in tanks with <em>M. griffithii</em>, but increased in tanks containing <em>Selenastrum</em> sp. These results suggest that of the tested species <em>Anodonta</em> mussels and <em>M. griffithii</em> show best potential for RAS effluent bioremediation application. We conclude that a co-culture of microalgae and unionid mussels could be used for recycling nutrients in aquaculture.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"9c8fdc9ed7510e5c4c178881d19c30db45b740d5e5e257c8400e6dcaa8a9a94e","category":"Environment"}
