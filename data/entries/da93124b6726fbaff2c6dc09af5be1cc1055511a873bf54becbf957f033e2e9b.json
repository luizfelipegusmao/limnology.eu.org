{"title":"PSII-12 Dose-dependent effects of supplemental benzoic acid on nitrogen balance, urinary pH, slurry pH, and manure odorous compounds in pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/291/7664887?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to determine the effects of supplemental benzoic acid (BA) at 0.5% to 2.5% in diets on nitrogen (N) utilization, urinary pH, slurry pH, and manure odorous compounds in pigs. Fifteen barrows with an initial body weight of 56.2 kg (standard deviation = 2.6) were individually housed in metabolism crates. The animals were allocated to a replicated 6 Ã— 4 incomplete Latin square design with 12 animals, 6 experimental diets, and 4 periods, resulting in 8 observations per dietary treatment. The basal diet mainly consisted of corn, soybean meal, and rapeseed meal. Benzoic acid was supplemented to the basal diet at 0.0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, or 2.5% BA at the expense of corn starch. Each period consisted of a 4-d adaptation period and a 24-h collection period for slurry followed by a 4-d collection period for feces and urine. On d 5, feces and urine were collected for 24 h, and the feces and urine were mixed in a ratio of fecal weight to urine weight at the end of the collection to obtain slurry samples. The apparent total tract digestibility of N tended to linearly increase (<span>P</span> = 0.071) and the daily digested N linearly increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) with increasing BA supplementation. In contrast, the urinary N output and retained N were not affected by inclusion of BA. The urinary and slurry pH were quadratically decreased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) with increasing BA supplementation. In the fecal samples, the concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and skatole linearly decreased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) and isovalerate concentration tended to linearly decrease (<span>P</span> = 0.099) by supplemental BA. In the slurry samples, the concentrations of isovalerate and skatole decrease linearly (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), and butyrate concentration tended to linearly decrease (<span>P</span> = 0.054) by supplemental BA. In conclusion, supplemental benzoic acid has the potential to improve the N digestibility in a dose-dependent manner for pigs. In addition, increasing benzoic acid supplementation decreased urinary pH, slurry pH, and concentrations of some odorous compounds in pig feces and slurry.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"da93124b6726fbaff2c6dc09af5be1cc1055511a873bf54becbf957f033e2e9b","category":"Environment"}
