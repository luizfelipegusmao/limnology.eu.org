We report hospitalisation rates and explored predictive factors for hospitalisation in adolescents and adults (10–35 years) living with PaHIV in England.</p> Method <p>Retrospective observational cohort study over a three-year period 2016–2019. Data collected included cause and duration of hospitalisation, HIV viral load and CD4 lymphocyte count. The primary outcome was overnight hospitalisation. Patients exited at study end/ transfer of care (TOC)/ loss to follow up (LTFU) or death. Maternity/hospital admissions at other centres were excluded. Admission rates per 100 person-years (95% CI) were calculated by age group. Negative binomial regression with generalized estimating equations was performed.</p> Results <p>255 patients contributed 689 person-years of follow up. 56% were female and 83% were of a Black, Black British, Caribbean or African ethnicity. At baseline, the median age was 19 years (IQR 16–22). 36 individuals experienced a total of 62 admissions which resulted in 558 overnight stays (median stay was 5 nights). One person died (lymphoma), six had TOC and one was LTFU by the end of the three-year study period. Crude incidence of admission for the whole cohort was 9.0 per 100 PY (6.9–11.6). The respective crude incidence rates were 1.5 PY (0.0–8.2) in those aged 10–14 years and 3.5 PY (1.5–7.0) in the 15–19-year-olds. In those aged 20–24 years it was 14.5 PY (10.1–20.2) and in those &gt;25 years the crude incidence rate was 11.7 PY (6.9–18.5). Factors significantly associated with admission were a CD4 lymphocyte count &lt;200 cells/uL, adjusted IRR 4.0 (1.8–8.8) and a history of a CDC-C diagnosis, adjusted IRR 2.9 (1.6–5.3). 89% admissions were HIV-related: 45% new/current CDC-C diagnoses, 76% due to infection.</p> Conclusions <p>Hospitalisation rates were four-fold higher in adults (&gt;20 years of age) compared to adolescents (10–19-year-olds). The continuing challenges experienced by PaHIV youth require enhanced multidisciplinary support throughout adulthood.</p>","author":"Sarah May Johnson","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a7967038263019561c9983f0cf1bf86e1af4d26b97b13d3263190f90a229d489","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
