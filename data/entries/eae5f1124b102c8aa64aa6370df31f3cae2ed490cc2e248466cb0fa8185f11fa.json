In 2011 through 2013, longitudinal gradients in fish assemblage were investigated in the Willamette River in western United States. Of 36,586 individual fish collected, 93% were native and 7% non-native. The best predictors of fishes collected with a boat electrofisher were percent embeddedness, macrophytes, longitudinal river distance, average depth, and velocity. Habitat type (mainstem or slough) was also a significant predictor. The best predictor of fishes collected in nearshore habitats with a backpack electrofisher were longitudinal river distance, velocity, and percent embeddedness. Fish communities differed significantly between mainstem and slough habitat. Overall, 25 of 40 species had high fidelities to mainstem or slough habitats. Native species showed a high fidelity to both mainstem and slough habitats while non-native species were significantly related only to slough habitats. Environmental characteristics strongly influenced fish assemblage structure in this large floodplain river. Maintaining and restoring mainstem and off-channel habitats are critical for maximizing native species resilience in the face of non-native species encroachment and a changing environment. Restoring the natural flow regime to the degree possible is needed to increase connectivity between the floodplain and mainstem and provide thermal and flood refuges for native fishes. Understanding habitat relationships provides essential context for fish conservation and management by resource agencies and landowners.</p>","author":"Joshua Everett Williams, \nStan Gregory, \nRandall Wildman","siteTitle":"Wiley: River Research and Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"dd8f8dcb48cf1db6f6edba43098839a842d88bad9f088e9d186fa05ae3366ba7","entryHash":"eae5f1124b102c8aa64aa6370df31f3cae2ed490cc2e248466cb0fa8185f11fa","category":"Environment"}
