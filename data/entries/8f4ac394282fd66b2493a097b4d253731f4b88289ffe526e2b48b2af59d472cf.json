{"title":"Elevated Graft-versus-Host Disease Risk Among International Stem Cell Transplant Recipients: A Pilot Study from the UAE","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2504/v1","date":1722419316000,"content":"Patients from regions without stem cell transplant (SCT) facilities often seek treatment abroad and return home for post-transplant care. While extensive data exists on GVHD and its risk factors, the prevalence of GVHD in international SCT patients returning to countries without transplant facilities, where multiple factors compromise post-transplant care, is not well documented. We screened 149 transplant recipients and analyzed data from 91 who received transplants abroad and were followed at our center from January 2019 to December 2022. This observational study used data from electronic medical records (EMR) and employed descriptive statistics, inferential tests, and relative risk calculations with forest plots to analyze GVHD prevalence and key risk factors. Of the recipients, 31.8% were residents from nine countries living in the UAE, and 67.2% were UAE citizens. Adults comprised 48.3% of the recipients, and 51.7% were pediatric. Hematological malignancies were the most common indication (49%), primarily in adults. Siblings were the majority of donors (52.6%), followed by related donors (23.09%), and unrelated donors (8.9%). Most (69.2%) received HLA-identical transplants followed by 21.9% who received haploidentical. Among adults, 62.2% developed GVHD, compared to 26% of pediatric patients. Recipients with related HLA-identical donors had a 50% GVHD prevalence, while those with unrelated identical donors had 71%. The overall GVHD prevalence was 50% among the 87.9% who received allogeneic SCTs. Despite favorable factors, GVHD prevalence remains high. Larger multicenter studies are needed to identify and assess the impact of contributing factors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f4ac394282fd66b2493a097b4d253731f4b88289ffe526e2b48b2af59d472cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
