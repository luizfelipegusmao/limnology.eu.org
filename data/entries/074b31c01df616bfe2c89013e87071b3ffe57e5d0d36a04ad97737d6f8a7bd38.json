Consequently, copper is a metal employed in various research fields, including home appliances, high-speed railway, aerospace, and others [<a href=\"#ozae044.298-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.298-B2\">2</a>]. On the other hand, color etching in copper and its alloys is not commonly studied, but it is necessary to address this knowledge gap. There are not many techniques are used to reveal the microstructure in copper alloys, but one of the most commonly used etchings is the combination of ferric chloride (FeCl<sub>3</sub>) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) [<a href=\"#ozae044.298-B3\">3</a>]. This work analyzes the effect of different etching durations at the same chemical concentration on the optical characterization of heat-treated copper samples.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"074b31c01df616bfe2c89013e87071b3ffe57e5d0d36a04ad97737d6f8a7bd38","category":"Environment"}
