{"title":"COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy among Health Providers at Kenyatta National Teaching and Referral Hospital Nairobi-Kenya","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1373/v1","date":1721196788000,"content":"Understanding HCPs COVID-19 vaccine concerns can provide critical insights to optimize success of the vaccine rollout program as they are a trusted source of health information to patients and the general population. We sought to understand reasons for health care providersâ€™ COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Kenyatta National teaching and referral Hospital. From April to July 2021, we interviewed 60 HCPs purposively sampled from the Infectious Disease Unit (IDU) (n=20) and other departments (n=40). We analyzed data using inductive and deductive approaches to understand reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. The HCPs had a median age of 37 years, (Interquartile range: [IQR 20.0-58.0]), 57% were female, 30% nurses among other cadres. Most HCPs cited low confidence in the vaccine such as mistrust in healthcare system and government, vaccine safety and efficacy concerns. Constraints such as uncertainty about the second vaccine dose availability, and misinformation caused hesitancy. Further, few were reluctant receiving the vaccine because of perceived herd immunity from a recent COVID-19 infection, and the need for more information before deciding. The study highlights the need to address any misinformation about vaccines safety and efficacy, and ensure accurate information is easily accessible to HCPs which can translate to higher vaccine uptake.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"74624e7b671cca7ad4b2d1a8e067e92e5e76de0541c98df2bfee071a8a2f3b2a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
