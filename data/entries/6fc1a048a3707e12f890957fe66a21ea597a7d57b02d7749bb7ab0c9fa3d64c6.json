{"title":"Hydro-acoustic classification and abundance estimation of mesopelagic fish in deep scattering layers (DSL) of the Indian Ocean","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/7/1330/7624345?rss=1","date":1709856000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Deep scattering layers (DSL) in oligotrophic systems are typically comprised of a variety of coexisting organisms, including fish, zooplankton, jellyfish, and squid, and hence there is uncertainty about the proportion of the acoustic backscatter in these layers that can be attributed to mesopelagic fish. Here, acoustic targets were classified using a multi-frequency acoustic classification algorithm based on data collected in the Indian Ocean at 18, 38, 70, and 120 kHz during three acoustic surveys in 2018. Frequency-dependent backscattering strength information (∆S<sub>v</sub>) was extracted from acoustic data that coincided with trawl hauls dominated by mesopelagic fish. Five ∆S<sub>v</sub> frequency pairs were used to separate the acoustic backscattering into three broad scattering categories, i.e. mesopelagic fish, crustacean-like/tunicates, and squids/others. Results indicated that the DSL is highly diverse and dominated by mesopelagic fish, with average densities at a regional scale ranging from 12.0 (±10.9) to 26.0 (±21.7) g m<sup>−2</sup>, and proportions of the acoustic backscatter attributed to mesopelagic fish ranging from 0.5 to 0.7. These estimates are generally lower than previously estimated for other regions of the Indian Ocean. The situation may well be similar elsewhere, particularly in oligotrophic systems, with potential ramifications for global mesopelagic fish biomass estimates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"6fc1a048a3707e12f890957fe66a21ea597a7d57b02d7749bb7ab0c9fa3d64c6","category":"Environment"}
