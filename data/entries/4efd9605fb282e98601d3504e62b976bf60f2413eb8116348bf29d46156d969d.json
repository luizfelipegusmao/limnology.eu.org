However, the consequences of this scenario for soil ecosystem multifunctionality (SMF) in forests are poorly understood. Here, we conducted a long-term field experiment in a temperate forest in China, where N deposition was simulated by adding N above and under the canopies. We discover that canopy N addition promotes SMF expression, whereas understory N addition suppresses it. SMF was regulated by fungal diversity in canopy N addition treatments, which is largely due to the strong resistance to soil acidification and efficient resource utilization characteristics of fungi. While in understory N addition treatments, SMF is regulated by bacterial diversity, which is mainly because of the strong resilience to disturbances and fast turnover of bacteria. Furthermore, rare microbial taxa may play a more important role in the maintenance of the SMF. This study provides the first evidence that N deposition enhanced SMF in temperate forests and enriches the knowledge on enhanced N deposition affecting forest ecosystems. Given the divergent results from two N addition approaches, an innovative perspective of canopy N addition on soil microbial diversity-multifunctionality relationships is crucial to policy-making for the conservation of soil microbial diversity and sustainable ecosystem management under enhanced N deposition. In future research, the consideration of canopy N processes is essential for more realistic assessments of the effects of atmospheric N deposition in forests.</p>","author":"An Yang, \nDong Zhu, \nWeixin Zhang, \nYuanhu Shao, \nYu Shi, \nXu Liu, \nZiluo Lu, \nYong‚ÄêGuan Zhu, \nHongtao Wang, \nShenglei Fu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"4efd9605fb282e98601d3504e62b976bf60f2413eb8116348bf29d46156d969d","category":"Environment"}
