{"title":"232 Evaluation of a phytogenic feed additive with essential oils and plant extracts on growth performance in single sourced steer calves fed a forage-based diet during the initial 53 d receiving period","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/213/7665029?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The receiving period of a feedlot calf is one of the most stressful stages in the life of that animal and can result in respiratory disease caused, in part, by reduced feed intake and transit stress. Feeding a phytomolecule compound in combination with current therapeutic strategies may aid in controlling systemic inflammation and improve the performance of newly received calves. This study determined whether a phytogenic feed additive with essential oils and plant extracts (PFA) influences measures of growth and growth efficiency during the feedlot receiving phase. The two treatments were a control group fed no additive (CON) and a treatment group fed PFA additive at a rate of 0.25 g/45.4 kg of body weight (BW; PFA). Steers were transported 285 km from an auction facility to the Ruminant Nutrition Center in Brookings, SD where they were vaccinated against viral respiratory diseases and clostridial species, and administered pour-on anthelmintic. Steers were divided into 10 replicate pens of 8 steers (305 ± 30 kg) per treatment (n = 160 steers) in a randomized complete block design. The steers were fed a basal diet [dry matter (DM) basis] containing corn silage (74%), DDGS (21%), a liquid supplement (5%), and monensin sodium (Rumensin-90, Elanco Animal Health) at 25 g/907 kg (DM basis) for 53 d. Steers were fed 2X daily with intakes closely managed for the first 14 d during adaptation to the receiving diet then a slick bunk management strategy was applied for the remainder of the study. No mortality was observed in this study, and one steer was treated for respiratory disease from the CON group. There were no significant differences observed in BW, average daily gain (ADG), variation in ADG, dry matter intake, or feed conversion efficiency from d 1 to 29, 29 to 53, or during the cumulative receiving period (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.11) between the CON and PFA groups. NE<sub>m</sub> and NE<sub>g</sub> did not differ between the treatments (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.79). The ratio of observed-to-expected dietary net energy was also not affected by dietary treatment (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.71). The steers used in this study were in good health and had minimal morbidity (0.63%) with no mortality during the 53-d receiving study which contributed to the feed additive having no appreciable influence on the growth and health outcomes in this study.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"811e7a9f0d95be30d1ce4e22d3769e819f613fa21fe261ebfd1816945736a4b6","category":"Environment"}
