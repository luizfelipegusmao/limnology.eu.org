{"title":"Solar-Powered Microgrids for Rural Electrification: Techno-Economic Analysis and Social Impact","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0092/v1","date":1722582389000,"content":"The transition to renewable energy sources is critical for sustainable development, particularly in rural regions with limited access to electricity. Solar-powered microgrids offer a promising solution for rural electrification by providing reliable, clean energy that can enhance economic opportunities and improve quality of life. This paper presents a techno-economic analysis of solar-powered microgrids for rural areas, evaluating their feasibility, costs, and benefits. The analysis encompasses technological aspects, such as solar panel efficiency, battery storage, and grid management, alongside economic factors including initial investment, maintenance costs, and potential returns. Additionally, the study assesses the social impact of solar-powered microgrids, exploring their effects on local communities, including improvements in education, health, and economic activities. The findings indicate that solar microgrids can be a viable and impactful solution for rural electrification, with significant long-term benefits for both economic development and social well-being.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8df6bd4ddc7c77118367f9235d31044733a8ff6aeb91556137180d4c3366825f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
