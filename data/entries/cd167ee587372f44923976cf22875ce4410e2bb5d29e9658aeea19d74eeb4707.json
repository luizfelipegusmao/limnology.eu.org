{"title":"Assessing Overall Performance of Sports Clubs and Decomposing into Their On-Field and Off-Field Efficiency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1398/v1","date":1729177948000,"content":"Generally playing group management performance and financial management performance of sports clubs are assessed separately. We adopt a non-parametric methodology to assess overall performance first conceptualising overall management as a production process comprising of two serially-linked subprocesses; playing group management and financial management. Thereafter, we decompose overall performance to obtain estimates of performance at the subprocess level. Through this procedure it is possible to determine whether it is a sports clubâ€™s on-field performance or off-field performance or both may contribute towards its inefficiency, if any, in overall management. Further, a model is developed to determine targets for inefficient clubs to become overall efficient. The method is applied to 18 clubs in Australian rules football league. In 2021 season, the results reveal that on-field performance, on average, is better than off-field performance and variability in off-field performance is higher than that of on-field performance. Observed overall management inefficiency is mainly due to inefficiency in financial management. Results are robust to weighting scheme adopted in overall efficiency configuration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd167ee587372f44923976cf22875ce4410e2bb5d29e9658aeea19d74eeb4707","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
