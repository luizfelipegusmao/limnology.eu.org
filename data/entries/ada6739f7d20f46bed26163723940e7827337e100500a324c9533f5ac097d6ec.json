{"title":"Harmonizing Heartbeats: The Mosaic of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Responders  — A Comprehensive Exploration of Diverse Criteria and Predictors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0116/v1","date":1719849145000,"content":"Background: Heart failure (HF) remains a challenging healthcare issue, necessitating innovative therapies like cardiac resynchronization-defibrillation therapy (CRT-D). However, defining CRT-D responders lacks uniformity, impeding effective clinical evaluation. This study explores diverse CRT-D responder definitions, encompassing functional, echocardiographic, and laboratory criteria.\n\nMaterials &amp; Methods: A single-center study involving 132 CRT-D patients scrutinized responder criteria, including NYHA stage, LVEF increase, and proBNP decrease. Statistical analyses, such as Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox hazard regression, were employed to evaluate responder characteristics and survival outcomes.\n\nResults: Responder rates varied across criteria, revealing nuanced patient profiles. CRT-D responders, defined by NYHA decrease, LVEF increase, or proBNP decrease, exhibit improved survival rates after 2 and 3 years (p &lt; 0.050). Young age, absence of recent myocardial infarction, and normal right ventricular, echocardiographic parameters emerge as predictors for positive response. In part, drug-based HF therapy correlates with increased responder rates. Cox regression identified LVEF ≥ 5% and proBNP decrease ≥ 25% as independent predictors of extended survival.\n\nConclusions: CRT-D responder definitions exhibit considerable variability, emphasizing the need for a nuanced, patient-centered approach. Factors like right ventricular function, drug therapy, atrial fibrillation, and renal function influence responses. The study enriches our understanding of CRT-D response, contributing to the foundation for personalized HF management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ada6739f7d20f46bed26163723940e7827337e100500a324c9533f5ac097d6ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
