{"title":"Design and Initial Tests of a Fast Neutron Radiography Detector Prototype with Sipm Readout","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1362/v1","date":1713669698000,"content":"Abstract: Development of the fast neutron radiography with higher penetration capability in Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques is rapidly. The detection efficiency and the imaging spatial resolution are the main problem of the radiography detector for many fast neutron imaging systems. In this paper, a detector composed of pixelated EJ200 scintillator array，an 16 × 16 silicon-photomultipliers (SiPM) array, and a capacitive multiplexing network readout electronics is designed. Using Monte-Carlo simulations，the main parameters of the detector was optimization. Then the detector prototype was fabricated and tested at a 14 MeV D-T neutron source. The preliminary test results showed that the prototype has spatial resolution of 1.26 mm. Using pixelated scintillator structure，the conflict between spatial resolution and detect efficiency could improved. Moreover, SiPMs offer a flexibility for the expansion of application field of the imaging system due to their excellent photon detection performance, relatively low price and joint possibility for large area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92497427466139ea41694a34a22bf0bd8e23c851a840db8be0031b4b302ed54a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
