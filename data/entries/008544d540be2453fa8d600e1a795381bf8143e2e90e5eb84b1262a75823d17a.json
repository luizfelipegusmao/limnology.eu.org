{"title":"Bank Retreat Mechanisms Driven by Debris Flow Surges: A Parameterized Model Based on the Results of Physical Experiments","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036914?af=R","date":1721458800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Lateral erosion is a critical factor that influences the formation and amplification of debris flows. However, our understanding of the bank retreat process in debris flow channels is limited, which limits the evaluation of debris flow magnitudes and the prediction of their activity trends. Herein, we conduct physical experiments to investigate bank retreat mechanisms using five types of bank soil and multiple debris flow surges. The bank retreat process is categorized into two stages: toe cutting and bank collapse. Toe cutting is mainly caused by hydraulic erosion, bank collapse includes gravity erosion in the form of toppling failure. Notably, the bank retreat process exhibits a significant negative feedback loop. Bank erosion widens the channel bed, subsequently decreasing the flow depth. In turn, this reduction in flow depth mitigates bank erosion. Moreover, we discover a concise pattern in the complex coupling of hydraulic erosion and toppling failure: erosion efficiency is linearly and negatively correlated with the bed widening width. We develop a new parameterized model for describing the bank retreat process and provided empirical values for the model parameters. Furthermore, we observe that the initial erosion efficiency first increases and then decreases with an increase in the fine particle content of the bank soil. Additionally, we report a negative correlation between the maximum bed widening width and the fine particle content in the bank soil that follows a power function relationship.</p>","author":"Xi'an Wang, \nJiangang Chen, \nXiaoqing Chen, \nHuayong Chen, \nWanyu Zhao, \nHechun Ruan, \nJinshui Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"008544d540be2453fa8d600e1a795381bf8143e2e90e5eb84b1262a75823d17a","category":"Environment"}
