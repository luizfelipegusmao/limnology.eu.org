{"title":"Reduction in the incidence of cognitive impairment and related costs through an innovative health awareness programme in rural Japan","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311826","date":1728914400000,"content":"<p>by Ayako Shoji, Kenichi Kudo, Koichi Murashita, Shigeyuki Nakaji, Ataru Igarashi</p>\r\nObjectives <p>This study examined the impact of the Center of Healthy Aging Program (CHAP) on the cognitive function and economic burden associated with dementia.</p> Methods <p>This observational study utilised Iwaki cohort data. We included participants with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores and categorised them into pre- and post-CHAP groups based on their year of entry into the cohort (before 2013 or after) (index year). We defined participants with suspected severe cognitive impairment and suspected mild cognitive impairment using their MMSE scores, with their incidence being the first observation meeting these definitions during the follow-up period. We compared the incidence rates between the pre- and post-CHAP groups using Cox proportional hazard analysis. Medical and caregiving costs were estimated based on the projected number of residents in Iwaki area with suspected mild cognitive impairment and sSCI during hypothetical 10 years of the CHAP implemented or not and compared.</p> Results <p>Of the 2,569 participants, 1716 and 853 were included in the pre- and post-CHAP groups, respectively. The incidence rate of suspected mild cognitive impairment was significantly lower in the post-CHAP group even after adjusted known factors associated with cognitive disorders. No cases of suspected severe cognitive impairment occurred in the post-CHAP group during the follow-up period. Estimated costs of JPY 1,628,450 (USD 11562.00 or EUR 10259.24, JPY 100  =  USD 0.71 or EUR 0.63) and JPY 789,560 (USD 5605.88 or EUR 4974.23) per person per year were projected after 10 years with and without the CHAP, respectively.</p> Conclusions <p>We demonstrated a reduction in the incidence rate of suspected mild cognitive impairment among residents who participated in the CHAP and a decrease in the medical and caregiving costs associated with suspected severe cognitive impairment.</p>","author":"Ayako Shoji","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"75ff4464196a1d2dda03856e2e30a3f69cc9c1667d04e9da117645709192f1dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
