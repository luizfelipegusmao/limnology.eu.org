{"title":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK parents’ attitudes towards routine childhood vaccines: A mixed-methods study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306484","date":1723557600000,"content":"<p>by Helen Skirrow, Celine Lewis, Habiba Haque, Lena Choundary-Salter, Kim Foley, Elizabeth Whittaker, Ceire Costelloe, Helen Bedford, Sonia Saxena</p>\r\nBackground <p>COVID-19 vaccines were key to controlling the pandemic and vaccination has been discussed extensively by the media and the public since 2020. We aimed to explore parents’ attitudes towards routine childhood vaccination since COVID-19 and how the pandemic impacted their experiences of getting their child vaccinated.</p> Methods <p>We used a mixed-methods approach—involving a questionnaire survey followed by focus groups. We partnered with The Mosaic Community Trust, an ethnic minority women’s group based in a deprived area of North-West London, United Kingdom (UK) with historically low childhood vaccine uptake. Descriptive findings from the questionnaires were reported and chi-square analyses performed to examine differences by ethnicity. Thematic analysis of the free-text questionnaire responses and focus groups was undertaken, guided by the COM-B model of Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation.</p> Results <p>Between Jun-Oct 2022, 518 parents completed the questionnaire (25% from ethnic minorities). Between March-May 2023 we held four focus groups with 22 parents (45% from ethnic minorities). Most parents (&gt;90%) thought routine childhood vaccines for children were important. Over a third (38%) of all parents reported having more questions about childhood vaccines since COVID-19, though among parents belonging to an ethnicity group other than white, 59% said they had more questions compared to those of any white ethnicity group (30%, (p = &lt;0.0001)). Difficulties accessing vaccine appointments were commoner reasons for children’s vaccinations being delayed than parents increased concerns about vaccines. Since COVID-19 some parents felt vaccinations were even more important, and a very small minority felt the pandemic had made them mistrust vaccinations.</p> Conclusion <p>Following COVID-19, we found parents remain confident in childhood vaccines. However, some parents, particularly from ethnic minority groups may have more questions about childhood vaccines than pre-pandemic. Post COVID-19, to address declining vaccine uptake, parents need easy access to healthcare professionals to answer questions about childhood vaccinations.</p>","author":"Helen Skirrow","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1aad5d2e06b3f07f7248a6de5a3c4e8012f2fa3fab0316101828492009ab6fa0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
