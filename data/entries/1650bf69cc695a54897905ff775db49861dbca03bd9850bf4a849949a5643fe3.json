{"title":"Exploring hidden diversity: Molecular insights into the Leporinus species of the rivers of the Brazilian states of Maranhão and Piauí","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15753?af=R","date":1712648018000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The present study delved into the world of hidden diversity by examining specimens identified as <i>Leporinus piau</i> from the river basins of the northern Brazilian states of Maranhão and Piauí. Using genetic analyses that combined data from three mitochondrial markers and one nuclear marker, the study identified two well-supported groups, reinforcing the findings of previous publications. The first group, found in samples from the Itapecuru, Mearim, Turiaçu, and Pericumã basins, in Maranhão, appears to represent a relatively ancient diversification and the possibility of concealed cryptic diversity. The second group, comprising specimens from the Parnaíba (Piauí) and Mearim (Maranhão) basins, appears to have resulted from a more recent process of diversification and has a close relationship with <i>Leporinus friderici</i> from the type locality. Our findings not only confirm the existence of a complex scenario of cryptic diversity in the genus <i>Leporinus</i> from the study basins but also underscore the taxonomic inconsistencies within this group of fish. This study offers a comprehensive analysis of the species diversity of the Maranhão and Piauí basins, which are critical regions for the conservation of Amazonian fish, providing valuable insights for the sustainable management and conservation of these fish.</p>","author":"Maria Histelle Sousa Nascimento, \nJosé Luis Olivan Birindelli, \nElmary Fraga, \nMaria Claudene Barros","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"1650bf69cc695a54897905ff775db49861dbca03bd9850bf4a849949a5643fe3","category":"Environment"}
