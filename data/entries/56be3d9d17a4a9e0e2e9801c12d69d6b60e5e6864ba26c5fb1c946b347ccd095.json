{"title":"Wastewater Genomic Surveillance to Track Infectious Disease-Causing Pathogens in Agadir and Inezgane Cities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0800/v1","date":1723512262000,"content":"Wastewater genomic surveillance is an efficient and economic approach to track infectious diseases and can help detect unusual epidemiological events. The current study uses this approach for the first time in Morocco to monitor the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A, B and RSV virus infections during the third wave of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant. The virome was concentrated from wastewater collected from two sewer sheds of two cities, Agadir and Inezgane, using the PEG/NaCl method. The viral copy number was determined using qRT-PCR. All 26 samples in both cities were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at various viral loads. For Influenza A virus, two samples were tested positive in Inezgane. The estimated SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA copy numbers observed were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals using the SEIR model. The number of viral copies of SARS-CoV-2 for Agadir and Inezgane varied from 82932 ± 15479 to 507865 ± 58759 copies/L and 61244 ± 8552 to 497506 ± 18061 copies/L, respectively. The estimated number of cases correlates positively with the number of reported cases. Next Generation Sequencing showed that samples contain the following two variants: BA.1 and BA.2 that have been detected in clinical samples. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of wastewater genomic surveillance in monitoring pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 in Morocco.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56be3d9d17a4a9e0e2e9801c12d69d6b60e5e6864ba26c5fb1c946b347ccd095","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
