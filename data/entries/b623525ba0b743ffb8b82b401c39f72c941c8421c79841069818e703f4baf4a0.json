This study compares the effectiveness of central-stimulation (tDCS) and peripheral-stimulation (TENS) in pain-inhibition during a cognitive-task in healthy volunteers and to observe potential neuro-cognitive improvements. Healthy eighty volunteers went through a complete experimental protocol comprising pain-induction (CPT), administration of tDCS/TENS, EEG-data acquisition, and cognitive assessments. The protocol for this study is categorized into 04-groups: G1(Control), G2(TENS), G3(Anodal-tDCS), and G4(Cathodal-tDCS).
