{"title":"Xenoestrogen concentration in women with endometriosis or leiomyomas: A case-control study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304766","date":1717509600000,"content":"<p>by Victoria Valdes-Devesa, David Sanz-Rosa, Israel J. Thuissard-Vasallo, Cristina Andreu-Vázquez, Ricardo Sainz de la Cuesta</p>\r\nBackground <p>Xenoestrogens are synthetic or naturally occurring chemicals capable of altering the endocrine system of humans and animals owing to their molecular similarity to endogenous hormones. There is limited data regarding their effects on women´s health. Chronic exposure to xenoestrogens can promote the development of estrogen-related diseases.</p> Objectives <p>To examine xenoestrogen concentration (TEXB-α) differences between women with leiomyomas or endometriosis and control women, and to study the relationship between the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of these patients and their xenoestrogen levels.</p> Methods <p>Prospective case-control study. We selected 221 women who underwent surgery at Quironsalud Madrid University Hospital between 2017 and 2021. The cases included 117 patients: 74 women who underwent surgery for uterine leiomyomas, 21 with endometriosis, and 22 with both pathologies. The control group comprised 104 healthy women who underwent surgical procedures for other reasons. TEXB-α was determined in the omental fat of all patients. Using a questionnaire and reviewing the patients’ medical records, we collected sociodemographic data and other relevant variables.</p> Results <p>A significant majority of study participants (68.8%) had detectable levels of xenoestrogens. We found no association between TEXB-α levels in omental fat and the presence of myomas or endometriosis. In the case group, women living or working in Madrid Community exhibited, on average, 3.12 Eeq pM/g higher levels of TEXB-α compared to those working in other areas (p = 0.030). Women who referred to the use of estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives had, on average, 3.02 Eeq pM/g higher levels of TEXB-α than those who had never used them (p = 0.022).</p> Conclusions <p>This study found no association between omental xenoestrogen levels and leiomyomas or endometriosis. However, their presence in most participants and their association with highly polluted areas emphasizes the importance of limiting environmental exposure to these substances. We also identified an association between hormonal contraceptive use and xenoestrogen concentration.</p>","author":"Victoria Valdes-Devesa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2d7dee9ea6630afb5c4c527f54046c9a4a9ab8f1a214a21722f70d394588f773","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
