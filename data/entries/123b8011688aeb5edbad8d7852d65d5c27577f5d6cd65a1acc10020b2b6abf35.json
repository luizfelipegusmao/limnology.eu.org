Fluid flow models are typically solved numerically by addressing a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) using methods such as finite difference and finite volume. However, these processes can be computationally demanding, particularly when aiming for high precision on a fine scale. Researchers have increasingly turned to machine learning to explore solutions for PDEs in order to improve simulation efficiency. The proposed method combines an adaptive multi-scale strategy with generative adversarial networks (GAN) to increase simulation efficiency on a fine scale. The devised model, called simulation enhancement GAN (SE-GAN), takes coarse-scale simulation results as input and generates fine-scale results in conjunction with the provided petrophysical properties. With this new approach, a deep learning model is trained to map coarse-scale results to fine-scale outcomes, rather than directly solving the fluid flow model. Case studies reveal that SE-GAN can achieve a significant improvement in accuracy while reducing computational time compared to the original fine-scale simulation solver. A comprehensive evaluation of numerical experiments is conducted to elucidate the benefits and limitations of this method. The potential of SE-GAN in accelerating the numerical solver for reservoir simulations is also demonstrated.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"123b8011688aeb5edbad8d7852d65d5c27577f5d6cd65a1acc10020b2b6abf35","category":"Environment"}
