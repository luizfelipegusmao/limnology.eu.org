{"title":"Anionic Hydrogels from Date Palm Waste for Dye Adsorption in Wastewater Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1464/v1","date":1716425734000,"content":"This work aimed to develop an anionic cellulose nanofiber (CNF) bio-adsorbent from palm date tree waste and to investigate its removal efficiency against cationic methylene blue dye from contaminated water. Palm date pulp was first prepared from palm date leaves through acid hydrolysis using H2SO4, followed by hydrolysis in a basic medium using KOH, in which the process completely removed the components of hemicellulose, lignin, and silica. To obtain anionic CNF, the resulting pulp was further treated with H2SO4, followed by centrifugation. Biogel formation of the CNF suspension was promoted by sonication, where its removal efficiency of methylene blue dye was studied as a function of dye concentration, temperature, contact time, and pH value. Two equilibrium models, the Langmuir and Freundlich models were employed, and the Langmuir model was found to be consistent with the experimental data. The highest removal efficiency was obtained at 60oC and was 5mg/gm. Furthermore, several kinetic models were used to gain insight into the adsorption mechanism. The pseudo-second-order model provided an accurate description of the adsorption process, while the Elovich equation suggested a chemical reaction between methylene blue dye and CNF. The studyâ€™s findings were in agreement with the pseudo-second-order model, indicating general chemical reactions. The study indicates that CNF adsorbents derived from renewable natural waste sources such as palm date leaves can be effective in removing cationic contaminants such as methylene blue dye.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3d37e9369eee0ad3a538de85f1b9054e1bd4585d4a1e0256d3d9c3c9598331b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
