{"title":"Nemafric-BL Phytonematicide Induces Isoprenylation and Farneslation in Guava Root-Knot Nematode, Meloidogyne enterolobii: Mechanism of Cucurbitacin-Cuticle Interaction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1512/v1","date":1711454958000,"content":"Cucurbitacin phytonematicides consistently suppress population densities of plant nematodes, but have no effect against bacteria, fungi and insects. This study investigates the mechanism through which cucurbitacin phytonematicides consistently exert nematicidal properties on nematodes. Post 72-h exposure of second-stage juveniles (J2) of Meloidogyne enterolobii to geometric concentration of Nemafric-BL phytonematicide, J2 total proteins were measured using TruspecCHNS Macro. Total proteins versus phytonematicide exhibited a negative quadratic relation (R2 = 0.97), with the minimum total proteins achieved at x = 4.9% phytonematicide. Beyond the minimum, total proteins increased gradually, depicting the existence of both isoprenylation (breakdown) and farnesylation (biosynthesis) of total proteins. In conclusion, cucurbitacins and nematode cuticles are both chemically structured, which provides the mechanism through which the test chemicals consistently decrease population densities of plant nematodes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8fa43d6b68dc6b5b648360c445d41adf845bb8a1803c913fd9f9c0058df482cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
