{"title":"From Powder to Structure: Multi-Dimensional Electron Diffraction to Enhance Small Molecule Pharmaceutical Formulation Characterization and Development","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.454/7719708?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Drug products often make use of formulation technologies such as amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) to overcome solubility and bioavailability challenges associated with many active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). In an ASD, an API is held within an amorphous water-soluble polymer excipient in a solid dispersion. ASDs may experience storage life complications caused by the unwanted crystallisation of the API which negatively affects the dissolution performance of the drug [<a href=\"#ozae044.454-B1\">1</a>]. In industry, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) is often used to assess and measure crystallinity. This bulk technique fails to probe the sample on the nanoscale, describing only the average structures at play locally. However, nanoscale structural information, for example the crystallisation of unexpected polymorphs or impurities, may control critical material attributes of a drug product such as solubility.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a46f4aea7bb370a7769f5e980006a1b5b134cb01ac9595a13587da0252b934b7","category":"Environment"}
