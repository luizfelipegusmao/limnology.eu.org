{"title":"New insights into plant autophagy: molecular mechanisms and roles in development and stress responses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/5/1234/7426994?rss=1","date":1700265600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic intracellular degradation process. Although the molecular mechanisms of plant autophagy share similarities with those in yeast and mammals, certain unique mechanisms have been identified. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of autophagy during vegetative growth stages as well as in plant-specific developmental processes, such as seed development, germination, flowering, and somatic reprogramming. Autophagy enables plants to adapt to and manage severe environmental conditions, such as nutrient starvation, high-intensity light stress, and heat stress, leading to intracellular remodeling and physiological changes in response to stress. In the past, plant autophagy research lagged behind similar studies in yeast and mammals; however, recent advances have greatly expanded our understanding of plant-specific autophagy mechanisms and functions. This review summarizes current knowledge and latest research findings on the mechanisms and roles of plant autophagy with the objective of improving our understanding of this vital process in plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"e8eb0bda4cb44d9a98a17afb9ede9a56bc7e1d69b30b7d83f3d8ae86b450ba2d","category":"Environment"}
