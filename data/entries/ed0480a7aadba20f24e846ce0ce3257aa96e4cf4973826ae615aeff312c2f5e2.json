This article discusses the development of a POS application designed to simplify the process of selling products in stores. The application uses PHP for the server, JavaScript for the client, Bootstrap for responsive design, and MySQL as the database. Its main features include a dashboard with daily sales summary, visual graphs, product category management, product addition and editing, admin and access rights management, ease of sales transaction processing, access to sales reports and analyses by leaders, and provision of sales reports in various formats. The clean and easy-to-use interface is expected to improve the efficiency of sales and inventory management, and assist businesses in making data-driven decisions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed0480a7aadba20f24e846ce0ce3257aa96e4cf4973826ae615aeff312c2f5e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
