{"title":"Charting the evolutionary path of the SUMO modification system in plants reveals molecular hardwiring of development to stress adaptation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3131/7699766?rss=1","date":1719360000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>SUMO modification is part of the spectrum of Ubiquitin-like (UBL) systems that give rise to proteoform complexity through post-translational modifications (PTMs). Proteoforms are essential modifiers of cell signaling for plant adaptation to changing environments. Exploration of the evolutionary emergence of Ubiquitin-like (UBL) systems unveils their origin from prokaryotes, where it is linked to the mechanisms that enable sulfur uptake into biomolecules. We explore the emergence of the SUMO machinery across the plant lineage from single-cell to land plants. We reveal the evolutionary point at which plants acquired the ability to form SUMO chains through the emergence of SUMO E4 ligases, hinting at its role in facilitating multicellularity. Additionally, we explore the possible mechanism for the neofunctionalization of SUMO proteases through the fusion of conserved catalytic domains with divergent sequences. We highlight the pivotal role of SUMO proteases in plant development and adaptation, offering new insights into target specificity mechanisms of SUMO modification during plant evolution. Correlating the emergence of adaptive traits in the plant lineage with established experimental evidence for SUMO in developmental processes, we propose that SUMO modification has evolved to link developmental processes to adaptive functions in land plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"f79f26097a20bf964cd504493bdaf1b21ed33e03dc6a778562f625158ab90864","category":"Environment"}
