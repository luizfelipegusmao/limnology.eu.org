{"title":"Associated Complementary Dual and Quantum Codes of Skew Constacyclic Codes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1716/v1","date":1729764440000,"content":"Consider the ring Be=Fq+uFq+⋯+ue−1Fq, ue=u (e≥2), where Fq denotes the finite field having q=pm elements (for m≥1 and a prime p), and q≡1(mode−1). Skew constacyclic codes over Be are studied in this paper. We present their generator polynomial and describe the criteria for their complementary duality. Moreover, we derive criteria for these codes to contain their dual and obtain quantum codes. Additionally, we establish a Gray map that preserves duality and investigate its properties. We also take into account additive skew constacyclic codes for this purpose and also derive criteria for the complementary duality of these codes. Finally, we provide several LCD and quantum codes (MDS/ near MDS). The latter are compared with the quantum codes obtained in the recent literature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa3ba444502b1ae04c4ae02491810b8e2ad9999048f18092c4b2445c4e126e47","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
