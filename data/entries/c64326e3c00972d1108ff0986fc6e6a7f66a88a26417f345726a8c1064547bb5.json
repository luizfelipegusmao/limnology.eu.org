In this study, through single-cell sequencing, we identified eight cell subpopulations in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Redimensional clustering of epithelial cells, myeloid cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) revealed heterogeneity in the TME of PAC. Intercellular communication analysis showed strong direct interactions between matrix CAFs, inflammatory CAFs, and epithelial cells. Additionally, we found that the SPP1-associated pathway was activated in monocytes, whereas the vascular endothelial growth factor-associated pathway was activated in epithelial cells. These results improve the understanding of the TME of pancreatic cancer and provide a foundation for further studies on intratumoral heterogeneity. In addition, differentially expressed gene secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) was identified in pancreatic cancer, and functional experiments showed that SLPI had a strong impact on cell viability and apoptosis, which offers a potential therapy target for pancreatic cancer.</p>","author":"Bolun Ai, \nYicheng Liang, \nTao Yan, \nYangyang Lei","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"c64326e3c00972d1108ff0986fc6e6a7f66a88a26417f345726a8c1064547bb5","category":"Environment"}
