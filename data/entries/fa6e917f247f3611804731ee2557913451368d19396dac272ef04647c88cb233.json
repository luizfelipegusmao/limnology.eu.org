{"title":"Policy Instruments Fostering Site Level Application of Circular Practices in Construction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1646/v1","date":1719225331000,"content":"One of the most pursued predicaments in the recent past is the slowness in transmuting circular practices. In the hope for many apparent advantages, construction firms have been attempting to embrace circularity oriented functions, thus controlling its negativities, to the extent where possible. However, many of these are futile attempts that have been made ad-hoc without having validated policy instruments intact. Only a few studies have taken an overarching approach to address this matter and effectively inculcate circularity at construction sites. This article is aimed to fill this knowledge gap by introducing a structured outline resulting in 9 policy categories and over 100 policy instruments. Developed from a review of 90 studies selected from Google scholar platform and 16 policy documents essentially contributed by eminent research groups, these policy instruments were subsequently validated in a series of 18 semi-structured interviews with experts and industry personnel having international exposure in large scale construction projects. This study provides over 150 practical examples scaffolding circularity as a noble cause. Of a practical insight, a fundamental reconfiguration of site operations deem indispensable.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa6e917f247f3611804731ee2557913451368d19396dac272ef04647c88cb233","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
