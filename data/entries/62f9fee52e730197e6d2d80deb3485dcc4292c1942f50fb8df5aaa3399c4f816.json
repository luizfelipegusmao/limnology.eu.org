{"title":"Key Researchers: Structural Evolution of Co-Author Networks in Single-Balloon Enteroscopy (2000-2023)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0230/v1","date":1725418496000,"content":"Aim: This study aims to analyze the evolution of co-author networks in Single-Balloon Enteroscope (SBE) research from 2000 to 2023, using data from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection. The objective is to provide a structural overview of researcher collaborations in this specialized field, highlighting key contributors and the impact of international cooperation. Method: I conducted a co-author network analysis on 149 SBE-related articles indexed in the WoS Core Collection between 2000 and 2023. Using Python (Version 3.10.5) within the PyCharm development environment (Software Version 2022.1.3), I assessed macro-level indicators including network density, clustering coefficient, number of components, and average distance. Micro-level indicators such as degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality were also evaluated to understand the roles of individual researchers in the network.Result: The analysis revealed that the co-author networks in SBE research have evolved over the studied period, with varying degrees of connectivity and collaboration. From 2000 to 2009, the network showed moderate clustering but high fragmentation, with a few key researchers like Nista, Enrico C., and Spada, Cristiano playing central roles. In the 2010-2019 period, network density decreased, indicating expansion in the author pool but less frequent co-authorships. However, the clustering coefficient remained high, suggesting localized collaboration. Central figures such as Itoi, Takao emerged as influential in bridging network gaps. In the most recent period (2020-2023), network density moderately increased, reflecting improved collaboration. Key contributors included Tanisaka, Yuki, and Ryozawa, Shomei, who enhanced connectivity within the network. Despite these advancements, the network remained fragmented with isolated components throughout all periods. Conclusion: The co-author networks in SBE research have shown an overall increase in collaboration over the past two decades, with key contributors playing pivotal roles in connecting disparate groups. However, the persistent fragmentation suggests a need for more integrated efforts to enhance international collaboration. Understanding these network dynamics can inform future strategies for fostering global cooperation and advancing SBE research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62f9fee52e730197e6d2d80deb3485dcc4292c1942f50fb8df5aaa3399c4f816","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
