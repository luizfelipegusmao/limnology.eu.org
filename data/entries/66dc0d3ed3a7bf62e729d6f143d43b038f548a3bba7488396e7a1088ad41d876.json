{"title":"A Screen-Printed Voltammetric Sensor Modified with Electropolymerized Molecularly Imprinted Polymer (eMIP) to Determine Gallic Acid in Non-alcoholic and Alcoholic Beverages.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0761/v1","date":1710310257000,"content":"The method for quantitative analysis is based on the direct measurement of the analyte using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), exploiting its oxidation peak. Calibration curves are set up to evaluate the figures of merit of the analytical method (LOD, LOQ, linear range). The application of the sensor for the dosing of GA in real matrices is carried out by analyzing non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages and comparing the results with those reported in the literature and with the content of total polyphenols determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. In all cases, concentrations of GA align with those previously found in the literature for the beverages examined. Moreover, the values are always lower than the total polyphenols content; this demonstrates the good selectivity of the sensor that can discriminate the target molecule from other polyphenols present.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"66dc0d3ed3a7bf62e729d6f143d43b038f548a3bba7488396e7a1088ad41d876","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
