{"title":"Hybrid Isentropic Twin Stars","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1691/v1","date":1719268231000,"content":"We present a study of hybrid neutron stars with color superconducting quark matter cores at finite temperature that results in sequences of stars with constant entropy per baryon, s/nB=const. For the quark matter equation of state, we employ a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model while nuclear matter is described with a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class. The phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction under isothermal conditions. We find that traversing the mixed phase on a trajectory at low s/nB≲2 in the phase diagram shows a heating effect while at larger s/nB the temperature drops. This behavior may be attributed to the presence of a color superconducting quark matter phase at low temperatures and the melting of the diquark condensate which restores the normal quark matter phase at higher temperatures. While the isentropic hybrid star branch at low s/nB≲2 is connected to the neutron star branch, it gets disconnected at higher entropy per baryon so that the \"thermal twin\" phenomenon is observed. We find that the transition from connected to disconnected hybrid star sequences may be estimated with the Seidov criterion for the difference in energy densities. The radii and masses at the onset of deconfinement exhibit a linear relationship and thus define a critical compactness of the isentropic star configuration for which the transition occurs which for large enough s/nB≳2 is accompanied by an instability. The results of this study may be of relevance for uncovering the conditions for the supernova explodability of massive blue supergiant stars by the quark deconfinement mechanism. The accretion-induced deconfinement transition with thermal twin formation may contribute to explaining the origin of eccentric orbits in some binary systems and the origin of isolated millisecond pulsars.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dceccb9870ae2eae990705420916d5564f62ce364064d8829750996e5c119a16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
