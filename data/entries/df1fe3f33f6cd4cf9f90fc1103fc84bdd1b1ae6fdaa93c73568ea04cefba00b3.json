{"title":"Evapotranspiration and Rainfall Effects on Post‐Storm Salinization of Coastal Forests: Soil Characteristics as Important Factor for Salt‐Intolerant Tree Survival","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024WR037907?af=R","date":1728103162000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Flooding and salinization triggered by storm surges threaten the survival of coastal forests. After a storm surge event, soil salinity can increase by evapotranspiration or decrease by rainfall dilution. Here we used a 1D hydrological model to study the combined effect of evapotranspiration and rainfall on coastal vegetated areas. Our results shed light on tree root uptake and salinity infiltration feedback as a function of soil characteristics. As evaporation increases from 0 to 2.5 mm/day, soil salinity reaches 80 ppt in both sandy and clay loam soils in the first 5 cm of soil depth. Transpiration instead involves the root zone located in the first 40 cm of depth, affecting salinization in a complex way. In sandy loam soils, storm surge events homogeneously salinize the root zone, while in clay loam soils salinization is stratified, partially affecting tree roots. Soil salinity stratification combined with low permeability maintain root uptakes in clay loam soils 4/5-time higher with respect to sandy loam ones. When cumulative rainfall is larger than potential evapotranspiration ET<sub>p</sub> (ET<sub>p</sub>/Rainfall ratios lower than 1), dilution promotes fast recovery to pre-storm soil salinity conditions, especially in sandy loam soils. Field data collected after two storm surge events support the results obtained. Electrical conductivity (a proxy for salinity) increases when the ratio ET<sub>p</sub>/Rainfall is around 1.76, while recovery occurs when the ratio is around 0.92. In future climate change scenarios with higher temperatures and storm-surge frequency, coastal vegetation will be compromised, because of soil salinity values much higher than tolerable thresholds.</p>","author":"Giovanna Nordio, \nSergio Fagherazzi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"df1fe3f33f6cd4cf9f90fc1103fc84bdd1b1ae6fdaa93c73568ea04cefba00b3","category":"Environment"}
