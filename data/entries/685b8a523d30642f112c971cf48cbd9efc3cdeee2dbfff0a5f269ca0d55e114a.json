{"title":"Numerical Estimation of Productivity for Single Slope Solar Stills in the Caspian Region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1604/v1","date":1726816104000,"content":"This study provides a detailed numerical assessment of the productivity of single-slope solar stills across key cities in the Caspian region, including Aktau, Atyrau, Astrakhan, Makhachkala, Baku, Tehran, and Turkmenbashi. Employing a mathematical model based on heat balance equations and the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method, we simulated the distillation process under various climatic conditions. The results reveal that productivity is significantly influenced by geographic location and local meteorological conditions. Tehran demonstrated the highest productivity across all seasons, with values of 1.75 × 10³ kg/(m²·year) and an efficiency of 0.53, due to its optimal solar irradiation and ambient temperature. In contrast, Atyrau and Makhachkala exhibited lower productivity, particularly in colder months, highlighting the effect of ambient temperature on solar still efficiency. The analysis identified optimal water depth at 2 cm and insulation thickness between 4 and 9 cm for enhancing productivity in continental climates like Aktau. Additionally, the lowest cost of distilled water was $0.024 per kilogram in Baku. These findings align with existing literature, validating the numerical model's accuracy. Future research will explore integrating solar stills with other renewable and fossil fuel-based technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"685b8a523d30642f112c971cf48cbd9efc3cdeee2dbfff0a5f269ca0d55e114a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
