{"title":"Thermographic Measurements in Electrical Power Engineering &ndash; Discussion on How to Interprete the Results","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0004/v1","date":1714550329000,"content":"An important issue concerning the inspection of the technical condition of electrical power components and systems is thermal imaging investigation. This paper presents how the thermograms obtained from these measurements should be interpreted correctly according different standards and how operators should react when a specific anomaly is detected. It is also a review article in which all currently applicable international standards are referred to. The motivation of the article relates to the fact that these standards seems to be too general and not cover all practical situations even though in many countries thermal imaging diagnostics of overhead lines or overhead outdoor and indoor power stations has been used for years on the basis of industry standards or good practices. The purpose of writing this article is precisely to encourage and provoke the global community of metrologists, scientists and engineers involved in thermographic measurements to discuss, strengthen efforts and establish relevant international standards for the interpretation of thermograms containing the relevant temperature anomalies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75db7bf40b4bc9beb4773c010dd808163f251a58ec3174fa49b7a4dbf8b3789b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
