{"title":"Cassava phosphatase PP2C1 modulates thermotolerance via fine-tuning dephosphorylation of antioxidant enzymes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2724/7514056?rss=1","date":1704844800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Global warming is an adverse environmental factor that threatens crop yields and food security. 2C-type protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), as core protein phosphatase components, play important roles in plant hormone signaling to cope with various environmental stresses. However, the function and underlying mechanism of PP2Cs in the heat stress response remain elusive in tropical crops. Here, we report that MePP2C1 negatively regulated thermotolerance in cassava (<span>Manihot esculenta</span> Crantz), accompanied by the modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and the underlying antioxidant enzyme activities of catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Further investigation found that MePP2C1 directly interacted with and dephosphorylated MeCAT1 and MeAPX2 at serine (S) 112 and S160 residues, respectively. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo assays showed that protein phosphorylation of MeCAT1<sup>S112</sup> and MeAPX2<sup>S160</sup> was essential for their enzyme activities, and MePP2C1 negatively regulated thermotolerance and redox homeostasis by dephosphorylating MeCAT1<sup>S112</sup> and MeAPX2<sup>S160</sup>. Taken together, this study illustrates the direct relationship between MePP2C1-mediated protein dephosphorylation of MeCAT1 and MeAPX2 and ROS accumulation in thermotolerance to provide insights for adapting to global warming via fine-tuning thermotolerance of the tropical crop cassava.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"886b56271676c189a58751e92db356c15592072d0ae96aebf46d2a6b9e122a68","category":"Environment"}
