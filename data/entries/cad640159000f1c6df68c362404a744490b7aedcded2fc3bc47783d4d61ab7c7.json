{"title":"Alternative DNA Markers to Detect Guam-Specific CRB-G (Clade I) Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) Indicate That the Beetle Did Not Disperse from Guam to the Solomon Islands or Palau.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1484/v1","date":1716451054000,"content":"A partial mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) gene haplotype variant of the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) Oryctes rhinoceros classed as ‘CRB-G (clade I)’ has been the focus of much research since 2007 with reports of invasions into new Pacific Island locations (e.g., Guam, Hawaii, Solomons Islands). For numerous invasive species, inference of invasion biology via whole genome is superior to assessments via the partial mtCOI gene. Here, we explore CRB draft mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from historical and recent collections, with assessment focused on individuals associated within the CRB-G (clade I) classification. We found that all Guam CRB individuals possessed the same mitogenome across all 13 protein coding genes and differed from individuals collected elsewhere, including ‘non-Guam’ individuals designated as CRB-G (clade I) by partial mtCOI assessment. Two alternative ATP6 and COIII partial gene primer sets were developed to enable distinction between CRB (clade I) that invaded Guam and CRB-G (Clade I) individuals collected elsewhere. Phylogenetic analyses based on concatenated ATP6-COIII genes showed that only Guam CRB-G (clade I) individuals clustered together, and therefore Guam was not the source of the CRB that invaded the other locations in the Pacific assessed in this study. The use of the mtCOI and/or mtCOIII genes for initial molecular diagnosis of CRB remained crucial, and assessment of more native CRB populations will further advance our ability to identify the provenance of CRB invasions being reported within the Pacific and elsewhere","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cad640159000f1c6df68c362404a744490b7aedcded2fc3bc47783d4d61ab7c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
