{"title":"Influence of Stigma on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Migraine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1962/v1","date":1721817558000,"content":"Several factors contribute to stigma associated with migraine, such as the lack of objective diagnostic tests and biomarkers or traditional gender stereotypes. Patients with migraine can perceive the stigma from different sources: other people (public stigma), organisations (structural stigma) or themselves (internalised stigma), and even neurologists may harbour stigma towards patients with headache. At a social level, repeated migraine attacks lead to restricted participation in work and family life, inducing anxiety, depression and reduced self-esteem. Regarding the workplace, the impact of migraine on their proffesional lives is significant. Individuals who were acquainted with people with migraine at job tended to behave more negatively towards them, and over half of the managers did not consider headache as a valid reason for being absent from work. Effectiveness at work is reduced during a migraine attack, but also because of the interictal symptoms these patients go through. Regarding presenteeism, migraine was the second most expensive disease in the USA, with an annual cost of approximately $240 billion. For all these facts, destigmatisation should take place at the level of healthcare providers, patients and the general population. Implementing educational programmes, training more neurologists in a specialised headache approach, listening to the patients and taking their concerns seriously, or recognizing the disability that the disease causes are strategies that may help minimizing the stigma of migraine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"80f67d00fea163f9ce4c24b0cc09061c7b1eb648b90d8b60826ed9b60ade04e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
