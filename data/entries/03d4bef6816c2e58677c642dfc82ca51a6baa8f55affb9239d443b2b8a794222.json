{"title":"Vibration Foam Rolling Treatment Influence on Changes in Plantar flexors Muscle Temperature and Surface emg Activity in Amateur Athletes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1947/v1","date":1729782085000,"content":"Foam rolling is widespread and deeply rooted in exercise practice. Optimal duration and role of this treatment still lack scientific consensus. Relatively novel foam rolling treatment that combines vibration during application targets different muscle characteristics that are not well understood. Studies exploring this combined treatment are scarce therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects of different duration vibration (15-s, 30-s and 60-s) foam rolling treatment on muscle skin temperature and surface muscle electromyography during Maximal Voluntary Isometric Contraction. Eighteen male subjects attended the research laboratory for three experimental sessions and performed four sets of three trials of maximal isometric heel rises. Repeated measures ANOVA determined that muscle skin temperature significant difference was only found for the 30-s treatment (p = 0.013 - 0.000). For surface muscle electromyography a 30-s treatment out of all three yielded the most significant results, between pretreatment set and post treatment set1 (p=0.01) small effect size (Cohen’s d= -0.33) and pretreatment set to post treatment set3 (p=0.01) small effect size (Cohen’s d= -0.30). All treatments did not produce significant difference during Maximal Voluntary Isometric Contraction heel rises. Future studies should investigate accute effects of longer duration treatment on changes in surface muscle temperature. Muscle activity could suggest that efficiency was improved taken into account of unchanged muscle strength, also downward trend of muscle activity caused by other two treatment durations could be of significance during rehabilitation process or during activites where this is a desired and indicated goal.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"03d4bef6816c2e58677c642dfc82ca51a6baa8f55affb9239d443b2b8a794222","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
