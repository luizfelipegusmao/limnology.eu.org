{"title":"Intelligent Robotic Arm: Adaptive Collision Avoidance Using Current Fluctuation Analysis in Human-Proximity Scenarios","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1794/v1","date":1719326666000,"content":"This research introduces an Intelligent Robotic Arm with Adaptive Collision Avoidance, employing real-time current fluctuation analysis for human-proximity detection. Precision and versatility in motors and actuators are given top priority in the robotic arm setup. Motor power lines are continually monitored by integrated high-precision current sensors, and a real-time data processing system separates natural fluctuations from those caused by outside influences. When a human comes into contact with the surface of the robotic arm, the system excels at detecting their closeness by identifying unique patternsin the variations of current. This sets off an adaptive collision avoidance system, which quickly flips the main power supplyâ€™s kill switch to bring the vehicle to an emergency stop. A crucial component is adaptability, as the system dynamically modifies sensitivity in response to environmental condi- tions. Comparative studies show that this approach performs better than conventional static sensing techniques. Experiments under control confirm the great precision, accuracy, and low false positive rate. The use of a failsafe technique improves system integrity by preventing false alarms and enabling recovery after an emergency","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0757d091ce5453b431acd657d83ca8231d194b38ca7f3e5329d500514efec2f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
