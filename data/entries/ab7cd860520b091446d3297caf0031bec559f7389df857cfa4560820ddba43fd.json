Carboxysomes are specialized BMCs known for their role in carbon fixation through the sequestering of Rubisco along with additional factors. Rubisco, the most abundant enzyme on earth and the protein responsible for carbon fixation in plants and algae, has low selectivity for its substrate CO<sub>2</sub> and has a slow enzymatic rate, resulting in an inefficient metabolic pathway. The use of BMCs in cyanobacteria and many chemoautotrophs have enhanced carbon fixation. Within the carboxysome, Rubisco has been observed at a range of concentrations and with either a pseudo-lattice of fibrils or a more liquid-like assembly (Fig. 1). We have developed a processing and particle analysis pipeline which converts tomography-derived particle positions into calculated binding curves, and determined the equilibrium polymerization constant (Kpoly) through a modeling approach consistent with <span>in situ</span> constraints such as non-independent binding interactions and physical boundaries (Fig. 2). This novel approach offers a powerful tool to evaluate both <span>in vitro</span> and potentially <span>in vivo</span> biomolecular interactions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ab7cd860520b091446d3297caf0031bec559f7389df857cfa4560820ddba43fd","category":"Environment"}
