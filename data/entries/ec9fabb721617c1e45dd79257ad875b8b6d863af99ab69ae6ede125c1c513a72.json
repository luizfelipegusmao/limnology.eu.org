{"title":"AI-Driven Personalization in Digital Marketing: Effectiveness and Ethical Considerations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0023/v1","date":1722511120000,"content":"The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized digital marketing, offering unprecedented levels of personalization. AI-driven personalization leverages machine learning algorithms and data analytics to tailor content, advertisements, and recommendations to individual consumers based on their behavior, preferences, and demographics. This paper explores the effectiveness of AI-driven personalization in enhancing customer engagement, increasing conversion rates, and improving overall marketing efficiency. It also examines the ethical considerations associated with these technologies, including data privacy, consent, and the potential for manipulation or bias. While AI-driven personalization can lead to more relevant and engaging consumer experiences, it raises critical ethical questions that must be addressed to ensure responsible and fair use. The study concludes with recommendations for marketers and policymakers to balance the benefits of AI personalization with the need for ethical standards and consumer protection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec9fabb721617c1e45dd79257ad875b8b6d863af99ab69ae6ede125c1c513a72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
