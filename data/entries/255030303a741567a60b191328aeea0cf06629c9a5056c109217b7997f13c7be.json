While whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has played a leading role in surveillance programs, many local laboratories lack the expertise and resources. Thus, we aimed to investigate the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and evaluate the performance of multiplexed real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for screening and monitoring the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants in Bangladesh.</p> Methods <p>A total of 600 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive cases were enrolled either prospectively or retrospectively from two divisions of Bangladesh. The samples were screened by variant RT-PCR targeting five mutations of the spike gene (N501Y, P681R, L452R, E484K, E484Q). A subsample of the study population was also selected for third-generation sequencing (TGS) and the results were compared to the variant RT-PCR screening. An in-depth comparison was made between the two methods in terms of congruence and cost-benefit.</p> Result <p>Seven variants were detected among samples, with similar distributions of the variants across both divisions. Variant RT-PCR for the targeted mutations lead to a 98.5% call rate; only nine samples failed to be determined. No association was found regarding the demographic features, clinical criteria, or routine RT-PCR Ct values across the variants. The clade diversity of the sequenced subpopulation (<i>n</i> = 99) exhibited similar distributions across the two study sites and other epidemiologic variables. Variant RT-PCR successfully distinguished variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs); however, 8% discrepancy was observed for the closest lineages. Moreover, the variant RT-PCR represented an ideal balance of cost, time, and accuracy that outweigh their limitations.</p> Conclusion <p>Based on the strong agreement of variant RT-PCR with TGS, such rapid, easily accessible approaches of rapid strain typing are essential in the context of pandemic responses to guide both treatment decisions and public health measures.</p>","author":"Zannat Kawser","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"255030303a741567a60b191328aeea0cf06629c9a5056c109217b7997f13c7be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
