{"title":"Multiple morphophysiological responses of a tropical frog to urbanization conform to the pace-of-life syndrome","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coad106/7590392?rss=1","date":1706313600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Pace-of-Life syndrome proposes that behavioural, physiological and immune characteristics vary along a slow-fast gradient. Urbanization poses several physiological challenges to organisms. However, little is known about how the health status of frogs is affected by urbanization in the Tropics, which have a faster and more recent urbanization than the northern hemisphere. Here, we analysed a suite of physiological variables that reflect whole organism health, reproduction, metabolic and circulatory physiology and leukocyte responses in <span>Leptodactylus podicipinus</span>. Specifically, we tested how leukocyte profile, erythrocyte morphometrics and germ cell density, as well as somatic indices and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities differ throughout the adult life span between urban and rural populations. We used Phenotypic Trajectory Analysis to test the effect of age and site on each of the multivariate data sets; and a Generalised Linear Model to test the effect of site and age on nuclear abnormalities. Somatic indices, erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities, erythrocyte morphometrics and leukocyte profile differed between populations, but less so for germ cell density. We found a large effect of site on nuclear abnormalities, with urban frogs having twice as many abnormalities as rural frogs. Our results suggest that urban frogs have a faster pace of life, but the response of phenotypic compartments is not fully concerted.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"942d8237218da349d9adbd557e926a2ac1610411d8419a26f06e684a7a712581","category":"Environment"}
