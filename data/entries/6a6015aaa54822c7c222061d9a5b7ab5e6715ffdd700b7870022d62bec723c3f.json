{"title":"The Journey of Genome Sequencing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1719/v1","date":1724631872000,"content":"A genome represents the complete collection of genetic material in an organism or cell. This genetic information is encoded in nucleic acids, which can be either single or double-stranded and arranged in linear or circular forms. DNA, the most common type of genetic material, consists of just four nucleotides: adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine. These nucleotides are organized in a double helix structure, a discovery made by Watson and Crick. The sequence of these nucleotides forms the basic blueprint of a gene or genome. The process of determining this sequence is known as genome sequencing. The field of genome sequencing has evolved dramatically over time, advancing from sequencing short DNA fragments to analyzing millions of base pairs. Initially, efforts were focused on determining the sequence of individual genes, but now whole genome sequencing is both rapid and widely accessible. Recent improvements in sequencing technology emphasize faster, more accurate results, lower costs, and better data analysis. Sanger sequencing, which became the gold standard for DNA sequencing for about thirty years, was instrumental in completing various genome sequences, including the human genome. It laid the groundwork for newer sequencing methods. Today, these newer methods, known collectively as “Next-Generation Sequencing” (NGS), include several generations of technology. Second-generation methods, such as Illumina, Pyrosequencing, ABI/SOLiD, and Ion Torrent Sequencing, and third-generation methods like PacBio and Helicos Sequencing, have advanced the field further. Fourth-generation technology, such as Nanopore sequencing, is also emerging. Most modern research now relies on NGS for analyzing biological sequences, and understanding these technologies offers insight into current methods and future developments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a6015aaa54822c7c222061d9a5b7ab5e6715ffdd700b7870022d62bec723c3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
