{"title":"Novel Dairy Fermentates Have Differential Effects on Key Immune Responses Associated with Viral Immunity and Inflammation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0455/v1","date":1712522635000,"content":"Fermented foods and ingredients, including fermentates derived from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in dairy products, can modulate the immune system. Here we describe the use of reconstituted skimmed milk powder to generate novel fermentates from Lactobacillus helveticus strains SC232, SC234, SC212, and SC210, and from Lacticaseibacillus casei strains SC209 and SC229, and demonstrate using in vitro assays that these fermentates can differentially modulate cytokine secretion by bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) when activated with either the viral ligand, loxoribine, or an inflammatory stimulus, lipopolysaccharide. Specifically, we demonstrate that SC232 and SC234 increase cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12p40, IL-23, IL-27 and IL-10, and decreased IL-1β in primary bone marrow derived dendritic cell (BMDCs) stimulated with a viral ligand. In contrast exposure of these cells to SC212 and SC210 resulted in increased IL-10, IL-1β, IL-23, and decreased  IL-12p40 following activation of the cells with the inflammatory stimulus LPS. Interestingly SC209 and SC229 had little or no effect on cytokine secretion by BMDCs.  Overall, our data demonstrates that these novel fermentates have specific effects and can differentially enhance key immune mechanisms that are critical to viral immune responses, or can suppress responses involved in chronic inflammatory conditions, such as Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and Crohn’s disease (CD).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8382adb2bdb54cbb9d82ad087d42abf084f47fb11c33c21a5bcae0a98c313672","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
