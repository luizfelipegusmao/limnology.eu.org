{"title":"Significant Sea‐Level Fluctuations in the Western Tropical Pacific During the Mid‐Holocene","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023PA004783?af=R","date":1715623450000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Understanding the history of sea-level changes in the past and the associated mechanisms is crucial for predicting sea level in the future. The South China Sea is the largest semi-enclosed marginal sea in the western tropical Pacific. Previous studies showed that this region experienced several sea-level fluctuations up to half a meter on centennial timescales ∼7,000 cal yr BP. These fluctuations were greater in magnitude than the rise in global mean sea level induced by greenhouse effect over the 20th century. However, whether such sea-level fluctuations occurred in a wider temporal context and their potential causes remain unclear. To answer these questions, we reconstructed the mid-Holocene sea-level fluctuations in the northern South China Sea using nine coral microatoll fossils collected from Hainan Island. The results suggest that sea-level fluctuations with amplitude of about half a meter on centennial timescales were common during 6,143–4,384 cal yr BP. Based on recent studies of sea-level driving mechanisms in the South China Sea and paleoclimate reconstructions, we infer that these sea-level fluctuations were likely driven by changes of Walker circulation intensity. Due to the internal variability of the climate system, the possibility of similar sea-level fluctuations in the foreseeable future cannot be ruled out.</p>","author":"Tingli Yan, \nKefu Yu, \nLeilei Jiang, \nYueer Li, \nNing Zhao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"69a881e15689378344e2f544f17d899603864e0695b4208841b63784555058e2","entryHash":"c61adf544aa104101e19fed62ce440e3acde8e633f3d09a4de8b5810be334ceb","category":"Environment"}
