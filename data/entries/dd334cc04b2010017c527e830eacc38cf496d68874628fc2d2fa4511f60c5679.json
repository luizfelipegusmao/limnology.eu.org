{"title":"Molecular Biotechniques for the Isolation and Identification of Microorganisms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0681/v1","date":1728463016000,"content":"Microorganisms play a pivotal role in ecology, medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. To comprehend their diversity, physiology, and functions, isolation and characterization are imperative. This review provides a concise overview of prevalent molecular biotechniques for microbial isolation. It describes the advantages, constraints, and practical applications of both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. Discussed methods encompass selective/differential media, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques, and single-cell genomics. Emerging high-throughput sequencing and single-cell isolation methods exemplify cutting-edge procedures explored herein. Integration of these molecular tools offers comprehensive insights into microbial-diversity, community structure, metabolic capabilities, and functional interplays.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd334cc04b2010017c527e830eacc38cf496d68874628fc2d2fa4511f60c5679","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
