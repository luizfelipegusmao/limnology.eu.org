{"title":"The Influence of the GiSelA 5 Rootstock Propagation Method on the Growth and Physiological Parameters of Maiden Trees of Selected Sweet Cherry Varieties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0994/v1","date":1728898293000,"content":"The basis of orchard production are rootstocks that reduce the vigor of sweet cherry trees. However, not all rootstocks for this species can be easily propagated using traditional methods by stooling or cutting. Some of these must be propagated using the in vitro culture method. This results in their high price and, consequently, the price of maiden sweet cherry trees. The experiment assessed the growth of maiden trees of selected sweet cherry varieties ('Bellise', 'Earlise', 'Lapins', 'Vanda') depending on the method of the semi-dwarf GiSelA 5 rootstock propagation. Additionally the intensity of life processes taking place in the obtained maiden trees was also examined. One type of this rootstock, obtained by cheaper method from softwood cuttings, was compared with the another propagated using the in vitro method. There were no significant differences in the percentage of maiden trees obtained in both types of rootstocks propagation method and in the two years of study. The efficiency of maiden trees varied little and ranged from 77.43% to 87.74% depending on the factors considered. The vigor of maiden trees growth in the first year of the study was stronger than in the second one. Only the diameter of maiden trees stem varied (from 7% to 39%), depending on the variety considered. With the exception of one variety, maiden trees produced on rootstock propagated from stem cuttings were characterized by a much larger diameter for the three varieties, ranging from 23% to 29% compare to in vitro. Also with this method of propagation, the rootstocks had a better developed root system and the maiden trees had a greater fresh mass. However, most often, no significant differences were found between the methods of propagation, only when comparing the years of research. The activity of life processes of maiden sweet cherry trees varied and no constant regularities were found. The only regularity observed was that maiden trees in the second year of the experiment were more often characterized by lower levels of the tested life parameters (Pn, E, C and Int.CO2), which was associated with worse growth results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c9a76616ae1dd8bc559b879082e4687182c5474e3218b32573244a7e0ce6e8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
