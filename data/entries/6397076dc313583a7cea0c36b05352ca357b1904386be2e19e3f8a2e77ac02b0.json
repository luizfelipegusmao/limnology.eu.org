Tisdale</p>\r\n\r\nHeart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a risk factor for drug-induced QT interval prolongation. It is unknown if HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is also associated with an increased risk. Dofetilide and sotalol are potent QT interval-prolonging agents that are frequently used in patients with HFpEF, in whom atrial fibrillation is a common comorbidity. We tested the hypothesis that the risk of QT interval prolongation associated with dofetilide and sotalol is increased in patients with HFpEF. We conducted a retrospective cohort study conducted using electronic health records from the Indiana Network for Patient Care (January 31, 2010 –May 3, 2021). After removing patients with overlapping diagnoses of HFpEF and HFrEF, no diagnosis code, and absence of QT interval records, we identified patients taking dofetilide or sotalol among three groups: HFrEF (n = 138), HFpEF (n = 109), and no HF (n = 729). QT prolongation was defined as heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) &gt; 500 ms during dofetilide/sotalol therapy. Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) for QT prolongation were determined by univariate analysis. Adjusted ORs were determined by generalized estimating equations (GEE) with logit link to account for an individual cluster with different times of hospitalization and covariates. QTc prolongation associated with dofetilide or sotalol occurred in 53.2%, 71.7% and 30.0% of patients with HFpEF, HFrEF, and patients with no HF, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, race, serum potassium and magnesium concentrations, kidney function, concomitant drug therapy, and comorbid conditions, the adjusted odds of QTc prolongation were significantly higher in patients with HFpEF [OR = 1.98 (95% CI 1.17–3.33)], and in those with HFrEF [OR = 5.23, (3.15–8.67)], compared to those with no evidence of HF. The odds of QT prolongation among inpatients receiving dofetilide or sotalol were increased in patients with HFpEF and HFrEF compared to those who did not have HF.","author":"Chien-Yu Huang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6397076dc313583a7cea0c36b05352ca357b1904386be2e19e3f8a2e77ac02b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
