{"title":"Assessment of the Embedment of Francis Turbine for Pumped Hydraulic Energy Storage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1334/v1","date":1718877185000,"content":"In the paper analyzes of Francis turbine failures for a powerful Pumped Hydraulic Energy Storage (PHES) are conducted. The structure is part of the PHES Chaira, Bulgaria (HA4 - Hydro-Aggregate 4). The aim is assessment of the structure-to-concrete embedment for possible cause of damages and destructions of the HA4 Francis spiral casing units. The embedment methods applied in the practice for decades are discussed and compared to that used for HA4. An innovative virtual prototype is built based on the finite element method to clarify the influence of workloads under generator mode. The stages of the simulation include:- complete structural analysis of the spiral case and the concrete under loads in generator mode;- complete structural analysis of the spiral case under loads in generator mode but without the concrete.Both procedures of simulations (with and without the concrete) are of major importance. Since a failure of the surface between the turbine, the spiral case and the concrete is observed the effect of the increasing contact gap (no contact) is analyzed. The stresses, strains and displacements of the turbine units are simulated followed by important analysis for reliability. The conclusions reveal the possible reasons for cracks and destruction in the main elements of the structure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f561c440e74f2a23e4162bcb81b4138d8762021a87bc58e1a03c442b2bdb8924","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
