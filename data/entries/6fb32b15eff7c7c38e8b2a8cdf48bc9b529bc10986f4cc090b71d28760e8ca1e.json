{"title":"Octopamine is required for successful reproduction in the classical insect model, <i>Rhodnius prolixus</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306611","date":1720792800000,"content":"<p>by Jimena Leyria, Ian Orchard, Angela B. Lange</p>\r\n\r\nIn insects, biogenic amines function as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and neurohormones, influencing various behaviors, including those related to reproduction such as response to sex pheromones, oogenesis, oviposition, courtship, and mating. Octopamine (OA), an analog of the vertebrate norepinephrine, is synthesized from the biogenic amine tyramine by the enzyme tyramine β-hydroxylase (TβH). Here, we investigate the mechanisms and target genes underlying the role of OA in successful reproduction in females of <i>Rhodnius prolixus</i>, a vector of Chagas disease, by downregulating <i>TβH</i> mRNA expression (thereby reducing OA content) using RNA interference (RNAi), and in vivo and ex vivo application of OA. Injection of females with dsTβH impairs successful reproduction at least in part, by decreasing the transcript expression of enzymes involved in juvenile hormone biosynthesis, the primary hormone for oogenesis in <i>R</i>. <i>prolixus</i>, thereby interfering with oogenesis, ovulation and oviposition. This study offers valuable insights into the involvement of OA for successful reproduction in <i>R</i>. <i>prolixus</i> females. Understanding the reproductive biology of <i>R</i>. <i>prolixus</i> is crucial in a medical context for controlling the spread of the disease.","author":"Jimena Leyria","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6fb32b15eff7c7c38e8b2a8cdf48bc9b529bc10986f4cc090b71d28760e8ca1e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
