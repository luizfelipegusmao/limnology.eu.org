{"title":"Assessment of spawning habitat suitability for Amphidromous Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) in tidal Asahi River sections in Japan: Implications for conservation and restoration","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4329?af=R","date":1717376082000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Amphidromous Ayu (<i>Plecoglossus altivelis</i>), vital for Japan's riverine commercial fisheries, is experiencing population decline due to habitat degradation. In response, Japan is implementing restoration efforts by releasing juvenile fish and cultivating spawning habitats. This study, focusing on the Asahi River's Heidan area, evaluates Ayu spawning habitat suitability, especially in tidal zones, and its conservation implications. Through field surveys and numerical analysis, the research identifies optimal conditions for spawning amid dwindling numbers. Observations from the 2020 peak spawning season showed that water temperatures below 20°C are conducive to spawning, with the best sites producing up to 48,817 eggs/m<sup>2</sup>. Gravel sizes between 0.85 and 53.0 mm were identified as crucial for effective spawning. Notably, artificial spawning grounds established in 2019 showed no spawning activity, likely due to saline intrusion from tides. Using the three-dimensional hydrodynamic-aquatic ecosystem numerical model, the study assesses flow, substrate, and water quality's impact on spawning, corroborated by sensor data. A key finding is the negative correlation between salinity and egg density in tidal sections of the Asahi River. Furthermore, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based YOLOv5 model, trained on underwater images, effectively detected Ayu aggregations, demonstrating an <i>F</i>1-score of 0.757 in differentiating Ayu from other coexisting fish species in the same aquatic environment. This AI approach provides a nonintrusive method for monitoring Ayu populations and habitat preferences. The research underlines that successful spawning habitats require minimal saline intrusion, with optimal salinity and flow conditions. These insights are critical for spawning ground development, emphasizing the management of tidal effects and riverbed conditions to bolster Ayu populations and preserve aquatic ecosystems.</p>","author":"Keisuke Yoshida, \nHiroshi Yajima, \nMd.
