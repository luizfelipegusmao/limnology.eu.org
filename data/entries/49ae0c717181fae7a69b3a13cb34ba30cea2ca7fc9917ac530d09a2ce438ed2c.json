{"title":"Bioactive and Its Chondroprotective Roles in Ameliorating Osteoarthritis: A Focus on Nanoparticle Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1705/v1","date":1727086506000,"content":"Bioactive like resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate, curcumin, and other polyphenols often target various signalling pathways, including NFκB, TGFβ, and Wnt/β-catenin in osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis, by executing epigenetic-modifying activities. Epigenetic modulation by bioactive is gaining traction with the onset of nutrigenomics. Such modulations can target genes by histone modifications, promoter DNA methylation, and non-coding RNA expression, some of which are directly involved in disease pathophysiology but less explored in OA. OA patients often explore options that can improve the quality of their life in addition to existing treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although bioactive and natural compounds exhibited therapeutic potential against OA, several disadvantages loom over them, like insolubility and poor bioavailability. Nanoformulated bioactives promise a better way to alleviate OA since they also control systemic events, including metabolic, immunological, and inflammatory responses, by modulating host gut microbiota that can regulate OA pathogenesis. Recent data suggest gut dysbiosis in OA. However, limited evidence is available on the role of bioactive as epigenetic and gut modulators in ameliorating OA. Moreover, the question of whether polyphenolic bioactive modulates gut microbial response that results in epigenetic-controlling activities of OA pathogenesis is not known. This narrative review explored the interplay of nanoformulated bioactive and host gut microbiota on chondrocyte growth, metabolism, and epigenetic alteration linked with OA progression and pathogenesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49ae0c717181fae7a69b3a13cb34ba30cea2ca7fc9917ac530d09a2ce438ed2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
