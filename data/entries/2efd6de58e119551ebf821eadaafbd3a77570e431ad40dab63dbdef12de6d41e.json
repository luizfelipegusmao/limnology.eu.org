{"title":"Research on the Behavior of a Penetrating Wound Dressed with a Vacuum Dressing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1361/v1","date":1729230482000,"content":"The article presents the results of experimental studies on wound models made in ballistic gel casts and dressed with a vacuum dressing. Compared to previously published articles, the thesis presents quantitative parameters describing the behavior of wounds under the influence of vacuum. A significant reduction in wound volume was noted. This effect is independent of the size of the wound. The experimental studies results were supported by numerical calculations using the finite element method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2efd6de58e119551ebf821eadaafbd3a77570e431ad40dab63dbdef12de6d41e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
