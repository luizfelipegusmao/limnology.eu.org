In contrast, the ancestral woodland strawberry (<span>Fragaria vesca</span>) has successfully colonized many habitats of the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, this species seems to harbour genetic factors promoting cold tolerance. Screening a germplasm established in the frame of the German Gene Bank for Crop Wild Relatives, we identified, among 70 wild accessions, a pair with contrasting cold tolerance. By following the physiological, biochemical, molecular, and metabolic responses of this contrasting pair, we identified the transcription factor Cold Box Factor 4 and the dehydrin Xero2 as molecular markers associated with superior tolerance to cold stress. Overexpression of green fluorescent protein fusions with Xero2 in tobacco BY-2 cells conferred cold tolerance to these recipient cells. A detailed analysis of the metabolome for the two contrasting genotypes allows the definition of metabolic signatures correlated with cold tolerance versus cold stress. This work provides a proof-of-concept for the value of crop wild relatives as genetic resources to identify genetic factors suitable to increase the stress resilience of crop plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"76e3cc27e915759694eeb669886fef608b7d74d86c0403eff5c8020f17ab7fc2","category":"Environment"}
