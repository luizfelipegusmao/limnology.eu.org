{"title":"Mapping China's reserved arable lands and its sustainable cropping layout","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13739?af=R","date":1720602864000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Reserved arable lands in China is of great significance for rationally allocating crop planting structures, alleviating the pressure of grain imports, and protecting food security. Owing to data acquisition limitations, obtaining the spatial distribution of reserved arable lands at large spatial scales is relatively rare, and there is little information on predicting the suitability, production capacity, and ecological effects of crop cultivation in reserved arable lands. This study obtained the distribution of reserved arable lands in China by applying restrictive factors, and used the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) suitability index for eight crops to obtain a spatial distribution map of suitable crops, proposed a cropland ecological efficiency index (CEEI) to analyse the ecological impact of crop cultivation in reserved arable lands.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>China possesses approximately 3.93 million hectares of viable reserved arable lands comprising primarily grasslands (67.68%), sandy land (8.11%), saline-alkali land (20.68%), and bare land (3.53%). The average CEEI for the eight crops under irrigation conditions ranges from 0.844 to 0.865, and that under rain-fed conditions (excluding rice) ranges from 0.609 to 0.779.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We proposed the development of rain-fed agriculture with sorghum as the primary crop in the central part of Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, while promoting the cultivation of rapeseed and soybeans in the eastern parts of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia. Overall, the development of irrigation agriculture focusing on wheat and barley should be pursued only when water resources are guaranteed, particularly in north-western regions such as Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Shaanxi. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Huicong Chen, \nYingbin He, \nXiangyi Wang, \nShanjun Luo, \nYifan Jiao, \nShengnan Han","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"51ef4820c6e42a3da913772112e569718d37bb377553d29fd4eab9b8386e71c9","category":"Environment"}
