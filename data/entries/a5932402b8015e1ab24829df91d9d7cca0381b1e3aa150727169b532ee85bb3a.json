{"title":"Natural Ginger Extract Versus Curcumin: Who Has Better Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Properties for Wound Healing?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2344/v1","date":1727683081000,"content":"In recent years, foodborne biomaterials have been widely used in wound healing, and they have attracted much attention because of their advantages of green, environmental protection and pollution-free. Therefore ï¼Œin this study, ginger, a commonly used medicine in traditional Chinese medicine, was used to prepare ginger extract (Ginger E) as wound healing dressing, and its effect was comprehensively compared with curcumin. The results showed that Ginger E and curcumin had excellent biocompatibility and bioactivity. Among them, Ginger E showed better ability to promote cell migration, angiogenesis and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) clearance than curcumin. And Ginger E behaved better anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. The results of animal experiments further demonstrate that Ginger E can promote angiogenesis and collagen deposition, promote the expression of anti-inflammatory factors, and refrain from the expression of pro-inflammatory factors, thus showing great potential in wound healing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5932402b8015e1ab24829df91d9d7cca0381b1e3aa150727169b532ee85bb3a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
