{"title":"Hybridized Shock Filtering and High Order Partial Differential Equation for Preserving the Legacy of Historical Document from Degradation and Distortion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1313/v1","date":1721122863000,"content":"Image restoration plays a vital role in image processing and pattern recognition in producing better recognition accuracy. It was observed that, most of the traditional restoration algorithms were meant for removing a single type of noise and efforts have been made towards the use of partial differential equation model (PDE), to restore different types of images such as super-resolution, bleeding through and deblurring. This research work deployed hybridized shock filter, shock diffusion of higher order PDE to remove degraded images that have been affected by atmospheric turbulence and water smear images. Degraded images of different types were acquired from various sources. The degraded images were subjected to shock filter algorithm, shock diffusion of higher order PDE. The shock filter was combined with PDE, likewise the shock diffusion was also combined with PDE, and the three algorithms were also combined to test the efficiency of the hybridized method on different degraded images. The result was validated using Mean Square Error, Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Peak-to-Noise-Signal -Ratio (PNSR) and universal quality index (UQI). From the result, it was observed that the combination of many image restoration algorithms does not give better results whereas, the combination of two of the algorithms has really proved effective.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e50ff82ff7a5a0c3c05b979849b362e4eb98e6449af545ac5f85ac8589ddb3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
