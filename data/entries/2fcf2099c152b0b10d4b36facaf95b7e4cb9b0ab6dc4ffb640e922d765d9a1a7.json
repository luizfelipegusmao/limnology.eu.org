{"title":"Analysis of Viability as Readout of Lymphocyte Transformation Test in Drug Hypersensitivity Diagnostics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0114/v1","date":1727862712000,"content":"In vitro tests of cellular activity form part of the diagnostic algorithm of drug hypersensitivity reactions. Because of the wide range of pharmacological mechanisms, clinical symptoms, genetic components and laboratory tests, it is important to know how a particular test performs in the diagnostic procedure. We carried out the detailed retrospective analysis of more than 6,000 measurements of numerous drug compounds tested in the past 6 years. Our cell viability-based lymphocyte transformation had a coefficient of variation of 10% and showed similar performance over the whole range of tested ages. With an adequate number of parallel measurements, the test can identify modest increases in stimulation indices with high confidence. Similar percentages of analytically positive responses were observed for the three most frequently tested drug groups, namely antibiotics, non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents and anesthetics. These results confirm that cell viability tests are suitable alternatives of proliferation assays in drug allergy testing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2fcf2099c152b0b10d4b36facaf95b7e4cb9b0ab6dc4ffb640e922d765d9a1a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
