The Additive Manufacturing (AM) of Haynes<sup>速</sup>-230 is being investigated to replace commonly used AM alloys such as Inconel 718 and 625 due to the benefits arising from a simpler composition, higher melting point, and greater rupture life. However, Haynes<sup>速</sup>-230 is not commonly processed using AM, due to cracks generated during the solidification process of the alloy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"413d452474cb571575d982c294ae11241333350ea3b03e163de23ed5d45e83c7","category":"Environment"}
