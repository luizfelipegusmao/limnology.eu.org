{"title":"Adsorption Technology For PFAS Removal In Water: Comparison Between Novel Carbonaceous Materials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0672/v1","date":1720520882000,"content":"PFAS are a variety of ecologically persistent compounds of anthropogenic origin loosely included in many industrial products, in which the carbon chain can be fully (perfluoroalkyl substances) or partially (polyfluoroalkyl substances) fluorinated. Their ubiquitous presence in many environmental compartments over the years, and highly long-lasting nature, arose concern because of the possible adverse effects of PFAS on ecosystem and human health. Between the remediation technologies, adsorption has been demonstrated to be a maneageble and cost-effective method for the removal of PFAS in aqueous media. This study tested two novel and eco-friendly adsorbents (pinewood and date seeds biochar) on 6 different PFAS (PFOS, GenX, PFHxA, PFOA, PFDA, PFTeDA). Batch sorption tests (24 hours) were carried out to evaluate the removal efficiency of each PFAS substance in relation to the two biochars. All samples of liquid phase were analysed by a developed and then well-established method: i) pre-treatment (centrifugation and filtration); ii) determination by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Results evidenced a comparable adsorption capacity of both materials, but greater for the long-chain PFAS. Such findings may lead to a promising path for the use of waste origin materials in the PFAS remediation field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d743df681cf3a21567c5a4c69d41c604654aea513ec22c70c750c06d6d913fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
