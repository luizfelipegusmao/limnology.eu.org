This study adopted a mixed research method. First, a questionnaire was designed, and 580 questionnaires were analysed using SPSS 26.0 statistical software with a basic statistical test, Pearson correlation coefficient. Then, we used semi-structured interviews to collect the opinions of six respondents. Finally, the data were compiled and discussed by multivariate check analysis. The study found that although coastal resources can promote the rural economy, maintain community culture, build a comfortable living environment for the elderly and promote health and well-being, they still affect the physical and mental health and well-being of the elderly because of serious pollution, damage to the community environment and ecology, high prices and few leisure facilities. Therefore, reducing pollution, stabilizing prices, maintaining coastal biodiversity, controlling the consumption mechanism and providing a safe leisure environment will help promote the physical and mental health of the elderly, increase their enthusiasm and self-confidence, and increase their sense of well-being.</p>","author":"Hsiao‐Hsien Lin, \nTzu‐Yun Lin, \nJan‐Wei Lin, \nChih‐Cheng Lo, \nQi‐Yuan Li, \nChao‐Yen Lin, \nJao‐Chuan Lin, \nCheng‐Ping Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"b1451fbbab88d5d284038c4b9dcde803f80efaf10cc377fabb5da95f8a190bce","category":"Environment"}
