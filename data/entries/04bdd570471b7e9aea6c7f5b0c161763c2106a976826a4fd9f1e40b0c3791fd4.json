{"title":"The Second Law of Infodynamics: A Thermocontextual Reformulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1664/v1","date":1729579020000,"content":"Vopson and Lepadatu recently proposed the Second Law of Infodynamics. The law states that while total entropy increases, information entropy declines over time. They state that the law has applications over a wide range of disciplines, but they leave many key questions unanswered. This article analyzes and reformulates the law based on the thermocontextual interpretation (TCI). The TCI generalizes Hamiltonian mechanics by defining states and transitions thermocontextually, with respect to an ambient-temperature reference state. The TCI partitions energy into ambient heat, which is thermally random and unknowable, and exergy, which is knowable and usable. The TCI is further generalized here to account for a reference observerâ€™s actual knowledge. This enables partitioning exergy into accessible exergy, which is known and accessible for use, and configurational energy, which is knowable but unknown and inaccessible. The TCI is firmly based on empirically validated postulates. The Second Law of thermodynamics and its information-based analogue, MaxEnt are logically derived corollaries. Another corollary is a reformulated Second Law of Infodynamics. It states that an external agent seeks to increase its access to exergy by narrowing its information gap with a potential exergy source. The principle is key to the origin of self-replicating chemicals and life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04bdd570471b7e9aea6c7f5b0c161763c2106a976826a4fd9f1e40b0c3791fd4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
