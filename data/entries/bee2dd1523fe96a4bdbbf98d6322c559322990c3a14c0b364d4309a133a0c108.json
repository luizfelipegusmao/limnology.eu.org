{"title":"Advancements in Hydroponics: A Review of Machine Learning and IoT Innovations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0226/v1","date":1725357243000,"content":"This review explores the critical difficulties confronting global agriculture in the face of changing climate patterns and limited resources, highlighting the importance of sustainable practices. With agriculture as the largest consumer of water worldwide, sustainable techniques are critical for long-term survival and ecological harmony. Even with advancements, rapid population increase and changing environment conditions demand immediate investment in cutting-edge technologies. Optimizing agricultural operations, increasing output, and reducing resource waste can be achieved through smart farming, which utilizes machine learning and Internet of Things tech-nologies. Particular difficulties like decreasing cultivator proportions and rising costs are empha-sized, with a focus on developing nations where agriculture plays a crucial role in the economy. Additionally, the anticipated rise in food demand highlights how urgent it is to find sustainable alternatives. But problems like inappropriate land and agricultural land fragmentation still exist, necessitating creative solutions. The paper explores how agriculture could be revolutionized by machine learning and IoT-based hydroponics, providing insights into how to improve resilience, productivity, and sustainability in the face of changing environmental and socioeconomic dy-namics. Through a thorough investigation, this paper advances the discussion on sustainable ag-riculture by demonstrating the important role that technology-driven strategies play in addressing concerns about environmental sustainability and global food security.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bee2dd1523fe96a4bdbbf98d6322c559322990c3a14c0b364d4309a133a0c108","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
