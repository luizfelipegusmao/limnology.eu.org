{"title":"Effects of glutamine on growth performance, nutrient content, fatty acid profile, and blood parameters of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15666?af=R","date":1712853919000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In this study, different amounts of glutamine were added to the diet of rainbow trout, and they were then fed for a period of 90 days. The current research investigated the effects of glutamine on various aspects of rainbow trout, including growth performance, condition factor, viscerosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, carcass composition, fatty acid profile, hematological parameters, and biochemical parameters. The study's findings revealed that adding glutamine to the diet of rainbow trout had a beneficial impact on their growth features. The rainbow trout group that was fed a 2% concentration of glutamine experienced the most notable increase in growth rate. A statistically significant difference in growth was observed among all groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Adding glutamine to the diet increased the amount of protein and decreased the fat content in the flesh of the fish. Glutamine exerted an influence on the blood and biochemistry parameters of fish, as well as their fatty acid composition. In conclusion, the inclusion of glutamine in the diet of fish could potentially enhance their immune system, improve the quality of their muscles, and enhance their growth performance.</p>","author":"Mustafa Öz, \nBurak Evren Inanan, \nTahir Karasahin, \nSuat Dikel","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"9b35c94671e1e7623fce8d7972c3831cf0b1809c38d202323f941359e4fdb14c","category":"Environment"}
