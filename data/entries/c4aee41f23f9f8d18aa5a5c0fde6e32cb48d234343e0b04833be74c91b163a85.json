{"title":"Regeneration of the Skin of Oncology Patients After Radiation Therapy Using Upcycled Fish Collage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1108/v1","date":1728975678000,"content":"Oncological therapy is a very complex process. Accurate diagnosis is the first and most important stage of therapy for the patient, because it allows the medical staff to determine what treatment is nec-essary and how to plan it. Oncological treatment is currently widely considered to be holistic, in which the body is perceived as one, interconnected system. Oncological therapy should not focus only on one area of care, but should also include treatment support, such as appropriate nutrition or pain management. Aims: The aim of the article was to confirm the level of hydration, limit excessive water loss and regulate the pH value of the skin of patients after oncological treatment, who were adminis-tered fish collagen. Methods: The study used a set of probes that were used to examine the biophysical parameters of the skin of patients after oncological treatment. Conclusions: It was confirmed that the tested product restores the appropriate level of skin hydration in oncological patients, supports the reconstruction of the skin and its energy barrier by reducing transepidermal water loss and restoring appropriate pH values. Thanks to this, it is possible to eliminate the effects of pathological changes or accelerate their elimination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4aee41f23f9f8d18aa5a5c0fde6e32cb48d234343e0b04833be74c91b163a85","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
