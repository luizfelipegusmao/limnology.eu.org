{"title":"Drag Reduction by Dried Malted Rice Solutions in Pipe Flow","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0317/v1","date":1712239061000,"content":"In this study, the friction factor of turbulent pipe flow for dried rice malt extract solutions is reduced experimentally to that of a Newtonian fluid. The friction factor is measured for four types of solutions at different culture times and concentrations. The results indicate that the experimental data points of the test solutions diverge from the maximum drag reduction asymptote at and above Re√f ≅ 200 and align parallel to those of Newtonian fluids. This drag reduction phenomenon differs from that of artificial high molecular polymer solutions. It is classified as a Type B drag reduction phenomenon of biopolymer solutions and fine solid particle suspensions. The order of drag reduction corresponds approximately to that of 5–50 ppm xanthan-gum solutions reported previously. Furthermore, the velocity profile in a turbulent pipe flow was predicted using a semi-theoretical equation, in which the friction factors were determined using the difference between the experimental results of the tested solutions and Newtonian fluids. The results indicate a more considerable thickening of the viscous sublayer in the turbulent pipe flow of the test solutions than that of Newtonian fluids.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"433d366e5d7a316c8ebcce435df1a49042ecc358b89a320c6a789e4b3c286dc2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
