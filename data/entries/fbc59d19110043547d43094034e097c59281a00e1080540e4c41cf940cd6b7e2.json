{"title":"Time-Optimal Motions of Mechanical System with Viscous Friction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1144/v2","date":1714724912000,"content":"Optimal control is a critical tool for mechanical robotic systems, facilitating precise manipulation of dynamic processes. These processes are described through differential equations governed by a control function, addressing a time-optimal problem with bilinear characteristics. Our study utilizes the classical approach complemented by Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) to explore this inverse optimal problem. The objective is to develop an exact piecewise control function that effectively manages trajectory control while considering the effects of viscous friction. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed control law markedly diminishes oscillations induced by boundary conditions. This research not only aims to delineate the reachability set but also strives to determine the minimal time required for the process. The findings include an exact analytical solution for the stated control problem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fbc59d19110043547d43094034e097c59281a00e1080540e4c41cf940cd6b7e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
