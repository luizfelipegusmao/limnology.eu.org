{"title":"Influence of Irrigation with Oxygen Plasma Treated Metal Contaminated Water on Plant Growth","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0668/v1","date":1720502122000,"content":"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of plasma treated metal contaminated water, used for irrigation, on plant growth. Zinc (Zn) is one of the more commonly used metals. It can enter the environment from industrial processes as particles released into the atmosphere or as wastewater discharged into waterways or the ground. Exposure to large amounts of zinc, even for a short time, can seriously affect human health. In this experiment, three different DBD O2 plasma treated zinc contaminated water and a control (tap water) were used, with Arabidopsis thaliana as the model plant. The treatments were: i) Control, ii) Zn water, iii) Zn+O3(30 min), and iv) Zn+O3(60 min). Arabidopsis plant exhibited maximum growth in the Zn+O3(30 min) treatment. All growth parameters, except leaf area, followed this trend: Zn+O3(30 min) &gt; Control &gt; Zn water &gt; Zn+O3(60 min). Gene expression analysis revealed that reduced metal ion stress and controlled oxidation due to active oxygen species contributed to favorable/improved growth of Arabidopsis in the Zn+O3(30 min) treatment. Therefore, 30 minutes of DBD O2 plasma treated zinc contaminated water [Zn+O3(30 min)] can mitigate the adverse effects of excess zinc ions and promote the growth of Arabidopsis plants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6fdeebc6851dbeceffa62c8371f0c1472aee8aafb28f806256453275dffc581","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
