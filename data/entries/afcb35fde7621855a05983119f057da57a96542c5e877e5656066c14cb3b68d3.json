{"title":"Understanding the Application of Emulsion System for Bacterial Encapsulation and Temperature-Modulated Release","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2144/v1","date":1727441574000,"content":"The encapsulation of bacteria in emulsion droplets offer various advantages over other conventional methods of encapsulation such as improvement in bacterial viability and may served as microenvironments for bacterial growth. Nevertheless, changes in temperature may affect bacterial viability and droplet stability. In this study, the encapsulation of bacteria in single water-in-oil (W/O) and double water-in-oil-in-water (W1/O/W2) emulsions was investigated under cold storage with a study on temperature-modulated release. The microencapsulation of bacteria in emulsion droplets was achieved by using a flow-focusing microfluidic device. Droplets stability was determined by measuring changes in droplets size and creaming behaviour at different temperatures. Thermal properties of the samples were determined by using differential scanning calorimetry while the release of bacteria with change in temperature was determined by measuring colony form unit (CFU) of the released bacteria and fluorescence microscopy. Higher bacterial viability was observed for encapsulated samples as compared to free cells indicating the ability of emulsion system in improving the bacterial viability during cold temperature storage. Crystallization temperature was lowered in the presence of bacteria, but the melting temperature was similar with or without bacteria. Storage in freezing temperatures of -20°C and -80°C leads to an extensive droplet destabilization with immediate release of encapsulated bacteria upon thawing in which temperature modulated release of encapsulated bacteria was achieved. This study provides an overview of the potential application of emulsion droplets for encapsulation and controlled release that is beneficial for various applications such as food and pharmaceuticals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"afcb35fde7621855a05983119f057da57a96542c5e877e5656066c14cb3b68d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
