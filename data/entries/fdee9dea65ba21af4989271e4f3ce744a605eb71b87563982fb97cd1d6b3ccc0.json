{"title":"Coupled System of Dual-Axis Clinostat and Helmholtz Cage for Simulated Microgravity Experiments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1491/v1","date":1726739576000,"content":"The experimental investigation of plant growth under space conditions is a necessary prerequisite of long-term space missions. Besides experiments in space, many studies are performed under simulated microgravity, using a clinostat. However, the Earth magnetic field is usually not taken into account in such investigations. Here, a self-designed and constructed system of coupled devices – a clinostat and a Helmholtz cage – is presented. The clinostat can, on the average, cancel the effective gravity field by using two independent rotations, enabling simulated zero-valued gravity experiments. Additionally, appropriately symmetrically mounted Helmholtz cage can be used to cancel the natural Earth magnetic field in the volume where the clinostat is located. The combination of these two devices offers the opportunity, e.g. for bio-inspired experiments in which plant cultivation can be carried out in conditions that imitate space environment. We provide information about the experimental setup and show first experimental results of growth tests.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fdee9dea65ba21af4989271e4f3ce744a605eb71b87563982fb97cd1d6b3ccc0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
