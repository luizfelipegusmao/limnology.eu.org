Objectives: An <i>ex-situ</i> study was carried out to determine the impact of noise on physiology and ptilochronology of non-breeding male domesticated quail birds. Methodology: During 60-days long trial, male quail birds, aged 5-weeks, weighing (c.100gm) were used. Out of 72 experimental birds, 18 birds were assigned to the Control Group (G1) while remaining 54 birds were divided equally into 3 treatment groups: Road Traffic noise (G2), Military activity noise (G3) and Human Activities noise (G4). Birds were housed in standard-sized separate cages (20 ×45 × 20 cm), every bird was kept apart in separate cage in open laboratory under maintained environmental conditions. Millet seeds and water were provided to all the experimental birds <i>ad libitum</i>. Noise originated from several sources of recorded high-intensity music (1125 Hz/ 90 dB), was administered for 5–6 hours per day. Observations were recorded in the morning and afternoon. The experiment was conducted during the non-breeding season from August to October in triplicate. Blood sampling was done after 60 days. Results: According to the current study, noise stress significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased the concentrations of creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, uric acid, cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein, and glucose while a decline in the levels of albumin was seen in treatment birds of G3. While in terms of hematology, total white blood cells count (TWBC), total red blood cells count (TRBC), mean cell volume (MCV) &amp; packed cell volume (PCV) concentrations were raised in blood of treatment birds of G3. In terms of hormones, noise stress significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased the serum concentrations of Corticosterone in G3 while a significant (p&lt;0.05) decline was observed in the concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in the same group. Moreover, fault bar formation in G3 was more prominent than others. Conclusion: Noise stress can significantly affect serology, hematology, hormonal physiology and ptilochronology in quail birds.","author":"Rida Amjad","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cacb5ced570818d258df6c5968bb5a6238f1f40dea825da1b3c15704a948da52","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
