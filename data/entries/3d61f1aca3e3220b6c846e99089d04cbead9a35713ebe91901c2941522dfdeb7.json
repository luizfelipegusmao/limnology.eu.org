{"title":"The barcode trap—Description of a new species of Microglanis, with a review of the status of Microglanis cibelae (Siluriformes: Pseudopimelodidae)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15764?af=R","date":1713772531000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In a recent study based on the generalized mixed Yule coalescent method for delimiting species, a threshold of 2% genetic distance using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequences was used to delimit the species of <i>Microglanis</i>. That action resulted in assembling several populations of <i>Microglanis</i> from Atlantic coastal rivers between Rio Grande do Sul and São Paulo states as a single species, <i>Microglanis cottoides</i>, including <i>Microglanis cibelae</i> as a junior synonym. We reexamined these populations and found three species diagnosed by their morphology and that constitute separate mtDNA lineages, including a new species. The synonym of <i>M. cibelae</i> and <i>M. cottoides</i> is reviewed and refuted based on morphological and molecular evidence. <i>M. cibelae</i> and the new species are sympatric and occasionally syntopic in the Tramandaí, Mampituba, and Araranguá river basins. The new species is distinguished from <i>M. cibelae</i> and <i>M. cottoides</i> by the anterior margin of the posttemporosupracleitrum narrow articulated with the epioccipital, the short mental and maxillary barbels, and depressed head and body.</p>","author":"Pablo Lehmann Albornoz, \nCésar Sá Bartzen, \nLuiz R.
