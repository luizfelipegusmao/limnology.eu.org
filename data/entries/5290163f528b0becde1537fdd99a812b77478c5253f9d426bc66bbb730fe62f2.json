{"title":"Review of Foam with Novel CO2-Soluble Surfactants for Improved Mobility Control in Tight Oil Reservoirs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1588/v1","date":1729504537000,"content":"CO2-soluble surfactant foam systems have garnered significant attention in the fields of enhanced oil and gas recovery, environmental protection, and greenhouse gas emission reduction. This review provides a comprehensive explanation of the basic theory of CO2-soluble surfactant foam, the mechanism of enhanced oil recovery, and the classification and application of various CO2-soluble surfactants.The mechanism of enhanced oil recovery by CO2-soluble surfactant foam involves the effective reduction of CO2 fluidity, the decrease in oil-air flow ratio, and the stabilization of the displacement front. Foam plays a vital role in mitigating the issues of channeling and gravity separation often caused by simple CO2 injection. The reduction in gas fluidity can be attributed to the increase in apparent viscosity and trapped gas fraction.Future research should prioritize the development of more efficient and environmentally-friendly CO2-soluble surfactants. It is essential to further explore the advantages and challenges associated with their practical applications in order to maximize their potential impact.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5290163f528b0becde1537fdd99a812b77478c5253f9d426bc66bbb730fe62f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
