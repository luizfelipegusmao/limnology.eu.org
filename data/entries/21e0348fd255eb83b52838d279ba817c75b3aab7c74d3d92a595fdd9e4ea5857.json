{"title":"Phylogeny, biogeography, and host range of gall midges (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) feeding on spores of rust fungi (Basidiomycota: Pucciniales)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae077/7742968?rss=1","date":1724803200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Rust fungi (Pucciniales) are plant pathogens that can cause devastating yield losses to economically important crops and threaten native plants with extinction. Rusts are usually controlled with fungicides when rust-resistant plant varieties are unavailable. However, natural enemies may offer an alternative to chemicals by acting as biological controls. The larvae of <span>Mycodiplosis</span> RÃ¼bsaamen (49 spp.) feed on the spores of rusts and powdery mildew fungi and have been suggested as a potential biocontrol candidate for disease-causing rusts. However, little is known about the phylogenetic relationships, biogeography, and host range of this genus. We screened 5,665 rust specimens from fungarium specimens and field collections and recovered a total of 363 larvae on 315 rust specimens from 17 countries. Three mitochondrial and 2 nuclear loci were amplified and sequenced for the phylogenetic reconstruction of 129 individuals. We recovered 12 clades, of which 12 and 10 were supported with maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, respectively. Of the 12 clades, 7 comprised species from multiple continents and climatic regions, and 5 comprised species from a single region. Individuals forming clades were collected from 2 to 18 rust species, suggesting that <span>Mycodiplosis</span> species have a broad host range. In total, <span>Mycodiplosis</span> larvae were identified on 44 different rust species collected from 18 plant families. Future studies should focus on expanding field sampling efforts, including data from additional gene regions, and incorporating morphological data to further elucidate species diversity and distribution patterns.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"21e0348fd255eb83b52838d279ba817c75b3aab7c74d3d92a595fdd9e4ea5857","category":"Environment"}
