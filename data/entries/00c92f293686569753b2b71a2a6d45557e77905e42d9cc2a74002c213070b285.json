Within these regions point defects, dislocations, step structures, grain boundaries and compositional inhomogeneities could all be resolved. Further time-resolved CL measurements elucidate the role these defects play in carrier recombination within the wells. We find that as the growth temperature increases, certain point defect populations proliferate and migrate, which impacts upon the quantum well luminescence intensity and homogeneity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"00c92f293686569753b2b71a2a6d45557e77905e42d9cc2a74002c213070b285","category":"Environment"}
