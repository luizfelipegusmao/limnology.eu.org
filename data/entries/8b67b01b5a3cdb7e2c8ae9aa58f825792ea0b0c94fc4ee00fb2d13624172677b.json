This article introduces a data augmentation (DA) strategy for electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) data, employing generative adversarial networks (GANs). We present an innovative approach, called the data augmentation generative adversarial network (DAG), which facilitates data generation from a very limited number of spectra, around 100. Throughout this study, we explore the optimal configuration for GANs to produce realistic spectra. Notably, our DAG generates realistic spectra, and the spectra produced by the generator are successfully used in real-world applications to train classifiers based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs) that have been successful in classifying experimental EEL spectra.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8b67b01b5a3cdb7e2c8ae9aa58f825792ea0b0c94fc4ee00fb2d13624172677b","category":"Environment"}
