{"title":"An Open-Source Julia Package for RMS Time-Domain Simulations of Power Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2243/v1","date":1727580958000,"content":"This paper presents RMSPowerSims.jl, an open-source Julia package for time-domain simulation of power systems. The package is designed to be used in conjunction with PowerModels.jl, a widely used Julia package for power system optimization. RMSPowerSims.jl provides a framework for the simulation of power systems in the time domain, allowing for the study of transient stability, fault analysis, and other dynamic phenomena. The package is designed to be intuitive and flexible, allowing users to easily define custom models for network components and disturbances. The package has been verified against DIgSILENT PowerFactory and has produced results that are in close agreement with those obtained using PowerFactory. RMSPowerSims.jl is available under an open-source license and can be downloaded from the Julia package registry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6c12e38705a6778918cf1fc2fd6024528f1ab1443681e120995dccba466c7a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
