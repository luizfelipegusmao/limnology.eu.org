In recent years, extensive research has been done to explore the possibility of transplanting animal organs into humans, a process referred to as xenotransplantation. Due to their matching organ sizes and other anatomical and physiological similarities with humans, pigs are the preferred organ donor species. Organ rejection due to host immune response and possible interspecies infectious pathogen transmission have been the biggest hurdles to xenotransplantation's success. Use of genetically engineered pigs as tissue and organ donors for xenotransplantation has helped to address these hurdles. Although several preclinical trials have been conducted in nonhuman primates, some barriers still exist and demand further efforts. This review focuses on the recent advances and remaining challenges in organ and tissue xenotransplantation.</p></div>","author":"Asghar Ali, Elisabeth Kemter and Eckhard Wolf","siteTitle":"Annual Reviews: Annual Review of Animal Biosciences: Table of Contents","siteHash":"88ae807e8b2cfc417a41d31c2599db29fa2c783b0d3a8de2765d823f4bd5cf41","entryHash":"ea206753de0e61cd7148291a7c7af6663155e19195164370c6e4d5a2a9170492","category":"Environment"}
