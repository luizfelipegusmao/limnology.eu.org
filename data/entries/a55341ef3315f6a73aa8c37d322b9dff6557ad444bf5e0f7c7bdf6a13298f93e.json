The water quality of Hanyuan Lake was found to be excellent.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study aims to understand the changes in the water quality of Hanyuan Lake and to show these changes over time. In this study, monthly sampling was conducted at three sampling sites in Hanyuan Lake, and water samples were measured for water quality indicators in the laboratory according to the methods specified in the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB3838-2002). Based on the monitoring data from January to December 2019, the WQI comprehensive evaluation method was used to conduct multiple linear stepwise regression analysis, extract key indicators, and establish the WQI<sub>min</sub> model. The results show that according to the WQI comprehensive evaluation method, the WQI values of Hanyuan Lake are all above 90, and the grade is excellent. The overall water quality of Hanyuan Lake is excellent, and most of the water quality indexes reach the Class I standard in the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB3838-2002). WQI<sub>min1</sub> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.86, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, PE = 4.28) as the best WQI<sub>min</sub> model. In this study, a model with fewer parameters was established by multiple linear regression method, which is conducive to better monitoring of water quality at monitoring stations while saving costs.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nAccording to the WQI comprehensive evaluation method, the WQI values of Hanyuan Lake are all above 90, the rating is excellent.\nFrom January 2019 to September 2020, the monthly change trend of each section is roughly the same, showing a trend of first decreasing, then rising, then decreasing, and finally rising and flattening.\nThe WQImin model was developed to completely describe the change in the water body.\n</p>","author":"Kai Su, \nZhongshan Peng, \nDan Zhu, \nRuiqian Liu, \nQin Wang, \nRong Cao, \nJun He","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"a55341ef3315f6a73aa8c37d322b9dff6557ad444bf5e0f7c7bdf6a13298f93e","category":"Environment"}
