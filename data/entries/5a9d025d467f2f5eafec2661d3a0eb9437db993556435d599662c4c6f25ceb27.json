{"title":"Viridiplantae Body Plans Viewed Through the Lens of the Fossil Record and Molecular Biology","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/63/6/1316/6783162?rss=1","date":1667174400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A review of the fossil record coupled with insights gained from molecular and developmental biology reveal a series of body plan transformations that gave rise to the first land plants. Across diverse algal clades, including the green algae and their descendants, the plant body plan underwent a unicellular $\\to $ colonial $\\to $ simple multicellular → complex multicellular transformation series. The colonization of land involved increasing body size and associated cell specialization, including cells capable of hydraulic transport. The evolution of the life-cycle that characterizes all known land plant species involved a divergence in body plan phenotypes between the haploid and diploid generations, one adapted to facilitate sexual reproduction (a free-water dependent gametophyte) and another adapted to the dissemination of spores (a more water-independent sporophyte). The amplification of this phenotypic divergence, combined with indeterminate growth in body size, resulted in a desiccation-adapted branched sporophyte with a cuticularized epidermis, stomates, and vascular tissues. Throughout the evolution of the land plants, the body plans of the sporophyte generation involved “axiation,” i.e., the acquisition of a cylindrical geometry and subsequent organographic specializations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative and Comparative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"715dd1b0fb4f45600bceadb227e9b7fdf8bd9d1d7a2fd3d5e0399d2c1f410646","entryHash":"5a9d025d467f2f5eafec2661d3a0eb9437db993556435d599662c4c6f25ceb27","category":"Environment"}
