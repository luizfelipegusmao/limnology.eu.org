{"title":"Yesterday's “lake” endures in its name—The etymology of lake names","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lob.10613?af=R","date":1708428351000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The global language of limnology is English, but most of our study objects do not have English names. Here, I compare 57,000 lake names in a lake-rich, non-English speaking country, that is, Sweden, with a previous analysis of 83,000 lakes in the conterminous United States. The diversity of lake name appellations is strikingly different. In the United States, three different appellations (“lake,” “pond,” “reservoir”) apply to 96% of the lakes, whereas in Sweden to account for 93% of the lakes, 76 different appellations and suffixes were required. The etymology of the remaining largely idiosyncratic 4000 lake names is difficult to assess, and of ancient origin. In the United States, lake names with appellations in languages of non-English European colonizers are rare and lakes that include words in indigenous languages almost exclusively also include an English appellation. Contrastingly, in regions of Sweden where Sami, Finnish, and Meänkieli are spoken, lake names are typically fully indigenous, including the appellation. The historical reasons for the differences are discussed. Examples of malpractice in the use of lake names in scientific papers are presented, and suggestions are made for how we better can achieve a good lake-name practice.</p>","author":"Lars Tranvik","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Bulletin: Table of Contents","siteHash":"4067ad97a51cc8dc25fbbbaa2160150c28c0da1c950424683ce4f339a8ef5bff","entryHash":"22d1e1f1d9b7b3d82d85181490eac75d84639552c42fa2eba391e81eb10d06e6","category":"Environment"}
