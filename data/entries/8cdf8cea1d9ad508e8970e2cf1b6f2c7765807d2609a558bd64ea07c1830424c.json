{"title":"Artificial Intelligence Based Target for Personalized Interventions of Atherosclerosis from Gut Microbiota Signature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0696/v1","date":1728477651000,"content":"Atherosclerosis remains a major driver for cardiovascular disease (CVD), despite advancements in traditional risk factor management therapies. Recent evidence emphasizes the crucial role of the gut microbiome in the progression of atherosclerosis and plaque rupture, highlighting a promising therapeutic avenue. This review focuses on the intertwined relationship between the gut microbiome, its metabolites, and atherosclerosis and CVD, also highlighting the potential therapeutic role of probiotics and prebiotics. \n\nGiven the diverse and unique gut microbiota signatures among individuals, a one-size-fits-all therapeutic approach is unlikely to be effective. Personalized treatment strategies are therefore necessary. Here we discussed how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be leveraged to analyze individual gut microbiome profiles from microbiome sequencing, predict treatment response, and optimize therapeutic strategies based on individual patients which would significantly improve outcomes of the treatment for atherosclerosis/CVD patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8cdf8cea1d9ad508e8970e2cf1b6f2c7765807d2609a558bd64ea07c1830424c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
