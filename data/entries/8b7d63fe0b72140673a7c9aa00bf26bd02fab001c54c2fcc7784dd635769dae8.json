{"title":"Modeling The Impact Of Economic Factors On Electoral Results: A\nPredictive Approach To Ghana&#039;s 2024 Elections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1264/v1","date":1724051817000,"content":"Introduction – Elections are a cornerstone of democratic societies, enabling citizens to express\ntheir preferences and shape the direction of their governments. Economic conditions, political\ndynamics, and social factors often play pivotal roles in influencing voter behavior and\ndetermining electoral outcomes, making elections a key area of study in understanding\ngovernance and policy change.\nObjectives – This study examines how key economic factors like inflation, unemployment, and\npoverty influence election results in Ghana. It also looks at how these economic elements shape\nvoter choices and predicts the possible outcomes of the 2024 general elections using past data.\nMethodology – The study used historical economic and political data from 1992 to 2023,\napplying statistical models like ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) to\nforecast future election outcomes. Economic indicators such as inflation and unemployment\nwere included to study their relationship with voter behavior.\nFindings - The results show that economic factors significantly impact voter turnout and party\nvote share. High inflation and unemployment rates tend to reduce voter support for incumbent\nparties. The model also predicts possible outcomes for the 2024 election based on these\neconomic trends.\nConclusion and Recommendation – The study concludes that improving economic conditions,\nsuch as reducing unemployment, could positively influence electoral outcomes for incumbents.\nIt is recommended that policymakers focus on stabilizing the economy to enhance electoral\nsuccess.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b7d63fe0b72140673a7c9aa00bf26bd02fab001c54c2fcc7784dd635769dae8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
