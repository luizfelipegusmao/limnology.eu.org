{"title":"Pre-Assembly Cryogenic Drilling in Carbon Fiber Sandwich Sheets with Inner Foam Core","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1426/v1","date":1724136593000,"content":"A study of cryogenic drilling in sandwich composites has been carried out. Materials used have been carbon fiber reinforced polymer sandwich sheets with inner foamed polyvinyl chloride core, composites with aerospace, marine, construction and automotive applications, including protec-tion structure of Polar engineering equipment. Experimental tests have been performed in lam-inates with 12 mm and 6 mm of thickness, drilling with liquid nitrogen as refrigerant to reach temperatures below -120ÂºC under different cutting conditions, in particular, drill rotation speeds between 2000 rpm and 6000 rpm and feed rates between 200 mm/min and 600 mm/min. Variables as thrust forces and circularity error have been measured, due to the importance of its effect on the hole quality, as an operation prior to a possible assembly. A design of experiments has been allowed determining relationships between variables, identifying the influence of cutting condi-tions on the thrust force and the circularity at inlet and outlet holes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf3f30382589344af1700ceafc594ebb23adb34a8f9f7168526f0de1f62771aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
