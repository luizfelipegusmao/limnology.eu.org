{"title":"Novel gurmarin-like peptides from Gymnema sylvestre and their interactions with the sweet taste receptor T1R2/T1R3","link":"https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjae018/7661047?rss=1","date":1714608000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Gymnema sylvestre</span> (GS) is a traditional medicinal plant known for its hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects. Gurmarin (hereafter Gur-1) is the only known active peptide in GS. Gur-1 has a suppressive sweet taste effect in rodents but no or only a very weak effect in humans. Here, 8 gurmarin-like peptides (Gur-2 to Gur-9) and their isoforms are reported in the GS transcriptome. The molecular mechanism of sweet taste suppression by Gur-1 is still largely unknown. Therefore, the complete architecture of human and mouse sweet taste receptors T1R2/T1R3 and their interaction with Gur-1 to Gur-9 were predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer (AF-M) and validated. Only Gur-1 and Gur-2 interact with the T1R2/T1R3 receptor. Indeed, Gur-1 and Gur-2 bind to the region of the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the mouse T1R2 subunit. In contrast, only Gur-2 binds to the TMD of the human T1R2 subunit. This result suggests that Gur-2 may have a suppressive sweet taste effect in humans. Furthermore, AF-M predicted that Gα-gustducin, a protein involved in sweet taste transduction, interacts with the intracellular domain of the T1R2 subunit. These results highlight an unexpected diversity of gurmarin-like peptides in GS and provide the complete predicted architecture of the human and mouse sweet taste receptor with the putative binding sites of Gur-1, Gur-2, and Gα-gustducin. In addition, gurmarin-like peptides may serve as promising drug scaffolds for the development of antidiabetic molecules.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"958e105f7c9473896289ed30a8ae403ab32654753a7b2ac89eca2b1328a06b9c","category":"Environment"}
