{"title":"Purification, identification and molecular docking of dual‐functional peptides derived from corn protein hydrolysates with antioxidant and antiadhesive activity against Helicobacter pylori","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13252?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>More than 50% of the world's population is infected with <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, which is classified as a group I carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Corn protein dual-functional peptides were identified and functionally analyzed <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i>. Two novel dual-functional peptides were identified as Cys-Gln-Asp-Val-Pro-Leu-Leu (CQDVPLL, CQ7) and Thr-Ile-Phe-Pro-Gln-Cys (TIFPQC, TI6) using nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC–MS/MS). The antiadhesive effects against <i>H. pylori</i> of CQ7 and TI6 were 45.17 ± 2.41% and 48.62 ± 1.84% at 4 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. <i>In silico</i> prediction showed that CQ7 and TI6 had good physicochemical properties. Molecular docking demonstrated that CQ7 and TI6 could bind to the adhesins BabA and SabA by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, preventing <i>H. pylori</i> infection. Moreover, CQ7 showed strong antioxidant activity due to its unique amino acid composition.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study demonstrated that the identified peptides, CQ7 and TI6, possess antioxidant and antiadhesive effects, preventing <i>H. pylori</i> infection and alleviating oxidative injury to the gastric mucosa. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Guanlong Li, \nXiaolan Liu, \nZhengfei Miao, \nJinshuang Fu, \nXiqun Zheng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"3b93215669244e0cee63eb1e1f96ae410708fe2fba289ce482962d0fd82da8b6","category":"Environment"}
