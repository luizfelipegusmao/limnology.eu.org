{"title":"Light quality induces a shift in coccosphere morphology in Scyphosphaera apsteinii","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/4/383/7691498?rss=1","date":1718150400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The coccolithophore <span>Schyphosphaera apsteinii</span> produces distinct coccolith morphotypes and offers a unique insight into coccolith calcification, as the number of lopadoliths per cell increases under low light intensities. This study employs <span>S. apsteinii</span> to investigate the acclimated impact of light intensity and wavelength on cell physiology and coccosphere morphology. Our findings reveal a marked increase in lopadolith production when grown under reduced light intensity, with lower growth rates, higher chlorophyll concentration and elevated net photosynthetic rates. Reduced blue-light also caused an increase in lopadolith numbers, elevated chlorophyll concentrations and net photosynthetic rates. Conversely, such responses are less pronounced under reduced red-light. Moreover, reduced blue- and red-light treatments exhibited enhanced growth rates compared to the light-replete control, despite a reduction in light intensity. Our findings suggest that changes in light quality cause a shift in the coccosphere morphology, affecting cell physiology and potentially aiding light harvesting in <span>S. apsteinii</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"79ae741090b81daec3a328f2533940918c1b8a7f8ea905ad9308f1babf4b2dc2","category":"Environment"}
