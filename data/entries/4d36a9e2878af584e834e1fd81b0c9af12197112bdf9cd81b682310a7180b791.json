However, the corrosive nature of LBE on structural materials presents a significant challenge to its implementation in advanced nuclear reactors. Previous study has shown that deformation-induced twin boundaries can facilitate the penetration of LBE into steel in the early stage [<a href=\"#ozae044.939-B1\">1</a>]. And steel ferritization will occur together with the LBE corrosion which transforms face-centered cubic (FCC) steel matrix to body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. In our research, we employed four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.939-B2\">2</a>] and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) elemental mapping to investigate the intergranular corrosion of austenitic stainless steel 316L by LBE.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4d36a9e2878af584e834e1fd81b0c9af12197112bdf9cd81b682310a7180b791","category":"Environment"}
