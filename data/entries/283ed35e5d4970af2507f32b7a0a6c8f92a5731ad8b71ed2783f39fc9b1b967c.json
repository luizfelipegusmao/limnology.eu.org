{"title":"Study on the Impact of Microscopic Pore Structure Characteristics in Tight Sandstone on Microscopic Remaining Oil After Polymer Flooding","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1390/v1","date":1721216218000,"content":"The characteristics of tight sandstone, such as small pores, complex pore structures, low permeability, and low porosity, make it difficult to accurately characterize its pore structure. This represents a major challenge in the exploration and development of tight sandstone oil and gas reservoirs. This article conducts a simulation study on the impact of characteristic parameters such as pore size, coordination number, pore-throat ratio, and wettability on microscopic remaining oil after polymer flooding, thereby quantifying the types of remaining oil.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"283ed35e5d4970af2507f32b7a0a6c8f92a5731ad8b71ed2783f39fc9b1b967c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
