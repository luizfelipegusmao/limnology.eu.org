{"title":"Enhancing Strength and Performance of Self-Compacting Concrete for Integration in Department of Public Works and Highways Projects: A Value Engineering Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0927/v1","date":1726131085000,"content":"This research paper investigates the enhancement of strength and performance of self-compacting concrete (SCC) for integration in Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) projects using a value engineering approach. The study explores key elements of SCC's strength and performance, including mix design optimization, construction practices, and durability considerations. Strategies to optimize SCC's strength, durability, and workability are discussed, emphasizing the benefits of SCC in improving construction efficiency and quality control within DPW infrastructure. The study also identifies challenges and gaps in SCC utilization, such as standardized performance verification and cost considerations, and proposes future directions for advancing SCC technology in civil infrastructure development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f7047d87fe95f96bd1e9c65ddc808a5bc32f468c2f5fc621b5c8d5e137855308","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
