{"title":"Return to Work After Breast Cancer. A One-Year Mixed-Method Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1735/v1","date":1719371383000,"content":"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common invasive neoplasm and affects many women of working age. The return to work (RTW) of female survivors (BCSs) is associated with a better quality of life and longer survival. A tailored intervention to promote RTW was launched in 2022. A year later, the women were contacted to find out if RTW had occurred regularly and what their health conditions were compared to baseline. BCSs reported excessive fatigue, poor sleep quality, anxiety, depression and reduced work ability; these parameters had not improved significantly compared to baseline. Thematic analysis of the interviews confirmed the presence of personal, company and societal factors that could hinder or favor RTW. The interviews demonstrated that, even in an economically developed country that has provided numerous benefits for BCSs, protection is not always effective. Personalized intervention seems necessary to complete the process of reintegrating BCSs into their future working careers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4259c36df314da01a3c6001d8a9ac98ff1bef960e41b38042d7cb239900e0eda","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
