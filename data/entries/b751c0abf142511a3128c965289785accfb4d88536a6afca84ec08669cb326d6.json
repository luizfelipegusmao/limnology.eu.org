{"title":"Plastic Design of Metal Thin-Walled Cross-Sections of Any Shape Under Any Combination of Internal Forces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0512/v1","date":1725608382000,"content":"The introduction provides an overview of beginning the development of a plastic design of metal\nthin-walled cross-sections. This large study investigates in detail together 14 steel and four extruded\naluminium cross-sections. Six groups of various shaped cross-sections that consist of: four I-shaped\ndoubly symmetric sections (two I-sections, one I-section with lips, one H-section); three\nmonosymmetric sections with axis of symmetry z (monosymmetric I-section, T-section, diamond\nsection); four monosymmetric sections with axis of symmetry y (two channels, channel with inside\nlips, channel with outside lips); two point symmetric sections (Z-section with and without lips); four\nasymmetric sections (L-profile, sigma section, two closed sections: oblique and irregular sections;\nnon-warping sections along midline, but with negligible warping along the element's thicknesses: Tsection and L-profile are included in the above groups. Four extruded aluminium cross-sections are: I\n200a section, diamond section and closed oblique and irregular sections. For all 18 cross-sections,\nthe plastic section moduli of three kinds were calculated: Wpl,y,nB, Wpl,z,nB for bimoment not\nconsidered to be constraint; Wpl,y, Wpl,z, Wpl,wfor bimoment considered to be restraint; maximum\nvalues Wpl,y,max, Wpl,z,max, Wpl,w,max.\nThe values of cross-section plastic resistances Npl, Mpl,y,Rd, Mpl,z,Rd and Bpl are also calculated in\nnumerical examples. The values of cross-section properties are calculated in different ways to verify\nthe correctness of the results. The following ways of calculations are used: the rules in Eurocode EN\n1993-1-1: 2022; own MathCad programmes; own software.\nRecommendations for educational institutes and designers in practice are provided, including\nsimple formulae for all the cross-sectional properties for the doubly and monosymmetric I-shaped\nsections, channels and Z-sections. Formulae are presented in six tables containing formulae in the\ndimensionless form, which are useful for parametrical studies and formulae for direct designs.\nThe background of the Eurocode rules in EN 1993-1-1: 2022 is explained together with\nrecommendations about how to avoid problems with using them.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b751c0abf142511a3128c965289785accfb4d88536a6afca84ec08669cb326d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
