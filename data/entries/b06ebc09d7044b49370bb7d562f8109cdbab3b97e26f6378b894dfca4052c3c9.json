{"title":"Electron Ptychography of Twisted Bilayer MoS2 at Elevated Temperatures with &lt; 0.5 Å Resolution","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.691/7719870?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>In-situ Scanning/Transmission Electron Microscopy(S/TEM) experiments at elevated temperature provide new insights into dynamic processes such as phase transitions, crystal growth, surface reactions, and catalysis[<a href=\"#ozae044.691-B1\">1</a>]. Among electron microscopy techniques, electron ptychography is a powerful technique with many advantages such as high dose efficiency, high contrast, and most notably exceptional sub-angstrom resolution that is better than the resolution of physical lenses[<a href=\"#ozae044.691-B2\">2</a>]. However, ptychographic reconstruction algorithms assume a constant object throughout the 4D STEM data acquisition [<a href=\"#ozae044.691-B3\">3</a>], necessitating high sample stability. In the case of heated specimens, mechanical vibrations [<a href=\"#ozae044.691-B4\">4</a>], drift [<a href=\"#ozae044.691-B4\">4</a>], and atomic mobilities increase, potentially limiting the convergence and achievable resolution of in-situ ptychography. These constraints raise the question of whether deep sub-angstrom resolution (better than 0.5 angstroms) that has been demonstrated at room temperature can be extended to in-situ studies at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate full field electron ptychography reconstruction of twisted bilayer(tBL) molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) at temperatures up to 400°C. Our results demonstrate spatial resolutions of 0.5 Å or better at high temperatures, indicating that electron ptychography of 2D materials at elevated temperature is achievable with no loss in spatial resolution. We use these data to study how the structure and local strains of tBL MoS<sub>2</sub> evolves as a function of temperature. Our methods are readily adaptable to other 2D materials and serve as a new avenue to enable deep sub-angstrom resolution for in-situ STEM experiments.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b06ebc09d7044b49370bb7d562f8109cdbab3b97e26f6378b894dfca4052c3c9","category":"Environment"}
