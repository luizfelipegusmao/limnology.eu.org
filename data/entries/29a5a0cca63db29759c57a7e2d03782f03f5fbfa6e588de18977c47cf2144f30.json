{"title":"Establishing age and gender-specific serum creatinine reference ranges for Thai pediatric population","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300369","date":1710252000000,"content":"<p>by Sakon Suwanrungroj, Parichart Pattarapanitchai, Sirinart Chomean, Chollanot Kaset</p>\r\n\r\nAccurate assessment of kidney function in children requires age and gender-specific reference ranges for serum creatinine. Traditional reference values, often derived from adult populations and different ethnic backgrounds, may not be suitable for children. This study aims to establish specific reference ranges for serum creatinine in the Thai pediatric population, addressing the gap in localized and age-appropriate diagnostic criteria. This retrospective study analyzed serum creatinine levels from Thai children aged newborn to 18 years, collected from the Laboratory Information System of the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health from January 2017 to December 2021. The Bhattacharya method was employed to establish reference ranges, considering different age groups and genders. The study compared these newly established reference values with international studies, including those of Schlebusch H., Pottel H., and Chuang GT., to validate their relevance and accuracy. A total of 27,642 data entries (15,396 males and 12,246 females) were analyzed. The study established distinct reference ranges for serum creatinine, which varied significantly across different age groups and between genders. These ranges were found to gradually increase with age from 2 months to 18 years. The study also highlighted notable differences in reference values when compared with other ethnic populations. The study successfully establishes tailored reference ranges for serum creatinine in Thai children, providing a valuable tool for more accurate diagnosis and monitoring of kidney health in this demographic. This initiative marks a significant advancement in pediatric nephrology in Thailand and suggests a need for continuous refinement of these ranges and further research in this area.","author":"Sakon Suwanrungroj","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"29a5a0cca63db29759c57a7e2d03782f03f5fbfa6e588de18977c47cf2144f30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
