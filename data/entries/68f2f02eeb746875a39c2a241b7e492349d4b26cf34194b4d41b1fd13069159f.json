{"title":"Identifying Key Factors in Papilla Growth Around Implants: Focus on Intraoral Negative Pressure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0832/v1","date":1726041177000,"content":"Background: The absence of interdental papillae in dental prosthetics often results in unsatisfactory esthetic outcomes, such as black triangles and elongated clinical crowns. Although previous research has shown that gingival papillae can regenerate in a coronal direction, the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not fully understood. Various theories have been proposed as potential explanations. Materials and Methods: This study evaluated several factors potentially influencing papilla growth, including adjacent elements, buc-cal-lingual papilla width, contact point position, convergent neck, crown overcontour, and intraoral negative pressure. A conceptual map was created to organize these factors, followed by their classification using a modified Overton Window. The principle of parsimony (Occam's Razor) was applied to identify the most plausible cause-related factors, categorizing them as causal relationship factors, filtered out factors, essential factors, or influencing factors. A mind map was used for visual grouping. Results: The analysis identified intraoral negative pressure as the most plausible cause-related factor for spontaneous papilla growth. Factors such as inflammation and drug-induced hyperplasia were excluded due to their association with unhealthy tissue. Other factors were classified as essential or influencing, but without direct causal links to papilla growth. Conclusions: Intraoral negative pressure is likely a key contributor to spontaneous papilla growth around implants. This finding, supported by abductive reasoning and the exclusion of less plausible factors, offers a new direction for enhancing esthetic outcomes in dental prosthetics, though further research is needed to confirm this causal relationship.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68f2f02eeb746875a39c2a241b7e492349d4b26cf34194b4d41b1fd13069159f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
