{"title":"High Throughput Determination of Infectious Virus Titers by Kinetic Measurement of infection-Induced Changes in Cell Morphology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0809/v1","date":1710426789000,"content":"Infectivity assays are the key analytical technology for development of manufacturing processes for virus-based therapeutics. Here, we introduce a novel assay format that utilizes label-free bright field images to determine the kinetics of infection-dependent changes in cell morphology. In particular, cell rounding is directly proportional to the amount of infectious virus applied, enabling rapid determination of viral titers in relation to a standard curve. Our kinetic infectious virus titer (KIT) assay is stability-indicating and, due to its sensitive readout method, provides results within 24 hours post-infection. Compared to traditional infectivity assays, which depend on a single readout of an infection endpoint, cumulated analysis of kinetic data by a fit model results in precise results (CV &amp;lt; 20%) based on only three wells per sample. This approach allows for a high throughput with ~400 samples processed by a single operator per week. We demonstrate the applicability of the KIT assay for VSV-GP and NDV, but it can potentially be extended to a wide range of viruses that induce morphological changes upon infection. The versatility of this assay, combined with its independence from specific instruments or software, makes it a promising solution to overcome the analytical bottleneck in infectivity assays within the pharmaceutical industry and as a routine method in academic research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9211904fc9804385b3e37f577f7d81abe5515e2137a7c029b3dbe81ac13a1b01","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
