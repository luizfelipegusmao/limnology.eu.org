{"title":"Association of Methodologies for Assessing Environmental Damage and Impacts Applied to Mechanized Forest Harvesting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2114/v1","date":1717145726000,"content":"The advancement of mechanization in forestry has bolstered productivity within the sector while simultaneously precipitating impacts necessitating deeper comprehension for the attainment of heightened levels of environmental sustainability in forestry management. The aim of this study was to apply an instrument for assessing the environmental damage and impacts of forest harvesting in commercial Eucalyptus plantations, based on a combination of methodologies. The environmental impact assessment methodology for forest harvesting was applied by combining interaction network approaches and impact assessment matrices. This methodology was then applied to a commercial Eucalyptus plantation in the municipality of São Pedro, state of São Paulo, Brazil. The results show that timber transportation activities had the highest positive and negative environmental indices. The most significant negative impacts refer to the depletion of water resources and erosion, while the positive impacts are regional development and job creation. The most significant changes, both positive and negative, were observed in a greater number of environmental impacts for the physical and anthropic environment, with fewer for the biotic environment. The combination of methodologies has potential as an expedient tool for planning forestry operations, providing practical results for decision-making, making production more sustainable and applicable to different crops and production systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3174ce9b3f364c59cec24e1cfdb3b49cdc5f4a3b29c8d16b674f3af9fd42cbc0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
