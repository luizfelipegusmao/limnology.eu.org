{"title":"An Uncertainty Relation for Retarded Gravity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1154/v1","date":1715928989000,"content":"In recent years retarded gravity has explained many of the mysteries surrounding the \"missing mass\" related to galactic rotation curves, the Tully-Fisher relations, and gravitational lensing phenomena. Indeed a recent paper analyzing 143 galaxies, has demonstrated that retarded gravity will suffice to explain the galaxies rotation curves without the need to postulate dark matter for multiple types of galaxies. Moreover, it also demystified the \"missing mass\" related to galactic clusters and elliptic galaxies in which excess matter wad derived through the virial theorem.  Here we give a mathematical criterion which specifies the cases for which retardation is important for gravity (and when it is not). The criterion takes the form of an \"uncertainty\" relation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7fadb45ddd4e5d0e1bbe354fce53c6e9f32b5b9ab975694a97a669714651d125","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
