{"title":"Hoof slip duration at impact in galloping Thoroughbred ex-racehorses trialling eight shoe-surface combinations","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311899","date":1728655200000,"content":"<p>by Kate Horan, James Coburn, Kieran Kourdache, Peter Day, Henry Carnall, Liam Brinkley, Dan Harborne, Lucy Hammond, Sean Millard, Renate Weller, Thilo Pfau</p>\r\n\r\nHorseshoes used during racing are a major determinant of safety as they play a critical role in providing traction with the ground surface. Although excessive hoof slip is detrimental and can predispose to instabilities, falls and injuries, some slip is essential to dissipate energy and lower stresses on the limb tissues during initial loading. This study aimed to quantify hoof slip duration in retired Thoroughbred racehorses galloping over turf and artificial (Martin Collins Activ-Track) tracks at the British Racing School in the following four shoeing conditions: 1) aluminium; 2) steel; 3) GluShu (aluminium-rubber composite); and 4) barefoot. High-speed video cameras (Sony DSC-RX100M5) filmed 389 hoof-ground interactions from 13 galloping Thoroughbreds at 1000 frames per second. A marker wand secured to the lateral aspect of the hoof wall aided tracking of horizontal and vertical hoof position in Tracker software over time, so the interval of hoof displacement immediately following impact (hoof slip duration) could be identified. Data were collected from leading and non-leading forelimbs at speeds ranging from 24–56 km h<sup>-1</sup>. Linear mixed models assessed whether surface, shoeing condition or speed influenced hoof slip duration (significance at p≤0.05). Day and horse-jockey pair were included as random factors and speed was included as a covariate. Mean hoof slip duration was similar amongst forelimbs and the non-leading hindlimb (20.4–21.5 ms) but was shortest in the leading hindlimb (18.3±10.2 ms, mean ± 2.S.D.). Slip durations were 2.1–3.5 ms (p≤0.05) longer on the turf than on the artificial track for forelimbs and the non-leading hindlimb, but they were 2.5 ms shorter on the turf than on the artificial track in the leading hindlimb (p = 0.025). In the leading hindlimb, slip durations were also significantly longer for the aluminium shoeing condition compared to barefoot, by 3.7 ms. There was a significant negative correlation between speed and slip duration in the leading forelimb. This study emphasises the importance of evaluating individual limb biomechanics when applying external interventions that impact the asymmetric galloping gait of the horse. Hoof slip durations and the impact of shoe-surface effects on slip were limb specific. Further work is needed to relate specific limb injury occurrence to these hoof slip duration data.","author":"Kate Horan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"151dd6164493598e295ad243b2cec2df229fae5775e4382a77baad82da48623b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
