Carey</p>\r\nBackground <p>Mild stroke affects more than half the stroke population, yet there is limited evidence characterizing cognition over time in this population, especially with predictive approaches applicable at the individual-level. We aimed to identify patterns of recovery and the best combination of demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors predicting individual-level cognitive state at 3- and 12-months after mild stroke.</p> Methods <p>In this prospective cohort study, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was administered at 3–7 days, 3- and 12-months post-stroke. Raw changes in MoCA and impairment rates (defined as MoCA&lt;24 points) were compared between assessment time-points. Trajectory clusters were identified using variations of ≥1 point in MoCA scores. To further compare clusters, additional assessments administered at 3- and 12-months were included. Gamma and Quantile mixed-effects regression were used to predict individual MoCA scores over time, using baseline clinical and demographic variables. Model predictions were fitted for each stroke survivor and evaluated using model cross-validation to identify the overall best predictors of cognitive recovery.</p> Results <p>Participants’ (n = 119) MoCA scores improved from baseline to 3-months (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001); and decreased from 3- to 12-months post-stroke (<i>p</i> = 0.010). Cognitive impairment rates decreased significantly from baseline to 3-months (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001), but not between 3- and 12-months (<i>p</i> = 0.168). Nine distinct trajectory clusters were identified. Clinical characteristics between clusters at each time-point varied in cognitive outcomes but not in clinical and/or activity participation outcomes. Cognitive performance at 3- and 12-months was best predicted by younger age, higher physical activity levels, and left-hemisphere lesion side.</p> Conclusion <p>More than half of mild-stroke survivors are at risk of cognitive decline one year after stroke, even when preceded by a significantly improving pattern in the first 3-months of recovery. Physical activity was the only modifiable factor independently associated with cognitive recovery. Individual-level prediction methods may inform the timing and personalized application of future interventions to maximize cognitive recovery post-stroke.</p>","author":"Juan Pablo Saa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"328ac12b70a8fd5e344a74d47a1ff9ecd85c3d44cb12b4b88bf482ca947df697","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
