{"title":"NOMA-Empowered Technologies for Non-line of Sight Environments: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0219/v1","date":1719910546000,"content":"Enhancing spectral efficiency, especially in Non-line-of-Sight environments, is emerging as a pivotal necessity when dealing with the evolving landscape of 5G networks and beyond, sur-passing the capabilities of previous 4G systems to achieve a high information rate combined with minimal interference.  Contrary to depending on the traditional Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) systems to tackle the issues caused by Non-line-of-Sight (NLoS) environments, advanced wireless networks are focusing on adopting innovative models such as Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), MIMO, IRS technology, etc. In this paper, we present technologies that can be integrated with NOMA to enhance communication reliability in environments that suffer from issues such as limited coverage and lower spectral efficiency mainly caused by huge obstacles. Our exploration includes the fundamental concepts of Cooperative NOMA (C-NOMA), Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (IRS), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and Energy Harvesting (HV), which adds a layer of sophistication, promising not only improved connectivity but also contributing to a more reliable and environmentally friendly data trans-mission landscape.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a48df00d77f9d7348b586cb2c7c60d3502ea4d4ffd67739f1fbd2878e0cdfc5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
