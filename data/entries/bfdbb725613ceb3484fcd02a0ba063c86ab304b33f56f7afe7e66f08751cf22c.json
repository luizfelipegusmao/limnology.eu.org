{"title":"Production of Monoclonal Antibodies for Therapeutic Purposes: Applications, Techniques, and Improvement","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1854/v1","date":1716945999000,"content":"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become an increasingly important therapeutic modality in recent years, with applications in oncology, hematology, and immunology. This review discusses the production of therapeutic mAbs, including the various types of mAbs (murine, chimeric, humanized, and fully human), their key applications, and the techniques used for their production, including hybridoma technology, single B cell antibody technology, and phage display technology. The review then proposes advanced techniques to overcome them. These include microfluidic sorting, alternative expression systems (including plants, bacteria, and yeast, and cell-free production systems), and the development of complex antibody formats like bi-specific monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, antibody-drug conjugates, and nanobody development. These advanced techniques promise to enhance the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and scalability of mAb production, paving the way for more effective therapeutic applications. This review highlights the theoretical significance of integrating innovative technologies to overcome existing challenges in mAb production, ultimately advancing the field of precision medicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bfdbb725613ceb3484fcd02a0ba063c86ab304b33f56f7afe7e66f08751cf22c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
