{"title":"Emergence of crucial evidence catalyzing the origin tracing of SARS-CoV-2","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309557","date":1725026400000,"content":"<p>by Shunmei Chen, Cihan Ruan, Yutong Guo, Jia Chang, Haohao Yan, Liang Chen, Yongzhong Duan, Guangyou Duan, Jinlong Bei, Xin Li, Shan Gao</p>\r\n\r\nSince the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), its genetic and geographical origins remain unclear, resulting in suspicions about its natural origin. In one of our previous studies, we reported the presence of a furin cleavage site RRAR in the junction region between S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein, which was discovered as the first crucial clue for the origin tracing of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we conducted an integrative analysis of new genome data from bat <i>Sarbecovirus</i> strains reported after the COVID-19 outbreak. The primary results included the identification of BANAL-20-52, Rp22DB159, and S18CXBatR24 as three close relatives of SARS-CoV-2 and the successful detection of seven out of nine key genomic features (designated as RC0-7 and <i>ORF8</i>) observed in wild types of SARS-CoV-2 in the three close relatives from Laos, Vietnam, and Yunnan province of China, respectively. The most significant contribution of the present study lies in the detection of RC1 in wild genotype in a bat <i>Sarbecovirus</i> population BANAL-20-52 belonging to. Encoding a segment of the <i>NSP3</i> protein, RC1 was discovered as the second crucial clue for the origin tracing of SARS-CoV-2. Although RC0, encoding the junction furin cleavage site, remains undetected outside of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, Feuang of Laos is the sole place where eight of the nine wild-type features (RC1-7 and <i>ORF8</i>) have been detected.","author":"Shunmei Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cae4bae460858c5db19514d56ba758f00856525555b0bfc89c9005856213b0bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
