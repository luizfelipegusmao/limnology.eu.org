{"title":"Deep Learning-based Automated Measurement of Effective Radiation Dose by 18F-FDG PET/CT","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1739/v1","date":1729609398000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Calculating the radiation dose from CT in 18F-PET/CT examinations poses a significant challenge. The objective of this study is to develop a deep learning-based automated program that standardizes the measurement of radiation doses. Methods: The Torso CT was segmented into six distinct regions using TotalSegmentator. An automated program was employed to extract the necessary information and calculate the effective dose (ED) of PET/CT. The accuracy of our automated program was verified by comparing the EDs calculated by the program with those determined by nuclear medicine physician (n=30). Additionally, we compared the EDs obtained from an older PET/CT scanner with those from a newer PET/CT scanner (n=42). Results: The CT ED calculated by the automated program was not significantly different from that calculated by the nuclear medicine physician (3.67 ± 0.61 mSv and 3.62 ± 0.60 mSv, respectively, p = 0.7623). Similarly, the total ED showed no significant difference between the two calculation methods (8.10 ± 1.40 mSv and 8.05 ± 1.39 mSv, respectively, p = 0.8957). A very strong correlation was observed in both CT ED and total ED between the two measurements (r2 = 0.9981 and 0.9996, respectively). When comparing the older and newer PET/CT scanners, the CT ED was not significantly different. However, the PET ED was significantly lower in the newer scanner than in the older scanner (4.39 ± 0.91 mSv and 6.00 ± 1.17 mSv, respectively, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Consequently, the total ED was significantly lower in the newer scanner than in the older scanner (8.22 ± 1.53 mSv and 9.65 ± 1.34 mSv, respectively, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: We successfully developed a deep learning-based automated program that calculates the ED of torso 18F-PET/CT, thereby eliminating inter-operator variability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c03ce10fcb9dfff9f6a0879d5abf5359cfe5b762c20d4042ac1ea9033681a707","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
