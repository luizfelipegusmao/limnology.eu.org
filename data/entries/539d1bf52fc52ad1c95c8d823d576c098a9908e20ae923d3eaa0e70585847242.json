{"title":"Association of Postoperative Serum Lactate Levels with Acute Kidney Injury in Mexican Patients Undergoing Cardio‚ÄêSurgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2011/v1","date":1714481523000,"content":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a highly prevalent and a critical complication of cardiac surgery (CS). Serum lactate levels (sLac) have consistently shown an association with morbimortality after CS. We performed a cross-sectional study including 264 adult patients that had a cardiac surgery between January and December 2020. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with AKI development. We measured the postoperative levels of sLac to all participants immediately after CS (T0) and after 4 hours (T4) of the surgical intervention. Linear regression model was carried out to identify the factors influencing both levels of sLac. We identified four risk predictors of AKI; one was preoperative (atrial fibrillation), one intraoperative (cardiopulmonary bypass time), and two were postoperative (length of hospital stay and postoperative sLac). T0 and T4 sLac levels were higher among CS-AKI patients than in Non-CS-AKI. Postoperative sLac levels were significant independent predictors of CSA-AKI and the sLac levels are influenced by length of hospital stay, the number of packed red blood cells transfused and the use of furosemide in CS-AKI patients. These findings may facilitate the earlier identification of patients susceptible to AKI after CS.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"539d1bf52fc52ad1c95c8d823d576c098a9908e20ae923d3eaa0e70585847242","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
