Method: The large Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was utilized to study any association between the use of ECMO in adults over age of 18 on mortality and complications with a diagnosis of cardiogenic shocks. Results: ICD-10 codes for ECMO, and cardiogenic shock for available years 2016-2020 were utilized. A total of 796,585 (age 66.5±14.4) patients had a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock excluding Impella. 13,160 (age 53.7±15.4) were treated with ECMO without IABP . Total inpatient mortality without any device was 32.7%. It was 47.9% with ECMO. Using multivariate analysis adjusting for 47 variables such as age, gender, race, lactic acidosis, three-vessel intervention, left main myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, systolic heart failure, acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, chronic renal disease, etc., ECMO utilization remained highly associated with mortality (OR: 1.78, CI: 1.6-1.9, p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5fc4081c39f34d9ec6dbd1d3d0383fbe11f60c17e99b8376bed7f788ce00e7a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
