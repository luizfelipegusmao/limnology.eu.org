However, the dense packing of biomacromolecules within cells poses challenges for accurate molecule identification. Cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) is the method of choice to study cellular architecture at high resolution [<a href=\"#ozae044.342-B1\">1</a>]. However, the resolution of tomograms reconstructed from tilt series is often limited by radiation damage, restricting the distinguishability of small or structurally similar particles. Subtomogram averaging has emerged as a valuable tool for improving resolution by averaging signals from thousands of particle images, which has achieved resolutions of ∼3 Å [<a href=\"#ozae044.342-B2\">2</a>]. Nevertheless, this method is throughput limited and distinguishing compositionally and conformationally distinct states of a molecule, especially rare ones, remains a challenge. Here, we present a novel approach utilizing 2D template matching (2DTM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.342-B3\">3</a>] to improve the detection and classification of molecules in cryo-EM images. 2DTM is an emerging method for the detection of molecules in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images of cells that leverages the preservation of high-resolution molecular features in single-tilt images. We introduce the concept of \"baited classification\" for the classification of conformationally different states.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"70dff583f3598078f055e67dd8907083eb90b220a5a1a183af5847b78675a2a0","category":"Environment"}
