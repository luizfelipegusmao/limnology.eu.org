In this study, we examined condition-dependent female aggression and its effects on mating success and frequency of pre-copulatory sexual cannibalism in the jumping spider <i>Phidippus audax</i> Hentz 1845. We examined two of the leading hypotheses of why sexual cannibalism may occur, (1) female mate choice and (2) adaptive female foraging. We separated 137 adult virgin female <i>P. audax</i> into three feeding treatments: (1) well-fed spiders, (2) 14-day food deprived, and (3) 28-day food deprived. We recorded weight loss (14- and 28-day treatments) and survival rates. We conducted mating trials to measure the proportion of non-aggressive and aggressive male and female behaviors, male mating success, and pre-copulatory sexual cannibalism. Females deprived of food had higher weight loss and lower survival rates than well-fed females. In addition, food deprived female spiders exhibited higher proportions of aggressive behaviors and pre-copulatory sexual cannibalism, and lower mating success compared to well-fed spiders. We found that as male size increased females were less likely to cannibalize males, but we found no effect of male body condition on whether a male mated with or was cannibalized by a female. Our results are consistent with the adaptive foraging hypothesis and corroborates prior research on pre-copulatory sexual cannibalism.</p>","author":"Michael E. Vickers, \nMarianne W.
