{"title":"Memristors in the Context of Security: A Brief Meta-Review of the State of the Art","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1555/v1","date":1716475557000,"content":"Over the last decade, a lot of research has been conducted on memristors. Most of this research focusses on using memristors for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications and to fabricate non-volatile memory, but also the security aspects of memristors have been examined. The current study summarises and compares five reviews on the security aspects of memristors. These reviews cover two different perspectives: (1) security applications of memristors such as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) or True Random Number Generators (TRNGs), and (2) potential threats when using memristors to train and store neural networks. The comparison of the reviews reveals that different sets of studies are included in the reviews and different characterisations of the studies are provided. This shows that different perspectives are necessary to get a comprehensive overview of the security aspects of memristors. By synthesising the perspectives of different reviews, this study helps to get such an overview.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44a5a8b9e7a69c84f9ef7e10cc223b5364c1f70ef6319255aa3e9bc85dbda389","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
