{"title":"The Clinical Utility of Molecular Imaging Using Nuclear Medicine Tools in the Management of All Stages of Adult Gliomas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1159/v1","date":1718622062000,"content":"Gliomas are common primary central nervous system (CNS) tumours which are often very difficult to diagnose, stage and manage because of their heterogeneity and molecular aberrations. The notable hallmark of gliomas is integrated genome mutations and methylome that correlates with distinctive patterns of transcription that potentiates glioma heterogeneity, angiogenesis and ultimately poor prognosis. The World Health Organization (WHO) has decided to reclassify gliomas based on molecular markers rather than the traditional anatomical basis; use of Nuclear Medicine techniques e.g. SPECT/PET and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques based on molecular markers is set to become the future gold standards. This has led to the investigations on potential for the use of non-invasive imaging techniques such as  [68Ga]68Ga-RGD positron emission tomography (PET) to be utilised routinely in clinical practice based on angiogenic markers and also the potential to add information that may assist in drug-design and therapeutic decision making. This review aims to provide an overview of the basis of recent advances in glioma imaging using molecular targeting with positron emission tomography and SPECT imaging, as well as the role in patient management i.e. diagnosis, staging, recurrence detection etc.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad8671b38584aa0446a86a9b1f14eb1ee0e37c67ee3886bf14f833e17d662585","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
