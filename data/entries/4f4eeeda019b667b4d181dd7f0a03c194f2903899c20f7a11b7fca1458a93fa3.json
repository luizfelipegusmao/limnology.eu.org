{"title":"Perfluorotetradecanoic acid exposure to adult male rats stimulates corticosterone biosynthesis but inhibits aldosterone production","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24135?af=R","date":1713272355000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PFTeDA) is a novel perfluoroalkyl substance that ubiquitously exists in the environment. However, whether PFTeDA affects adrenal cortex function remains unclear. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (age of 60 days) were daily administered with PFTeDA (0, 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg body weight) through gavage for 28 days. PFTeDA did not change body and adrenal gland weights. PFTeDA markedly elevated serum corticosterone level at 10 mg/kg but lowering serum aldosterone level at this dosage without influencing serum adrenocorticotropic hormone level. PFTeDA thickened zona fasciculata without affecting zona glomerulosa. PFTeDA remarkably upregulated the expression of corticosterone biosynthetic genes (<i>Mc2r, Scarb1</i>, <i>Star</i>, <i>Cyp21</i>, <i>Cyp11b1,</i> and <i>Hsd11b1</i>) and their proteins, whereas downregulating aldosterone biosynthetic enzyme <i>Cyp11b2</i> and its protein, thereby distinctly altering their serum levels. PFTeDA markedly downregulated the expression of antioxidant genes (<i>Sod1</i> and <i>Sod2</i>) and their proteins at 10 mg/kg. PFTeDA significantly decreased SIRT1/PGC1α and AMPK signaling while stimulating AKT1/mTOR signaling. Corticosterone significantly inhibited testosterone production by adult Leydig cells at &gt;0.1 μM in vitro; however aldosterone significantly stimulated testosterone production at 0.1 nM. In conclusion, exposure to PFTeDA at male rat adulthood causes corticosterone excess and aldosterone deficiency via SIRT1/PGC1α, AMPK, and AKT1/mTOR signals, which in turn additively leads to testosterone deficiency.</p>","author":"Yingfen Ying, \nShaowei Wang, \nLu Han, \nHuitao Li, \nYiyan Wang, \nJieqiang Lv, \nRen‐shan Ge, \nYunbing Tang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"4f4eeeda019b667b4d181dd7f0a03c194f2903899c20f7a11b7fca1458a93fa3","category":"Environment"}
