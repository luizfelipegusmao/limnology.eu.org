{"title":"A Conjecture on the Possible Another Supermassive Black Hole in the Bar of Our Milky Way","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1730/v3","date":1722339572000,"content":"In the bar of our Milky Way, there should be another supermassive black hole B which is with the mass almost 10−2~10−5 the Sgr A* and with a distance almost 10,000 lightyears from the Sgr A*. The bar is formed by the stars that are orbiting around the two black holes Sgr A* and B. And, in the bar, a lots of stars orbit around B while another lots of stars around Sgr A*. The two orbits form the peanut shape with “x-shaped structure” in the bar, while the boxy core is formed with all of the three orbits. And, the orbits of the stars out of the bar could be repulsed to a distant place by the black hole B to form the galactic spiral arms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b39dd55cc7ad38a116d2c785611b6685cc311533bef8e595440669cf8cff26f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
