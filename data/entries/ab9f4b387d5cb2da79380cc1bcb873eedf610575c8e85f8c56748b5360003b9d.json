{"title":"Inequalities involving Higher Degree Polynomial Functions in $\\pi(x)$","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1276/v5","date":1721901909000,"content":"The primary purpose of this article is to study the asymptotic and numerical estimates in detail for higher degree polynomials in $\\pi(x)$ having a general expression of the form, \\begin{align*} P(\\pi(x)) - \\frac{e x}{\\log x} Q(\\pi(x/e)) + R(x) \\end{align*} $P$, $Q$ and $R$ are arbitrarily chosen polynomials and $\\pi(x)$ denotes the \\textit{Prime Counting Function}. The proofs require specific order estimates involving $\\pi(x)$ and the \\textit{Second Chebyshev Function} $\\psi(x)$, as well as the famous \\textit{Prime Number Theorem} in addition to certain meromorphic properties of the \\textit{Riemann Zeta Function} $\\zeta(s)$ and results regarding its non-trivial zeros. A few generalizations of these concepts have also been discussed in detail towards the later stages of the paper, along with citing some important applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab9f4b387d5cb2da79380cc1bcb873eedf610575c8e85f8c56748b5360003b9d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
