It is the most important sign of long-term chronic undernutrition and public health problem in Ethiopia. However, little information was known regarding determinants of stunting among adolescents since it had mostly been investigated in late infancy, especially among children under the age of five. Therefore, identifying determinants of stunting among adolescent girl is still crucial.</p> Objective <p>To identify determinants of stunting among adolescent girls in schools of Digo Tsion Town, Northwest Ethiopia, 2022.</p> Methods and materials <p>Case-control study was conducted among 417 adolescent girls (104 cases and 313 controls) in schools of Digo Tsion Town with computer generated simple random sampling technique. World Health Organization Anthroplus 2007 software was used for analyzing anthropometrics data. Data was collected by epicollect5 mobile application through interview by using structured questionnaire. The data was entered in epi data 4.6 and exported into Statistical Package for Social Science version 26. Variables with p- value â‰¤ 0.25 in bivariable analysis were candidate for multivariable analysis. Model fitness was checked by Hosmer and Lemon Show fitness of test. Variables having a P-value &lt; 0.05 in multivariable analysis were declared as statistically significant at 95% Cl. The result was presented by statement, figures, and tables.</p> Results <p>A total of 409 (100 cases and 309 controls) adolescent girls participated, with a response rate of 96% for cases and 98.72% for controls. Food insecurity (AOR = 2.13, CI [1.15, 3.93]), low dietary diversity score (AOR = 1.99, CI [1.06, 3.73]), drinking coffee/tea immediately while eating meals (AOR = 2.19, CI [1.22, 3.95]), not getting nutritional counsel (AOR = 2.07, CI [1.17, 3.66]), chronic illness (AOR = 3.78, CI [1.16, 12.3]), and not visited by health extension workers at home (AOR = 1.85, CI [1.03, 3.31]) were statistically significant determinants of stunting.</p> Conclusion <p>Stunting among adolescents is influenced by a low dietary diversity score, a food-insecure household, drinking coffee or tea immediately while eating a meal, not receiving nutritional counseling, having a chronic illness, and not being visited by health extension workers at home. Future researchers would do better to undertake prospective studies. Health extension workers are better able to provide nutritional counsel for adolescent.</p>","author":"Ambaw Abebaw Emrie","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"16f57b38510e148ca6710709f4a7f4fd943fef811b8597934a8fb8d6babbd136","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
