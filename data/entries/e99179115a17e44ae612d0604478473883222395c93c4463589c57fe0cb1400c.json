{"title":"Effects of Biodegradation of Biobased Mulch Films Reinforced with Cellulose from Waste Mango","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0089/v1","date":1725276862000,"content":"Excessive use of plastic mulches, has triggered a series of environmental problems, this is due to the large volumes generated and their low or non-existent degradability. For this reason, materials with similar characteristics to synthetic mulches are sought, but with a biodegradable character. In this work, mulches films were produced from gelatin (GC) and chitosan (ChC), reinforced with mango cellulose. Its biodegradation time in soil and a photographic analysis with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were determined. GC sample presented a biodegradability of 97% at 30 days, and ChC lost 95% of its weight after 70 days exposed to soil. The SEM results for both mulch films presented some color changes after 30 days, completely fractured, the growth of mycelium on the surface and the presence of pores are observed. Obtaining polymers from waste materials, such as mango, represents an important task to obtain cellulose that can be used both to reinforce and to provide biodegradable character to biobased materials which can be degraded by microorganisms present in the soil. FTIR spectra revealed a decrease in hydroxyl groups, amides and carbonyls bands as the days of degradation increased.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e99179115a17e44ae612d0604478473883222395c93c4463589c57fe0cb1400c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
