{"title":"The Coupling Interaction of Soil Water and Soil Organic Carbon after Vegetation Restoration on China&rsquo;s Loess Plateau","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1229/v1","date":1713424322000,"content":"Soil water content (SWC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) are two important factors to consider when revegetation in degraded land of arid and semiarid areas. Knowing the response of SWC and SOC to vegetation restoration as well as their coupling interaction is important for sustainability of vegetation restoration. In this study, three common plantations of the same recovery years were selected on Chinaâ€™s Loess Plateau, which included Pinus sylvestris, Pinus tabuliformis and Populus simonii, to evaluate the response of SWC and SOC to vegetation restoration as well as their interactions, and then revealed the influencing factors of SWC and SOC variations. Results showed that compared to the grassland, three plantations all exacerbated the deficit of deep soil water, but Populus simonii increased the SOC, while the rest all decreased the SOC. And tradeoff of Populus simonii had the lowest root mean squared error (RMSD). Therefore, Populus simonii was identified as representing a suitable revegetation technique for this region. There was strong interaction between SWC and SOC for shallow soil layers. Land use type (LUT) has an important effect on deep SOC variations, while SOC and soil texture for deep SWC variations. The results were helpful to the sustainable development of artificial forests in this region as well as other similar arid and semiarid areas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8971834c29bdf51116dc946c1a0d291ac52f647b74a432993e27b0c06bdf5667","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
