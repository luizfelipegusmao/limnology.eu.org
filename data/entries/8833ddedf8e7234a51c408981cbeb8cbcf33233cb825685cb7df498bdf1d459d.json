{"title":"Quality prediction of whole‐grain rice noodles using backpropagation artificial neural network","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13324?af=R","date":1712732400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Whole-grain rice noodles are a kind of healthy food with rich nutritional value, and their product quality has a notable impact on consumer acceptability. The quality evaluation model is of great significance to the optimization of product quality. However, there are few methods that can establish a product quality prediction model with multiple preparation conditions as inputs and various quality evaluation indexes as outputs. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) model based on a backpropagation (BP) algorithm was used to predict the comprehensive quality changes of whole-grain rice noodles under different preparation conditions, which provided a new way to improve the quality of extrusion rice products.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that the BP-ANN using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm and the optimal topology (4-11-8) gave the best performance. The correlation coefficients (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup>) for the training, validation, testing, and global data sets of the BP neural network were 0.927, 0.873, 0.817, and 0.903, respectively. In the validation test, the percentage error in the quality prediction of whole-grain rice noodles was within 10%, indicating that the BP-ANN could accurately predict the quality of whole-grain rice noodles prepared under different conditions.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study showed that the quality prediction model of whole-grain rice noodles based on the BP-ANN algorithm was effective, and suitable for predicting the quality of whole-grain rice noodles prepared under different conditions. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Chujun Wang, \nXin Shi, \nJianyi Xue, \nSiming Zhao, \nCaihua Jia, \nMeng Niu, \nBinjia Zhang, \nYan Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"8833ddedf8e7234a51c408981cbeb8cbcf33233cb825685cb7df498bdf1d459d","category":"Environment"}
