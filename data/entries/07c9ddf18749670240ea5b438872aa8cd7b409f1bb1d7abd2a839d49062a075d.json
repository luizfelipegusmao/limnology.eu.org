An optimal KC-BC was synthesized by the co-pyrolysis of a blend containing KC and DS in the ratio of 1:3 at 600 °C for 1 h and at the heating rate of 10 °C/min. This KC-BC was characterized through X-ray diffractometry, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive analysis X-ray, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis. The as-prepared KC-BC exhibited a BET surface area of 59.88 m<sup>2</sup>/g and a mean pore diameter of 11.42 nm, indicating its mesoporous structure. Superior AE % of 100 mg/L Pb<sup>2+</sup> solution (95.10%) was obtained using 0.30 g of KC-BC at 35 °C for 210 min. The adsorption studies indicated that the Langmuir isotherm and the pseudo second-order kinetic model best described the adsorption of Pb<sup>2+</sup> by the prepared KC-BC. Finally, the regeneration of the KC-BC for multiple cycles was explored as well.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"07c9ddf18749670240ea5b438872aa8cd7b409f1bb1d7abd2a839d49062a075d","category":"Environment"}
