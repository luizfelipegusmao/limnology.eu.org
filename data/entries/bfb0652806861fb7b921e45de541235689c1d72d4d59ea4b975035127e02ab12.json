{"title":"Effects of Cognitive Dual-Tasking on Biomechanics and Neuromuscular Control during the Transition to Walking from Standing or Sitting Postures in Young Adults","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0869/v1","date":1726032743000,"content":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of cognitive dual-tasking on gait initiation and sit-to-walk. Twenty-eight healthy young adults performed gait initiation and sit-to-walk under two conditions: while engaging in serial subtraction (dual-task) and without any additional task (single-task). Motion data were collected using a 10-camera optoelectronic motion capture system, synchronized with force plates and surface electromyography. We analyzed spatiotemporal parameters, center of mass displacement, center of pressure trajectory, and lower limb muscle activation patterns. We found that dual-task conditions significantly affected both gait initiation and sit-to-walk patterns, increasing the duration of transitions and mediolateral center of mass displacements, while reducing vertical center of mass displacements and forward propulsion. We also observed a more constrained and less efficient center of pressure path, with reduced posterior displacement during the weight shift phase. Muscle activation, particularly in the tibialis anterior and biceps femoris, decreased during dual-task conditions, indicating altered neuromuscular strategies. These findings suggest a shift in postural control demands and motor performance during dual-task transitions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bfb0652806861fb7b921e45de541235689c1d72d4d59ea4b975035127e02ab12","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
