{"title":"Exposure to bovine livestock and latent tuberculosis infection in children: Investigating the zoonotic tuberculosis potential in a large urban and peri-urban area of Cameroon","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003669","date":1724680800000,"content":"<p>by Martine Augusta Flore Tsasse, Henry Dilonga Meriki, Hugues Clotaire Nana Djeunga, Marius Ambe Ngwa, Henri Olivier Tatsilong Pambou, Raïssa Dongmo, Ouethy Nguessi, Joseph Kamgno, Jane-Francis Tatah Kihla Akoachere, Patrick Nguipdop-Djomo</p>\r\n\r\nBovine tuberculosis (bTB), a neglected zoonotic disease, is endemic in cattle in many Sub-saharan African countries, yet its contribution to tuberculosis (TB) burden is understudied. Rapid urbanisation and increase in demand for animal proteins, including dairy products, increases the risk of spill over. This study compared the latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) risk in children, a proxy-measure for recent TB infection, in children living in high cattle density areas to children from the general population in Cameroon. Cross-sectional study in the Centre Region of Cameroon in 2021, recruiting 160 children aged 2–15 years, stratified by exposure to livestock, people treated for pulmonary TB (PTB) and the general community. Veinous blood was tested for LTBI using QuantiFERON–TB Gold-Plus. Prevalence were calculated and the association to exposure and other risk factors investigated using logistic regression models. The crude LTBI prevalence were 8.2% in the general population, 7.3% in those exposed to cattle and 61% in pulmonary TB household contacts. After adjusting for confounding and sampling design, exposure to cattle and exposure to pulmonary TB were associated with higher risk of LTBI than the general population (respectively odds ratio (OR): 3.56, 95%CI: 0.34 to 37.03; and OR: 10.36, 95%CI: 3.13 to 34.21). Children frequently consuming cow milk had higher risk of LTBI (OR: 3.35; 95%CI 0.18 to 60.94). Despite limited statistical power, this study suggests that children exposed to cattle in a setting endemic for bTB had higher risk of LTBI, providing indirect evidence that <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> may contribute to TB burden.","author":"Martine Augusta Flore Tsasse","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"66d3c8a59935540aefea6107e79a17c2c0e460d6a2bb481fc197ec39b2ae854f","category":"Environment"}
