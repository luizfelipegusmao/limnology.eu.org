Unusual charge density waves (CDW) and superconductivities, attributed to strong electron correlations, have been reported in the Kagome family AV<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5</sub> (A = K, Rb, Cs) [<a href=\"#ozae044.863-B1\">1</a>]. Although various experimental techniques have been employed to study the charge order in the Kagome materials, such as scanning tunneling microscopy, x-ray scattering and neutron scattering, the in-situ study using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has not been reported. Taking advantage of the high spatial resolution TEM, both imaging and diffraction, the study on Kagome materials may provide comprehensive understanding of the structural phase transition through electron diffraction.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7f983e702fa9e63c50d834eba3ce0c4d755f0ccbdbc9b269891987fbd6f22ce8","category":"Environment"}
