{"title":"Short-Term Clinical Results of Minimally Invasive Direct Coronary Artery Bypass (MIDCAB) Procedure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1618/v1","date":1713949596000,"content":"Objectives: Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) is an alternative for revascularisation of isolated left anterior descending (LAD) or as multi-vessel (MV) procedure for diagonal branch (RD) or circumflex artery (RCX) region. \nMethods: From 2021 to 2022 91 patients underwent MIDCAB procedure in our heartcenter. 80% were male. Eighty percent of the patients had two or three vessel coronary artery disease. Mean age was 65±10 years. The left internal mammary artery (LIMA) was anastomosed to the left anterior descending via left minithoracotomy approach in all patients. Fourteen patients received multi-vessel MIDCAB (15%) with two or three anastomoses a saphenous vein graft (as T-graft to LIMA) was anastomosed to RD or RCX.\nResults: Mean operation time was 2.6±0.8 hours. The 30-day mortality was 0. Mean required packed red blood cells (pRBC) was 0.4±1.2 unit. The intensive care unit stay (ICU) was 1.5±1.6 days mean. We observed two patients (2%) with wound infections postoperatively. Four patients underwent rethoracotomy because of bleeding. Mean follow-up time was 1.5±0.5 years. Seventy-eight patients (86%) were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 1, 11 patients (12%) were in NYHA class 2. One patient received percutaneous coronary intervention due to de novo stenosis of the RCA. Late mortality was 2%. The Kaplan-Meier survival rate was  98.8%  at 1 and 2 years. \nConclusion: MIDCAB is technically demanding. Our postoperative and short-term clinical results demonstrate that this procedure is safe and feasible. Optimal patient selection and an experienced surgical team are mandatory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec68c862d2f2b1e1e59dda83be00e9638c1da3c94da831ddb0294de5dbc4a13c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
