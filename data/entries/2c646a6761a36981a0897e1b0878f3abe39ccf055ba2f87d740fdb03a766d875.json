However, the HS mechanisms of action, as well as the differences between radicular and foliar modes of application, remain unclear. Here, we explored the changes in phytohormonal balance as possible mechanism of HS to enhance lettuce (<i>Lactuca sativa</i> L.) growth, and the difference between both modes of application. For this purpose, BLACKJAK®, a HS-based product was applied as radicular (R) and foliar (F) at the concentrations (mL/L): 0.20 (R1), 0.40 (R2), 0.60 (R3), 0.80 (R4), 5.00 (F1), 7.50 (F2), 10.00 (F3), and 12.50 (F4). The experiment was performed in pots filled with vermiculite:perlite (3:1) and HS were applied three times with a periodicity of 10 days. Shoot and root growth parameters were measured. In addition, the phythormones indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellins (GAs), trans-zeatine (tZ), isopentenyl adenine (iP), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), and salicylic acid (SA), were analysed by U-HPLC-MS. BLACKJAK® application resulted in higher shoot growth at doses R1, R2, R3, F2, and F3, whereas root biomass was increased at R2, R3, F2, F3, and F4, showing radicular better plant growth than foliar applications. Furthermore, HS changed phytohormonal balance in shoots and roots. However, it was with radicular applications, especially at R2, where phytohormonal profile was best associated with plant growth due to the increases observed in IAA, GAs, JA, SA, tZ, and decreased ABA. However, further research is needed to clarify the involvement of hormones in the growth-promoting action of HS.</p>","author":"Santiago Atero‐Calvo, \nFrancesco Magro, \nGiacomo Masetti, \nEloy Navarro‐León, \nAlfonso Albacete, \nJuan Manuel Ruiz","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of Applied Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a403b38a3432c20b8a9e38602184acbfc416cca77ff6bdf54b49e3b6eafe9c39","entryHash":"2c646a6761a36981a0897e1b0878f3abe39ccf055ba2f87d740fdb03a766d875","category":"Environment"}
