{"title":"Current Regulations for Transporting Medicines Using a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0911/v1","date":1718265359000,"content":"The document sets out three differentiated proposals for the transport of medicines through RPAS with their respective regulations, adapted to different operational categories: open category, special category and military scope. In the open category, an economical and efficient solution is prioritized for urban and rural areas, complying with weight and height regulations, in addition to guaranteeing the stability and quality of medications during transportation. The special category allows more complex operations and in more adverse conditions, such as densely populated areas and long routes, incorporating advanced security measures and training for personnel. In the military field, RPAS are used in conflict zones and hard-to-reach areas, ensuring the safe and rapid delivery of medical supplies under extreme conditions. Success stories in different countries are highlighted, demonstrating significant improvements in delivery times and risk reduction for health personnel.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ba4f7070f9492fd63fa073337c0b1af4c042fdb4ef9ee24e6b6b00a432e06e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
