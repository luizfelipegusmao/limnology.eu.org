However, the uncertainty surrounding how microbial temperature responses control carbon losses under warming conditions highlights a significant gap in our climate change models. To address this issue, we conducted a fine-scale analysis of soil organic carbon composition under different temperature gradients and characterized the corresponding microbial growth and physiology across various paddy soils spanning 4000 km in China. Our results showed that warming altered the composition of organic matter, resulting in a reduction in carbohydrates of approximately 0.026% to 0.030% from humid subtropical regions to humid continental regions. These changes were attributed to a decrease in the proportion of cold-preferring bacteria, leading to significant soil carbon losses. Our findings suggest that intrinsic microbial temperature sensitivity plays a crucial role in determining the rate of soil organic carbon decomposition, providing insights into the temperature limitations faced by microbial activities and their impact on soil carbon-climate feedback.</p>","author":"Sen Li, \nManuel Delgado‐Baquerizo, \nJixian Ding, \nHan Hu, \nWeigen Huang, \nYishen Sun, \nHaowei Ni, \nYanyun Kuang, \nMengting Maggie Yuan, \nJizhong Zhou, \nJiabao Zhang, \nYuting Liang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"18f6de60199193c2d194bb09b0612fbe8b2d528a2d8b66ee43f40cebe61a8b46","category":"Environment"}
