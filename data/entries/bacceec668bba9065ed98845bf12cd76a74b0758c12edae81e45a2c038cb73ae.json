The partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was constructed with 7 latent variables and obtained 100% accuracy, explaining a variance of 97.05% in calibration and 93.13% in cross-validation to discriminate each phenological stage, as well as the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) also separated the stages 100% correctly.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Two plots (10 ha each) of <i>Triticum aestivum</i> L. wheat crop were analysed, one with a phosphorus-solubilizing bioinoculant (bioinput) and another without the bioinput (control). Traditional physical–chemical variables and four enzymes were analysed: arylsulfatase (AS), β-glucosidase (β-G), acid phosphatase (AP), and N-acetyl-β-<span>d</span>-glucosaminidase (NAG). These variables were considered by Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The HCA separated 100% correctly the control and bioinput samples along the wheat phenological stages (Feekes-Large scale). The PLS-DA model was constructed with seven latent variables and obtained 100% accuracy, explaining a variance of 97.05% in calibration and 93.13% in cross-validation. The control soil had a productivity of 57.8 bags per hectare, while the soil with bioinput had a productivity of 60.8 bags per hectare. Furthermore, soil with the bioinput presented higher concentrations of the enzymes AS, β-G, and AP in the final phenological stages.</p>","author":"Nikolas Mateus Pereira de Souza, \nRicardo Eugenio Dill, \nDavid Gabriel dos Santos Fagundes, \nAlexandro Cagliari, \nAlexandre Rieger","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of Applied Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a403b38a3432c20b8a9e38602184acbfc416cca77ff6bdf54b49e3b6eafe9c39","entryHash":"bacceec668bba9065ed98845bf12cd76a74b0758c12edae81e45a2c038cb73ae","category":"Environment"}
