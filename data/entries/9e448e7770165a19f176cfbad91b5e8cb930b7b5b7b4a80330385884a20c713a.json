{"title":"Convergent evolution of parrot plumage coloration","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae107/7627975?rss=1","date":1710288000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Parrots have remarkable plumage coloration that result in part from a unique ability to produce pigments called psittacofulvins that yield yellow to red feather colors. Little is known about the evolution of psittacofulvin-based pigmentation. Widespread color mutations of captive-bred parrots provide perfect opportunities to study the genetic basis of this trait. An earlier study on <span>blue</span> budgerigars, which do not possess psittacofulvins, reveals the involvement of an uncharacterized polyketide synthase (MuPKS) in yellow psittacofulvin synthesis. The <span>blue</span> phenotype had repeatedly appeared in different parrot species, similar to independent experimental replications allowing the study of convergent evolution and molecular mechanism of psittacofulvin-based pigmentation. Here, we investigated the genetic basis of the <span>blue</span> phenotypes in two species of <span>Agapornis</span> parrots, Fischer's lovebird (<span>A. fischeri</span>) and Yellow-collared lovebird (<span>A. personatus</span>). Using whole-genome data, we identified a single genomic region with size &lt;2 Mb to be strongly associated with the color difference between <span>blue</span> and wild-type (WT) birds in both species. Surprisingly, we discovered that the mutation associated with the <span>blue Agapornis</span> phenotype was identical to the previously described substitution causing the functional change of MuPKS in budgerigars. Together with the evidence of shared <span>blue</span>-associated haplotypes and signatures of a selective sweep in this genomic region in both species, we demonstrated both <span>de novo</span> mutation and interspecific introgression play a role in the evolution of this trait in different <span>Agapornis</span> species. The convergent substitution in the same gene in both lovebirds and budgerigars also indicates a strong evolutionary constraint on psittacofulvin-based coloration.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"9e448e7770165a19f176cfbad91b5e8cb930b7b5b7b4a80330385884a20c713a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
