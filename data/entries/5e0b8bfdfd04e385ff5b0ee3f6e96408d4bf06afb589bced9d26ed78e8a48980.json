{"title":"Reducing Emissions in the Maritime Sector: Offshore Wind Energy as a Key Factor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0731/v1","date":1728609212000,"content":"The maritime environment is the setting for a variety of economic activities, such as offshore wind energy, aquaculture, salt extraction, and oil and gas platforms. While some of these activities have a long-term presence, others require decarbonisation as they head towards their demise. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop a methodology to replace the electrical energy from high-emission industrial processes offshore with clean electricity generated by offshore wind energy. The proposal is structured in three phases: Initiation, which involves the collection of quantitative, technical and geospatial information of the study area; Indicators, where the main indicators are calculated and the best alternative is selected using multi-criteria evaluation methods; and finally, short, medium and long-term scenarios are proposed. The methodology is evaluated in Spain, the best alternative with a nominal power of 225 MW, is capable of avoiding up to 1.44 MtCO2 by 2050.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e0b8bfdfd04e385ff5b0ee3f6e96408d4bf06afb589bced9d26ed78e8a48980","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
