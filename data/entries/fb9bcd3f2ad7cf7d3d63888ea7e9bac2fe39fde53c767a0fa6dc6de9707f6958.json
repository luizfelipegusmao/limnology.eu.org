{"title":"Primary Cable Position Effect on Non-Toroidal Shape Pass Through Current Transformer Accuracy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2191/v1","date":1721992278000,"content":"Non-toroidal shape primary pass through protection current transformers (CTs) are used to measure high currents. Their design provides them with a big airgap that allow passing several cables per phase though them, which is the main advantage versus toroidal types, as the number of CTs required to measure the whole phase current is drastically reduced. The cables pass through the transformer window can be in several positions. As the isolines of the magnetic field generated by the primary currents are centered in the cables, if these cables are not centered in the transformer window, the magnetic field will be non-uniform along the transformer core. Consequently, local saturations can appear if the cables are not properly disposed causing the malfunction of the CT. In this paper, the performance of a non-toroidal shape protection CT is studied. The research is focused on the cable position influence in possible partial saturations of the CT when it is operating near to its accuracy limit. Depending on the cable position, the ratio of the primary and secondary currents can depart from assigned ratio. The validation of this phenomenon has been carried out via Finite Element Analysis (FEA) showing that partial transformer core saturations appears in areas of the magnetic core close to the cable. Applying FEA, also the admissible accuracy region for cable positioning inside the CT is delimited. Finally, the simulation results are ratified with experimental tests performed in non-toroidal protection CTs varying the primary cablesâ€™ positions, which are subjected to currents up to 5 kA, achieving satisfactory results. From this analysis, installation recommendations are given.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb9bcd3f2ad7cf7d3d63888ea7e9bac2fe39fde53c767a0fa6dc6de9707f6958","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
