{"title":"Random Plasmonic Laser Based on Bismuth/Aluminum/Yttria/ Silver Co-Doped Silica Fiber with Microcavity Shaped Tip","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0458/v1","date":1728296409000,"content":"In this study, we demonstrate a proof of principle of an all-fiber random laser due to the plasmonic effect. This was achieved in a fiber co-doped with Bismuth/Aluminum/Yttria/Silver in which a microsphere (microcavity) at the fiberâ€™s tip was made using a splicing machine. The presence in the fiber of Bismuth- and silver nanoparticles along with Bismuth-Aluminum phototropic centers stands behind the observed phenomenon. The effect can be attributed to in-pair functioning of this unit as an active medium and volumetric plasmonic feedback, with the result being lasing at 807 nm under 532-nm pumping with notably low (~2 mW) threshold.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6e9b131259424fc2ec83dd2ac0cc1cda604deaa2c168baac0cae3a3bb58d51f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
