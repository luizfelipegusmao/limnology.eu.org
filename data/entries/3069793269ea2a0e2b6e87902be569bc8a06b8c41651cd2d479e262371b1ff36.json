{"title":"CRISPR/CAS Genome Editing Technology: Implications And Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.1948/v2","date":1712904083000,"content":"Scientists can use the Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein 9 system, which is a powerful and flexible tool for changing the genome, to change only certain parts of the genome. This has helped researchers figure out how target genes work in biology and disease. CRISPR/Cas9 is made up of a sequence-specific CRISPR RNA (crRNA) set and a generic Cas9 nuclease. The crRNA set tells Cas9 where to cut DNA and cause double-strand breaks. In the next step of cellular DNA repair, insertions, deletions, and swaps are made at specific spots. For CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage to be specific, the target sequences must match the crRNA, and a protospacer nearby motif must be placed after the target sequences. In this article, we talk about how CRISPR/Cas9 works at the molecular level, what it can be used for, what it can't do, and what its future clinical treatment promise might be.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3069793269ea2a0e2b6e87902be569bc8a06b8c41651cd2d479e262371b1ff36","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
