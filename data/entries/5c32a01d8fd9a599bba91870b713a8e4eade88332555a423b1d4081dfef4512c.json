{"title":"Combining in situ and ex situ plankton image data to reconstruct zooplankton (&gt;1 mm) volume and mass distribution in the global ocean","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/5/461/7759637?rss=1","date":1726531200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plankton size spectra are important indicators of the ecosystem state, yet such measurements are typically biased by the available sampling methods. Here, we combined individual size measurement from two zooplankton imaging approaches—<span>in situ</span> observation by the Underwater Vision Profiler5 and Multinet-collection supplemented by <span>ex situ</span> imaging via Zooscan—obtained in the global ocean, to calculate zooplankton normalized biovolume size spectra (NBSS) for all organisms larger than 1 mm. The reconstructed NBSS combining both datasets resulted in increased biomass estimates by adding organisms poorly sampled by either of the methods. The optimal values measured by both methods are used to reconstruct the zooplankton biovolume and biomass distributions. The reconstructed slopes appeared steeper and closer to those measured only by the UVP5 (+7.6%) and flatter than those obtained only from the Multinet (−20%), particularly in tropical and temperate latitudes. The main difference in tropical and temperate NBSS from the two devices is due to the fragile rhizarians that were not accounted for when using net data. When possible, we suggest using <span>in situ</span> and <span>ex situ</span> technologies together, and we provide potential indications on how to correct for missing components of the community when only one method is available.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"5c32a01d8fd9a599bba91870b713a8e4eade88332555a423b1d4081dfef4512c","category":"Environment"}
