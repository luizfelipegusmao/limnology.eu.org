{"title":"335 Effects of feeding an immunomodulatory feed additive (NutraGen) on serum cytokine and antibody concentrations in calves following exposure to a combination bovine respiratory disease challenge","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/62/7757261?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Two 89-d experiments (Exp 1 and Exp 2) evaluated the effects of feeding an immunomodulatory feed additive (NutraGen; NG) in calves following exposure to bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) on d -3 and <span>Mannheimia haemolytica</span> (MH) infection on d 0. For each experiment, steers [body weight (BW = 251 ± 38.2 kg were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 treatments. Treatments included a placebo (CON; Exp 1 n = 5; Exp 2 n = 5), a placebo fed from d -18 to d -3 followed by NG fed from d -3 to d 28 (CHLG; Exp 1 n = 5; Exp 2 n = 6), and NG fed from d -18 to d 28 (PREC; Exp 1 n = 6; Exp 2 n = 5). Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.). Animal served as the experimental unit and time served as a repeated measure. Treatment, time, and the treatment × time interaction served as fixed effects. Block was included as a random effect. Cytokine data were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, determined to be non-normal, and logarithm (base 10) transformed as a result prior to statistical analysis. Multiple time effects and treatment × time interactions occurred for serum MH, BVDV 1, and BVDV 2 antibody concentrations in both experiments (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05). In Exp 1, there was a tendency for an overall treatment effect for calves assigned to the CON treatment to exhibit the greatest MH serum antibody concentrations (<span>P</span> = 0.06). While no differences were detected between treatment groups, BVDV 1 and BVDV 2 antibody concentrations peaked on the same day in both experiments, d 28 post-challenge. There were no treatment × time interactions, treatment effects, or time effects for serum TNF-α, IFN-γ, or IL-17A concentrations (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.13) in either experiment. In Exp 1, there was a treatment effect for serum IL-10 (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.0001), where calves assigned to the PREC treatment had increased serum IL-10 concentrations when compared with calves in the other treatment groups. In Exp 2, there was a tendency for a treatment effect for IL-10 concentrations, where calves assigned to the PREC treatment displayed decreased IL-10 concentrations when compared with calves in the other treatment groups (<span>P</span> = 0.07). These data suggest that feeding NG to calves prior to a stress experience may alter cellular responses. Overall, these experiments suggest that NG impacted antibody concentrations and cytokine expression during a bovine respiratory disease challenge.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"84ec96d9ee3aabd32abec12dd7d350a7bb51ac1151fc0ba2e286e5cebfa4a533","category":"Environment"}
