{"title":"Potato virus Y viral protein 6K1 inhibits the interaction between defense proteins during virus infection","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1447/7420159?rss=1","date":1699920000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>14-3-3 proteins play vital roles in plant defense against various pathogen invasions. To date, how 14-3-3 affects virus infections in plants remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> 14-3-3h interacts with TRANSLATIONALLY CONTROLLED TUMOR PROTEIN (TCTP), a susceptibility factor of potato virus Y (PVY). Silencing of <span>Nb14-3-3h</span> facilitates PVY accumulation, whereas overexpression of <span>Nb14-3-3h</span> inhibits PVY replication. The antiviral activities of 3 Nb14-3-3h dimerization defective mutants are significantly decreased, indicating that dimerization of Nb14-3-3h is indispensable for restricting PVY infection. Our results also showed that the mutant Nb14-3-3h<sup>E16A</sup>, which is capable of dimerizing but not interacting with NbTCTP, has reduced anti-PVY activity; the mutant NbTCTP<sup>I65A</sup>, which is unable to interact with Nb14-3-3h, facilitates PVY replication compared with the wild-type NbTCTP, indicating that dimeric Nb14-3-3h restricts PVY infection by interacting with NbTCTP and preventing its proviral function. As a counter-defense, PVY 6K1 interferes with the interaction between Nb14-3-3h and NbTCTP by competitively binding to Nb14-3-3h and rescues NbTCTP to promote PVY infection. Our results provide insights into the arms race between plants and potyviruses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"0f7149d1e3009d965a19e30929cd0b9a2dd27c30030eb6c728ae8d945061bfe1","category":"Environment"}
