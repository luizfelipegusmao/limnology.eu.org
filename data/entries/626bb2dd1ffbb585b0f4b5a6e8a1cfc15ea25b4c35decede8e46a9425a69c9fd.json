{"title":"Partially replacing plant protein sources with torula yeast in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) feed increases growth and factors related to immune status","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13047?af=R","date":1707993399000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In this study, the impact of adding 10% or 20% torula yeast (PB TY10 and PB TY20) to a fishmeal-free diet on digestibility and growth of juvenile rainbow trout was assessed. The yeast diets were compared with a plant-only diet (PB) and a diet containing 20% fishmeal (FM). The apparent digestibility of dry matter, protein, energy, and ash of yeast in trout (~120 g) were 78.6%, 93.8%, 84.8%, and 48.7%, respectively. All PB diets had higher protein digestibility and PB TY20 had higher ash digestibility than the FM diet. To assess growth, trout (~44 g) were divided into triplicate tanks (30 per tank) and fed one of the four experimental diets for 12 weeks. The PB diet resulted in lower growth and daily feed intake (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), but adding yeast significantly improved them. Final weight of PB TY10 did not differ significantly from that of FM. Expression of <i>oclna</i> and <i>cldn15</i> in the proximal intestine increased in trout fed yeast (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Expression of <i>tlr2</i>, <i>mcsfr</i>, and <i>tnfa</i>, as well as the plasma lysozyme concentration, increased with PB TY20 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, torula yeast has the potential to improve the robustness and growth of rainbow trout in the context of fishmeal-free diets.</p>","author":"Ricardo D.
