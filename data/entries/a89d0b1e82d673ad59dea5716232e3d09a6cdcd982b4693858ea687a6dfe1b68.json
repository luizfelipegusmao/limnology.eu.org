{"title":"Phenotypically plastic responses to environmental variation are more complex than life history theory predicts","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/8/1486/7676311?rss=1","date":1715990400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>For insects that exhibit wing polyphenic development, abiotic and biotic signals dictate the adult wing morphology of the insect in an adaptive manner such that in stressful environments the formation of a flight-capable morph is favored and in low-stress environments, a flightless morph is favored. While there is a relatively large amount known about the environmental cues that dictate morph formation in wing polyphenic hemipterans like planthoppers and aphids, whether those cues dictate the same morphs in non-hemipteran (i.e., cricket) wing polyphenic species has not been explicitly investigated. To experimentally test the generality of environmental cue determination of wing polyphenism across taxa with diverse life histories, in this study, we tested the importance of food quantity, parasitic infection, and tactile cues on wing morph determination in the wing polyphenic sand field cricket, <span>Gryllus firmus</span>. Our results also show that certain stress cues, such as severe diet quantity limitation and parasitic infection, actually led to an increase in the production of flightless morph. Based on these findings, our results suggest that physiological and genetic constraints are important to an organismâ€™s ability to respond to environmental variation in an adaptive manner beyond simple life history trade-offs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"a89d0b1e82d673ad59dea5716232e3d09a6cdcd982b4693858ea687a6dfe1b68","category":"Environment"}
