{"title":"Diversity and dynamics of bacteria from iron-rich microbial mats and colonizers in the Mediterranean Sea (EMSO-Western Ligurian Sea Observatory): Focus on Zetaproteobacteria","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305626","date":1721052000000,"content":"<p>by Aina Astorch-Cardona, Lionel Bertaux, Yann Denis, Alain Dolla, CÃ©line Rommevaux</p>\r\n\r\nAutotrophic microaerophilic iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria seem to play an important role in mineral weathering and metal corrosion in different environments. Here, we compare the bacterial and zetaproteobacterial communities of a mature iron-rich mat together with <i>in situ</i> incubations of different Fe-bearing materials at the EMSO-Ligure West seafloor observatory, which is located on the abyssal plain in the NW Mediterranean Sea. Our results on bacterial communities enable us to make a clear distinction between those growing on mild steel anthropic substrata and those developing on basaltic substrata. Moreover, on anthropic substrata we highlight an influence of mat age on the bacterial communities. Regarding zetaproteobacterial communities, our results point to an increase in ZetaOTUs abundance and diversification with the age of the mat. We corroborate the key role of the ZetaOTU 2 in mat construction, whatever the environment, the substrata on which they develop or the age of the mat. We also show that ZetaOTU 28 is specific to anthropogenic substrata. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of using dPCR to precisely quantify very low abundant targets, as Zetaproteobacteria on our colonizers. Our study, also, allows to enrich our knowledge on the biogeography of Zetaproteobacteria, by adding new information on this class and their role in the Mediterranean Sea.","author":"Aina Astorch-Cardona","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9fe9ae328000ffe05ed512b4cf6d5ea41fc2e028255d12d5a8084bbabc7598bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
