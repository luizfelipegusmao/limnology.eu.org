{"title":"The Flight Test Results of Altitude Stabilization System Dedicated for the Wing-in-Ground UAV","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1009/v1","date":1726139423000,"content":"The dynamic development of robotics is affecting people's lives. Flying robots replace pilots and crews in performing dangerous tasks. There are various designs of the above-mentioned robots such as multi-rotors, fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, among which wing-in-ground (WIG) units can also be distinguished. WIG vehicles, which utilize ground effect to enhance efficiency and stability, share similarities with UAVs in their control and aerodynamic challenges.\nThe article presented the results of the autopilot test for the NeoX UAV, which have the potential to be utilized in WIG UAVs. The NeoX was developed at the Air Force Institute of Technology as a reconnaissance flying robot and is a tailless mini UAV. It has a characteristic feature which is the flying wing with a small fuselage. The electric engine with the pusher propeller ensures thrust. The tailless airplane has a greater drag-to-lift ratio than a conventional airplane, but this airplane configuration needs a control system that ensures a stable flight. The structure of auto-pilot for the horizontal flight phase (a cruise phase), the climbing, and the descending phase were presented. The authors concentrated on the longitudinal channel of autopilot and showed the recorded results from the flight tests. \nThe research focused on developing autopilot system that could be adapted for use in WIG craft, which operate with similar aerodynamic principles but require unique control adaptations due to their proximity to the water or ground. The findings from the NeoX UAV tests are instru-mental in enhancing the stability and performance of these specialized crafts, ensuring safer and more efficient operation in their respective environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ecc4713403472c9becd249e1acca7b13d4817b75bf95c055e5e9e73f9a953b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
