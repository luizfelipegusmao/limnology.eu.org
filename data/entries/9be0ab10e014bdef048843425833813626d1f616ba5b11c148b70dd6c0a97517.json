{"title":"Effect of the Mineralogical Composition of Sandstones on the Wear of Mining Machinery Components","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1730/v1","date":1716798523000,"content":"The paper provides and comments on the results of studies of the effect of sandstone-based abrasives and quartz sand alone on the wear of martensitic surfaces of wear-resistant steels. The wear process was examined on a ring-on-ring test rig seeking to determine the mass decrement parameter which characterised wear. The tests were conducted for three sandstone varieties: Carboniferous, Permian, and Cretaceous, and they made it possible to determine that the most intense process of deterioration of wear-resistant steels took place in the presence of quartz sand grain, while less intense wear was observed in the case of sandstone-based abrasives. The mass decrement values established in the presence of the sandstones in question did not differ significantly between individual sandstone varieties. Based on a surface damage analysis, the basic damage mechanism was found to be micro-scratching, however, with regard to the sandstones examined, it was also determined that individual grains could be pressed into surface irregularities, as well as that films of soft hematite cement developed in the Permian sandstone and that inclusions of carbonaceous matter were formed in the Carboniferous sandstone. With reference to the wear process observations, a wear model was described for the surface of the steels examined in the presence of sandstone-based abrasives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9be0ab10e014bdef048843425833813626d1f616ba5b11c148b70dd6c0a97517","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
