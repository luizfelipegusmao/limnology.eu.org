{"title":"Ectopic Expression of Distinct PLC Genes Identifies ‘Compactness’ as a Possible Architectural Shoot Strategy to Cope with Drought Stress","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/doi/10.1093/pcp/pcad123/7318190?rss=1","date":1697414400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Phospholipase C (PLC) has been implicated in several stress responses, including drought. Overexpression (OE) of <span>PLC</span> has been shown to improve drought tolerance in various plant species. <span>Arabidopsis</span> contains nine <span>PLC</span> genes, which are subdivided into four clades. Earlier, OE of <span>PLC3, PLC5</span> or <span>PLC7</span> was found to increase <span>Arabidopsis</span>’ drought tolerance. Here, we confirm this for three other PLCs: <span>PLC2</span>, the only constitutively expressed <span>AtPLC; PLC4</span>, reported to have reduced salt tolerance and <span>PLC9</span>, of which the encoded enzyme was presumed to be catalytically inactive. To compare each <span>PLC</span> and to discover any other potential phenotype, two independent OE lines of six At<span>PLC</span> genes, representing all four clades, were simultaneously monitored with the GROWSCREEN-FLUORO phenotyping platform, under both control- and mild-drought conditions. To investigate which tissues were most relevant to achieving drought survival, we additionally expressed At<span>PLC5</span> using 13 different cell- or tissue-specific promoters. While no significant differences in plant size, biomass or photosynthesis were found between <span>PLC</span> lines and wild-type (WT) plants, all <span>PLC</span>-OE lines, as well as those tissue-specific lines that promoted drought survival, exhibited a stronger decrease in ‘convex hull perimeter’ (= increase in ‘compactness’) under water deprivation compared to WT. Increased compactness has not been associated with drought or decreased water loss before although a hyponastic decrease in compactness in response to increased temperatures has been associated with water loss. We propose that the increased compactness could lead to decreased water loss and potentially provide a new breeding trait to select for drought tolerance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"a5fc167ec832e7993d6dc194da565a24da105e6815f9e5df23cb98b7220151fa","category":"Environment"}
