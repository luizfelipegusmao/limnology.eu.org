Plants have developed several complex mechanisms to respond against these abiotic stresses. Studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) effectively reduce stress-responsive genes that significantly help plants tolerate abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, temperature, and heavy metals. The regulation of such genes by miRNAs not only aids in plant growth and development but also controls physiological processes such as identifying floral organs, leaf morphogenesis, and root development. As per the information, miRNA plays an important role in stress regulation and regulates homeostasis in mangrove plants such as <i>Rhizophore apiculata.</i> Several modern technologies and approaches have been developed to determine these stress response miRNAs. The targeted genes of miRNAs are transcription factors that further control a set of down and upstream genes to affect physiological response. This paper explores the miRNAs found in a mangrove plant <i>Avicennia marina</i>. The plant contains many miRNAs and knowledge of miRNAs – their development, roles, functions, and target genes under abiotic stress conditions.</p>","author":"Anjali Sharma, \nMousumi Datta, \nPrajita Kundu, \nAditi Nayak","siteTitle":"Wiley: Marine Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"9aeeb02fb4d0869ca2d9b47a9c219a8693576fd84433bf6b8b40db990539dbf7","entryHash":"1c6bbb4bb435bfa9959a6fa7c6b546b5fc51371bd75c0359a4ccb8cf248c50ec","category":"Environment"}
