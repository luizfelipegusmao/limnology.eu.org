{"title":"Transcription factor WRKY75 maintains auxin homeostasis to promote tomato defense against Pseudomonas syringae","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1053/7584768?rss=1","date":1705708800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen <span>Pseudomonas syringae</span> infects a range of plant species and causes enormous economic losses. Auxin and WRKY transcription factors play crucial roles in plant responses to <span>P. syringae</span>, but their functional relationship in plant immunity remains unclear. Here, we characterized tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>) SlWRKY75, which promotes defenses against <span>P. syringae</span> pv. <span>tomato</span> (<span>Pst</span>) DC3000 by regulating plant auxin homeostasis. Overexpressing <span>SlWRKY75</span> resulted in low free indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels, leading to attenuated auxin signaling, decreased expansin transcript levels, upregulated expression of <span>PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES</span> (<span>PRs</span>) and <span>NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENE 1</span> (<span>NPR1</span>), and enhanced tomato defenses against <span>Pst</span> DC3000. RNA interference-mediated repression of <span>SlWRKY75</span> increased tomato susceptibility to <span>Pst</span> DC3000. Yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and luciferase activity assays suggested that SlWRKY75 directly activates the expression of <span>GRETCHEN HAGEN 3.3</span> (<span>SlGH3.3</span>), which encodes an IAA-amido synthetase. SlGH3.3 enhanced tomato defense against <span>Pst</span> DC3000 by converting free IAA to the aspartic acid (Asp)-conjugated form IAA-Asp. In addition, SlWRKY75 interacted with a tomato valine-glutamine (VQ) motif-containing protein 16 (SlVQ16) in vivo and in vitro. SlVQ16 enhanced SlWRKY75-mediated transcriptional activation of <span>SlGH3.3</span> and promoted tomato defense responses to <span>Pst</span> DC3000. Our findings illuminate a mechanism in which the SlVQ16â€“SlWRKY75 complex participates in tomato pathogen defense by positively regulating SlGH3.3-mediated auxin homeostasis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"7d5cedba3e1b2f15c1d8430d47f2f2dc16621690989ae651b4fdbf94886f958e","category":"Environment"}
