{"title":"Calculating the Mass of Objects That Are Transitive from Giant Planets to Brown Dwarfs Using a New Formula for the Gravitational Potential","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1808/v1","date":1711700442000,"content":"The gravitational potential characterizes the gravitational field of ordinary bodies and has dimension equal to the square of the velocity. In 2021, a new expression for the law of universal gravitation was obtained, which is completely analogous to Coulombâ€™s law. Using this result, the presented paper introduces a new formula for the gravitational potential, which has dimension of velocity. This formula establishes a clear boundary for the mass of objects that are transitive from giant planets to stars of the smallest masses (brown dwarfs).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a0cc370f6925297915cb9265ea55517295d5235be0baeff5cb08740d7bf1f88a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
