{"title":"Activation of the Anaphase Promoting Complex Restores Impaired Mitotic Progression and Chemosensitivity in Multiple Drug Resistant Human Breast Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1579/v2","date":1711629255000,"content":"The development of multiple drug resistant (MDR) cancer all too often signals the need for alternative toxic therapy or palliative care. Our recent in vivo and in vitro studies using canine MDR lymphoma cancer cells demonstrated that the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC) is impaired in MDR cells compared to normal canine control and drug sensitive cancer cells. Here, we sought to establish whether this phenomena is a generalizable mechanism independent of species, malignancy type or chemotherapy regime. To test the association of blunted APC activity with MDR cancer behavior, we used matched parental and MDR MCF7 human breast cancer cells, and a patient derived xenograft (PDX) model of human breast cancer. We show that APC activating mechanisms, such as APC subunit 1 (APC1) phosphorylation and CDC27/CDC20 protein associations, are reduced in MCF7 MDR cells when compared to chemosensitive matched cell lines. Consistent with impaired APC function in MDR cells, APC substrate proteins failed to be effectively degraded. Similar to our previous observations in canine MDR lymphoma cells, chemical activation of the APC using Mad2 Inhibitor-1 (M2I-1) in MCF7 MDR cells enhanced APC substrate degradation and resensitized MDR cells in vitro to the cytotoxic effects of the alkylating chemotherapeutic agent, Doxorubicin (DOX). Using cell cycle arrest/release experiments we show that chemo-sensitive and -resistant MCF7 cells progress through the cell cycle at similar rates, but mitosis is delayed in MDR cells with elevated substrate levels. When treated with M2I-1, MDR cells progress through mitosis at a faster rate that coincides with reduced levels of APC substrates. In our PDX model, mice growing a clinically-MDR human breast cancer tumor show significantly reduced tumor growth when treated with M2I-1, with evidence of increased DNA damage and apoptosis. Thus, our results strongly support the hypothesis that APC impairment is a driver of aggressive tumor development and that targeting the APC for activation has the potential for meaningful clinical benefits in treating recurrent cases of MDR malignancy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02267f89d6761075e67f6fed6e289440f1ad9afb69fb31960645f8de82dcbab8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
