{"title":"Minimizing Escherichia coli O157:H7 contamination in indoor farming: effects of cultivar type and ultra‐violet light quality","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13303?af=R","date":1712732400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Bacterial contamination of produce is a concern in indoor farming due to close plant spacing, recycling irrigation, warm temperatures, and high relative humidity during production. Cultivars that inherently resist contamination and photo-sanitization using ultraviolet (UV) radiation during the production phase can reduce bacterial contamination. However, there is limited information to support their use in indoor farming.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Lettuce (<i>Lactuca sativa)</i> cultivars with varying plant architectures grown in a custom-built indoor farm exhibited differences in <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 survival after inoculation. The survival of <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 was lowest in the leaf cultivar (open architecture) and highest in the romaine and oakleaf cultivars (compact architecture). Of the different UV wavelengths that were tested (UV-A, UV-A + B, UV-A + C), UV A + C at an intensity of 54.5 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (with 3.5 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> of UV-C), provided for 15 min every day, was found to be most efficacious in reducing the <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 survival on romaine lettuce with no negative effects on plant growth and quality.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Contamination of <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 on lettuce plants can be reduced and the food safety levels in indoor farms can be increased by selecting cultivars with an open leaf architecture coupled with photo-sanitization using low and frequent exposure to UV A + C radiation. © 2024 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yuyao Kong, \nAmanda J Deering, \nKrishna Nemali","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"06489d4c8d6d72ab4dd8607a82cd22f99643f7ff48334846258f10b967d7cfe8","category":"Environment"}
