{"title":"The Dynamic Role of Curcumin in Mitigating Human Illnesses: Recent Advances in Therapeutic Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1576/v1","date":1726825753000,"content":"Treatment with herbal medicine continues to enjoy widespread popularity not only in the developing world, because of low costs, easy availability, and low risk of adverse effects. One such plant is Curcumin longa L., or turmeric, which has a long history of both culinary and medicinal uses throughout Asia, spanning thousands of years. In addition to traditionally being used as a dye, as a flavouring and colouring agent in foods, and, e.g., marriage rituals, turmeric is also notable for its long history of use to treat a variety of medical conditions, including inflammatory, bacterial, and fungal diseases and infections, jaundice, tumours, and ulcers among others. In light of this long history of use, it is not surprising to find that also modern biochemistry and clinical research studies show that a significant component of turmeric, curcumin, may have a multitude of therapeutic benefits, much of it attributed to the herb’s antioxidant qualities which are crucial for the prevention and treatment of, e.g., chronic inflammatory illnesses, conditions that often act as precursors for other serious diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, such as Parkinsons and Alzheimer’s. Furthermore, investigations on the safety profile and toxicity of curcumin have shown that it is generally safe even at large dosages, although caution is necessary as curcumin also have documented anticoagulant effects. This article is focused on providing a better perspective into molecular mechanisms for possible actions along with an in-depth review of recent studies of curcumin, its beneficial role and therapeutic applications in chronic health conditions, with a focus on its cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, peptic ulcer, Covid19, psoriasis, vitiligo, and depression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f879de50373a5e7cc66fd2e5dd11096ca4776822f947129b794723b20dea7374","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
