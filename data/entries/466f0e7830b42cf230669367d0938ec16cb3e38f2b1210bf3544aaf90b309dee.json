{"title":"Study on Structure Damage Identification Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1981/v1","date":1724838918000,"content":"In order to solve the problem of structure damage location and degree identification, the weighted mean of vectors algorithm (INFO), a high-performance optimization one, was first introduced to identify structure damage. The genetic algorithm (GA) are improved to obtain a refined genetic algorithm (RGA). An objective function is constructed by combining the dynamic response transfer-ratio without modal analysis. INFO and RGA algorithms are used to optimize the objective function for damage identification. Though simulations, the INFO, RGA, GA algorithms were used to identify the damage on a simply supported beam and cantilevered plate with different levels of noise and different frequency spacing of pickup points. The simulations verify the effectiveness of the three damage identification methods, and the INFO algorithm has the highest damage identification accuracy, the RGA is second and the GA is the worst.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"466f0e7830b42cf230669367d0938ec16cb3e38f2b1210bf3544aaf90b309dee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
