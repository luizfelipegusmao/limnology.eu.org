{"title":"Quantifying the Shading Effects of a Small Scale Rooftop Installed Linear Fresnel Reflector in Cyprus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0036/v1","date":1717393023000,"content":"The Linear Fresnel Reflectors are a solar concentration technology that is versatile and can serve many industrial processes or thermal conditioning. Such collectors entail a certain footprint, generating shading on the surface where they are installed. This effect is rarely quantified but may play an indirect role on the surface below. When installed on a roof, the solar radiation heats the building less. In places where the annual heating demand is higher than the cooling demand, this constitutes an asset. However, this becomes a disadvantage when the cooling demand is higher annually than the heating demand. Essentially, the reduced solar radiation allows the growth of plants that would not grow without the shade provided by the collector. The present paper is a quantitative analysis of such shading based on the Linear Fresnel Reflector of the Cyprus Institute. The work was conducted using the Tonatiuh++ ray-tracing software to determine the annual radiation blocking. A total of four years of actual meteorological measurements were applied directly to the ray-tracing model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bdaf25763bd64798f886cc4833c11cec08534197ba9bb6d1f630967fcd28409b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
