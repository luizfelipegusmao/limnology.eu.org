{"title":"Study on key parameters of buckling deformation instability and fracture of rock beams and asymmetric distribution law of stope stress","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305244","date":1718114400000,"content":"<p>by Zhanshan Shi, Hanwei Zhao, Bing Qin, Bing Liang, Gang Li, Xiuru Liu, Lifeng Jia</p>\r\n\r\nThe moving deformation of the strata and the redistribution of stope stress after mining show asymmetrical characteristics, which do not conform to the symmetrical structural characteristics of the original rock beam fracture. To further analyze the deformation of rock beams and the asymmetry law of stope pressure distribution after strata caving, the detailed process of instability and deformation of composite rock beams before failure was revealed through similar material simulation, theoretical analysis, and numerical simulation. Through similar simulation experiments, the structural characteristics of strata caving were observed. After excavation, the caving angle near the open-off cut side of the model is greater than that on the stop-mining line side. The maximum bending moment of the rock beam is located at the open-off cut side. The rock beam fracture is located on the partial open-off cut side in the middle of the rock beam. The rock beam on the open-off cut side is easy to shear slip and not easy to hinge. The rock beam in front of the advancing direction of the working face is easily hinged. Based on the structural characteristics of strata caving, considering the thickness of the composite rock beam, the two-hinged arch mechanical model for rock beam fracture is established. On this basis, the key parameters of rock beam instability and fracture such as limit load, additional horizontal stress, limit break distance, and break position are analyzed. Based on the deformation characteristics of two hinged arches, the caving structure and the asymmetric distribution mechanism of stress redistribution during the deformation of overburden in stope are explained. Finally, the deformation of rock beam and the asymmetry of stress distribution in stope are verified by numerical calculation. The results show that the concentrated stress value of the coal pillar at the open-off cut side is greater than that in front of the working face. There is a pressure relief area behind the working face, and the pressure relief area has a certain range. The range of stress concentration area, pressure relief area, and stress value tend to be stable, and only the range of the original rock stress zone expands when the working face is advanced to a certain distance. The asymmetric distribution of compaction stress in goaf is related to the buckling deformation of strata.","author":"Zhanshan Shi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d02f8d4bdb5343c6febac05eb8c33d6e0c88732bd27df00aeec3b0403f268b01","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
