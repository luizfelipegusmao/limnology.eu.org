{"title":"Causal Extraction to Measure Media Bias? A Comparative Analysis of Causal Attributions in Reporting of the Israel-Palestine Conflict","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0189/v1","date":1717499044000,"content":"Causal language can be a powerful tool for media outlets to subtly influence public perception and reinforce specific narratives. Therefore, identifying these linguistic patterns can be helpful in assessing the level of bias present in media content. In this paper, we directly compare the prevalence of causal language in headlines pertaining to the coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war. We specifically look at the BBC and AlJazeera headlines covering the assault on Gaza since October 7, 2023. We use UniCausal, a model for causal text mining, in order to automatically extract the cause and effect of each headline. Our findings reveal that BBC headlines tend to avoid directly attributing causality to Israel for the violence in Gaza, whereas Al Jazeera headlines explicitly identify Israel as the responsible party. This differential use of causal language suggests a potential bias in media reporting.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c50b2be4ce1dd1ad16ea955d47d4060a0029c64cd31f3ead59b422cb7cfa44e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
