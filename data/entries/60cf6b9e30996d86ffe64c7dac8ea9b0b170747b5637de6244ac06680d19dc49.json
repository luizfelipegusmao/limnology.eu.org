{"title":"Understanding Super Heavy Mass Numbers and Maximum Binding Energy of Any Mass Number with Revised Strong and Electroweak Mass Formula","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1928/v1","date":1716961052000,"content":"In our recent publications, based on strong and electroweak interactions, we have developed a completely new formula for estimating nuclear binding energy. With reference to currently believed Semi Empirical Mass Formula (SEMF), we call our formula as ‘Strong and Electroweak Mass Formula’ (SEWMF). Our formula constitutes 4 simple terms and only one energy coefficient of magnitude 10.1 MeV. First term is a volume term, second term seems to be a representation of free nucleons associated with electroweak interaction, third term is a radial term and fourth one is an asymmetry term about the mean stable mass number. In this paper, we make an attempt to understand and estimate the maximum binding energy associated with any mass number. It can be expressed as, for A &gt; 4, $\\left(BE\\right)_A\\cong \\left[A-0.000935A^2-A^{1/3}-A^{-1/2}\\right]$ MeV. We are working on refining the 4th term with even-odd corrections, shell corrections and other microscopic corrections. Proceeding further, stable mass numbers and super heavy mass numbers can be understood with a relation of the form, $\\left[\\textrm{RoundOff}\\left(\\left(Z+2.9464\\right)^{1.2}-1.7165\\right)\\right]\\pm\\left[0,1\\right]\\pm\\left(2n\\right)$ where $n \\cong 0,1,2$. It needs a review with respect to even-odd proton numbers and other microscopic corrections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60cf6b9e30996d86ffe64c7dac8ea9b0b170747b5637de6244ac06680d19dc49","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
