The antenna is extracted from a circular monopole by inserting various patches and stubs. The genetic algorithm is utilized to optimize the parameters and achieve the best possible results regarding bandwidth and gain. Afterward, a 2-port multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) configuration is created by positioning an identical second single element perpendicularly to the first one. The electrical size of the suggested MIMO configuration is 0.26 λ<sub>L</sub> × 0.53 λ<sub>L</sub>, where λ<sub>L</sub> represents the free space wavelength at lower resonance of 2.45 GHz. The common ground technique is adopted to further reduce and achieve the accepted level of mutual coupling of the MIMO configuration. The presented MIMO antenna offers a low mutual coupling of &lt; –27 dB with 0.2 envelope correlation coefficient (ECC). The antenna has a gain of around 6.2 dBi and 6.5 dBi at resonating frequencies of 2.45 GHz and 5.4 GHz. Furthermore, the specific absorption rate (SAR) analysis of the MIMO antenna offers a range inside of the standard values, showing its potential for On/Off body communications. The comparison with already published works shows that the proposed antenna achieves better results in either compact size or wide operational bandwidth along with low mutual coupling.","author":"Wahaj Abbas Awan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"be85b107812450abcbb1120c8921a6c18eecca17d101371fab42e9419cf24ff7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
