{"title":"Precise Frequency Detecting Technology Based on Group Period Synchronization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0330/v1","date":1725431994000,"content":"Using different frequency group period phase synchronization, a precise frequency detecting technology is presented. On the basis of the phase comparison for different frequencies, a high-accuracy frequency measuring can be achieved by quantization of phase comparison results and analysis of quantization results. Using the phase coincidence points between comparison signals as the counter’s open and close signals, the time interval between the same phase coincidence points is a group period. Via the detection and analysis of the phase coincidence points, the ±1-word counting error can be eliminated, and measuring speed is also improved. By using FPGA technology, the measuring device can be simplified, and the development cost can be reduced. Testing results indicate that the frequency measuring accuracy with 10−13/s level can be achieved. The technology is greater than the common frequency measuring technology in more ways than one, such as power consumption, device volume, measuring rate, etc., so it plays an important role in Beidou satellite positioning, precise timing, high-precision time frequency transfer and comparison, scientific metrology and other fields.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2994796aa120b56f4ea3776b54952002cfdd691c2db359a958b01fdc8409bc8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
