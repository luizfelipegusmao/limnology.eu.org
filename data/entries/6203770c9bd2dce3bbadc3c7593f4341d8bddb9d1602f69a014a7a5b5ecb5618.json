{"title":"Geospatial Variation in Vaccination Coverage and Zero-Dose Prevalence at the District, Ward and Health Facility Levels Before and After a Measles Vaccination Campaign in Nigeria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0445/v1","date":1728378772000,"content":"Many measles endemic countries with suboptimal coverage levels still rely on vaccination campaigns to fill immunity gaps and boost control efforts. Depending on local epidemiological patterns, national or targeted campaigns are implemented, following which post-campaign coverage surveys (PCCSs) are conducted to evaluate their performance, particularly in terms of reaching previously unvaccinated children. Due to limited resources, PCCS surveys are designed to be representative at coarse spatial scales, often masking important heterogeneities in coverage that could enhance the identification of areas of poor performance for follow up via routine immunization strategies. Here, we undertake geospatial analyses of the 2021 measles PCCS in Nigeria to map indicators of coverage measuring the individual and combined performance of the campaign and routine immunization (RI) at 1x1 km resolution and the ward and district levels in 13 states. Using additional geospatial data sets, we also produced estimates of numbers of unvaccinated children during the campaign and numbers of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) zero-dose children before and after the campaign at these levels and within health facility catchment areas. Our study revealed that although the campaign reduced the numbers of MCV zero-dose children in all the districts, areas of suboptimal campaign and RI performance with considerable numbers of zero-dose children remained. Our analyses further identified wards and health facility catchment areas with higher numbers of unvaccinated children within these areas. Our outputs provide a robust evidence base to plan and implement follow-up RI strategies and to guide future campaigns at flexible and operationally relevant spatial scales.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6203770c9bd2dce3bbadc3c7593f4341d8bddb9d1602f69a014a7a5b5ecb5618","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
