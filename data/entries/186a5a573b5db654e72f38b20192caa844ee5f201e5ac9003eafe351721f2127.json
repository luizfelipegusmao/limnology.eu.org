In a recent study, Munasinghe et al. (2023) consider how variation in where TE families prefer to insert within the genome influences their copy number evolution. The study emphasizes how a preference for neutral insertion sites is only advantageous in conjunction with host restriction mechanisms, which suggests that insertion preference may be a strategy to mitigate genetic conflicts with the host.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"186a5a573b5db654e72f38b20192caa844ee5f201e5ac9003eafe351721f2127","category":"Environment"}
