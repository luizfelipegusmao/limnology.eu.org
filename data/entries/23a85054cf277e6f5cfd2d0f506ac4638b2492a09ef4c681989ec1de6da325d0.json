As a multifactorial disease, the gene-associated mechanisms are important to know. This study applied a bioinformatics approach to explore the molecular underpinning of type 2 diabetes mellitus through differential gene expression analysis. We used microarray datasets GSE16415 and GSE29226 to identify differentially expressed genes between type 2 diabetes and normal samples using R software. Following that, using the STRING database, the protein‐protein interaction network was constructed and further analyzed by Cytoscape software. The EnrichR database was used for Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis to explore key pathways and functional annotations of hub genes. We also used miRTarBase and TargetScan databases to predict miRNAs targeting hub genes. We identified 21 hub genes in type 2 diabetes, some showing more significant changes in the PPI network. Our results revealed that GLUL, SLC32A1, PC, MAPK10, MAPT, and POSTN genes are more important in the PPI network and can be experimentally investigated as therapeutic targets. Hsa-miR-492 and hsa-miR-16-5p are suggested for diagnosis and prognosis by targeting GLUL, SLC32A1, PC, MAPK10, and MAPT genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway.<div><strong>Insight:</strong> Type 2 diabetes, as a rising global and multifactorial disorder, is important to know the gene-associated mechanisms. In an integrative bioinformatics analysis, we integrated different finding datasets to put together and find valuable diagnostic and prognostic hub genes and miRNAs. In contrast, genes, RNAs, and enzymes interact systematically in pathways. Using multiple databases and software, we identified differential expression between hub genes of diabetes and normal samples. We explored different protein‐protein interaction networks, gene ontology, key pathway analysis, and predicted miRNAs that target hub genes. This study reported 21 significant hub genes and some miRNAs in the insulin signaling pathway for innovative and potential diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.</div></span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"08ec31a93e0a3f830088f3051f0870206dac7048d685312e4717ea0a4882ca75","entryHash":"23a85054cf277e6f5cfd2d0f506ac4638b2492a09ef4c681989ec1de6da325d0","category":"Environment"}
