{"title":"Presenting a Model for School Dropout of Girls in Deprived Areas Based on a Qualitative Investigation: A Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1878/v1","date":1727164882000,"content":"Education plays a key role in human societies and the development of nations. Providing social justice in a country creates educational justice, and educational justice grants equal opportunities for growth and prosperity to the members of the society. In reality, there are differences between urban and rural educational facilities, as well as between girls and boys. Deprived and rural areas are full of losses, from economic problems to intellectual and cultural blockages. Failure to enhance these areas leads to further decline in these environments, and one of its consequences in education is the dropout of students. Girls are especially exposed to this problem due to gender discrimination, traditional and religious views, and living conditions. The purpose of this research was to obtain in-depth information about the experiences and reactions of girls in deprived areas and to identify its factors. This case study was conducted in the Khuzestan province of Iran using the grounded theory, and the results of the interviews were categorized after coding and its paradigm model was presented. In the end, solutions were presented to reduce the dropout rate of girls in deprived areas and prevent this problem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"125b38aef0c1afc4fe7c96a9fe59797503febc1b2b0a8716a6b481e391a19f32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
