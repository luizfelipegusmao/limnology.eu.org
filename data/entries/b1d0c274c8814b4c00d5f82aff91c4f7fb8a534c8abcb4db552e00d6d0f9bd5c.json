The psoas muscle index was used to assess sarcopenia. The C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio, prognostic nutritional index, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio were used to calculate the preoperative inflammatory marker levels. The prognostic factors for overall survival were determined using Cox regression analysis.</p> Results <p>Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with sarcopenia. Sarcopenia showed a significant association with advanced tumor stage. Univariate analysis revealed a significant reduction in overall survival in patients with a prognostic nutritional index of &lt;45, C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio of ≥0.047, cancer antigen 19–9 levels of ≥130 U/mL, sarcopenia, lymph node metastasis, and vascular invasion. Multivariate analysis revealed that a C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio of ≥0.047 (hazards ratio, 3.383; 95% confidence interval: 1.384–8.689; <i>p</i>&lt; 0.001), cancer antigen 19–9 levels of ≥130 U/mL (hazards ratio, 2.720; 95% confidence interval: 1.291–6.060; <i>p</i> = 0.008), sarcopenia (hazards ratio, 3.256; 95% confidence interval: 1.535–7.072; <i>p</i> = 0.002) and vascular invasion (hazards ratio, 2.092; 95% confidence interval: 1.057–4.170; <i>p</i> = 0.034) were independent predictors of overall survival. Overall survival in the sarcopenia and high C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio groups was significantly poorer than that in the non-sarcopenia and low C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio and sarcopenia or high C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio groups.</p> Conclusion <p>Sarcopenia and a high C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio are independent prognostic factors in patients with pancreatic cancer after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Thus, sarcopenia may have a better prognostic value when combined with the C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio.</p>","author":"Masashi Utsumi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b1d0c274c8814b4c00d5f82aff91c4f7fb8a534c8abcb4db552e00d6d0f9bd5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
