{"title":"PP1 phosphatase controls both daughter cell formation and amylopectin levels in <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002791","date":1725976800000,"content":"<p>by Asma Sarah Khelifa, Maanasa Bhaskaran, Tom Boissavy, Thomas Mouveaux, Tatiana Araujo Silva, Cerina Chhuon, Marcia Attias, Ida Chiara Guerrera, Wanderley De Souza, David Dauvillee, Emmanuel Roger, Mathieu Gissot</p>\r\n\r\nVirulence of apicomplexan parasites is based on their ability to divide rapidly to produce significant biomass. The regulation of their cell cycle is therefore key to their pathogenesis. Phosphorylation is a crucial posttranslational modification that regulates many aspects of the eukaryotic cell cycle. The phosphatase PP1 is known to play a major role in the phosphorylation balance in eukaryotes. We explored the role of TgPP1 during the cell cycle of the tachyzoite form of the apicomplexan parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. Using a conditional mutant strain, we show that TgPP1 regulates many aspects of the cell cycle including the proper assembly of the daughter cellsâ€™ inner membrane complex (IMC), the segregation of organelles, and nuclear division. Unexpectedly, depletion of TgPP1 also results in the accumulation of amylopectin, a storage polysaccharide that is usually found in the latent bradyzoite form of the parasite. Using transcriptomics and phospho-proteomics, we show that TgPP1 mainly acts through posttranslational mechanisms by dephosphorylating target proteins including IMC proteins. TgPP1 also dephosphorylates a protein bearing a starch-binding domain. Mutagenesis analysis reveals that the targeted phospho-sites are linked to the ability of the parasite to regulate amylopectin steady-state levels. Therefore, we show that TgPP1 has pleiotropic roles during the tachyzoite cell cycle regulation, but also regulates amylopectin accumulation.","author":"Asma Sarah Khelifa","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"87784b5147327476fd816657539a9c8f6800ee9299749c752d5234fe6e74524b","category":"Environment"}
