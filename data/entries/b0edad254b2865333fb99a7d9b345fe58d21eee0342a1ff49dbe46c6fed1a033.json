Meanwhile, anthropogenic activities, including human disturbance and restoration in the coastal wetland, can substantially alter the carbon sequestration capacity, and the effect of the anthropogenic perturbation in mangroves was more extensive than that in salt marshes. Conserving all remaining intact coastal wetland in China will increase carbon sequestration to ~1.0 Tg C annually and protecting the remaining coastal wetland from degradation and restoring the degraded coastal wetland can effectively increase carbon sequestration.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Coastal wetlands play an important role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations and contribute significantly to climate change mitigation. However, climate change, reclamation, and restoration have been causing substantial changes in coastal wetland areas and carbon exchange in China during recent decades. Here we compiled a carbon flux database consisting of 15 coastal wetland sites to assess the magnitude, patterns, and drivers of carbon fluxes and to compare fluxes among contrasting natural, disturbed, and restored wetlands. The natural coastal wetlands have the average net ecosystem exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> (NEE) of −577 g C m<sup>−2</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>, with −821 g C m<sup>−2</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> for mangrove forests and −430 g C m<sup>−2</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> for salt marshes. There are pronounced latitudinal patterns for carbon dioxide exchange of natural coastal wetlands: NEE increased whereas gross primary production (GPP) and respiration of ecosystem decreased with increasing latitude. Distinct environmental factors drive annual variations of GPP between mangroves and salt marshes; temperature was the dominant controlling factor in salt marshes, while temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation were co-dominant in mangroves. Meanwhile, both anthropogenic reclamation and restoration had substantial effects on coastal wetland carbon fluxes, and the effect of the anthropogenic perturbation in mangroves was more extensive than that in salt marshes. Furthermore, from 1980 to 2020, anthropogenic reclamation of China's coastal wetlands caused a carbon loss of ~3720 Gg C, while the mangrove restoration project during the period of 2021–2025 may switch restored coastal wetlands from a carbon source to carbon sink with a net carbon gain of 73 Gg C. The comparison of carbon fluxes among these coastal wetlands can improve our understanding of how anthropogenic perturbation can affect the potentials of coastal blue carbon in China, which has implications for informing conservation and restoration strategies and efforts of coastal wetlands.</p>","author":"Weizhi Lu, \nJingfeng Xiao, \nHaiqiang Gao, \nQingyu Jia, \nZhengjie Li, \nJie Liang, \nQinghui Xing, \nDehua Mao, \nHong Li, \nXiaojing Chu, \nHui Chen, \nHaiqiang Guo, \nGuangxuan Han, \nBin Zhao, \nLuzhen Chen, \nDerrick Y.
