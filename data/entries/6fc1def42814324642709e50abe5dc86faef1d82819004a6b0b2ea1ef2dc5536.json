To achieve it, we first decompose the seismic records into a series of weighted Ricker wavelets using a fast inversion-based sparse seismic decomposition algorithm which is characterized by the ability of embodying contributions of arbitrary phase rotation Ricker wavelets during its decomposition procedure. Then, with the guidance of a new-defined position indicating vector, we stack the weighted Ricker wavelets that appear near same time sample to form the final decomposition results. As a quantitative application, we propose a <em>Q</em>-value estimation strategy according to the centroid frequencies of the acquired seismic wavelets. A single trace and Marmousi model synthetic examples are adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of seismic decomposition and <em>Q</em>-value estimation. In addition, our method is applied to both onshore and offshore field seismic data decomposition, successfully. The following estimated equivalent and interval <em>Q</em>-value attributes are further used for seismic resolution enhancement and carbonate reservoir heterogeneity evaluation, respectively.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"6fc1def42814324642709e50abe5dc86faef1d82819004a6b0b2ea1ef2dc5536","category":"Environment"}
