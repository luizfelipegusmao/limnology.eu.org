Microorganisms retrieved from such habitats are naturally adapted to extreme environments. Strains displaying plant growth-promoting abilities can play a vital role in improving degraded soil performance. The utilization of diazotrophs as natural nitrogen sources is particularly important as it reduces the reliance on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.</p>\n                  </span>\n                  <span>\n                    <h3>Method</h3>\n                    <p>To investigate this further, bacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere of wheat (<em>Triticum aestivum</em> L.), <em>Salicornia europaea</em> (L.), aster (<em>Tripolium pannonicum</em> subsp. <em>tripolium</em> (L.) Greuter), and maize (<em>Zea mays</em> L.) cultivated in the technosoils of Inowrocław, central Poland, influenced by the soda lime repository. A total of eleven bacteria were selected based on the presence of the <em>nif</em>H gene. The isolates were also tested for other growth-promoting traits, as well as biocontrol properties and antibiotic sensitivity. Finally, a germination test was performed on wheat seeds grown under nitrogen (N absence) and salt stress (150 mM NaCl) conditions.</p>\n                  </span>\n                  <span>\n                    <h3>Results</h3>\n                    <p>Isolates Azo12 and W4ii, identified as <em>Agrobacterium</em> sp. and <em>Azotobacter chroococcum</em>, respectively, significantly promoted the growth of seedling roots and leaves under salt stress compared to seedlings without bacteria (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.001). <em>Agrobacterium</em> sp.
