Participants self-completed questionnaires about health conditions, service use, and demographics. 572 attended a 2-hour health screening that included an assessment of prescribed medications; (3) Results: Most participants were female (55.3%), with a mean age of 69.1 (SD=9.2) years. Participants had a high prevalence of medical conditions, the most common were high blood pressure, arthritis, high lipids, hearing loss, and chronic pain. Almost all participants reported taking medications, with an average of 4.3 medications per person. Among those who attended the health screening, 78.1% were taking medications that could cause xerostomia (dry mouth); (4) Conclusions: This study provides initial information on the prevalence of medical conditions, medication usage, with potential impact on oral health of older adults living in rural Victoria. This information would be valuable for healthcare and dental workforce planning, policy development, and improving the overall well-being of this population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce136ce18163fa1ab0891eb8c9bc5c8cdbec197aa4fb136ca76c98ec4a584e22","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
