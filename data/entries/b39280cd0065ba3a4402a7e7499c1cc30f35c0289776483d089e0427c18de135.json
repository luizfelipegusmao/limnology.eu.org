{"title":"Reproductive morphophysiology of an iteroparous batch spawner fish: from early follicle development to ovulation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15891?af=R","date":1728396900000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Batch spawner fishes develop successive clutches of oocytes which allows them to participate in many reproductive cycles during their adult life (iteroparous) and spawn in multiple events within each breeding cycle. Here, ovarian follicular development was morpho-functionally analyzed in females of the iteroparous batch spawner fish <i>Gymnocorymbus ternetzi</i>. To obtain better insights into the reproductive morpho-physiology in batch spawners, the objective of this research was to analyze the dynamics of the follicular development, with its hormonal regulation between two active reproduction events. We found that over 16 days, follicles progressed asynchronously to chromatin nucleolus, Primary and Secondary growth stages of oogenesis with progressive secretion of 17β-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>). During the end of secondary growth, the increase in 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20β-p) was measured relative to the maturation process of the ovarian follicles (e.g., nuclear migration and its rupture during the resumption of meiosis). Interestingly, an additional increase in E<sub>2</sub> was observed after fish reproduction, probably related to the recruitment of new batch follicles for secondary growth. We also measured the high values of multiple condition factor post-reproduction measurements, reflecting more energy invested during the pre-reproductive process. We also quantified high concentrations of 17,20β-p, probably related to the recruitment of a new batch of oogonia to meiosis, presumably secreted by post-ovulatory follicles, after fish reproduction. We finally found that fish without exposure to reproductive stimulus developed a regression phase at day 24, characterized by massive follicle atresia, that allow them to recycle energy and constitutive materials of the follicles invested during oogenesis for another reproductive cycle.</p>","author":"Omar Domínguez‐Castanedo, \nCyndi G.
