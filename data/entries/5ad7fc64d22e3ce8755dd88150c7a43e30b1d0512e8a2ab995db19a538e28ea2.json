{"title":"Aircraft Wake Evolution Prediction Based on Parallel Hybrid Neural Network Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0814/v1","date":1715581843000,"content":"To overcome the time-consuming drawbacks of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) numerical simulations, this paper proposes a hybrid model based on a parallel architecture based on the concept of intelligent aerodynamics, named PA-TLA (Parallel Architecture combining TCN, LSTM, and Attention mechanism). This model utilizes CFD data to drive efficient predictions of aircraft wake evolution at different initial altitudes during the approach phase. Initially, CFD simulations of continuous initial altitudes during the approach phase are used to generate aircraft wake evolution data, which are then validated against real-world LIDAR data to verify their reliability. The PA-TLA model is designed based on a parallel architecture, combining Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and a tensor concatenation module based on the attention mechanism, which ensures computational efficiency while fully leveraging the advantages of each component in a parallel processing framework. The study results show that the PA-TLA model outperforms both the LSTM and TCN models in predicting the three characteristic parameters of aircraft wake: vorticity, circulation, and Q-criterion. Compared to the serially structured TCN-LSTM, PA-TLA achieves an average reduction in mean squared error (MSE) by 6.80%, mean absolute error (MAE) by 7.70%, and root mean square error (RMSE) by 4.47%, with an average increase in the coefficient of determination (RÂ²) by 0.36%, and a 35% improvement in prediction efficiency. Lastly, this study combines numerical simulation and the PA-TLA deep learning architecture to analyze the characteristics of wake evolution during the near-ground phase, providing theoretical value for further reducing aircraft wake intervals and enhancing airport operational efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ad7fc64d22e3ce8755dd88150c7a43e30b1d0512e8a2ab995db19a538e28ea2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
