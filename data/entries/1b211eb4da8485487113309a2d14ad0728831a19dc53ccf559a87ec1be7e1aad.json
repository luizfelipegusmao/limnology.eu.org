{"title":"Robust Soliton Crystal Generation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0207/v1","date":1727936479000,"content":"The deterministic generation of robust soliton comb has significant meaning for the optical frequency combs to be widely used in various applications. As a novel form of microcomb, Soliton crystal holds the advantages of easy generation, high conversion efficiency, and excellent thermal robustness. Here, we report the turnkey deterministic generation of ‘Palm-like’ soliton crystal with a free-running scheme. The robustness of the turnkey soliton crystal generation is also investigated in multiple aspects, including the success rate, the thermal robustness, and the long-term stability. The experiment results reveal our turnkey soliton crystal can achieve nearly a 100% success rate with a power variation less than ±1.5 dB over one hundred trials of two samples, is insensitive to thermal effects, and is robust to the environment during four-hour laboratory time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b211eb4da8485487113309a2d14ad0728831a19dc53ccf559a87ec1be7e1aad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
