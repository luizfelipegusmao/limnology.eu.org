{"title":"Complex patterns of morphological diversity across multiple populations of an urban bird species","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/7/1325/7663949?rss=1","date":1714694400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Urbanization presents a natural evolutionary experiment because selection pressures in cities can be strongly mismatched with those found in speciesâ€™ historic habitats. However, some species have managed to adapt and even thrive in these novel conditions. When a species persists across multiple cities, a fundamental question arises: do we see similar traits evolve in similar novel environments? By testing if and how similar phenotypes emerge across multiple urban populations, we can begin to assess the predictability of population response to anthropogenic change. Here, we examine variation within and across multiple populations of a songbird, the dark-eyed junco (<span>Junco hyemalis</span>). We measured morphological variations in juncos across urban and nonurban populations in Southern California. We investigated whether the variations we observed were due to differences in environmental conditions across cities. Bill shape differed across urban populations; Los Angeles and Santa Barbara juncos had shorter, deeper bills than nonurban juncos, but San Diego juncos did not. On the other hand, wing length decreased with the built environment, regardless of the population. Southern Californian urban juncos exhibit both similarities and differences in morphological traits. Studying multiple urban populations can help us determine the predictability of phenotypic evolutionary responses to novel environments.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"cafd45faaa4097528edea1953beb585da045d0105410fa14e46989a8da9fd2bd","category":"Environment"}
