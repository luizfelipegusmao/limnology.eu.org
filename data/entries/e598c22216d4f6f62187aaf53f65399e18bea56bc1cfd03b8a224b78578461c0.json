{"title":"Collection methods and distribution modeling for Strepsiptera in the United States","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/4/740/7690638?rss=1","date":1717977600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The twisted-wing parasite order (Strepsiptera Kirby, 1813) is difficult to study due to the complexity of strepsipteran life histories, small body sizes, and a lack of accessible distribution data for most species. Here, we present a review of the strepsipteran species known from New York State. We also demonstrate successful collection methods and a survey of species carried out in an old-growth deciduous forest dominated by native New York species (Black Rock Forest, Cornwall, NY) and a private site in the Catskill Mountains (Shandaken, NY). Additionally, we model suitable habitats for Strepsiptera in the United States with species distribution modeling. We base our models on host distribution and climatic variables to inform predictions of where these twisted-wing parasites are likely to be found. This work provides a useful reference for the future collection of Strepsiptera.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"e598c22216d4f6f62187aaf53f65399e18bea56bc1cfd03b8a224b78578461c0","category":"Environment"}
