{"title":"Aging-Friendly Recreational Landscapes in Residential Green Spaces: A Systematic Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1480/v1","date":1729504792000,"content":"Aging is a common global challenge. The World Health Organization has released the guide “Global Age-Friendly Cities: An equitable, inclusive and sustainable place” in which it is stated that age-friendly recreational landscapes are one of the important elements for cities and communities to create suitable leisure and social activities for older people. As a healthy green living room at the doorstep, residential green space is of great significance for building age-friendly recreational landscapes in residential green spaces. In this paper, based on the perspective of the demand of older adults for residential green space recreational landscapes, we use the systematic literature review method to comprehensively and deeply comb and summarize the existing research results and put forward China’s future key research directions in this field in a comparative analysis. The study found that: 1. The research heat in this direction has been high in the past five years, and the amount of literature in China and the United States is the highest. 2. The main disciplines involved in the study are landscape architecture, public health, and sociology, and the amount of literature in the direction of public health in international journals is the most, and the papers in the direction of landscape architecture in China are the most. 3. The main research methods used are quantitative research, which accounts for 58% of the literature, and questionnaire surveys, which account for 51% of the literature. 4. The main independent variables involved are green space area, walking environment, recreational and health facilities, community participation, etc., and the main dependent variables are satisfaction, frequency of green space use, physical and mental health, community cohesion, and sense of well-being. 5. The five main theories involved are demand theory, ecology theory, health promotion theory, environmental psychology, and environmental gerontology theory. International literature is mostly studied from health promotion theory and ecological theory, and Chinese literature is mostly studied from the perspective of need theory. 6. Measurement indexes are different in diverse disciplines, among which the direction of landscape architecture mainly explores the influence of green space safety, accessibility, multi-functionality, environmental aesthetics, and recreational facilities on the satisfaction, and happiness of older adults from the perspective of green space planning and design. In the direction of public health, the impact of green space on the physical, psychological, and social health of older adults is mainly explored from the perspectives of green space areas, neighborhood environments, and community participation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ff5aa9a034758d166a20e7e6064eb70acce7f896b2dd790fc8cd29fe2448c79","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
