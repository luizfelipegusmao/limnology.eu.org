{"title":"Enhancing Food Security through Data Insights: Exploring How Household Dietary Diversity Score and Spatial Visualization in Chilean Vulnerable Population Can Inform Food Governance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1502/v1","date":1724192382000,"content":"This study explores how the Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) and spatial visualization can inform food governance in Chile, focusing on socio-demographic and geographical determinants affecting food consumption patterns. A national household database (n=4,407) provided by the “Family Support Program of Food Self-Sufficiency” (FSPFS) of the Ministry of Social Development and Family was analyzed. The findings revealed that Chilean vulnerable households were led mostly by women (86.6%), with an age average of 55.9 15.6 years old, versus 68.9 12.9 years in the case of men. The intake frequency analysis showed that dairy, fruits, and vegetables were below the recommended values in at least half of the households, and that fats and sugars were above recommended levels. Regarding the HDDS [0-189], the national average was of 91.4 ± 20.6 and was significantly influenced by the number of minors in the households, water access, food access issues, and residing in the Zona Sur. Finally, the spatial visualization showed that the Zona Central had higher consumption of fruits and vegetables, while the extreme zones Norte Grande and Zona Austral showed higher intakes of fats and sugars. These findings emphasize the importance of leveraging data insights like HDDS and spatial visualization to enhance food security and inform food governance strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"66a4d889df43f78a3126404b2186367a6fc46e070ae8c3e477c07e02c459394b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
