{"title":"Cell Death in Crustacean Immune Defense","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/raq.12976?af=R","date":1726119215000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Cell death mechanisms in crustaceans are a complex interplay of processes essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune defense. Modes of cell death like apoptosis, necroptosis, and necrosis are well-documented in crustaceans, serving crucial roles in removing damaged or infected cells. Unlike in other organisms, crustaceans likely lack pyroptosis, a type of programmed cell death associated with innate immunity and inflammation, because they do not possess the gasdermin genes essential for this process. Recently, NETosis and ferroptosis have emerged as significant mechanisms in pathogen defense. NETosis, involving the release of DNA fibers and antimicrobial proteins, helps trap and neutralize pathogens, while ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death, contributes to lipid peroxidation and immune responses. Cuproptosis, although not yet studied in the context of crustacean immunity, shows potential crosstalk with ferroptosis, particularly in the regulation of metal ion homeostasis, oxidative stress, and cellular metabolism. Understanding these mechanisms offers promising applications in aquaculture, such as developing targeted immune modulators and enhancing disease resistance in economically important crustacean species.</p>","author":"Zeyan Chen, \nMuhammad Tayyab, \nDefu Yao, \nJudeÂ Juventus Aweya, \nZhihong Zheng, \nXianliang Zhao, \nZhongyang Lin, \nYueling Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Reviews in Aquaculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e603512385355dc11b8c11c7000aba80fad3ae9faea7a2537d8e3609c19b97a1","entryHash":"c9695e837d26fc36672a9b4fbf328ecca21fd7fa6fef53d1030ea807e784813c","category":"Environment"}
