{"title":"Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression and Anxiety in Patients With Schizophrenia in Psychiatric Home Nursing Service: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1324/v1","date":1718779378000,"content":"This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to explore whether depression and anxiety could be reduced by psychiatric home healthcare supporters offering brief cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp) at home using a workbook for patients with schizophrenia. Eighteen patients with schizophrenia treated in a psychiatric home nursing service were randomly assigned to two groups: one group received CBTp in addition to usual care (CBTp + TAU group; n=8) and the other received only usual care (TAU group; n=8); 2 patients were excluded due to hospitalization or withdrawal of consent. Eight weekly CBTp sessions were conducted; anxiety/depression, quality of life, self-esteem, and overall functioning were assessed at baseline, week 9, and week 13. There was no significant difference in the primary evaluation; however, a significant improvement (p=0.014) was observed in the secondary evaluation of quality of life. The effect size was 0.95 for primary evaluation and 1.33 for the secondary evaluation, indicating a large effect. This study showed that nurses and occupational therapists can provide CBTp in psychiatric home care for patients with schizophrenia to potentially alleviate anxiety and depression compared to standard psychiatric home care alone. Therefore, larger RCTs with larger sample sizes are recommended.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb37c514530507d73acea39728ade69f21e0bee0a93afbe6acddd616271684b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
