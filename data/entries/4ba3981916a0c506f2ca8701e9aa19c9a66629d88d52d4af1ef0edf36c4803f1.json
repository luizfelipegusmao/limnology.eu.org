{"title":"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence to Identify Therapeutic Pathways in Trypanosoma cruzi: A Comparative Approach with Trypanosoma brucei","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1782/v1","date":1729731796000,"content":"Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, presents a significant challenge in global health due to the parasite's complex life cycle and its persistence in human tissues. In contrast, advances in treating Trypanosoma brucei infections, notably through the use of irreversible enzyme inhibitors like eflornithine, offer valuable insights into therapeutic strategies. This article explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can aid in identifying crucial metabolic and biochemical pathways in T. cruzi that could serve as targets for irreversible enzymatic inhibitors, drawing parallels to the successful inhibition of T. bruceiâ€™s ornithine decarboxylase. By employing AI for data mining, drug-target interaction prediction, pathway modelling, and drug repurposing, researchers can accelerate the discovery of novel treatments. We compare the biological and biochemical differences between T. cruzi and T. brucei, highlighting how AI can bridge the gap in drug discovery and offer new possibilities for Chagas disease treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ba3981916a0c506f2ca8701e9aa19c9a66629d88d52d4af1ef0edf36c4803f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
