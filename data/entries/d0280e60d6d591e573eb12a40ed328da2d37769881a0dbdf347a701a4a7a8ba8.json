Prevention requires increasing knowledge and awareness, improving meat inspection and hygiene, and promoting safe food handling and sanitation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and practice (KP) of residents in Pak Chong District, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, regarding taeniasis and cysticercosis.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional study was conducted in Pak Chong District, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, and its 11 subdistrict municipalities. Study participants were selected using a stratified random sampling design. A validated questionnaire (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.70) was used to collect socio-demographic information and assess knowledge and practices related to taeniasis and cysticercosis. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression were used for the analysis.</p> Results <p>Of the 360 survey respondents, 65.0% (n = 234) were women, 82.2% (n = 296) were aged under 60 years, 99.2% (n = 357) identified as Buddhist, 87.5% (n = 315) had less than a bachelor’s degree education level, 54.2% (n = 195) had monthly family income ≥10,000 Thai baht, 10.6% (n = 38) were unemployed, and 26.1% (n = 93) lived in a town municipality. The survey revealed that 98.3% (n = 354) of participants were categorized as having less accurate knowledge and 83.6% (n = 301) were classified as more frequently engaging in correct prevention practices. Our study revealed that pig farmers (1.7%) occasionally permitted the pigs to forage freely. The results of multiple linear regression analysis revealed that knowledge scores were positively associated with household income ≥10,000 Thai baht (<i>βadj</i> = 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65 to 2.36). Practice scores were negatively associated with age over 60 years (<i>βadj</i> = −1.77, 95% CI −3.14 to −0.40) and living in a subdistrict municipality (<i>βadj</i> = −2.58, 95% CI −3.77 to −1.39). There was no association between KP regarding taeniasis and cysticercosis in the population of Pak Chong.</p> Conclusions <p>Overall, participants’ knowledge was lacking. Public education interventions are recommended to improve knowledge among residents with low socioeconomic status. These findings can inform the development of targeted interventions and educational programs in Pak Chong District, especially among elderly people in subdistrict municipalities, to improve practices for the prevention and control of these parasitic infections.</p>","author":"Wuttipong Phumrattanaprapin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d0280e60d6d591e573eb12a40ed328da2d37769881a0dbdf347a701a4a7a8ba8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
