{"title":"Enhancing Cybersecurity Incident Response: AI-Driven Optimization for Strengthened Advance Persistence Threat Detection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1725/v1","date":1727084636000,"content":"The Cyber Security Incident Response Team executes its critical duties in the Centralized Security Operation Centers. Its primary target is to protect organizational resources from all types of Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) and attacks while making the correct judgments at the right time. Despite the great efforts and the efficient tools, the incident response mechanism faces two significant challenges. The generation of large amounts of alerts with huge rates of false positives per unit of time and the time-consuming manual expert engagement in the post-alert decision phase. The main aim of this research study is to investigate the potential of Machine Learning techniques in solving the above challenges. This study proposes six event detection modules to identify 14 different types of malicious behavior using Splunk. The available APT dataset is extended by adding more alert types. Then, the machine learning techniques i.e., Random Forest, and XGBoost, are applied to improve the decision process and reduce the false positive alerts of the Security Information and Event Management system. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques by predicting an accuracy of 99.6%.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cca5fa988cf1eba297498d9f3c16c46e7a018b8138ad505bf21cf8192908bca0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
