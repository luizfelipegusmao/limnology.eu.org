{"title":"Modeling and Simulation of Piezoelectric-Based Train-Induced Vibration Energy Harvester Railway Track Monitoring System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1778/v1","date":1714154709000,"content":"This study aimed to evaluate a cantilever beam-type piezoelectric energy harvester operating on train-induced vibrations for powering Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) used in railway track monitoring systems. The harvester's behaviors under different conditions are simulated in MATLAB using the analytical model. Natural frequency, maximum deflection, and stress were calculated with greater precision using eigenfrequency and stationary analysis usingÂ COMSOL Multiphysics. At a base excitation of 2 g and a resonant frequency of 4.38 Hz, the simulated results showed that the developed energy harvester prototype could generate up to 14 V of AC output voltage and 550 mW of output power. These findings highlight the promising potential of the proposed energy harvester for transforming train mechanical energy into electrical power. This energy harvester's viability and dependability for real-world applications in monitoring railway tracks are supported by developed analytical and simulation models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f6ff3c3df70ac052ec7685ad261d701f2548b8d1d6d1590abf40cece3fac08e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
