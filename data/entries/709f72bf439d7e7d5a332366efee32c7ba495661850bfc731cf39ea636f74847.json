We found chaotic dynamics in the groundwater and rainfall data, but a dominant trend component was seen in the groundwater-level data from phase plots. Dynamics suggest the presence of self-organized criticality/chaos in the groundwater dynamics over decadal time scales. We used BNN prediction models, (i) nonlinear autoregressive (NAR), (ii) nonlinear input–output (NIO) and (iii) nonlinear autoregressive exogenic Input (NARX), to predict the groundwater levels with rainfall and temperature as exogenic inputs. We noticed ~ 94 to 95% prediction accuracy with the NAR model with optimal inputs and ~ 1% improvement with added exogenic input. Interestingly, the study indicates that (i) the dynamics of the groundwater differ significantly from rainfall and temperature in the region, (ii) the nonlinear autoregressive model based on the self-organized dynamics of groundwater-level changes is robust in providing prediction accuracy up to ~ 95%, and (iii) the dynamics of remaining ~ 5% groundwater-level changes may be due to the presence of randomly varying extreme weather events and man-made/anthropogenic changes.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"709f72bf439d7e7d5a332366efee32c7ba495661850bfc731cf39ea636f74847","category":"Environment"}
