{"title":"Influence of Fibers on Shear Behavior of Concrete Beams Reinforced with Steel and GFRP Rebars","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1272/v1","date":1726536697000,"content":"The behavior of concrete beams reinforced with steel and Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) rebars, without shear reinforcement is investigated in the current study. This study includes testing experimentally of twenty-four steel and GFRP Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams cast with different percentage of fibers. The beams were split into two types, steel and GFRP RC beams. Beams of different fiber ratios (0, 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5%) were developed and tested, in two groups, each consists of twelve specimens, steel and GFRP reinforced RC beams. Both steel and GFRP RC beams were cast as singly reinforced with 10 mm diameter longitudinal bars at the bottom. In order to ensure that the beam to fail under shear, the top reinforcement and stirrups are removed. The concrete cover was kept as 30 mm. Three concrete grades (M30, M60 and M80) were examined for different dosage of fibers for both steel and GFRP RC beams. The size of the beam samples was kept as 150 ×200×1500 mm. The key parameters were the form of reinforcement material (steel and GFRP), compressive strength of concrete and fiber percentage. Failure mode, ultimate load carrying capacity, mid-span deflection, strain in concrete and reinforcement (steel and GFRP) of the beams have been reported. It is found that the effect of using fibers and higher grade of concrete is more pronounced in improving stiffness of GFRP RC beams compared to steel RC beams. Hence it can be concluded that GFRP rebars can be used as an efficient type of reinforcement in RC beams.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d2cf84f97d67f2be80dc7d76e58638ae22bb1bb28ccb0e6e30ae5654fa4ee603","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
