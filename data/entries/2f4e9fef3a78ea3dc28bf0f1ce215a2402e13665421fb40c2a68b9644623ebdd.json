{"title":"Wireworm species associated with corn and soybean agroecosystems in Ontario, Canada","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/5/760/7717940?rss=1","date":1721606400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Wireworms, the larvae of click beetles (Coleoptera: Elateridae), are often the target of insecticide seed treatments commonly used in corn (<span>Zea mays</span> L.) and soybean (<span>Glycine max</span> (L.) Merr.) production in North America. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge of the species, life history, and economic impact of wireworms present in these agroecosystems. An extensive survey of wireworms was conducted in corn and soybean fields in Ontario, Canada, from 2014 to 2017 to document species distribution and co-occurrence and to identify risk factors related to their abundance. In total, 4,332 specimens were collected from 1,245 different sampling records. The dominant species collected was <span>Limonius agonus</span> (Say) (Coleoptera: Elateridae) comprising 71.5% of the specimens. The remaining wireworm specimens were identified as <span>Hypnoidus abbreviatus</span> (Say), <span>Melanotus similis</span> (Kirby), <span>M. cribulosus</span> (LeConte), <span>M. depressus</span> (Melsheimer), <span>M. communis</span> (Gyllenhal), <span>Agriotes mancus</span> (Say), <span>Aeolus mellillus</span> (Say), and <span>Hemicrepidius</span> spp (Germar). Multiple wireworm species were found to commonly occur within the same field and the same sample. Path analysis was conducted to investigate whether site, soil, and agronomic characteristics influenced wireworm distribution and abundance. Several significant relationships were found between wireworm species and geographic factors, soil texture, and agronomic practices. The results of this survey provide critical information that can be used to improve integrated pest management of the major wireworm genera found in corn and soybean agroecosystems in Ontario.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"2f4e9fef3a78ea3dc28bf0f1ce215a2402e13665421fb40c2a68b9644623ebdd","category":"Environment"}
