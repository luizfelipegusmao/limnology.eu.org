{"title":"Health assessment of nesting loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in one of their largest rookeries (central eastern Florida coast, USA)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae064/7762818?rss=1","date":1726790400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Reproduction is a physiologically demanding process for sea turtles. Health indicators, including morphometric indices and blood analytes, provide insight into overall health, physiology and organ function for breeding sea turtles as a way to assess population-level effects. The Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge (ACNWR) on Florida’s central eastern coast is critical nesting habitat for loggerhead sea turtles (<span>Caretta caretta</span>), but health variables from this location have not been documented. Objectives of the study were to (1) assess morphometrics and blood analyte data (including haematology, plasma biochemistry, protein electrophoresis, β-hydroxybutyrate, trace nutrients, vitamins and fatty acid profiles) from loggerheads nesting on or near the beaches of the ACNWR, (2) investigate correlations of body condition index (BCI) with blood analytes and (3) analyse temporal trends in morphometric and blood analyte data throughout the nesting season. Morphometric and/or blood analyte data are reported for 57 nesting loggerheads encountered between 2016 and 2019. Plasma copper and iron positively correlated with BCI. Mass tended to decline across nesting season, whereas BCI did not. Many blood analytes significantly increased or decreased across nesting season, reflecting the catabolic state and haemodynamic variations of nesting turtles. Twenty-three of 34 fatty acids declined across nesting season, which demonstrates the physiological demands of nesting turtles for vitellogenesis and reproductive activities, thus suggesting potential utility of fatty acids for the assessment of foraging status and phases of reproduction. The findings herein are relevant for future spatiotemporal and interspecies comparisons, investigating stressor effects and understanding the physiological demands in nesting sea turtles. This information provides comparative data for individual animals in rescue or managed care settings and for assessment of conservation strategies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"c4063c99caf1458c958f92098e5614cd78456793ecaa309a0bbb4b288df15315","category":"Environment"}
