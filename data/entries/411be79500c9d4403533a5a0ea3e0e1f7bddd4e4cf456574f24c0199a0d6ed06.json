Hesseling</p>\r\n\r\nDrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is threatening global TB control. Although formulations designed for children are a priority, adult levofloxacin formulations are widely used in TB treatment and prevention. TB-CHAMP was a cluster-randomised, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of 24 weeks of daily levofloxacin to prevent TB in child and adolescent household contacts of adults with infectious multidrug-resistant TB. Nested in-depth longitudinal qualitative work was conducted in a subset of children and their caregivers to understand broader experiences of treatment acceptability. We conducted 41 interviews with 8 caregivers of children &lt;6 years, and with 6 older children responding for themselves. Children who could not swallow the adult formulation whole, found the tablet unpalatable, although they learnt to tolerate the taste over time. Most caregivers and children came from families with substantial experience of TB, but felt they knew little about TB preventive therapy. Many families experienced challenging socio-economic circumstances. Poor acceptability was mitigated by sympathetic study personnel, assistance with transport and financial compensation. The adult formulation of levofloxacin was disliked by many younger children but was acceptable to children able to swallow the tablet whole. In addition to using acceptable drug formulations, TB preventive treatment implementation models should include patient education and should accommodate patientsâ€™ socioeconomic challenges.","author":"Susan E.
