{"title":"Spin Helicity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202301.0571/v3","date":1718606044000,"content":"Under the quaternion group, $Q_8$, spin helicity emerges as an element of reality, and complementary to spin polarization.  Here we show that the correlation in EPR coincidence experiments is conserved upon separation from a singlet, being divided between polarization and coherence. Including helicity accounts for the violation of Bell's Inequalities without non-locality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9f199d07a9f8cfa64332dc89c0c69124598029ff75384b8f3c961cd1d5902ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
