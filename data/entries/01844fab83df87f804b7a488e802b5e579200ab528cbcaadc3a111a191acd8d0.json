{"title":"The Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures Research on Key Considerations and Policies in Taiwan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2113/v1","date":1727345979000,"content":"The study provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the existing key policies and considerations in Taiwan's Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures (OECMs), with the objective of providing useful evidence-based insights for formulating new effective environmental-friendly policies and promoting the existing policies. The study adopts a mixed research methodology that entails the combination of qualitative and quantitative research methodological frameworks. The primary source of the quantitative data for the study is the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) which provides variable data on OECMs and a component of databases of the Protected Planet Initiative (PPI) which is the joint product of UNEP and IUCN, managed by UNEP-WCMC and the IUCN working with governments, communities and collaborating partners. The qualitative methodological framework for the research adopted a technical systematic review approach based on the three-step framework for systematic reviews that involved planning, conducting and reporting the review. The review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The sources that were included in the review included scientific research materials that focused on the policies related to OECMs. Taiwan has a total of 92 individual areas that are designated as national protected areas (PAs) and OECMs and formally recognized by the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA). Out of the 92 designated areas, only seven are managed by the Construction and Planning Agency while the remaining 85 areas are managed by the Forestry Bureau. In terms of designation, 37 areas are designated as major wildlife habitats, 21 areas are designated as nature reserves, 20 areas are designated as wildlife refuges, eight areas are designated as national parks and six areas are designated as forest reserves. The primary themes that were identified were associated with marine spatial planning, environmental impact assessment (EIA) and marine scientific research and included biodiversity, protected area consideration, geographically defined areas, coastal resources and marine ecosystems. Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures (OECMs) have not been widely implemented yet, but most countries, including Taiwan, are increasingly aligning their existing policies with the strategies outlined in the OECMs policies to achieve large area-based conservation targets and reduce biodiversity loss.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"01844fab83df87f804b7a488e802b5e579200ab528cbcaadc3a111a191acd8d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
