{"title":"Comprehensive analysis of basement membrane‐related gene based on single‐cell and bulk RNA sequencing data to predict prognosis and evaluate immune characteristics in colorectal cancer","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24211?af=R","date":1709717091000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Aims</h2>\n<p>Basement membrane-related genes (BMs) participate in regulating cell polarity, invasion, metastasis, and survival across different tumor types. Nevertheless, the specific functions of BMs in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain uncertain.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>To investigate the clinical relevance of BMs in CRC, we retrieved both gene expression and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets for subsequent analysis. The Kaplan–Meier (K–M) survival curve was employed to evaluate prognosis in high- and low-risk groups. Furthermore, additional analyses, including nomogram construction, functional enrichment, examination of the tumor immune microenvironment, prediction of small-molecule drugs, and more, were conducted to delve into the significance of BM-related signatures in CRC. Single-cell data from seven CRC patients were obtained from the TISCH2 database, and expression validation and cell source exploration of BM-related signatures were performed. Lastly, the expression and function of TIMP1, a key gene in BMs that may play a role in the progression of CRC, was validated in vitro through a series of basic experiments.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>We constructed a seven BMs-based model to categorize CRC patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. K–M survival analysis indicated a poorer prognosis for high-risk CRC patients. Cox regression analysis further identified the risk score as an independent prognostic factor for CRC patients. The nomogram model exhibited superior discrimination and calibration abilities of CRC patients. Based on the results from GO/KEGG and GSEA, genes in the high-risk subgroup were implicated in immune-related pathways and exhibited a positive correlation with immune checkpoints. In single-cell data, we found that TIMP1 is highly expressed in many cells, especially in malignant tumor cells. We also observed up-regulation of TIMP1 in CRC cell lines, promoting cancer invasion and migration in vitro.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Our study has discovered a novel prognostic index derived from BM-related genes in CRC patients. Specifically, the new model enables patient stratification, improving the selection of individuals likely to benefit from immunotherapy.</p>","author":"Jing Han, \nQipeng Wang, \nShangshang Li, \nJie Yang, \nZhengcai Qiu, \nWei Fu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"c236457d9ab283a1cf3fa76e1e63b9a3e34940bd657c6c503e5724d58f71f04a","category":"Environment"}
