{"title":"Autocrine phosphatase PDP2 inhibits ferroptosis by dephosphorylating ACSL4 in the Luminal A Breast Cancer","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299571","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by Jun-Jie Zhu, Feng-Ying Huang, Hengyu Chen, Yun-long Zhang, Ming-Hui Chen, Ri-Hong Wu, Shu-Zhen Dai, Gui-Sheng He, Guang-Hong Tan, Wu-Ping Zheng</p>\r\n\r\nPhosphatases can dephosphorylate phosphorylated kinases, leading to their inactivation, and ferroptosis is a type of cell death. Therefore, our aim is to identify phosphatases associated with ferroptosis by analyzing the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the Luminal A Breast Cancer (LumABC) cohort from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). An analysis of 260 phosphatase genes from the GeneCard database revealed that out of the 28 DEGs with high expression, only the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 2 (PDP2) had a significant correlation with patient survival. In addition, an analysis of DEGs using gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and gene set enrichment analysis revealed a significant variation in the expression of ferroptosis-related genes. To further investigate this, we analyzed 34 ferroptosis-related genes from the TCGA-LumABC cohort. The expression of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4) was found to have the highest correlation with the expression of PDP2, and its expression was also inversely proportional to the survival rate of patients. Western blot experiments using the MCF-7 cell line showed that the phosphorylation level of ACSL4 was significantly lower in cells transfected with the HA-PDP2 plasmid, and ferroptosis was correspondingly reduced (p &lt; 0.001), as indicated by data from flow cytometry detection of membrane-permeability cell death stained with 7-aminoactinomycin, lipid peroxidation, and Fe<sup>2+</sup>. Immunoprecipitation experiments further revealed that the phosphorylation level of ACSL4 was only significantly reduced in cells where PDP2 and ACSL4 co-precipitated. These findings suggest that PDP2 may act as a phosphatase to dephosphorylate and inhibit the activity of ACSL4, which had been phosphorylated and activated in LumABC cells. Further experiments are needed to confirm the molecular mechanism of PDP2 inhibiting ferroptosis.","author":"Jun-Jie Zhu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"66dac60e4e3c340fd8dbc5a5d5de1fc888c3e26aef2a957143e15b0593b50707","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
