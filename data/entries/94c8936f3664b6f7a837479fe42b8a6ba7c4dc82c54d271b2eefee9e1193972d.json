{"title":"Securing Tomorrow&rsquo;s Digital World: Key Trends in Cyber security for 2024","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0576/v1","date":1725874745000,"content":"It is critical to keep abreast of emerging dangers in the constantly changing field of cyber security. As 2024 approaches, numerous technological developments and trends are changing how businesses handle cyber security. This article explores the cutting edge of cyber security developments that are expected to rule in 2024. The field of cyber security is undergoing a revolution, from the adoption of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) as the new paradigm to the integration of AI and ML for real-time threat detection. Solutions for Extended Detection and Response (XDR) are becoming the mainstay for thorough threat detection and response in a variety of contexts, including networks, endpoints, and cloud environments. The use of biometric authentication techniques is growing in popularity because they provide better access control and identity verification. Concurrently, Deception Technologies are altering defensive tactics by using fictitious assets to trick and identify attackers at an early stage. Quantum-resistant cryptography, which aims to protect sensitive data from future quantum attacks, is on the horizon given the threat posed by quantum computing. Furthermore, the growing number of linked devices emphasizes how critical it is to strengthen IoT security protocols. Moreover, as long as companies are using cloud computing, they must make sure that strong cloud security protocols are in place. Simultaneously, the emergence of containerization technologies demands a targeted strategy for containerized environment security. Organizations must adopt these practices and strengthen their defenses against new threats as the cyber security landscape changes. Businesses may confidently and resiliently traverse the complex cybersecurity landscape of 2024 by remaining aware and implementing proactive security measures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94c8936f3664b6f7a837479fe42b8a6ba7c4dc82c54d271b2eefee9e1193972d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
