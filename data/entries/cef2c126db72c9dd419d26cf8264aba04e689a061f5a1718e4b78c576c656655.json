{"title":"Identification of clobromazolam in Australian emergency department intoxications using data-independent high-resolution mass spectrometry and the HighResNPS.com database","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/5/273/7624899?rss=1","date":1708646400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The proliferation of novel psychoactive substances (NPSs) continues to challenge toxicology laboratories. In particular, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime considers designer benzodiazepines to be a current primary threat among all NPSs. Herein, we report detection of a new emerging designer benzodiazepine, clobromazolam, using high-resolution mass spectrometry and untargeted data acquisition in combination with a “suspect screening” method built from the crowd-sourced HighResNPS.com database. Our laboratory first detected clobromazolam in emergency department presenting intoxications included within the Emerging Drugs Network of Australia—Victoria project in the state of Victoria, Australia, from April 2022 to March 2023. Clobromazolam was the most frequent designer benzodiazepine detected in this cohort (100/993 cases, 10%). No patients reported intentional administration of clobromazolam, although over half reported exposure to alprazolam, which was detected in only 7% of cases. Polydrug use was prevalent (98%), with phenazepam (45%), methylamphetamine (71%) and other benzodiazepines (60%) most frequently co-detected. This is the first case series published in the literature concerning clobromazolam in clinical patients. The identification of clobromazolam in patients presenting to emergency departments in Victoria demonstrates how high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with the HighResNPS.com database can be a valuable tool to assist toxicology laboratories in keeping abreast of emerging psychoactive drug use.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"cef2c126db72c9dd419d26cf8264aba04e689a061f5a1718e4b78c576c656655","category":"Environment"}
