Magnons may be able to transmit information over macroscopic distances without ohmic losses, making them especially tempting as information carriers [<a href=\"#ozae044.772-B1\">1</a>]. Understanding how the bonding and local structure of a material affects magnon behavior is of necessary to create a real-world application with magnons. Traditional characterization methods, such as Inelastic Neutron Scattering or Raman Spectroscopy, can be a powerful tool to detect magnons, but they provide relatively delocalized information about the sample. The next step in the evolution of vibrational spectroscopy is to leverage the flexibility and spatial resolution of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to collect localized vibrational data using electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) [<a href=\"#ozae044.772-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f114448c344ce44247df25eb6716bb56f1ff37a154a0beeaf7aeee9f6e46bf2c","category":"Environment"}
