{"title":"Length–Weight Relationship, Condition Factor and Maturity Characteristics of an Invasive Oreochromis niloticus (Cichlidae) in an Alkaline‐Saline Lake Nakuru, Kenya","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lre.12462?af=R","date":1722251363000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Studies on the length–weight relationship (LWR), condition factor (<i>K</i>) and size at first maturity status are important aspects of fish biology and fisheries management. Although many studies have reported about growth parameters of <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> under various fishery waters and aquaculture systems, a recent invasion of the species in Lake Nakuru (Kenya) is a new case study. Therefore, this paper provides baseline data on LWR, K and Lm<sub>50</sub> of <i>O</i>. <i>niloticus</i> in relation to limnological conditions in the lake. Water quality parameters (pH, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, salinity and total suspended solids) and indicators of eutrophication status (phosphates, nitrates and chlorophyll<i>-a</i>.) were analysed in November 2020 and November 2021. Fish samples were collected using experimental gillnets with assorted mesh sizes from 2 to 4 in., and their morphometric data was analysed. Results show significant spatial variations (ANOVA; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in all the water quality parameters. These parameters, except the temperature, also significantly differed between the study periods (<i>t</i>-test; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <i>O. niloticus</i> was the most dominant species, comprising 75.3% and 90.8%, in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Mean total length (19.80 cm) and weight (169 g) of the fish in 2021 were greater than 19.20 cm and 153 g in 2020. Nile tilapia exhibited an isometric LWR (<i>b</i> = 3), better well-being (<i>K</i>&gt;1), but it matured at smaller sizes (&lt;25 cm) in both sexes. Further monitoring of water quality changes in Lake Nakuru and their future impact on the population of <i>O</i>. <i>niloticus</i> is recommended.</p>","author":"Alice Mutie, \nGeorge N.
