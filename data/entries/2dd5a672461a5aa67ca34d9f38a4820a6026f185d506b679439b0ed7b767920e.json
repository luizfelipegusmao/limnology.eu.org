{"title":"An Ontology-Based Booking Application for Personalized Packages in the Health Tourism Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1123/v1","date":1718606515000,"content":"Currently, health tourists primarily rely on independent facilitators to manage and book their medical appointments and vacation plans. There is a notable absence of dedicated booking applications for health tourism packages. This paper proposes HealthTourismHub, an application designed to provide personalized packages that include medical appointments, accommodation options and recommended tourism activities. It also serves as a platform for medical experts and accommodation providers, allowing health tourists to discover and connect with them. To incorporate personalization, HealthTourismHub uses an ontology that organizes medical and tourism data, along with a reasoner that generates new knowledge. This approach enables the application to offer customized packages and identify the most suitable providers for each user. Providers are strategically paired and located in close proximity, with the package also including personalized tourism recommendations. A survey was conducted to assess the usability of the application and general perspectives towards health tourism, including motivations, concerns, and preferences. The results revealed an above-average SUS score, indicating that users found the application user-friendly and effective. Some areas for improvement were identified, such as error handling and additional functionalities. Nonetheless, HealthTourismHub shows great potential as a pioneer in the field of health tourism applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2dd5a672461a5aa67ca34d9f38a4820a6026f185d506b679439b0ed7b767920e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
