{"title":"Association between burnout and empathy in medical residents","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301636","date":1712671200000,"content":"<p>by Mehrnoosh Zakerkish, Abdolhussein Shakurnia, Ali Hafezi, Mahmood Maniati</p>\r\nBackground <p>Burnout is a work-related syndrome that can affect physicians’ performance. Empathy is one of the clinical competencies in whose formation many factors play a role. Empathy and burnout are important topics of research in medical sciences, and both are related to the communication between the patient and the physician. This study investigated the relationship between occupational burnout and empathy among medical residents.</p> Method <p>This cross-sectional study was conducted on 297 medical residents in Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences from January to March 2021. The data collection tools were the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). The reliability of the instruments was measured by calculating Cronbach’s alpha. Data were analyzed by SPSS-18, using the Pearson correlation test and linear regression models.</p> Results <p>The average age of the study population was 33.06 ±4.7 years, with more than half being females (57.6%) and married (51.9%). The residents’ mean scores of empathy and overall burnout were 102.87 out of 140 and 55.90 out of 132, respectively. The burnout scores showed an inverse correlation with the overall empathy scores (r = −0.123, P = 0.035), and the score of standing in the patient’s shoes (r = −0.165, P = 0.004). Linear regression test was used to detect which dimension of empathy was a better predictor for the reduction of burnout scores. Results showed that the best predictor was standing in the patient’s shoes (P = 0.014).</p> Conclusion <p>The findings showed a negative association between empathy and burnout among medical residents, which suggests the need for adjustment of the existing burnout management at the institutional level. Therefore, residents should be supported by managers to reduce burnout and improve their empathic behavior.</p>","author":"Mehrnoosh Zakerkish","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cd05ae790a740367486922439e49b7aa1e6173fd0c9595439d7f9096318fbc0b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
