{"title":"Object-Oriented Modeling of Classic Physical Systems using Linear Implicit Equilibrium Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1139/v1","date":1710843845000,"content":"Pairs of potential and flow variables have long been established for interfacing object-oriented component models of physical systems. Recently, however, the use of triplets has been discovered for the purpose of robust modeling. New and powerful Modelica libraries have been developed such as the DLR ThermoFluid Stream library or the introduction of the Dialectic Mechanics library. Their use of triplets is entangled with a special modeling approach that uses Linear Implicit Equilibrium Dynamics. In this paper, we study the basic motivation of this approach, its benefits and drawbacks before we finally demonstrate how it beneficially impacts the generation of corresponding simulation code.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a99bc0e2370eab7799c8e4e5aebeefe6134d3cd9e829006fa0674ad9b06ec302","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
