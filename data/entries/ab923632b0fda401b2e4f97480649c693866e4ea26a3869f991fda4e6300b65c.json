{"title":"Collective action within an environment of unknown unknowns: Experiences with the port of Mars Game","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308363","date":1722866400000,"content":"<p>by Marco A. Janssen, Raksha Balakrishna, Lance Gharavi, Yi-Chun Hong, Allen Lee, Christine Nguyen, Michael Simeone</p>\r\n\r\nThere is limited research about how groups solve collective action problems in uncertain environments, especially if groups are confronted with unknown unknowns. We aim to develop a more comprehensive view of the characteristics that allow both groups and individuals to navigate such issues more effectively. In this article, we present the results of a new online experiment where individuals make decisions of whether to contribute to the group or pursue self-interest in an environment with high uncertainty, including unknown unknowns. The behavioral game, Port of Mars is framed as a first-generation habitat on Mars where participants have to make decisions on how much to invest in the shared infrastructure to maintain system health and how much to invest in personal goals. Participants can chat during the game, and take surveys before and after the game in order to measure personality attributes and observations from the game. Initial results suggest that a higher average social value orientation and more communication are the key factors that explain why some groups are more successful than others in surviving Port of Mars. Neither other attributes of players nor the groupâ€™s communication content explain the observed differences between groups.","author":"Marco A.
