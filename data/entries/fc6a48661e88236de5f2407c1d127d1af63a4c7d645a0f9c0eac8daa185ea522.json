{"title":"Evaluation of Postoperative Nerve Regeneration in Murine Experimental Models Subjected to Nerve Transection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1809/v1","date":1716865340000,"content":"Objectives: This study aims to explore the use of murine models in peripheral nerve transection research, evaluating and synthesizing key methods for analyzing nerve regeneration to guide future research and clinical interventions.\nMethodology: A systematic review was conducted in February 2024, adhering to Cochrane and PRISMA 2020 guidelines, using Medline, Scielo, and Lilacs databases. The focus was on experimental studies of nerve regeneration in animal models post-transection. Only experimental clinical trials reporting nerve regeneration outcomes were included; studies lacking a comparator group or functional evaluation methods were excluded.\nResults: Out of 273 studies initially identified from MEDLINE, 19 were selected for detailed analysis. The average study included 32.5 subjects, with about 10.16 subjects per intervention subgroup. The predominant model was the sciatic nerve injury with a 10mm gap. The most common intervention involved unprocessed adipose-derived stem cells, utilized in 14 articles.\nConclusions: The review underscores the significant potential of current methodologies in peripheral nerve regeneration, particularly highlighting the use of murine models and thorough evaluation techniques. These studies significantly contribute to our understanding of nerve regeneration processes and inform directions for future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc6a48661e88236de5f2407c1d127d1af63a4c7d645a0f9c0eac8daa185ea522","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
