{"title":"Cross-Cultural Intelligent Language Learning System (CILS): Leveraging AI to Facilitate Language Learning Strategies in Cross-Cultural Communication","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0425/v1","date":1715153734000,"content":"This research presents the Cross-Cultural Intelligent Language Learning System (CILS), a novel approach integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into language education to enhance cross-cultural communication. CILS utilizes advanced AI technologies to provide adaptive, personalized learning experiences that cater to the unique linguistic and cultural backgrounds of each learner. By dynamically adjusting content and methodology, CILS significantly improves linguistic proficiency and cultural understanding, essential for effective global interactions. The implementation of CILS in platforms such as Busuu and HelloTalk has demonstrated marked improvements in engagement and communication skills among learners. Empirical studies validate the system's effectiveness in real-world settings, showing enhanced learner performance and increased intercultural competence. Additionally, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) applied confirms that the usability and perceived usefulness of AI-driven systems strongly influence learner acceptance and sustained use. This study not only underscores the potential of AI in transforming language education but also highlights the critical role of cultural sensitivity in designing educational technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"899993ac529dba3d138f392f0cf2263994d1d555acdbc9ce5fa15284748f7fdd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
