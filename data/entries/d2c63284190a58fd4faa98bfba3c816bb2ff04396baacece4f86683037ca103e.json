Soma</p>\r\n\r\nSteroid hormones are important modulators of many physiological processes, and measurements of steroids in blood, saliva, and urine matrices are widely used to assess endocrine pathologies and stress. However, these matrices cannot be used to retrospectively assess early-life stress and developmental endocrine pathologies, because they do not integrate steroid levels over the long term. A novel biological matrix in which to measure steroids is primary teeth (or “baby teeth”). Primary teeth develop early in life and accumulate various endogenous molecules during their gradual formation. Here, we developed and validated the first assay to measure steroids in human primary teeth using liquid chromatography-tandem spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Our assay is highly sensitive, specific, accurate, and precise. It allows for the simultaneous quantification of 17 steroids in primary teeth (16 of which have not been examined previously in primary teeth). Overall, steroid levels in primary teeth were relatively low, and 8 steroids were quantifiable. Levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, cortisol, and progesterone were the highest of the 17 steroids examined. Next, we used this assay to perform steroid profiling in primary teeth from males and females. The same 8 steroids were quantifiable, and no sex differences were found. Levels of androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) were positively correlated, and levels of glucocorticoids (cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone) were also positively correlated. These data demonstrate that multiple steroids can be quantified by LC-MS/MS in human primary teeth, and this method potentially provides a powerful new way to retrospectively assess early-life stress and developmental endocrine pathologies.","author":"Ruolan S.
