{"title":"Chemical kinetics and thermodynamics of PPO activity, colour changes and microbial degradation during blanching of the sugarcane billets","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13536?af=R","date":1714126479000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Sugarcane juice, which has a short shelf life, is a popular thirst-quenching and rejuvenating beverage worldwide. The limited shelf life is a result of changes in polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, total plate count (TPC) and color attributes (<i>L</i>*, <i>a*</i> and <i>b*</i>-values). We hypothesized that chemical kinetics and thermodynamics of blanched sugarcane cane juice causing alterations in PPO, TPC, and <i>L</i>, <i>a*</i> and <i>b*</i>-values will address the challenges of sugarcane juice preservation.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Sugarcane billets were blanched at variable time–temperature combinations in the range 0–20 min and 70–90 °C. Reaction rates increased with increasing temperature; PPO activity, TPC and colour followed first-order kinetics. PPO activity had an activation energy (<i>Ea</i>) of 81 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>. The half life (<i>t</i>\n<sub>½</sub>) dropped from 16.5 to 3.47 min and decimal reduction time (<i>D</i>-values) dropped from 54.83 to 11.52 min. Thus reactions were temperature-sensitive. Thermodynamic studies indicated an endothermic (positive enthalpy values, Δ<i>H</i> &gt; 0; 78.10 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>) and reversible process (negative entropy values Δ<i>S</i> &lt; 0; −0.044 kJmol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>). Michaeli–Menten constant (<i>K</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>m</i>\n</sub>) and maximum velocity (<i>V</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>max</i>\n</sub>) of PPO activity were determined by adding variable lemon juice concentrations in sugarcane juice. As the <i>Km</i> values increased (from 5.53 to 15.81 m<span>m</span>) and <i>V</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>max</i>\n</sub> values decreased (from 666.67 to 384.61 UmL<sup>−1</sup>), a Lineweaver–Burk plot suggested decreased PPO affinity of sugarcane juice.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The results of the present study indicate that studies on chemical kinetics and thermodynamics (PPO, TPC and <i>L</i>, <i>a*</i> and <i>b*</i>-values) of blanched sugarcane cane juice shall mitigate challenges of sugarcane juice preservation. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Priyanka Singh, \n Anam, \nPushpa Singh, \nSaachi Chaurasia, \nDilip Kumar","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"c84e307a79cc600d2f3720eefa6ec8cc4a8786b288a1cd74231d0e2f1017c591","category":"Environment"}
