{"title":"Chemical kinetics and thermodynamics of PPO activity, colour changes and microbial degradation during blanching of the sugarcane billets","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13536?af=R","date":1713352222000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Sugarcane juice, which has a short shelf life, is a popular thirst-quenching and rejuvenating beverage worldwide. The limited shelf life is due to changes in polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, total plate count (TPC) and color attributes <i>(L</i>*, <i>a*</i> and <i>b*</i> values). We hypothesized that chemical kinetics and thermodynamics of blanched sugarcane cane juice causing alterations in PPO, TPC and <i>L, a*, b*</i> values shall address the challenges of sugarcane juice preservation.</p>\n<h2>Result</h2>\n<p>Sugarcane billets were blanched at variable time–temperature combinations in the range of 0–20 min and 70–90°C. Reaction rates increased with increasing temperature; PPO activity, TPC and colour followed first order kinetics. PPO activity had an activation energy (<i>Ea</i>) of 81 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>. The half time (t ½) values dropped from 16.5 min to 3.47 min and decimal reduction time (<i>D-values)</i> dropped from 54.83 min to 11.52 min. Thus reactions were temperature-sensitive. Thermodynamic studies indicated an endothermic (positive enthalpy values, ΔH &gt; 0; 78.10 kJmole<sup>−1</sup>) and reversible process (negative entropy values ΔS &lt; 0; −0.044 kJmole<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>). Michaelis - Menten constant (<i>K</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>m</i>\n</sub>) and maximum velocity (<i>V</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>max</i>\n</sub>) of PPO activity were determined by adding variable lemon juice concentrations in sugarcane juice. As <i>Km</i> values increased (from 5.53 mM to 15.81 mM) and <i>V</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>max</i>\n</sub> values decreased (from 666.67 to 384.61 UmL<sup>−1</sup>), Lineweaver Burk Plot suggested decreased PPO affinity of sugarcane juice.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The results indicated that studies on chemical kinetics and thermodynamics (PPO, TPC and <i>L, a*, b*</i> values) of blanched sugarcane cane juice shall mitigate challenges of sugarcane juice preservation.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
