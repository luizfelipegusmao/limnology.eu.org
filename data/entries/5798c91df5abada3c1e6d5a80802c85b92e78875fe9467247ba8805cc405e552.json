{"title":"Multi‐response kinetic study of Maillard reaction hazards in the glucose‐lysine model system","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13911?af=R","date":1726800206000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p><i>N</i>ε-carboxymethyllysine (CML), <i>N</i>ε-carboxyethyllysine (CEL) and <i>α</i>-aminoadipic acid (AAA) are important foodborne hazards and their intake can cause a variety of diseases in humans. It is extremely important to investigate the formation mechanism of CML, CEL and AAA, as well as their association with each other when aiming to control their production.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A multi-response kinetic model was developed within the glucose-lysine Maillard reaction model system. The concentrations of glucose, lysine, glyoxal (GO), methylglyoxal (MGO), CML, CEL and AAA were quantified at different temperature (100–160 °C) and at different intervals (0–60 min). The experimental data were fitted to the proposed model to calculate kinetic parameters for the corresponding steps. The results indicated that the production of CML was primarily relied on the direct oxidative cleavage of the Amadori product, rather than the reaction between GO and Lys, whereas CEL and AAA were generated through the reaction of MGO with Lys. Significantly, the reaction between <i>α</i>-dicarbonyl compounds and Lys preferentially generated CML and CEL, resulting in the lower concentrations of AAA compared to CML and CEL.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The multi-response kinetic model developed in the present study can be applied well to the Maillard reaction. The relationship between the formation mechanisms of CML, CEL and AAA is also explained. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Kaihua Liu, \nZhijie Liu, \nJunjian Miao, \nYiqun Huang, \nKeqiang Lai","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"5798c91df5abada3c1e6d5a80802c85b92e78875fe9467247ba8805cc405e552","category":"Environment"}
