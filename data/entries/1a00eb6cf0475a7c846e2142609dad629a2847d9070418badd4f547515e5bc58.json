However, the influence of often-overlooked perturbations on swimming fish remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the propulsion generated by oscillating tailbeats with superimposed rhythmic perturbations of high frequency and low amplitude. We reveal, using a combination of experiments in a biomimetic fish-like robotic platform, computational fluid dynamics simulations, and theoretical analysis, that rhythmic perturbations can significantly increase both swimming efficiency and thrust production. The introduction of perturbations increases pressure-induced thrust, while reduced phase lag between body motion and the subsequent fluid dynamics response improves swimming efficiency. Moreover, our findings suggest that beneficial perturbations are sensitive to kinematic parameters, resolving previous conflicts regarding the effects of such perturbations. Our results highlight the potential benefits of introducing perturbations in propulsion generators, providing potential hypotheses for living systems and inspiring the design of artificial flapping-based propulsion systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"1a00eb6cf0475a7c846e2142609dad629a2847d9070418badd4f547515e5bc58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
