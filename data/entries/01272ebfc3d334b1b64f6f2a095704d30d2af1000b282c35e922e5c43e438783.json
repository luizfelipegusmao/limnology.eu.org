{"title":"Research Progress into the Regulatory Mechanism of Silent Information Regulator 1 in Sepsis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0155/v1","date":1722592545000,"content":"Sepsis, characterized by a dysregulated systemic inflammatory response to infection, remains a significant global health burden, despite substantial advancements in its treatment. An understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving sepsis is crucial for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a member of the class III histone deacetylases, plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression by catalyzing the deacetylation of lysine residues on non-histone and histone proteins. With the advancement of sepsis research, SIRT1 has been shown to exert significant anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and metabolic regulatory effects, positioning it as a potential therapeutic target for sepsis. This article reviews the latest progress on research into the signaling pathways modulated by SIRT1 in sepsis and its associated regulatory mechanisms to further elucidate the pathogenesis of sepsis and assist in guiding clinical treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"01272ebfc3d334b1b64f6f2a095704d30d2af1000b282c35e922e5c43e438783","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
