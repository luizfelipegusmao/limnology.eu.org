{"title":"Enhanced Ocular Drug Delivery of Dexamethasone Using Chitosan-Coated Soluplus® Based Mixed Micellar System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1939/v1","date":1727252700000,"content":"Background: This study introduces a novel dexamethasone (DEX) mixed micellar system (DEX-MM) using Soluplus® and Pluronic F-127 (PF127) to enhance ocular drug delivery. The enhancement of ocular application properties was achieved by creating a chitosan-coated DEX-MM (DEX-CMM), which promotes better adherence to the ocular surface, thereby improving drug absorption; Methods: Using the solvent evaporation method, a formulation was developed with a Soluplus® to drug ratio of 1:10, enhanced with 0.25% PF127. After dispersing in water, 1% chitosan (CS) was added. The stability and integrity of DEX within the micelles were verified using attenuated total reflection-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Additionally, in vitro and ex vivo drug release studies were con-ducted; Results: DEX-CMM (F6) demonstrated a particle size of 151.9±1 nm and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.168±0.003, suggesting uniformity and high electrostatic stability with a zeta po-tential of +35.96±2.13 mV. The non-Fickian drug release mechanism indicated prolonged drug retention. Comparative analyses showed DEX-CMM outperforming a standard DEX suspension in drug release and ocular tissue permeation, with flux measurements significantly higher than the DEX suspension; Conclusion: The study confirmed the efficacy of DEX-CMM in enhancing drug delivery to ocular tissues, evidenced by improved permeability. Safety evaluations using the HET-CAM test demonstrated that DEX-CMM was non-irritant, supporting its potential for effective ocular drug delivery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b46dad671a98b2d141eee86191adea08b2b013a1999a27cdfdc51a1aeb52e5c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
