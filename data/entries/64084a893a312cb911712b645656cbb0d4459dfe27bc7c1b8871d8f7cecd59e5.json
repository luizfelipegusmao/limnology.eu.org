{"title":"Pattern formation and travelling waves in a multiphase moving boundary model of tumour growth","link":"https://academic.oup.com/imammb/article/40/4/327/7444987?rss=1","date":1700697600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We employ the multiphase, moving boundary model of Byrne <span>et al.</span> (2003, <span>Appl. Math. Lett.</span>, 16, 567â€“573) that describes the evolution of a motile, viscous tumour cell phase and an inviscid extracellular liquid phase. This model comprises two partial differential equations that govern the cell volume fraction and the cell velocity, together with a moving boundary condition for the tumour edge, and here we characterize and analyse its travelling-wave and pattern-forming behaviour. Numerical simulations of the model indicate that patterned solutions can be obtained, which correspond to multiple regions of high cell density separated by regions of low cell density. In other parameter regimes, solutions of the model can develop into a forward- or backward-moving travelling wave, corresponding to tumour growth or extinction, respectively. A travelling-wave analysis allows us to find the corresponding wave speed, as well as criteria for the growth or extinction of the tumour. Furthermore, a stability analysis of these travelling-wave solutions provides us with criteria for the occurrence of patterned solutions. Finally, we discuss how the initial cell distribution, as well as parameters related to cellular motion and cell-liquid drag, control the qualitative features of patterned solutions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Mathematical Medicine and Biology: A Journal of the IMA Current Issue","siteHash":"8e41cf2ed671fc83106bccd712981630d68940d521d41091ba0f730fc4a24554","entryHash":"64084a893a312cb911712b645656cbb0d4459dfe27bc7c1b8871d8f7cecd59e5","category":"Environment"}
