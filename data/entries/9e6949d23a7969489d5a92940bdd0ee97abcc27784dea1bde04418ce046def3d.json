However, the spatio–temporal evolution and drivers of WUE remain unclear. This study utilized global annual scale global land surface satellite gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration data from 1982 to 2018 to estimate WUE and analyze its spatio–temporal characteristics. Additionally, the study investigated the response of WUE changes to five environmental factors (precipitation [PRE], soil moisture, temperature [TEM], palmer drought severity index, and vapor pressure deficit [VPD]) on WUE changes using partial correlation and structural equation modeling. The results suggested that the global annual WUE increased markedly over the study period, at an average rate of 0.0016 gC m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup> H<sub>2</sub>O year<sup>−1</sup>. In contrast to the existing knowledge on the drivers of WUE change, climate change was found to have a larger contribution to WUE changes at the global and regional scales, especially in terms of TEM and VPD. A positive correlation between TEM and WUE was observed, but extreme TEM could lead to a decrease in WUE. VPD had the most significant direct effect on WUE, and its negative effect offset the positive influence of TEM especially in hyper-arid, semi-arid, and arid regions. These findings offer new insights into the impact of VPD and global warming on WUE.</p>","author":"Z. Y. Hu, \nQ. H. Dai, \nY. J. Yan, \nY. Zhang, \nH. Y. Li, \nH. Zhou, \nY. W.
