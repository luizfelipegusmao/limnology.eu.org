{"title":"SVALKA-POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX2 module controls C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR3 induction during cold acclimation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1152/7485695?rss=1","date":1703030400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>C-REPEAT BINDING FACTORS (CBFs) are highly conserved plant transcription factors that promote cold tolerance. In Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), three CBFs (CBF1 to CBF3) play a critical role in cold acclimation, and the expression of their corresponding genes is rapidly and transiently induced during this adaptive response. Cold induction of <span>CBFs</span> has been extensively studied and shown to be tightly controlled, yet the molecular mechanisms that restrict the expression of each <span>CBF</span> after their induction during cold acclimation are poorly understood. Here, we present genetic and molecular evidence that the decline in the induction of <span>CBF3</span> during cold acclimation is epigenetically regulated through the Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) 2. We show that this complex promotes the deposition of the repressive mark H3K27me3 at the coding region of <span>CBF3</span>, silencing its expression. Our results indicate that the cold-inducible long noncoding RNA <span>SVALKA</span> is essential for this regulation by recruiting PRC2 to <span>CBF3</span>. These findings unveil a <span>SVALKA</span>-PRC2 regulatory module that ensures the precise timing of <span>CBF3</span> induction during cold acclimation and the correct development of this adaptive response.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"74827423c228245aa585d5fdf962b5ff72e30f5d62a84bc6fce8573152eb8b04","category":"Environment"}
