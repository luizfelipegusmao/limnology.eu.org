{"title":"Blockade of phosphodiesterase 5 by sildenafil reduces tumor growth and potentiates tumor‐killing ability of cisplatin in vivo against T cell lymphoma: Implication of modulated apoptosis, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, glucose metabolism, and pH regulation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24074?af=R","date":1709898124000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In the past years, PDE5 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for many cancers due to its highly upregulated expression. Interestingly, a recent in vitro study by our group has shown the antitumor and chemopotentiating action of sildenafil against T cell lymphoma. Our study showed that lower doses of sildenafil (50 μM) and cisplatin (0.5 μg/mL) exhibited 4% and 23% cytotoxicity against HuT78 cells, respectively, which was dramatically increased up to 50% when treated with both. Hence, the present study was designed to evaluate the antitumor and chemo-potentiating action of sildenafil in a murine model of T cell lymphoma (popularly called as Dalton's lymphoma [DL]). In the present study, DL-bearing mice were administered with vehicle (PBS), sildenafil (5 mg/kg bw), cisplatin (5 mg/kg bw), and sildenafil and cisplatin followed by evaluation of their impact on tumor growth by analyzing various parameters. The apoptosis was assessed by Wright–Giemsa, annexin-V, and DAPI staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was examined through DCFDA staining. The expression of genes and proteins were estimated by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The experimental findings of the study demonstrate for the first time that sildenafil inhibits tumor growth and potentiates tumor inhibitory ability of cisplatin by altering apoptosis, glycolysis, ROS homeostasis, and pH regulation in T cell lymphoma-carrying host. In addition, our investigation also showed amelioration of tumor-induced liver and kidney damage by sildenafil. Overall, the experimental data of our study strongly advocate the use and repurposing of SDF in designing promising chemotherapeutic regimens against malignancies of T cells.</p>","author":"Shiv Govind Rawat, \nRajan Kumar Tiwari, \nAjay Kumar","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"5014669beafa941aa5cca99009b5a4bdc8bdbd70aea7b25d5e182452f9cb0962","category":"Environment"}
