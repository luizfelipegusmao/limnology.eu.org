{"title":"Normalization of Fetal Cerebral and Hepatic Iron by Parental Iron Therapy to Pregnant Rats with Systemic Iron Deficiency without Anemia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0694/v1","date":1723191906000,"content":"Iron (Fe) is co-factor for enzymes of the developing brain necessitating sufficient supply. We investigated the effects of administering ferric derisomaltose/Fe isomaltoside (FDI) subcutaneously to Fe deficient (ID) pregnant rats on cerebral and hepatic concentrations of essential metals and gene expression of ferroportin and hepcidin. Pregnant rats subjected to ID were injected with FDI on the day of mating (E0), 14 days into pregnancy (E14), or the day of birth (Postnatal (P0)). The efficacy was evaluated by determination of cerebral and hepatic Fe in pups on P0 and as adults on P70, and the concentration of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn). Females fed an ID diet (5.2 mg/kg Fe) had offspring with significantly lower cerebral and hepatic Fe compared to female controls fed a standard diet (158 mg/kg Fe). Cerebral Cu increased irrespective of supplying a standard diet or administering FDI combined with the standard diet. Hepatic hepcidin was significantly lower following ID, whereas cerebral hepcidin was virtually undetectable in all experimental groups. In conclusion, administering FDI subcutaneously to ID pregnant rats on EO normalizes cerebral Fe in the fetus, but when applied at later gestational ages, additional Fe to the offspring is needed to normalize cerebral and hepatic Fe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2aad16ec3947ec349bf6ea3f2655a30cd22c04f1a999b023d734cdbf6550eb6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
