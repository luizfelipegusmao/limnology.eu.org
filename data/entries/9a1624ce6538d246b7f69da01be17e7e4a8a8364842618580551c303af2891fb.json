{"title":"QSAR Regression Models for Predicting HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibition Based on MACCS Molecular Fingerprints and Virtual Screening of Natural Products","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0529/v1","date":1728379016000,"content":"HMG-CoA reductase is an enzyme that regulates the initial stage of cholesterol synthesis and its inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Methods: We have created a set of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for human HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors using nested cross-validation as the primary validation method. To develop the QSAR models, we employed various machine learning regression algorithms, feature selection methods, and fingerprints or descriptor datasets. Results: We built and evaluated a total of 300 models, selecting 21 that demonstrated good performance (coefficient of determination, R2 ≥ 0.70 or concordance correlation coefficient, CCC ≥ 0.85). Six of these top-performing models met both performance criteria and were used to construct five ensemble models. We identified the descriptors most important in explaining HMG-CoA inhibition for each of the six best-performing models. We used the top models to search through over 220,000 chemical compounds from a large database (ZINC 15) for potential new inhibitors. Only a small fraction (237 out of approximately 220,000 compounds) had reliable predictions with mean pIC50 values ≥8 (IC50 values ≤10 nM). Our svm-based ensemble model predicted IC50 values &lt;10 nM for roughly 0.08% of the screened compounds. We have also illustrated the potential applications of these QSAR models in understanding the cholesterol-lowering activities of herbal extracts, such as those reported for an extract prepared from the Iris × germanica rhizome. Conclusions: Our QSAR models can accurately predict human HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, having the potential to accelerate the discovery of novel cholesterol-lowering agents and may also be applied to understand the mechanisms underlying the reported cholesterol-lowering activities of herbal extracts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a1624ce6538d246b7f69da01be17e7e4a8a8364842618580551c303af2891fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
