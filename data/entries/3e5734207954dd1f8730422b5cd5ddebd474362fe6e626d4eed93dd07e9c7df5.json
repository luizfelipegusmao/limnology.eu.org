{"title":"Modelling of Applying Road Pricing at Airport Highway via VISUM Micro-simulation Software in Amman City, Jordan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2356/v1","date":1722317038000,"content":"Road congestion in Amman city increased yearly, due to the increase in private car ownership and traffic volumes. This study aims to (a) assess the social and economic impacts of the toll road in Amman, Jordan through a survey questionnaire using statistical software (SPSS), (b) identify the optimal price at selected road using micro-simulation (VISUM). Traffic, geometric and cost data of toll technique of two sections on the Airport Highway (From Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Madaba Interchange.; and From Madaba Interchange to Queen Alia International Airport (QAIA) interchange) were used for simulation purpose. The toll road (across 7 distinct scenarios at various price) were assessed for an optimal revenue. The survey questionnaire was made based on all scenarios including AM peak hour. The operation cost for toll road was determined based on greater Amman Municipality (GAM). The optimal scenario was measured based on the value ¬¬of revenue (JD), and type of payment. The results indicate that users found the most charging method to be based on traveled distance (54.02%) and the optimal value of the toll to be equal 0.25 JD (34.08%). In Addition, the total cost of Manual Toll Collection method (MTC) in 2025 is 126,935JD and the revenue is 1122.6 JD so this indicates to positive result. Eventually, the result of applying road pricing on the airport road in 2025 indicate to be effective and economically feasible only by using Manual Method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e5734207954dd1f8730422b5cd5ddebd474362fe6e626d4eed93dd07e9c7df5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
