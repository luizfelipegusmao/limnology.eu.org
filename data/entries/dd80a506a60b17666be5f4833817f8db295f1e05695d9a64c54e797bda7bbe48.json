{"title":"Network analysis of spread of SARS-CoV-2 within dialysis clinics: A multi-center network analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299855","date":1709906400000,"content":"<p>by Sunpeng Duan, Yuedong Wang, Peter Kotanko, Hanjie Zhang</p>\r\nBackground <p>In-center hemodialysis entails repeated interactions between patients and clinic staff, potentially facilitating the spread of COVID-19. We examined if in-center hemodialysis is associated with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 between patients.</p> Methods <p>Our retrospective analysis comprised all patients receiving hemodialysis in four New York City clinics between March 12<sup>th</sup>, 2020, and August 31<sup>st</sup>, 2022. Treatment-level clinic ID, dialysis shift, dialysis machine station, and date of COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR were documented. To estimate the donor-to-potential recipient exposure (“donor” being the COVID-19 positive patient denoted as “COV-Pos”; “potential recipient” being other susceptible patients in the same shift), we obtained the spatial coordinates of each dialysis station, calculated the Euclidean distances between stations and weighted the exposure by proximity between them. For each donor, we estimated the donor-to-potential recipient exposure of all potential recipients dialyzed in the same shift and accumulated the exposure over time within the ‘COV-Pos infectious period’ as cumulative exposures. The ‘COV-Pos infectious period’ started 5 days before COVID-19 diagnosis date. We deployed network analysis to assess these interactions and summarized the donor-to-potential recipient exposure in 193 network diagrams. We fitted mixed effects logistic regression models to test whether more donor-to-potential recipient exposure conferred a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p> Results <p>Out of 978 patients, 193 (19.7%) tested positive for COVID-19 and had contact with other patients during the COV-Pos infectious period. Network diagrams showed no evidence that more exposed patients would have had a higher chance of infection. This finding was corroborated by logistic mixed effect regression (donor-to-potential recipient exposure OR: 0.63; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.17, p = 0.163). Separate analyses according to vaccination led to materially identical results.</p> Conclusions <p>Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between in-center hemodialysis patients is unlikely. This finding supports the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as universal masking and other procedures to control spread of COVID-19.</p>","author":"Sunpeng Duan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dd80a506a60b17666be5f4833817f8db295f1e05695d9a64c54e797bda7bbe48","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
