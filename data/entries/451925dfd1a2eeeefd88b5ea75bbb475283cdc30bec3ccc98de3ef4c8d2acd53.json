{"title":"Structure and Constraints for a Knowledge Architecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1719/v1","date":1711614566000,"content":"Knowledge is not merely the characteristic of certain pieces of information being deemed true and justifiable, but rather a process. Within an axiomatic system, the set of information that reaches the status of knowledge forms a universe that provides an interpretation of the reality one aims to describe. Language exchanges information through communication and the process of justification (exchange of information), if it consistently justifies a particular piece of information, it elevates it to knowledge.  In this paper, we provide a framework for knowledge within an axiomatic model where we define the fundamental elements of communication and grammar. As a result, the structure dictates that knowledge, to be considered as such, must be investigateable by anyone who utilizes it in its entirety, both in form and content. Ultimately, the development of knowledge processing, referred to as \\emph{knowmatics}, represents a clear evolution of the computer science that processes information (subset of knowledge).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"451925dfd1a2eeeefd88b5ea75bbb475283cdc30bec3ccc98de3ef4c8d2acd53","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
