{"title":"Gintonin-Enriched Panax ginseng Extract Fraction Sensitizes Renal Carcinoma Cells to TRAIL-induced Apoptosis through DR4/5 Upregulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1338/v1","date":1716260032000,"content":"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising chemotherapeutic agent because of its selective apoptotic action on cancer cells. However, resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis remains a challenge in many cancers. The gintonin-enriched Panax ginseng extract fraction (GEF) has diverse pharmacological benefits. We explored the combined efficacy of GEF and TRAIL in inducing apoptosis in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. The effect of GEF treatment on viability, clonogenic potential, wound healing, and TRAIL-induced apoptotic signaling of RCC cells was studied in vitro. Our investigation revealed that GEF pre-treatment sensitized RCC cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation and cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration inhibition. This sensitization was linked to the upregulation of death receptors 4 and 5 and alterations in apoptotic protein expression; notably, decreased expression of Mu-2-related death-inducing gene, a novel anti-apoptotic protein. Our findings underscore the necessity of caspase activation for GEF/TRAIL-induced apoptosis using the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. It demonstrates that GEF sensitizes human RCC cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by upregulating DR4/5 and modulating apoptotic protein expression. These findings suggest a promising strategy for overcoming TRAIL resistance in cancer therapy and highlight the potential of GEF as a valuable adjunct to TRAIL-based treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"894e619ab7362fd66cf70e00a3013d83593bf0d0984b76c9cae09494dfc7fd43","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
