{"title":"The quest to find TLC: Tendril-less cucumbers, that is","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/8/2751/7661016?rss=1","date":1714608000000,"content":"<span>If you have ever grown cucumbers (<span>Cucumis sativus</span>) at home, you will know just how unruly these plants can be. As the primary stem grows and produces leaves from each side of the shoot apical meristem, branches and tendrils emerge from axillary meristems located at the leaf axils, forming a sprawling vine that will take over your garden if left untamed. In a commercial context, these disorderly tendrils and branches block airflow and light and divert resources away from fruit production. They must therefore be painstakingly removed, increasing both labor costs and the risk of infection through the resulting wounds. An ideal solution would be to have cucumber plants that develop fruit at the leaf axils without producing branches or tendrils. However, breeding such plants via targeted approaches requires an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing both tendril and branch formation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"469e0ecb3a6e7bba0006d700fa4c5b4de092557d501f250b669739cb97a6451c","category":"Environment"}
