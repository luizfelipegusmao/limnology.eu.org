{"title":"Exploring Prescription Practices: Insights from an Antimicrobial Stewardship Program at a Tertiary Healthcare Facility, Rwanda","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0531/v1","date":1715257646000,"content":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health threat linked to increased morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to return us to the pre-antibiotic era. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs are recognized as a key intervention to improve antimicrobial use and combat AMR. However, implementation of AMS programs remains limited in Africa, particularly in Rwanda. This qualitative study, conducted at King Faisal Hospital (KFH) in Rwanda, aimed at assessing current prescription practices to identify areas for improvement and promote adherence to AMS principles. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed, revealing four emerging themes. First, emerged on AMS activities that were working well which includes availability of microbiology laboratory results, and prescription guidelines as factors influencing antibiotic prescription adjustments. Second, Implementations challenges to AMS which identified the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics, limited local data on AMR patterns, stock-outs of essential antibiotics, Thirdly, the importance of adhering to AMR management guidelines at KFH was underscored. Lastly, participant recommendations centered on regular training for healthcare workers, widespread dissemination of AMR findings across departments, and the enforcement of antibiotic restriction policies. These actions can improve prescription behaviors, upholding the highest standards of patient care, and strengthening the nascent AMS program.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b289aa9ac66637eccc82452c1c8ebfa3c4574c9e71103cc6bf8139275d42aeb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
