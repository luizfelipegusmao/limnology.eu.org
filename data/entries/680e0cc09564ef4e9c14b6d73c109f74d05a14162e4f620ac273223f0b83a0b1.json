{"title":"Geothermal Resilience to Energy Production Issues","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1242/v1","date":1723802481000,"content":"The modern era has numerous issues associated with power generation, especially with old fashioned combustion power plants. Since fossil fuels are primarily responsible for the emission of greenhouse gasses, there is a desperate need for adaptation and sustainability. Looking at those challenges, geothermal energy which civilization had a long time ago becomes the desirable solution. This paper aims at establishing the feasibility of geothermal power plants in meeting the challenges of energy intensity and environmental conservation. This study also illustrates that the categories of geothermal energy systems which include the dry steam, flash steam and the binary cycle power plants are capable of achieving high capacity factors, initiating feasibility studies, and have relatively low impacts on the environment. While it is likely to cost more in the initial stages of construction, geothermal power plants provide more long-term cost benefits and significantly fewer toxic emissions relative to the fossil fuel plants. Switching to geothermal energy not only means that the world will have new sources of energy in the near future but also that it will be clean and environmentally friendly. Through incremental steps, geothermal power plants may well open the door to a full energy source infrastructure for subsequent generations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"680e0cc09564ef4e9c14b6d73c109f74d05a14162e4f620ac273223f0b83a0b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
