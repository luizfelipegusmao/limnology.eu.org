Ensuring wind comfort and pedestrian safety are critical requirements in urban environments. This paper reports on the wind flow field at the main campus of the Dhaka University of Engineering &amp; Technology (DUET), Gazipur, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate pedestrian wind comfort and safety. The simulations were conducted in ANSYS Fluent employing the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation. The vertical profile of the streamwise wind speed was validated using the existing observations. The results revealed that the wind speed at the building corners was higher than the air inlet velocity, whereas the wind speeds in the walkways among the buildings were found to vary. The velocity vectors surrounding the building were densely packed, with a recirculation vortex formed in the upstream flow. Furthermore, walkways can display a lower mean wind velocity coupled with high turbulence kinetic energy (TKE). The turbulent kinetic energy is seen to be as high as 1.52 m2 s-2 which exceeds the threshold limit, while wind velocity is 1.81 m/s at the same point. These findings highlight potential pedestrian safety risks and underscore the need for urban design enhancements.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2bcb1050ff069d61640f0953a216f7373ac3df1e1f3fec57332bace2a5dcfc9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
