In this study, we studied the immunological response of murine erythroid cells to acute blood loss using flow cytometry, NanoString immune transcriptome profiling, and BioPlex cytokine secretome profiling. We observed that acute blood loss forces the differentiation of murine erythroid cells in both bone marrow and spleen and that there was an up-regulation of several immune response genes, in particular pathogen-associated molecular pattern sensing gene <i>Clec5a</i> in post-acute blood loss murine bone marrow erythroid cells. We believe that the up-regulation of the <i>Clec5a</i> gene in bone marrow erythroid cells could help bone marrow erythroid cells detect and eliminate pathogens with the help of reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial proteins calprotectin and cathelicidin, the genes of which (<i>S100a8</i>, <i>S100a9</i>, and <i>Camp</i>) dominate the expression in bone marrow erythroid cells of mice.","author":"Kirill Nazarov","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"12a69d98a6deab0feaa4885ccb4267862829c68d84fa50be2afdd1236d22dfa4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
