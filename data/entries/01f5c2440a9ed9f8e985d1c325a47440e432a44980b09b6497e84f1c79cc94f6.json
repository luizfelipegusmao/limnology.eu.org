{"title":"Impact of Apolipoprotein A on Cardiac and Neural Abnormalities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0016/v1","date":1722503056000,"content":"Apolipoprotein A (ApoA), an integral component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, plays a vital role in the transport and metabolism of lipids. It is implicated in both cardiovascular (CVD) and neurological diseases. In the context of CVD, ApoAs are pivotal in facilitating the reverse transport of cholesterol, mitigating inflammation, and preserving endothelial function. These char- acteristics highlight the crucial role of ApoA in averting the onset of CVDs. Moreover, ApoA has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkin- son's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Apart from its role in lipid metabolism, recent stud- ies have indicated the involvement of ApoA in neuroprotection, amyloid-beta clearance, and regu- lation of neuroinflammation. This paper addresses the research question: \"How do different isoforms of Apolipoprotein A influence the development and progression of cardiovascular and neurological diseases, and what are the potential therapeutic implications of targeting ApoA in these conditions?\" By providing a comprehensive review of current knowledge, this paper empha- sizes the importance of ApoA in understanding the intricate connections between cardiovascular and neurological health, suggesting that ApoA-targeted interventions may help treat diseases in both domains.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"01f5c2440a9ed9f8e985d1c325a47440e432a44980b09b6497e84f1c79cc94f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
