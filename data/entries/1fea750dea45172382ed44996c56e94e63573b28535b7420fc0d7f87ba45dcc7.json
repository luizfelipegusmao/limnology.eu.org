{"title":"A Computational Model of Dendritic Growth Dynamics: Exploring Exponential and Logarithmic Scales in Neural Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0143/v1","date":1714712588000,"content":"The intricate architecture of dendritic arborization is fundamental to the formation and functionality of neural networks, serving as the primary site for synaptic integration and signal propagation. This study presents a pioneering computational model that simulates dendritic growth dynamics, employing exponential and logarithmic scaling over an extended developmental period of 720 days. This model offers a valuable tool for investigating the implications of diverse dendritic growth patterns on neural development, synaptic connectivity, and ultimately, cognitive functions. The computational framework incorporates biologically plausible parameters, allowing for the systematic exploration of dendritic branching patterns and their potential impact on neuronal information processing. By simulating exponential and logarithmic growth scales, the model captures the inherent complexity and diversity of dendritic morphologies observed in various neuronal populations across different brain regions. The findings from this study hold significant implications for our understanding of neural circuit assembly, synaptic integration, and the potential functional consequences of aberrant dendritic growth patterns observed in neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, the model's ability to simulate extended developmental trajectories over a prolonged period of 720 days offers insights into the dynamic interplay between dendritic growth and synaptic pruning, which is crucial for the refinement and optimization of neural networks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1fea750dea45172382ed44996c56e94e63573b28535b7420fc0d7f87ba45dcc7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
