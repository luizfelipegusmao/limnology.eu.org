The study aimed to determine the association between physical activity as well as obesity and the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases among patients with hypertension and diabetes attending Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH), Irrua, Nigeria.</p> Methodology <p>The research was a descriptive, cross-sectional study of 394 systematically selected consenting patients with hypertension and diabetes presenting to a teaching hospital in Irrua, Edo State, Nigeria. The Cardiovascular risk assessment was determined using the Framingham 10year Risk of General Cardiovascular Disease. Anthropometric assessment, blood pressure and blood glucose were determined. Data was collected with a semi-structured questionnaire and analysed with Stata version 16. Chi square and logistic regression was used to test for association and significance level was set at p = 0.05.</p> Results <p>The study included 394 participants with a mean age of 54±15.47years. Respondents were mostly females (55.3%), physically inactive (70.3%), overweight (42.4%) and had a high risk (41.8%) of developing CVD in 10 years using Framingham categorisation. There was a significant association between physical activity (P&lt;0.01; OR 2.45; CI: 1.53–3.92), obesity (P&lt;0.01; OR 2.52; CI: 1.64–3.86) and risk of developing CVD.</p> Conclusion <p>The study found a statistically significant relationship between physical inactivity, obesity, and the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Increasing physical activity levels need to be a top priority at all levels of healthcare as well as the general population.</p>","author":"Tijani Idris Ahmad Oseni","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"41838f71472c775c03bca643042e876e1fff2f5434c49af7158dc75fc070bc82","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
