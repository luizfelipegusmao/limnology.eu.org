{"title":"Review of Classification of PCMs, With a Focus on the Search for New, Suitable PCM Candidates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1187/v1","date":1721066126000,"content":"With a growing number of PCMs and new, suitable PCM candidates, an overview is not only important, but also increasingly complex. Classification of PCM was thus changed significantly in the past decades. A review of classification of PCMs from recent years shows that not only different classification criteria are used, but more important that they are often mixed, used inconsistently, even without a clear goal. Focusing on the main goal of current classification schemes, to give an overview of the material options for the search for new, suitable PCM candidates, including already established PCMs, a consistent classification is developed in a desktop study. For this, first, the general options for classification criteria are reviewed, and then the appropriate ones selected. Then, based on them a new, revised PCM classification is suggested. It is specifically detailed with regard to mixtures; for binary mixtures it is based on a literature review performed within the study. The result also stresses the importance of specific R&amp;D: for pure substances the sources and the chemical modification, and for mixtures their optimization by new compositions, additives, etc.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8598476ff6294b7bcc2405ce480c39b7677faa2657e7800b8360458b8c418b5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
