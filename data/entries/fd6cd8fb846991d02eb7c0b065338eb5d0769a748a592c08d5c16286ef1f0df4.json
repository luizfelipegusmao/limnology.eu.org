{"title":"Novel ATP2A2 Gene Mutation c.118G&gt;A Causing Keratinocyte and Cardiomyocyte Disconnection in Darier Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0577/v1","date":1710146461000,"content":"Darier disease (DD) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to mutation of ATP2A2 gene causing an isolated skin manifestation based on keratinocyte disconnection and apoptosis. Systemic manifestations of DD have not been demonstrated so far although a high incidence of neuropsychiatric syndromes suggest an involvement of central nervous system. A Novel ATP2A2 Gene Mutation c.118G&gt;A, causing keratinocyte and cardiomyocyte disconnection in Darier disease, is reported. Their common pathologic pathway, still unreported, was documented by both skin and left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy because of cardiac dilatation and dysfunction appeared several decades after skin manifestations.Keratinocyte disconnection was paralleled by cardiomyocyte separation at lateral junction. Cardiomyocyte separation was associated to cell disarray, sarcoplasmic reticulum dilatation and increased myocyte apoptosis. Clinically, hyperkeratotic skin papules were associated to chest pain, severe muscle exhaustion and ventricular arrhythmias that improved following administration of aminophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor enhancing SERCA2 protein phosphorylation.Specific mutations of ATP2A2 gene may cause cardiac involvement in patients with DD. Cardiac pathologic changes are similar to those documented in the skin including cardiomyocyte disconnection that promotes precordial pain and cardiac arrhythmias. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, enhancing SERCA2 protein phosphorylation may substantially attenuate the symptoms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd6cd8fb846991d02eb7c0b065338eb5d0769a748a592c08d5c16286ef1f0df4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
