{"title":"Current Status of Health Care Bioethics Committees in Chile: Suggestions for Improvement in Public Health Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2083/v1","date":1727346268000,"content":"This study examines the current functioning of Health Care Bioethics Committees (HBCs) in Chile, with the objective of providing recommendations for improving public health care management. Through a comprehensive literature review and a case analysis of the ‘Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile’, the structure, functions and challenges of the CEA are explored. The research reveals the importance of the multidisciplinary composition of the committees, the need for continuing education in bioethics, and the relevance of the consultative role in ethical decision making. The results suggest that the effectiveness of CABs does not necessarily depend on the number of members or the length of their terms of office, but on the quality of their training and experience. It is concluded that for adequate health care management, it is essential to strengthen the role of the CEA in the ethical education of health care personnel and in the development of institutional regulations, as well as to improve their visibility and accessibility within the Chilean health care system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"08e6fdadd5ef8660125a5010802cf9003e3f20e9fc8dab46985e5a6f78d6cf06","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
