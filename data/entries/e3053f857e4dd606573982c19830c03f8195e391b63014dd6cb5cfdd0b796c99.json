{"title":"Altered Arterial Stiffness, Ventricular-Arterial Coupling and Troponin Levels in Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematous","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0540/v1","date":1712579870000,"content":"Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), leading to elevated mortality rates among patients. We aimed to evaluate the levels of cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), global longitudinal strain (GLS), ventricular-arterial coupling (VAC) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hsTn), in SLE patients and to explore their relationship with clinical parameters. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 82 SLE patients without evident cardiac or kidney impairment and 41 age- and sex matched healthy controls. We comparatively evaluated CAVI, GLS, VAC, and hsTn between SLE patients and controls, and we assessed their association among SLE patients with disease activity based on the SELENA-SLEDAI Activity Index. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of CAVI and hsTn within the SLE cohort. Results: In comparison to healthy controls, SLE patients presented with significantly higher CAVI, GLS and hsTn levels, while VAC was significantly reduced (p&amp;lt;0.001). Further, SLE patients with active disease (SELENA-SLEDAIâ‰¥4) exhibited higher levels of CAVI and troponin than those with inactive disease (p&amp;lt;0.001). SLEDAI was an independent predictor of CAVI, while VAC and SLEDAI were independent determinants of hsTn in SLE cohort. Conclusion: SLE patients displayed abnormal levels of CAVI, VAC, GLS, and troponin compared to healthy individuals. Our findings implicate the potential of those CV novel CVD risk factors to refine screening and therapeutic strategies for this specific population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3053f857e4dd606573982c19830c03f8195e391b63014dd6cb5cfdd0b796c99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
