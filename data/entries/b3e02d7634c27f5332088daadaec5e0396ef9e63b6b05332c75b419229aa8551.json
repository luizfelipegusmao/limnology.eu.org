{"title":"The Evolution of Permeability and Sensitivity Analysis of Gas-bearing Coal Under Cyclic Dynamic Loading","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1586/v1","date":1724246434000,"content":"It is imperative to conduct experimental studies on the seepage behavior of gas-bearing coal under cyclic dynamic loading conditions. This paper focuses on the evolution of coal permeability under the combined effects of dynamic loading, static loading, and gas adsorption. The principal conclusions are as follows. (1) As the frequency and amplitude of dynamic loading increase, the development of pore and fissure structures within the coal body becomes increasingly pronounced during dynamic loading cycles, resulting in a gradual rise in permeability. Notably, as the coal approaches its yielding stage, the permeability can increase by up to 47%. (2) The permeability curve is divided into four regions: the compaction reduction zone, the oscillation zone, the gradual recovery zone, and the abrupt increase zone of failure. Ultimately, in the failure phase, the permeability surges dramatically, potentially reaching 4 to 5 times the initial permeability. (3) When the static load stage is constant, the rate of change in permeability of the coal under dynamic loading decreases with increasing adsorption amount. When the adsorption amount is constant, the rate of change in permeability of the coal under dynamic loading increases with the increase in static load stress stage, with the maximum increase reaching 75.2%. It can be concluded from the rate of change in permeability and the dynamic loading sensitivity coefficient that the permeability of the coal is highly sensitive to cyclic dynamic loading, with increased sensitivity associated with larger static load stages and decreased sensitivity with greater adsorption amounts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3e02d7634c27f5332088daadaec5e0396ef9e63b6b05332c75b419229aa8551","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
