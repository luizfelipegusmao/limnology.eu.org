{"title":"Different behavioral profiles between invasive and native nudibranchs: means for invasion success?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/cz/article/70/3/406/7691175?rss=1","date":1718064000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Behavior is predicted to be a primary determinant of the success of the invasion process during the early phases of colonization. Comparing invaders with sympatric native species may provide a good approach to unravel behavioral traits involved in an invasion process. In this study, we carried out an experimental simulation of the introduction and the acclimatization phase into a new environment and assessed the expression of activity, alertness, and habituation in an invasive Mediterranean population of the South African nudibranch <span>Godiva quadricolor</span> comparing its profiles with those of the sympatric Mediterranean native nudibranchs <span>Cratena peregrina</span> and <span>Caloria quatrefagesi</span>. Individuals of these 3 species were subjected to 3 behavioral tests: spontaneous activity, carried out in the introduction phase (immediately after sampling) and after a week of acclimatization; alert test, in which a potential threat was simulated by means of a tactile stimulus, and habituation test, in which the same alert test stimulus was repeated 5 times at 30-min intervals. The invasive <span>G. quadricolor</span> showed higher levels of exploration activity, thigmotaxis, alertness, and sensitization than the native species. These behavioral traits may represent pivotal drivers of the ongoing invasion process.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Current Zoology Current Issue","siteHash":"e7197aa0e79464a44186f16a81d9758c42b85acdd06820e73429ff264fcd9f66","entryHash":"0b5e4a0e4748d2f6977d2fae804055162b3cd434bf5aa6a1d7dab02d653c4dbd","category":"Environment"}
