{"title":"Association between Mitochondrial DNA Copy Number and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes among Black and White Preterm Infants up to Two Years of Age","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1905/v1","date":1714374657000,"content":"Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) is associated with mitochondrial function contributing various diseases. Understanding of the association between mtDNAcn and infant neurodevelopment, as well as the role of racial disparities, remains unknown. A cohort study was conducted with 55 preterm infants and a single blood sample was collected from each infant during their NICU stay to measure mtDNAcn. NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) and Bayley Scale of Infant Developmental testing Edition III was assessed during NICU until 2 years of corrected age (CA). Linear regression models were performed to investigate the relationship between the clinical characteristics, neurobehavioral outcomes and mtDNAcn. Majority of our subjects were male, White, non-Hispanic, had C-section, and without preterm premature rupture of membrane (PPROM). Increased mtDNAcn was found associated with younger birth gestational age (GA), nonoptimal neurodevelopment. However, the opposite associations between mtDNAcn and neurodevelopmental outcomes were observed between Black and White infants up to 1 year of CA. Adverse early life experience, together with increased mtDNAcn in White infants, and decreased mtDNAcn in Black infants may be considered as significant positive predictors of poor early life neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c3bdaa0fbed8c90246423163b538ea40391b479a0362e0f2402d4c62818cde6a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
