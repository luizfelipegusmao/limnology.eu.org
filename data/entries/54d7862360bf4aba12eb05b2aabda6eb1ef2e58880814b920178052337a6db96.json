{"title":"Financial sector development and renewable energy consumption nexus: Evidence from global dynamic panel threshold analysis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12469?af=R","date":1714556647000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Decarbonizing economies requires an energy transition from conventional energy resources to renewable and clean energy resources. However, this transition largely depends upon the availability of huge investments to manage high start-up costs and operational infrastructure. In this respect, the financial sector can play a vital role. This study explores the financial sector's role in renewable energy consumption utilizing a comprehensive measure of financial sector development constituting both financial institutions and financial markets. Moreover, the study utilizes an advanced econometric technique “dynamic panel threshold model” on panel data of 165 countries ranging from 1980 to 2019. The empirical analysis reveals the presence of a threshold value of 0.191, 0.196, and 0.008 for the overall financial development index, financial institutions index, and financial market index, respectively. This finding confirms the presence of a U-shaped curve between financial sector development and renewable energy consumption, validating the existence of the financial Kuznets curve. Thus, initially, financial sector development results in lower renewable energy consumption while after reaching the threshold level it boosts renewable energy consumption. Furthermore, the study also shows the statistically significant role of economic growth, trade openness, and inflation in explaining renewable energy usage. The obtained outcomes suggest a pressing necessity to improve both financial institutions and markets to surpass the threshold levels of financial sector performance within the financial sector, thus supporting a rise in renewable energy consumption.</p>","author":"Muhammad Tariq Majeed, \nZubia Hussain","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"54d7862360bf4aba12eb05b2aabda6eb1ef2e58880814b920178052337a6db96","category":"Environment"}
