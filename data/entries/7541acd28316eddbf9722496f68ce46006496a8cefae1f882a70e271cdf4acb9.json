For all research conducted at or funded by NIH, the policy requires a DMS Plan that describes how data will be managed and shared over the life of a project, including key information such as repositories where the data will be deposited. To increase the policy’s impact, NIH should empower stakeholders by expanding the resources provided to prepare, review, and implement DMS Plans.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"7541acd28316eddbf9722496f68ce46006496a8cefae1f882a70e271cdf4acb9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
