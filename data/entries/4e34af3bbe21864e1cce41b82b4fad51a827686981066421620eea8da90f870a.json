Use of soft x-rays from 284 to 543 eV (2.34 to 4.4 nm) allow SXT to retrieve quantitative x-ray absorption information of protein content in biological cells in their native, wet state without the use of chemical fixation or staining [<a href=\"#ozae044.1034-B3\">3</a>]. Because of these unique characteristics, SXT has been widely applied in a wide range of applications, from phenotyping of cells such as bacteria, yeast and eukaryotes to investigating cell-nanoparticle, cell-parasite and cell-virus interactions [<a href=\"#ozae044.1034-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4e34af3bbe21864e1cce41b82b4fad51a827686981066421620eea8da90f870a","category":"Environment"}
