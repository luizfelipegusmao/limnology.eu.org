{"title":"Mitomycin C as an Anti-persister Strategy Against Klebsiella Pneumoniae: Toxicity and Synergy Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0398/v1","date":1722941058000,"content":"The combination of several therapeutic strategies is often seen as a good way to decrease the resistance rates, since bacteria overcome better single-drug treatments than multi-drug ones. This strategy is especially attractive when several targets and subpopulations are affected, as it is the case of Klebsiella pneumoniae persister cells, a subpopulation of bacteria able to transiently survive antibiotic exposures. This work aims to evaluate the potential of a repurposed anticancer drug, mitomycin C, combined with the K. pneumoniae lytic phage vB_KpnM-VAC13 in vitro and the safety in an in vivo murine model against two clinical isolates of this pathogen, one of them exhibiting an imipenem-persister phenotype. At the same time, we verified the absence of toxicity of mitomycin C at the concentration using the human chondrocyte cell line T/C28a2. The viability of these human cells was checked both by cytotoxicity assays and flow cytometry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"251d935600de4adbd7b6f3e114dff196247b98d88ab4806789b093f5d0bcd70a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
