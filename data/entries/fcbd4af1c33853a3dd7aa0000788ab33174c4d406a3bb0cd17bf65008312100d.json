{"title":"Structural Integrity and Performance Analysis of a Concrete Bridge Close to the Masjed Soleiman Earthen Dam","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0420/v1","date":1728280860000,"content":"This study aims to evaluate the performance of a concrete bridge located near the earthen dam of Masjed Soleiman County. The proximity of bridges to large water structures such as dams can affect their structural integrity due to environmental factors and the dynamic loads imposed by fluctuating water levels and soil movements. This paper analyzes the structural behavior of the concrete bridge using advanced modeling techniques, including finite element analysis and site-specific data. The methodology involves evaluating the bridge’s load-carrying capacity, durability under environmental stresses, and possible degradation due to soil settlement and moisture penetration from the nearby dam.Field tests and simulations were conducted to assess the bridge’s stability and performance under different loading conditions, including traffic loads and external factors like changes in water pressure from the dam. Results indicate that while the concrete bridge remains structurally sound, there are signs of minor degradation in certain areas, such as cracks and moisture-related issues. These findings highlight the importance of regular maintenance and monitoring, especially in structures located near large water bodies or dams.Recommendations for improving the bridge’s performance include applying advanced waterproofing methods, strengthening concrete components in critical zones, and implementing a routine inspection schedule. The results from this case study provide valuable insights into the interaction between bridges and surrounding hydraulic infrastructure, serving as a reference for similar projects in regions prone to environmental and structural stresses.This research contributes to the body of knowledge by offering practical solutions for maintaining and enhancing the durability of concrete bridges in close proximity to dams, emphasizing the need for proactive strategies to extend the lifespan of such critical infrastructure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fcbd4af1c33853a3dd7aa0000788ab33174c4d406a3bb0cd17bf65008312100d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
