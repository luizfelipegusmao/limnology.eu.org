{"title":"New Insight Into Phytochromes: Connecting Structure to Function","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-arplant-070623-110636?TRACK=RSS","date":1721606400000,"content":"<div><p>Red and far-red lightâ€“sensing phytochromes are widespread in nature, occurring in plants, algae, fungi, and prokaryotes. Despite at least a billion years of evolution, their photosensory modules remain structurally and functionally similar. Conversely, nature has found remarkably different ways of transmitting light signals from the photosensor to diverse physiological responses. We summarize key features of phytochrome structure and function and discuss how these are correlated, from how the bilin environment affects the chromophore to how light induces cellular signals. Recent advances in the structural characterization of bacterial and plant phytochromes have resulted in paradigm changes in phytochrome research that we discuss in the context of present-day knowledge. Finally, we highlight questions that remain to be answered and suggest some of the benefits of understanding phytochrome structure and function.</p></div>","author":"Jon Hughes and Andreas Winkler","siteTitle":"Annual Reviews: Annual Review of Plant Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"f9af7703a9e08f35edcf21995cc07f36402e9892411dd5042fb57fa6c1c4e57d","entryHash":"d318db5cc0c67545145b949b4e340ae428ce0e4060707cf59000a296f9a22f85","category":"Environment"}
