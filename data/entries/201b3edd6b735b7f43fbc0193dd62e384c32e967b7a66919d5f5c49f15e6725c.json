{"title":"Respiratory acidosis and O2 supply capacity do not affect the acute temperature tolerance of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae026/7675712?rss=1","date":1715817600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The mechanisms that determine the temperature tolerances of fish are poorly understood, creating barriers to disentangle how additional environmental challenges—such as CO<sub>2</sub>-induced aquatic acidification and fluctuating oxygen availability—may exacerbate vulnerability to a warming climate and extreme heat events. Here, we explored whether two acute exposures (~0.5 hours or ~72 hours) to increased CO<sub>2</sub> impact acute temperature tolerance limits in a freshwater fish, rainbow trout (<span>Oncorhynchus mykiss</span>). We separated the potential effects of acute high CO<sub>2</sub> exposure on critical thermal maximum (CT<sub>max</sub>), caused via either respiratory acidosis (reduced internal pH) or O<sub>2</sub> supply capacity (aerobic scope), by exposing rainbow trout to ~1 kPa CO<sub>2</sub> (~1% or 10 000 μatm) in combination with normoxia or hyperoxia (~21 or 42 kPa O<sub>2</sub>, respectively). In normoxia, acute exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub> caused a large acidosis in trout (blood pH decreased by 0.43 units), while a combination of hyperoxia and ~1 kPa CO<sub>2</sub> increased the aerobic scope of trout by 28%. Despite large changes in blood pH and aerobic scope between treatments, we observed no impacts on the CT<sub>max</sub> of trout. Our results suggest that the mechanisms that determine the maximum temperature tolerance of trout are independent of blood acid–base balance or the capacity to deliver O<sub>2</sub> to tissues.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"201b3edd6b735b7f43fbc0193dd62e384c32e967b7a66919d5f5c49f15e6725c","category":"Environment"}
