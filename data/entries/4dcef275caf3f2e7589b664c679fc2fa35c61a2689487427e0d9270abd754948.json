{"title":"Land Cover Change Detection with Optical and SAR Satellite Data after Tropical Cyclone Seroja - Case Study in Dili, Timor Leste","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0171/v1","date":1727866775000,"content":"This study utilizes a combination of optical PlanetScope imagery and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 to investigate land cover changes in Dili, Timor-Leste, following Tropical Cyclone Seroja. The primary objective is to evaluate how integrating these datasets enhances disaster monitoring and response in flood-affected areas. The Random Forest classifier, known for its robustness in handling high-dimensional and noisy data, was applied to classify land cover into six distinct classes: vegetation, water, built-up areas, bare soil, clouds, and shadows. The classification was performed across three phases—pre-disaster, post-disaster, and recovery—using Google Earth Engine (GEE). Binary segmentation using Otsu thresholding was applied to the SAR images to refine the classification by delineating water bodies from non-water areas. The study achieved high classification accuracy, with overall accuracy ranging from 97.2% to 98.7%, and the Kappa index, which measures agreement between classified and reference data, remained consistently strong, indicating reliable model performance. Key results include a significant increase in water bodies and extensive damage to vegetation and built-up areas during the post-disaster phase, followed by partial recovery in the subsequent period. Despite the high accuracy, urban areas posed classification challenges due to misclassification between built-up and bare soil categories. This research offers a methodological framework for integrating optical and SAR data with machine learning for land cover change detection in post-disaster scenarios. The societal benefits of this study include improved disaster preparedness, enhanced recovery planning, and valuable insights into flood impact mitigation in regions like Timor-Leste, where technical and data limitations persist.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4dcef275caf3f2e7589b664c679fc2fa35c61a2689487427e0d9270abd754948","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
