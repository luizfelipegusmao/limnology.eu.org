The research question posed is: How are human rights being addressed within the framework of Vision 2030? The goal of the essay is to provide a qualitative analysis of the reforms and policies emerging under Vision 2030, highlighting both advancements and ongoing challenges. Key discussions include historical human rights perspectives, specific strategies aimed at enhancing women’s rights and labor rights, and the implications of legal reforms. The essay draws upon a range of scholarly sources to underscore the intricate relationship between human rights improvements and socio-economic objectives in Saudi Arabia. The main conclusions suggest that while significant strides have been made, particularly in women's empowerment and labor rights, substantial obstacles—rooted in cultural norms and institutional practices—persist. Ongoing international scrutiny and a robust domestic dialogue on human rights remain critical for the success of these reforms. The essay ultimately advocates for sustained efforts to uphold human rights as a cornerstone of the Vision 2030 agenda.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"769347b5857fbb82b22018e7572a8ccf8a6d6990e1f21133faabe377ec0a310c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
