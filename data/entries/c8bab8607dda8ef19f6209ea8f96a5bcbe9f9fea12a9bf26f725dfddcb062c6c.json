{"title":"Embracing telepharmacy: Unveiling Malaysiansâ€™ perceptions and knowledge through online survey","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307897","date":1724767200000,"content":"<p>by Azlina Ahmad, Shubashini Gnanasan, Mahmathi Karuppannan</p>\r\n\r\nThe expansion of information technologies, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, has notably increased the use of remote services, including telehealth. Telepharmacy, a subset of telehealth, offers remote pharmaceutical care services, benefiting patients by providing advice and consultations without the need for physical pharmacy visits. This study aimed to assess public perceptions and awareness of telepharmacy in Malaysia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from Nov 2022 to May 2023, involving 387 Malaysian citizens aged 18 and above. Data collection utilised Google Forms distributed via social medias, covering demographics, technological readiness, awareness, perceptions, and willingness related to telepharmacy. The study demonstrated high digital readiness among respondents, owning smartphones and being adept in utilising various digital features. However, there was a lack of awareness regarding the concept of telepharmacy. Despite predominantly positive perceptions of its potential, only 48.1% of respondents showed willingness to utilise telepharmacy services. While respondents exhibited readiness for digital engagement, there was a notable deficit in understanding telepharmacy. Though perceptions were positive, willingness to embrace telepharmacy was moderate. Addressing the knowledge gap through targeted education initiatives might enhance acceptance. Future research should focus on integrating telepharmacy into healthcare systems considering public preferences, thereby evaluating its actual implementation and outcomes among diverse demographics.","author":"Azlina Ahmad","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c8bab8607dda8ef19f6209ea8f96a5bcbe9f9fea12a9bf26f725dfddcb062c6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
