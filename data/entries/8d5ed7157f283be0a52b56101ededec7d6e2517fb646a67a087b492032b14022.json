{"title":"Nudix hydrolase 23 post-translationally regulates carotenoid biosynthesis in plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1868/7595672?rss=1","date":1706659200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Carotenoids are essential for photosynthesis and photoprotection. Plants must evolve multifaceted regulatory mechanisms to control carotenoid biosynthesis. However, the regulatory mechanisms and the regulators conserved among plant species remain elusive. Phytoene synthase (PSY) catalyzes the highly regulated step of carotenogenesis and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) acts as a hub to interact with GGPP-utilizing enzymes for the synthesis of specific downstream isoprenoids. Here, we report a function of Nudix hydrolase 23 (NUDX23), a Nudix domain-containing protein, in post-translational regulation of PSY and GGPPS for carotenoid biosynthesis. <span>NUDX23</span> expresses highly in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) leaves. Overexpression of <span>NUDX23</span> significantly increases PSY and GGPPS protein levels and carotenoid production, whereas knockout of <span>NUDX23</span> dramatically reduces their abundances and carotenoid accumulation in Arabidopsis. NUDX23 regulates carotenoid biosynthesis via direct interactions with PSY and GGPPS in chloroplasts, which enhances PSY and GGPPS protein stability in a large PSYâ€“GGPPS enzyme complex. NUDX23 was found to co-migrate with PSY and GGPPS proteins and to be required for the enzyme complex assembly. Our findings uncover a regulatory mechanism underlying carotenoid biosynthesis in plants and offer promising genetic tools for developing carotenoid-enriched food crops.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"8d5ed7157f283be0a52b56101ededec7d6e2517fb646a67a087b492032b14022","category":"Environment"}
