{"title":"Plant growth-promoting bacteria potentiate antifungal and plant-beneficial responses of <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> by upregulating its effector functions","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301139","date":1711116000000,"content":"<p>by Paulina Guzmán-Guzmán, Eduardo Valencia-Cantero, Gustavo Santoyo</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Trichoderma</i> uses different molecules to establish communication during its interactions with other organisms, such as effector proteins. Effectors modulate plant physiology to colonize plant roots or improve <i>Trichoderma</i>’s mycoparasitic capacity. In the soil, these fungi can establish relationships with plant growth–promoting bacteria (PGPBs), thus affecting their overall benefits on the plant or its fungal prey, and possibly, the role of effector proteins. The aim of this study was to determine the induction of <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> gene expression coding for effector proteins during the interaction with different PGPBs, <i>Arabidopsis</i> or the phytopathogen <i>Fusarium brachygibbosum</i>, and to determine whether PGPBs potentiates the beneficial effects of <i>T</i>. <i>atroviride</i>. During the interaction with <i>F</i>. <i>brachygibbosum</i> and PGPBs, the effector coding genes <i>epl1</i>, <i>tatrx2</i> and <i>tacfem1</i> increased their expression, especially during the consortia with the bacteria. During the interaction of <i>T</i>. <i>atroviride</i> with the plant and PGPBs, the expression of <i>epl1</i> and <i>tatrx2</i> increased, mainly with the consortium formed with <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> UM270, <i>Bacillus velezensis</i> AF12, or <i>B</i>. <i>halotolerans</i> AF23. Additionally, the consortium formed by <i>T</i>. <i>atroviride</i> and <i>R</i>. <i>badensis</i> SER3 stimulated <i>A</i>. <i>thaliana</i> PR1:GUS and LOX2:GUS for SA- and JA-mediated defence responses. Finally, the consortium of <i>T</i>. <i>atroviride</i> with SER3 was better at inhibiting pathogen growth, but the consortium of <i>T</i>. <i>atroviride</i> with UM270 was better at promoting <i>Arabidopsis</i> growth. These results showed that the biocontrol capacity and plant growth-promoting traits of <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. can be potentiated by PGPBs by stimulating its effector functions.","author":"Paulina Guzmán-Guzmán","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"22a156095a08e51cfb799ffcf49c3f355649ef682503aa82016e237981b69a85","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
