{"title":"Deciphering the Complexities of Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Emerging Roles of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition Transcription Factors (EMT-TFs) in Disease Progression","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1231/v1","date":1721053510000,"content":"Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a diverse malignancy originating from myeloid progenitor cells, with significant genetic and clinical variability. Modern classification systems like those from the World Health Organization (WHO) and European LeukemiaNet use immunophenotyping, molecular genetics, and clinical features to categorize AML subtypes. This classification highlights crucial genetic markers such as FLT3, NPM1 mutations, and the MLL-AF9 fusion, which are essential for prognosis and directing targeted therapies. The MLL-AF9 fusion protein is often linked with therapy-resistant AML due, highlighting the risk of relapse due standard chemotherapeutic regimes. In this sense, factors like the ZEB, SNAI, and TWIST gene families, known for their roles in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis, also regulate hematopoiesis and may serve as effective therapeutic targets in AML. These genes contribute to cell proliferation, differentiation, and extramedullary hematopoiesis, suggesting new possibilities for treatment. Advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that promote AML, especially how the bone marrow microenvironment affects invasion and drug resistance, is crucial. This comprehensive insight into the molecular and environmental interactions in AML emphasizes the need for ongoing research and more effective treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30bdfd4c3800f1bdd661f26ced9e937357418e76fcc3e1749289d1f110aa4c40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
