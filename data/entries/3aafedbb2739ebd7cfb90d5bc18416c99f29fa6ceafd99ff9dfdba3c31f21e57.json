{"title":"Experimental State Observer of the Population Inversion of a Multistable Erbium-Doped Fiber Laser","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1158/v1","date":1726473876000,"content":"In this work, numerical and experimental implementation of a state observer applied to an Erbium-Doped Fiber Laser (EDFL) has been developed. The state observer is designed through the mathematical model of the EDFL to estimate the non-measurable variable; however, in numerical estimation, the state variables can be measurable given the mathematical model. Only the laser intensity variable was experimentally measured. The state observer estimated the population inversion through the obtained experimental laser intensity time series fitted with their numerical laser intensity using the mean square error (MSE) tool. A bifurcation diagram of the population inversion time series local maximum was built from the state observer. The state space of the experimental laser intensity versus observed population inversion was built.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3aafedbb2739ebd7cfb90d5bc18416c99f29fa6ceafd99ff9dfdba3c31f21e57","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
