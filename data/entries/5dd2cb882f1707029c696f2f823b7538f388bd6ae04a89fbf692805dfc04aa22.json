These limitations risk: “missing” rare ultrastructural events through the limited volumes of tissue examined which are further compounded by challenges extrapolating 3D information from 2D images and then understanding ultrastructural changes with respect to cell function.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5dd2cb882f1707029c696f2f823b7538f388bd6ae04a89fbf692805dfc04aa22","category":"Environment"}
