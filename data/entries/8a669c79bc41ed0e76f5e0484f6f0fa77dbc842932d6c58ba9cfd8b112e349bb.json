{"title":"Reversal of Renal Failure in a Case of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia with Renal Infiltration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1511/v1","date":1719207688000,"content":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukemia in adults, characterized by abnormal growth of mature B cells in the blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues. Although CLL primarily affects the hematopoietic system and lymph nodes, renal involvement is exceptionally rare and presents diagnostic and treatment challenges. Potential causes of renal failure in CLL patients include sepsis, dehydration, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), compression of the ureter by enlarged lymph nodes, and side effects of cancer therapy. This report presents a case of CLL with renal infiltration leading to severe renal failure, discussing the clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, and management of this condition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a669c79bc41ed0e76f5e0484f6f0fa77dbc842932d6c58ba9cfd8b112e349bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
