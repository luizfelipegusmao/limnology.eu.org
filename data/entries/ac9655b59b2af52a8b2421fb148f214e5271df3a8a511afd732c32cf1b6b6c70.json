{"title":"The Impact of Plyometric Training on Agility, Speed, and Social Interaction in Children with Mild Intellectual Disability: A Special Olympics Framework Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0508/v1","date":1717765553000,"content":"Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a plyometric training program designed to enhance agility, speed, and social interaction among boys with mild intellectual disability (ID) aged 10-12, within the Special Olympics framework. Participants: Thirty-two boys (mean age = 10.69 ± 0.8 years; mean IQ = 61 ± 7) from three inclusive education centers participated in the study. Methods: The intervention consisted of a 10-week plyometric training program, conducted twice a week. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included the Reaction Time Test, 4-Corner Agility Test, 10-Meter Speed Run, 4x5 Meter Relay Test, and the Friendship Activity Scale (FAS). Results: The study found significant improvements across all measures. Reaction time decreased by 0.83 seconds (t = 7.44, p &lt; 0.001), 4-corner agility improved by 0.77 seconds (t = 11.93, p &lt; 0.001), 4x5 meter speed improved by 0.61 m/s (t = 17.37, p &lt; 0.001), and 10-meter run speed improved by 1.55 m/s (t = -12.76, p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, the FAS score increased by 0.81 points (t = 9.59, p &lt; 0.001), indicating enhanced social interactions. Conclusion: The plyometric training program significantly improved agility, speed, and social interaction in children with mild ID, demonstrating the effectiveness of inclusive, adaptive physical education strategies within the Special Olympics framework.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac9655b59b2af52a8b2421fb148f214e5271df3a8a511afd732c32cf1b6b6c70","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
