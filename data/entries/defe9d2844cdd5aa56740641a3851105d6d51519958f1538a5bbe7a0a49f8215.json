{"title":"Effectiveness of attapulgite modified by chlorides on speciation and environmental risk of heavy metals in soil","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13762-023-05423-5","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of attapulgite modified with five different chlorides (AMNaC, AMCaC, AMMgC, AMFeC, and AMAlC) in improving attapulgite performance and its potential for immobilizing heavy metals in polluted soil. The contaminated soil was treated with attapulgite-modified chlorides as a passivating agent to stabilize Cd, Pb, Cr, and Zn pollutants, while untreated soil served as the control. Various techniques, including scan electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and stability analysis were employed to evaluate the modifications. The bioavailability and stability of heavy metals were assessed using the TCLP and CaCl<sub>2</sub> extraction to determine Cd, Pb, Cr, and Zn concentrations. The BCR method was conducted to investigate changes in the speciation of heavy metals in soils stabilized by attapulgite-modified chloride compounds. SEM and XRD analysis demonstrated that the attapulgite-modified chlorides were uniformly dispersed and well-fixed on the superficies of the attapulgite particles. Following the addendum of attapulgite-modified chloride, the soil pH increased by 1.33 units, while EC, CEC, OM, and N showed slight increases. The toxicity characterized leaching procedure results indicated significant reductions in Cd, Pb, Cr, and Zn concentrations, with decreases ranging from 3.80 to 1.20 mg/kg, 15.00 to 4.40 mg/kg, 3.00 to 0.80 mg/kg, and 24.16 to 10.70 mg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, after the incubation period, the residual proportions of Cd, Pb, Cr, and Zn increased by 32.04%, 39.01%, 36.03%, and 39.01%, respectively. Overall, utilizing attapulgite-modified chlorides effectively reduced the bio-availability and mobility of heavy metals in the soil.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"defe9d2844cdd5aa56740641a3851105d6d51519958f1538a5bbe7a0a49f8215","category":"Environment"}
