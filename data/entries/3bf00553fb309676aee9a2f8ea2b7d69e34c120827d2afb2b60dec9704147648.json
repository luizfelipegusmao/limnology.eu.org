{"title":"A Comprehensive Study of Pineapple Cultivation: Morphology, Harvesting Challenges, and Mechanization Innovations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202210.0120/v2","date":1711352335000,"content":"This review paper delves into the multifaceted aspects of pineapple cultivation, focusing on morphology studies, harvesting challenges, and mechanization efforts. Pineapple, renowned for its commercial value and unique flavor, holds a prominent position in global agriculture, with India alone producing 19.64 lakh tonnes annually. However, the hilly terrains of regions like northeastern India pose significant hurdles to traditional harvesting methods, necessitating innovative solutions. Understanding the morphology of pineapple plants is crucial for optimizing cultivation practices and designing efficient harvesting equipment. Insights from various studies shed light on leaf structure, fruit maturity, and growth patterns, providing valuable information for engineering tailored solutions. Mechanization endeavors, including semi-mechanized harvesting machines and semi-manual harvesters, demonstrate promising results in improving efficiency and reducing labor-intensive practices. Despite challenges such as increased crop losses and operational costs, continued research and development in mechanization hold the key to sustainable pineapple cultivation. This paper underscores the importance of integrating morphology studies and mechanization efforts to address the unique challenges faced by pineapple farmers, particularly in hilly terrains, and highlights the need for ongoing innovation to ensure the long-term sustainability of pineapple cultivation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3bf00553fb309676aee9a2f8ea2b7d69e34c120827d2afb2b60dec9704147648","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
