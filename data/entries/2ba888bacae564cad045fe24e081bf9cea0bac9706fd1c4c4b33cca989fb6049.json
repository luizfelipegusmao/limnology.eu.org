Calculating its electron density, bandgap energy and electronic mobility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ba888bacae564cad045fe24e081bf9cea0bac9706fd1c4c4b33cca989fb6049","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
