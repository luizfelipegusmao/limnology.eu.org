COVID-19 vaccination is essential to build population immunity and prevent severe disease among this population. We determined the prevalence and factors associated with intention to accept COVID-19 vaccine among IDPs in Northeast Nigeria. This cross-sectional study, conducted during July–December 2022, included 1,537 unvaccinated IDPs from 18 IDPs camps. We performed a complex sample survey analysis and described participants’ characteristics and vaccination intention with weighted descriptive statistics. We fitted weighted logistic regression models and computed adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals to identify factors associated with intention to accept COVID-19 vaccine. Of 1,537 IDPs, 55.4% were 18–39 years old, 82.6% were females, and 88.6% had no formal education. Among them, 63.5% (95% CI: 59.0–68.1) expressed intention to accept COVID-19 vaccine. Among the IDPs who intended to reject vaccine, 42.8% provided no reason, 35.3% had COVID-19 misconceptions, 9.5% reported vaccine safety concerns, and 7.4% felt no need. IDPs who perceived COVID-19 as severe (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.31, [95% CI: 1.35–3.96]), perceived COVID-19 vaccine as effective (AOR = 4.28, [95% CI: 2.46–7.44]) and resided in official camps (AOR = 3.29, [95% CI: 1.94–5.56]) were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccine. However, IDPs who resided 2 kilometers or farther from the nearest health facility (AOR = 0.34, [95% CI: 0.20–0.58]) were less likely to accept vaccine. Intention to accept COVID-19 vaccine among the IDPs was suboptimal. To improve vaccination acceptance among this population, health education and risk communication should be intensified to counter misinformation, strengthen vaccine confidence, and shape perception of COVID-19 severity, focusing on IDPs in unofficial camps. Appropriate interventions to deliver vaccines to remote households should be ramped up.","author":"Saheed Gidado","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c499c14e6c8ca8eb8b8c99ccf2e029d75b630f1772cf1d276baddf4e94c01432","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
