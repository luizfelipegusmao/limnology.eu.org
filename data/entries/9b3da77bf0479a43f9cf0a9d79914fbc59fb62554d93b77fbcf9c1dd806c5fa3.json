{"title":"Using Optical Sensor Applied to Rapid Soil Test Kit for NH4+ and NO3- in Soil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1520/v1","date":1711450089000,"content":"This study aims to construct simple devices to ascertain the concentrations of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-). The device structure comprises a visible and near-infrared absorption meas-urement room, along with an RGB (red, green, and blue) absorption measurement room, con-stituting the two measuring rooms. Both the measurement rooms are equipped with light sources and detectors configured to operate in opposed or thru-beam modes. A tiny processor is utilized for processing the measurements, with an algorithm implemented within its memory. During the algorithm development phase, ranges for measuring the quantity of nutrients were categorized using a discriminant analysis approach. Thirty percent of the soil sample data were utilized as verification data, while the remaining 70 percent served as training data. Nutrient content values from reliable measuring instruments were incorporated into all datasets. Discriminant analysis was employed to classify the amount of NH4+ into five ranges based on the test results. When tested with soil samples, the accuracy was 66.13% compared to the reference value of a reliable measuring device. Similarly, NO3- was classified into four ranges with an accuracy of 81% com-pared to the reference value of a reliable measuring device.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b3da77bf0479a43f9cf0a9d79914fbc59fb62554d93b77fbcf9c1dd806c5fa3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
