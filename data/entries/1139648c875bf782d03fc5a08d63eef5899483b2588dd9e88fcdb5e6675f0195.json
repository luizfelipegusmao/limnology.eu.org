{"title":"Avatar Detection in Metaverse Recordings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2512/v1","date":1722409252000,"content":"The metaverse is gradually expanding. There is a growing number of photo and video recordings of metaverse virtual worlds being used in multiple domains, with growing collections. An essential element of the metaverse and its recordings are avatars. In this paper, we present a novel task of avatar detection in metaverse recordings, supporting semantic retrieval in collections of metaverse recordings and other use cases. Our work addresses the characterizations and definitions of avatars and presents a new model supporting avatar detection. The latest object detection algorithms are trained and tested on a variety of avatar types in metaverse recordings. Our work achieves a higher level of accuracy than existing models, which encourages further research in this field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1139648c875bf782d03fc5a08d63eef5899483b2588dd9e88fcdb5e6675f0195","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
