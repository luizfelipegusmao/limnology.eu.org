{"title":"Light output function and pulse-shape discrimination capability of p-Terphenyl organic scintillator in wide energy range","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.0901/v2","date":1724379343000,"content":"In this work, we studied light-output properties, efficiency function as well as PSD capability of p-Terphenyl scintillator. The selected solid cylindrical scintillation detector has a size of (45 x 45) mm with PSD properties. Recently presented studies of light-output functions have been meas-ured only for low neutron energies. Our motivation has been to determine more accurate the light output function for p-Terphenyl scintillator over a wider neutron energy range.\nThe measurements have been carried out with mono-energetic neutron beams in the wide energy range from 2.5 to 19 MeV. The neutron-gamma spectrometric system, which we developed has been used for the measurement. The input analogue signal from the detector is digitized with fast 12-bits analogue to digital converter with sampling frequency of 1 GHz. Measured data from the detector are processed into gamma and neutron spectra. \nThe light output function for protons has been determined by finding the position of the protons for given neutron energies. The more accurate light output function for p-Therphenyl scintillator has been calculated. The pulse-shape discrimination capability as well as efficiency of p-Terphenyl scintillator in comparison with NE-213 equivalent detector is lower.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5d3b322c5e3d102313c47970e8f904c7ae0a3ea8c8513601640b059dc8fac99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
