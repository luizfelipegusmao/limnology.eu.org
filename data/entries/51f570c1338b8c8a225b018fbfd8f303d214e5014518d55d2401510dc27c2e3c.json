{"title":"A Review of Generative Pretrained Multi-step Prompting Schemes &ndash;and a New Multi-step Prompting Framework","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0720/v1","date":1715580704000,"content":"This paper reviews the pioneering work related to the generation of a sequence of prompts in Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) to automatically complete a complex writing task. The paper identifies the main categories of automated multi-step prompting and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. The paper also proposes an additional approach for automated multi-step prompting with iterative four main phases: in the first phase a sequence of prompts is geared to elicit the structure of the requested task. This is done by identifying the taskâ€™s main parts, the general contents of the different parts and their precedence relations. The structure of each main part is iteratively explored to find secondary and tertiary parts if they exist. A second phase is followed by a sequence of prompts that fill in the primary, secondary, and tertiary parts, and seek to fine-tune the result. The third phase reviews the generated text and criticizes it. Based on this criticism a revision is prepared. The fourth phase is fine-tuning the document, with emphasis on section length and text tone. Future research could deal with the system identification of points where the system should initiate interaction with the user for desired feedback and guidance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51f570c1338b8c8a225b018fbfd8f303d214e5014518d55d2401510dc27c2e3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
