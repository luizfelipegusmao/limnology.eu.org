{"title":"Machine Learning-Driven Prediction of Brain Age for Alzheimer&#039;s Risk: APOE4 Genotype and Gender Effects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0820/v1","date":1723511336000,"content":"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, significantly influenced by the Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) gene and gender. This study aims to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict brain age and assess AD risk by considering the effects of APOE4 genotype and gender.\n\nMethods: We collected brain volumetric MRI data and medical records from 1100 cognitively unimpaired individuals and 602 AD patients. We applied three ML regression models—XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Linear Regression (LR)—to predict brain age. Additionally, we introduced two novel metrics, Brain Age Difference (BAD) and Integrated Difference (ID), to evaluate model performance and analyze the influence of APOE4 genotype and gender on brain aging.\n\nResults: AD patients displayed significantly older brain ages compared to their chronological ages, with BADs ranging from 6.5 to 10 years. The RF model outperformed both XGBoost and LR in terms of accuracy, delivering higher ID values and more precise predictions. Comparing APOE4 carriers with non-carriers, the models showed enhanced ID values and consistent brain age predictions, improving overall performance. Gender-specific analyses indicated slight enhancements, with models performing equally well on both genders. It indicates that APOE4 may be a more robust predictor of brain age than gender.\n\nConclusion: Robust ML models for brain age prediction can be pivotal in the early detection of AD risk via MRI brain structural imaging, especially for APOE4 carriers. Such early identification may facilitate timely preventive interventions for AD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4bf0c51e99bff356c5d7e54d039538e409f8bdd5aa2345824012d97a23275b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
