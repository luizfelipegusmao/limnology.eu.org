Abu-Humaidan</p>\r\n\r\nThe Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a prevalent blood-borne illness, posing a significant risk to hemodialysis patients particularly due to their potential immunosuppressed status. This study aimed to address HBV awareness among Jordanian hemodialysis patients, filling a gap in regional research. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at a multicenter governmental hospital in Jordan, with 389 participants. Among them, 61.3% were male, and 80.7% were over 38 years old. While 34% demonstrated a high level of knowledge, Participants with a higher degree of education and those working in the medical field were more informed. Although most participants had an inadequate understanding of HBV symptoms and transmission, they maintained positive attitudes and engaged in infection preventative actions. Enhanced educational efforts are required to raise awareness among hemodialysis patients, and further research is needed to address any reluctance towards preventive practices and seeking treatment.","author":"Nader Alaridah","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"31ea68132faa34a6f81ef825818096df966f6b89ec6c8b5a5a67464d5beaf893","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
