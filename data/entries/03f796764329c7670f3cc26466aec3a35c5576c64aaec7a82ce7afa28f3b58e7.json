{"title":"Research on the Construction of Evaluation System for New Building Industrialization Projects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0038/v1","date":1727938478000,"content":"Although new industrialized construction technologies have the potential to improve industry performance by optimizing work processes and improving the working environment, the application of these technologies in the construction industry is still in its infancy, and its technical direction is not yet set. This study aims to put forward a theoretical framework for evaluating the level of new-type building industrialization of construction engineering projects, conduct integrated research on the existing domestic and foreign literatures on new-type building industrialization and intelligent construction, preliminarily construct the index system, and determine the evaluation index system of new-type building industrialization projects through the Delphi method. The index weight is determined by the combination of order relation analysis and entropy weight method. The evaluation model is constructed by matter-element theory and cloud model, and the evaluation grade standard is proposed. The research results will help guide the evaluation of new building industrialization projects, and provide a judgment reference for determining the development trend and direction of new building industrialization technologies in the future, and help formulate data-driven industrial policies to promote the adoption of new industrialization technologies and promote the digital transformation of the construction industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"03f796764329c7670f3cc26466aec3a35c5576c64aaec7a82ce7afa28f3b58e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
