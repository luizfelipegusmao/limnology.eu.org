{"title":"Numerical Investigation on Thermal Conductivity of Graphene Foam Composite for Thermal Management Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0643/v1","date":1718081866000,"content":"Graphene foam prepared by chemical vapor deposition method is a promising thermal interfacial material. However, the thermal properties of graphene foam highly depend on the experimental fabrication conditions during the chemical vapor deposition process. Aiming to reveal how to prepare the appropriate graphene foam for the various thermal management scenarios, the influence of experimental conditions on thermal properties of graphene foam is investigated. Furthermore, the contribution of thermal conductivity and thermal radiation to the effective thermal coefficient of graphene foam is carried out for comparison. Research results show that, the porosity and the cross-section shape of struts of growth template are two critical factors to affect the thermal transport of graphene foam, especially with the increase of temperature. In addition, the deposition time of graphene determines the wall thickness and affects the thermal conductivity directly. The thermal radiation contributes more than thermal conductivity when the temperature climbs continuously. Comparatively, the effective thermal coefficient of graphene foam composite with high porosity and circular shape struts is much superior to others at high temperature. The research findings can provide important guidance for the graphene foam fabrication and its applications in the field of thermal management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"18de3ba3e4a01dd4205aee4a3c2792b056c85b419eafcc5d0f5c59e7fdcd4c27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
