{"title":"Thermal Bed Design for Temperature-Controlled DNA Amplification Using Optoelectronic Sensors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1059/v1","date":1726301462000,"content":"Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) is a widely used technique for nucleic acid amplification due to its high specificity, sensitivity, and rapid results. Advances in microfluidic lab-on-chip (LOC) technology have enabled the integration of LAMP into miniaturized devices, known as μ-LAMP, which require precise thermal control for optimal DNA amplification. This paper introduces a novel thermal bed design using PCB copper traces and FR−4 dielectric materials, providing a reliable, modular, and repairable heating platform. We present the design, fabrication, and control mechanisms of the thermal bed, demonstrating its ability to maintain accurate temperatures essential for μ-LAMP applications. The thermal bed’s performance is validated through finite element method (FEM) simulations, confirming its effectiveness in diverse applications such as disease diagnostics, biological safety, and forensic analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ee95dda7760ee48972c884073197b702003ecd93c9d3686e7acb77a7d88b0e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
