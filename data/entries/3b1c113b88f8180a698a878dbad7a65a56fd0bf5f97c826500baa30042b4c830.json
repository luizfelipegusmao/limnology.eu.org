{"title":"The Ali-Cesaro Stolz Theorem: Extending Classical Limit Analysis with Z-transforms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0934/v1","date":1723547725000,"content":"The Ali-Cesaro Stolz theorem, introduced in this paper, extends the classical Cesaro-Stolz theorem by addressing cases where the latter does not yield results or provides a \"Does Not Existe (DNE) form. This novel theorem leverages the properties of limits and Z-transforms, offering a robust framework for analyzing sequences and series. The theorem is particularly effective in scenarios where traditional approaches fail, providing new insights and tools for mathematical analysis. This paper presents a detailed formulation of the Ali-Cesaro Stolz theorem, including proofs, applications, and a discussion on its implications and advantages over existing methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b1c113b88f8180a698a878dbad7a65a56fd0bf5f97c826500baa30042b4c830","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
