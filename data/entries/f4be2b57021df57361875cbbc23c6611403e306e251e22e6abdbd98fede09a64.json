{"title":"Water resources sustainability assessment in the Vietnamese Srepok River Basin","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/wej.12911?af=R","date":1705380875000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study proposes a sustainability assessment framework for managing the water resources of the Vietnamese portion of the Srepok River Basin (VSRB). A sustainability hierarchy was developed using five, ten, seven and five sustainability indicators to characterize economic, environmental, social and management dimensions of the basin's water resources. Reliable weights for each of these sustainability components were assigned using fuzzy analytical hierarchy process evaluations of judgements obtained from five highly experienced experts. The sustainability levels were ranked in increasing order of Management &gt; Economic &gt; Environment &gt; Social, allowing a composite sustainability index to be assessed. By taking into account economic, environmental, social and management perspectives, the assessment provides a comprehensive understanding of the sustainability of water resources in the VSRB.</p>","author":"Bui Thi Nuong, \nStephen Darby, \nNguyen Thuy Chung, \nBui Du Duong, \nVu Quynh Trang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"f4be2b57021df57361875cbbc23c6611403e306e251e22e6abdbd98fede09a64","category":"Environment"}
