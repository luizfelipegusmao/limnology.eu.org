{"title":"Knowledge and Misinformation about Breast cancer risk factors, symptoms, and prevention among healthy and affected women: a study on 2,375 Italian participants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1866/v1","date":1724711549000,"content":"Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide and remains the leading cause of death among Italian women. Despite increased breast cancer awareness and improved diagnostic techniques, mortality rates remains high globally. In Italy, despite the availability of screening programs by the National Health System (NHS) for all Italian women aged 50-69 every two years, the participation rate remains relatively low. The low uptake of screening may be attributed to a lack of general cancer knowledge among women, including awareness of risk factors, symptoms, and prevention measures. This study investigates the knowledge and misinformation in a population of Italian women regarding breast cancer risk factors, symptoms, and prevention.\nMethods: From March 2021 to January 2022, we conducted a survey targeting the female population in Italy, with a total of 2375 participants willingly participating in the study. To investigate factors linked to variations in attitudes toward breast cancer, the participants were categorized into two groups: the general population (Group A, n=2235) and women who have had or currently have breast cancer (Group B, n=140). Statistically significant differences were identified between these two groups.\nResults: The findings revealed considerable confusion regarding both the symptoms and causes associated with cancer, as well as prevention measures. This confusion was particularly prominent among women in the general population and those with lower levels of education.\nConclusions: Given these insights, it remains crucial to promote accurate health information concerning risk factors, symptoms, and prevention strategies related to this devastating disease, emphasizing the ongoing importance of disseminating correct health information.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6ae8b19b9885d2e9d1b3c911708fc760d67d0d78311e1cf86cb0d16af16fa53","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
