{"title":"Encapsulated pomegranate peel extract as a potential antimicrobial ingredient from food waste","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13698?af=R","date":1719578898000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Pomegranate peel waste is a valuable reservoir of heat-sensitive total hydrolysable tannins (THT), with potential applications in food and pharmaceuticals. Preserving THT is challenging due to degradation post-extraction. We explore ionic gelation as an encapsulation method to optimize THT utilization.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Through external gelation, we optimized the process variables using Box–Behnken design. At 40 g kg<sup>−1</sup> sodium alginate, 25 g kg<sup>−1</sup> calcium chloride, and 300 g kg<sup>−1</sup> pomegranate peel extract (PPE), we achieved an 83.65% encapsulation efficiency. Compared to spray drying, external gelation demonstrated superior performance, with enhanced release percentages and stability. Physical, phytochemical, and release profiles of encapsulates were extensively analysed. External gelation achieved an 87.5% release in 30 min, outperforming spray-dried counterparts (69.7% in 25 min). Encapsulated PPE exhibited robust antibacterial activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (ATCC 25923) in powdered infant formula, with a 32 ± 0.01 mm zone of inhibition and 300 μg mL<sup>−1</sup> minimum inhibitory concentration. Insights into <i>S. aureus</i> growth curves underlined the mechanism of action via membrane potential alterations. The results of carried investigations also showed that the antibacterial activity of the encapsulated PPE extracts against the targeted organism was identical to the antibacterial activity exhibited by synthetic antibiotics used generally to kill microorganisms in food. Therefore, from the findings, it can be concluded that the PPE encapsulate produced using the external gelation technique at the optimized condition displayed superior storage stability possessing strong antimicrobial activity when compared to encapsulate produced using the spray drying technique.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>External gelation emerges as a potent technique for developing effective encapsulates enriched with natural antimicrobials or antibiotics. This approach holds promise for applications in food, pharmaceuticals, and nutraceuticals, enhancing stability and efficacy while reducing reliance on synthetic antibiotics. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Elenjikkal Jerome Rifna, \nMadhuresh Dwivedi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"da095e21dd9e2f19c6230df058960a4de706312439bce1e3f909a005da5c847b","category":"Environment"}
