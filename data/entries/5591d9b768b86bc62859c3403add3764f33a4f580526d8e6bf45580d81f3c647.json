{"title":"Spent coffee grounds as an alternative fertilizer: impact on bioaccessibility of antioxidants and commercial quality of lettuce","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13936?af=R","date":1727855304000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>During the processing of spent coffee grounds (SCGs) several residues are obtained, which are mostly disposed of in landfills. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive waste management strategy for these residues. This study evaluates the potential of SCGs as a biofertilizer by assessing their effects on lettuce leaves and the release of antioxidants following <i>in vitro</i> digestion and fermentation.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Lettuce plants were grown with different amounts of SCGs (0–150 g kg<sup>−1</sup>) in the substrate. High SCG concentrations in the soil generated lighter colored tissues, a decrease in the green color, less root development, and lower dry weight of leaves (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The SCG levels also affected the release of antioxidants by the final product. This effect was more pronounced in the digested fraction: applying the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) method, the addition of SCGs from 10 g kg<sup>−1</sup> to 125 g kg<sup>−1</sup> increased the amount of antioxidant from 43.88 ± 4.81 to 105.96 ± 29.09 μmol Trolox g<sup>−1</sup> of dry weight (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The Indigo Carmine Reducing Capacity (IC<sub>RED</sub>) method also showed a similar trend, but in this case the highest value was obtained with 150 g kg<sup>−1</sup> of SCGs (16.41 ± 3.93 mmol catechin g<sup>−1</sup> of dry weight) (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, in the fermented fraction a significant increase in the antioxidant released was found with low levels of SCG(<i>P</i>&lt;0.05), while lettuces fertilized with intermediate amounts of SCGs (25 and 50 g kg<sup>−1</sup>) presented the highest amount of insoluble antioxidant (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>A compromise should be found in order to achieve a product with a high antioxidant capacity and an acceptable visual quality. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Mariela Patrignani, \nHéctor Joaquín Hasperué, \nAna Cervera‐Mata, \nSilvia Pastoriza, \nJosé Ángel Rufián Henares","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"5591d9b768b86bc62859c3403add3764f33a4f580526d8e6bf45580d81f3c647","category":"Environment"}
