{"title":"(R)-2-Amino-1-Hydroxyethylphosphonic Acid","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0592/v1","date":1725863290000,"content":"(R)-2-Amino-1-hydroxyethylphosphonic acid 2 was prepared by hydrolytic kinetic resolution of rac-diethyl oxiran-2-ylphosphonate followed by reaction with benzylamine, acid hydrolysis, catalytic hydrogenolysis and anion exchange chromatography. Recrystallization from water-ethanol gave 2, which was characterized by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 31P NMR, polarimetry, elemental microanalysis, high-resolution mass spectrometry and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The acid 2 crystallized in the orthorhombic chiral space group P212121 with cell constants a = 6.303(2) Å, b = 7.104(2) Å, c = 11.627(3) Å. The X-ray crystal structure confirmed the (R)-configuration of 2 and revealed that 2 is zwitterionic in the solid state, with extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl, ammonium cation and phosphonate anion groups.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ead35e8769013ba0725dbbc2c2c6dfe168124f40862128bc57ee3b1aa3da1f60","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
