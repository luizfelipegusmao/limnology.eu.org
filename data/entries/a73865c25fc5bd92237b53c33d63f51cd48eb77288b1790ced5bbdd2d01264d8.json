{"title":"Cationic Azobenzenes as Light-Responsive Crosslinkers for Alginate-Based Supramolecular Hydrogels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0536/v1","date":1709909847000,"content":"Azobenzene photoswitches are fundamental components in contemporary approaches aimed at light-driven control of intelligent materials. Significant endeavors are directed towards enhancing the light-triggered reactivity of azobenzenes for such applications and obtaining water-soluble molecules able to act as crosslinkers in a hydrogel. Here, we report the rational design and the synthesis of azobenzene/alginate photoresponsive hydrogels endowed with fast reversible sol-gel transition. We started with the synthesis of three cationic azobenzenes (AZO A, B, and C) and then incorporated them in sodium alginate (SA) to obtain photoresponsive supramolecular hydrogels (SMHGs). The photoresponsive properties of the azobenzenes were investigated by UV-Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Upon irradiation with 365 nm UV light, the azobenzenes demonstrated efficient trans-to-cis isomerization, with complete isomerization occurring within seconds. The return to the trans form took several hours, with AZO C exhibiting the fastest return, possibly due to higher trans isomer stability. In the photoresponsive SMHGs, the minimum gelation concentration (MGC) of azobenzenes was determined for different compositions, indicating that small amounts of azobenzenes could induce gel formation, particularly in 5 wt% SA. Upon exposure to 365 nm UV light, the SMHGs exhibited reversible gel-sol transitions, underscoring their photoresponsive nature. This research offers valuable insights into the synthesis and photoresponsive properties of cationic, water-soluble azobenzenes, as well as their potential application in the development of photoresponsive hydrogels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a73865c25fc5bd92237b53c33d63f51cd48eb77288b1790ced5bbdd2d01264d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
