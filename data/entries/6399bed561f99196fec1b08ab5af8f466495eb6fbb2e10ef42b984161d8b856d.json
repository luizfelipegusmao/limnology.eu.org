{"title":"Unveiling the Interrelationship between Eating Patterns and Metabolic Syndrome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0846/v1","date":1718192701000,"content":"Given that metabolic syndrome, along with obesity as one of its key components, remains one of the leading yet insufficiently addressed public health issues, what contributes to the development and maintenance of the disorder must certainly attract the attention of professionals and scientists. Precisely because of this phenomenon, eating patterns associated with metabolic syndrome should be studied and attempts should be made to uncover patterns in occurrence. The aim of this study is to review the literature and consider the connection between metabolic syndrome and eating patterns such as emotional and compulsive eating, as well as through the lens of food addiction. Furthermore, we have attempted to uncover the role of psychiatry and psychotherapy in the treatment of metabolic syndrome and delve into the complexity of recognizing these patterns and emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the treatment of metabolic syndrome.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6399bed561f99196fec1b08ab5af8f466495eb6fbb2e10ef42b984161d8b856d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
