{"title":"Parallel evolution in an island archipelago revealed by genomic sequencing of Hipposideros leaf-nosed bats","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/6/1183/7624587?rss=1","date":1709856000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Body size is a key morphological attribute, often used to delimit species boundaries among closely related taxa. But body size can evolve in parallel, reaching similar final states despite independent evolutionary and geographic origins, leading to faulty assumptions of evolutionary history. Here, we document parallel evolution in body size in the widely distributed leaf-nosed bat genus <span>Hipposideros</span>, which has misled both taxonomic and evolutionary inference. We sequenced reduced representation genomic loci and measured external morphological characters from three closely related species from the Solomon Islands archipelago, delimited by body size. Species tree reconstruction confirms the paraphyly of two morphologically designated species. The nonsister relationship between large-bodied <span>H. dinops</span> lineages found on different islands indicates that large-bodied ecomorphs have evolved independently at least twice in the history of this radiation. A lack of evidence for gene flow between sympatric, closely related taxa suggests the rapid evolution of strong reproductive isolating barriers between morphologically distinct populations. Our results position Solomon Islands <span>Hipposideros</span> as a novel vertebrate system for studying the repeatability of parallel evolution under natural conditions. We conclude by offering testable hypotheses for how geography and ecology could be mediating the repeated evolution of large-bodied <span>Hipposideros</span> lineages in the Solomon Islands.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"4112ef8261380c450c95d00f0b655aaef07350f32b3d458f51a25565f6d63d40","category":"Environment"}
