{"title":"Why should scientists lead? To underpin policy on marine and polar ecosystems","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/5/823/7641130?rss=1","date":1712275200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>I recount my personal history, beginning as a young fisherman, becoming an academic fisheries biologist, and ultimately a leader of institutions dedicated to marine and polar research, higher education, and advising policymakers. After my dissertation in the early 1990s, I embarked on an active research career at the Institute of Marine Research (IMR) in Bergen, Norway, developing a sonar method to estimate the abundance of schooling, pelagic fish. My career then transitioned to middle leadership—15 years as Section Leader and Research Director at IMR—followed by &gt;10 years as a top leader for The University Centre in Svalbard, the National Institute of Nutrition and Seafood Research, and finally the Norwegian Polar Institute. I describe the major challenges, opportunities, and processes these leadership roles have entailed. I hope to send a positive message about the influential role of science, and the necessity of clear communication of results and advice at a time when there is a sense of urgency.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"116e4dfe23f1728d64d87318751602d4d7d1690061e2dbd94e3e7119efe2d42e","category":"Environment"}
