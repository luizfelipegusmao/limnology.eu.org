{"title":"Reconciling Environmental Safety and Economic Feasibility: A Review of Soil Fluorine Management Strategies in South Korea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1403/v2","date":1720684786000,"content":"Soil naturally contains fluorine, but concerns arise when its levels or bioavailability are increased by human activities or specific compounds. South Korea faces challenges in regulating soil fluorine pollution despite implementing stricter total fluorine standards than many developed countries. Moreover, these regulations can be economically unfeasible because of the naturally high background levels of fluorine in the soil in Korea. This review explores the global landscape of soil fluorine management strategies and examines potential solutions that reconcile environmental protection with economic concerns. We recommend a shift towards regulating specific and hazardous fluorine compounds rather than total content, and prioritizing remediation efforts based on assessments of bioavailable fluorine. This approach may help Korea establish a more effective and sustainable strategy for managing soil fluorine pollution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"334da87e47560ef5b3933418d8ab2a5bb3038609c36e2f7046b20c076011a40a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
