{"title":"Peroxymonosulfate Activation by Fe@N Co-doped BC for the Degradation of Sulfamethoxazole: The Key Role of Pyrrolic N","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0831/v1","date":1725973103000,"content":"In this study, Fe, N co-doped biochar (Fe@N co-doped BC) was synthesized by   carbonization-pyrolysis method and used as carbocatalysts to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal. In the Fe@N co-doped BC/PMS system, the degradation rate of SMX (10.0 mg⋅L−1) was 90.2% within 40 min under optimal conditions. The radical quenching experiments, and electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis suggested that sulfate radicals (SO4•−), hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and singlet oxygen (1O2) participated in the degradation process. After the reaction, the proportion of pyrrolic N apparently decreased from 57.9% to 27.1%. Pyrrolic N served as active sites to break the inert carbon network structure and promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs). Besides, pyrrolic N showed stronger interaction with PMS and significantly reduced the activation energy required for the reaction (∆G = 23.54 kcal/mol). The utilization potentiality of Fe@N co-doped BC was systematically evaluated in terms of its reusability, and selectivity to organics. Finally, the intermediates of SMX were also detected.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"124d60421b513bf7c643b1316236bb726a141ca9e12a9eff8892a3c2b3cff0fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
