{"title":"Reverberating Action Potentials and the Emergence of Short Circuit Propagation in Gliosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1476/v1","date":1718946993000,"content":"This study explores the intriguing phenomenon of action potentials reverberating and propagating in high-resistance tissues, such as gliosis, leading to the emergence of short circuits within the brain. Gliosis, characterized by increased tissue resistance, presents a unique environment for electrical signals. My research investigates the possible mechanisms behind these reverberations and their role in the creation of self-empowering short circuits that can potentially affect the entire brain's functionality. Understanding these processes may have significant implications for the treatment and management of neurological disorders associated with gliosis and abnormal electrical activity in the brain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7392bc4626751077a15dde0c84ae17dad1a436142f210edf638ecd1ca400c1ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
