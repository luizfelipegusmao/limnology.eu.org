It has been caused by both fundamental and application research reasons covering new quantum nano-optics effects, electromagnetically induced transparency (EMT), chemical dynamics and reactivity, and other novel issues. Such an interesting physical phenomenon associated with the Rabi splitting and creation of new hybrid modes has been mostly studied by conventional reflection/transmission optical spectroscopic methods. However, using these techniques not all modes can be generated and observed. Therefore, there are attempts to study these coupling effects by application of electron beams capable of generating sub-radiant dark modes and being suitable for their detection by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). To do it both at sufficient spatial (&lt; 10 nm) and energy (â‰¤ 10<sup>0</sup> eV) resolutions, STEM-EELS systems with monochromatized probe electron beams have to be used.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"94add865cc166ca341dbb0d8ec04b3c311e644f68dfcbe58aad9219b6df3c728","category":"Environment"}
