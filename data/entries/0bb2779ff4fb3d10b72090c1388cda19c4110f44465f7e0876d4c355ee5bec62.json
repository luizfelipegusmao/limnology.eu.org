However, generating high-intensity low-frequency acoustic waves in open space is difficult. In this paper, a low-frequency acoustic generator with a resonant cavity used to enhance the acoustic intensity in open space was developed, which is an aerodynamic acoustic generator to radiates a high-intensity acoustic wave of 52Hz. Some experiments were carried out to measure this generatorâ€™s internal flow field and radiated acoustic field characteristics, including the propagation characteristics at 100m. The experimental results show that the resonant enhancement effect is presented near the predetermined resonance frequency, and the enhanced value is about 4dB. The acoustic intensity for 52Hz at 1m position is 124dB. By combining the Helmholtz resonator with the airflow modulator, the airflow resonance in the resonator enhances the air pressure pulsation inside the chamber and increases the disturbance of acoustic radiation to the air. So as to improve the sound intensity and radiation efficiency in the low-frequency range.","author":"Baoguo Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0bb2779ff4fb3d10b72090c1388cda19c4110f44465f7e0876d4c355ee5bec62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
