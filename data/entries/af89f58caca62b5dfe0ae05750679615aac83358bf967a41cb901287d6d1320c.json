{"title":"Synergistic cytotoxicity of olive leaf extract-loaded lipid nanocarriers combined with Newcastle disease virus against cervical cancer cells","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308599","date":1723644000000,"content":"<p>by Arash Golalipour, Ali Mohammadi, Saeid Hosseinzadeh, Alireza Soltani, Vahid Erfani-Moghadam</p>\r\n\r\nDespite recent medical progress, cervical cancer remains a major global health concern for women. Current standard treatments have limitations such as non-specific toxicity that necessitate development of safer and more effective therapeutic strategies. This research evaluated the combinatorial effects of olive leaf extract (OLE), rich in anti-cancer polyphenols, and the oncolytic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) against human cervical cancer cells. OLE was efficiently encapsulated (&gt;94% loading) within MF59 lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs; contains Precirol as NLC-P, contains Lecithin as NLC-L) to enhance stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery. Physicochemical analysis confirmed successful encapsulation of OLE within nanoparticles smaller than 150 nm. In vitro cytotoxicity assays demonstrated significantly higher toxicity of the OLE-loaded nanoparticle formulations on HeLa cancer cells versus HDF normal cells (P&lt;0.05). MF59 achieved the highest encapsulation efficiency, while NLC-P had the best drug release profile. NDV selectively infected and killed HeLa cells versus HDF cells. Notably, combining NDV with OLE-loaded nanoparticles led to significantly enhanced synergistic cytotoxicity against cancer cells (P&lt;0.05), with NLC-P <sub>(OLE)</sub> and NDV producing the strongest effects. Apoptosis and cell cycle analyses confirmed the increased anti-cancer activity of the combinatorial treatment, which induced cell cycle arrest. This study provides evidence that co-delivery of OLE-loaded lipid nanoparticles and NDV potentiates anti-cancer activity against cervical cancer cells in vitro through a synergistic mechanism, warranting further development as a promising alternative cervical cancer therapy.","author":"Arash Golalipour","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"af89f58caca62b5dfe0ae05750679615aac83358bf967a41cb901287d6d1320c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
