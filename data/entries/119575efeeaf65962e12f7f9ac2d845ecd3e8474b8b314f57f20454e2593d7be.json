{"title":"Dancing in the purple rain: color affinity and oviposition choices in Aedes sierrensis (Diptera: Culicidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/1/77/7505695?rss=1","date":1704240000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The western tree hole mosquito, <span>Aedes sierrensis</span> (Ludlow) (Diptera: Clucidae), is a pestiferous mosquito with a range extending over the entire pacific seaboard and into portions of the intermountain west. As a peridomestic heartworm vector, it demands at least some level of surveillance to understand its abundance. However, the species is refractory to a majority of conventional vector surveillance approaches for tracking mosquitoes. To find more options for <span>Aedes sierrensis</span> surveillance, a variety of oviposition attractants were evaluated in arena-style choice assays using colony reared adults. A range of infusion treatments (e.g., alfalfa, oak, and beetroot) were examined and then combined with investigations of liquid color as well as ovicup color and entryway position. These studies revealed that <span>Ae. sierrensis</span> have an affinity for purple coloration, plain water, and larger entryway sizes for oviposition cups. A prototype ovicup was 3D-printed using purple filament and multiple types of entryways, and used to re-test infusion waters. No particular attraction differences were detected after normalizing for purple color. Comparisons to black 3D-printed cups yielded surprising observations that male mosquitoes also aggregated on purple cups while females sheltered, but not necessarily oviposited, in black cups. Although this was only a laboratory-based assessment, these studies provide useful information for future field trials of potential oviposition traps for surveillance of <span>Ae. sierrensis</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"119575efeeaf65962e12f7f9ac2d845ecd3e8474b8b314f57f20454e2593d7be","category":"Environment"}
