Esaifan, Loai M. Saadah, Khawla Abu Hammour, Rana K. Abu Farha</p>\r\nObjective <p>Differential effects of linagliptin and vildagliptin may help us personalize treatment for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The current study compares the effect of these drugs on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in an artificial neural network (ANN) model.</p> Methods <p>Patients with T2DM who received either vildagliptin or linagliptin, with predefined exclusion criteria, qualified for the study. Two input variable datasets were constructed: with or without imputation for missing values. The primary outcome was HbA1c readings between 3 to 12 months or the reduction in HbA1c levels.</p> Results <p>The cohort comprised 191 individuals (92 vildagliptin and 99 linagliptin). Linagliptin group had significantly higher disease burden. For imputed dataset, HbA1c was lower with linagliptin at 3 to 12 months (7.442 ± 0.408 vs. 7.626 ± 0.408, P &lt; 0.001). However, there was a small yet significant difference in HbA1c reduction favoring vildagliptin over linagliptin (-1.123 ± 0.033 vs. -1.111 ± 0.043, P &lt; 0.001). LDL level, uric acid, and the drug group were identified as predictors for HbA1c levels. In the non-imputed dataset HbA1c at 3 to 12 months was lower with linagliptin (median ± IQR: 7.489 ± 0.467 vs. 7.634 ± 0.467, P-value &lt; 0.001). However, both linagliptin and vildagliptin exhibited similar reductions in HbA1c levels (both median ± IQR of -1.07 ± 0.02). Predictors for HbA1c levels included eGFR level and the drug group.</p> Conclusion <p>Linagliptin effectively lowers HbA1c levels more than vildagliptin including in patients with comorbidities. DPP4-I choice is a constant predictor of HbA1c in all models.</p>","author":"Hanin A.
