{"title":"Experimental and numerical investigation on the reinforced concrete boundary beam-wall system subjected to axial compression","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301622","date":1713362400000,"content":"<p>by Dae-Jin Kim, Jin-Ju Han, Seung-Il Kim</p>\r\n\r\nThis paper proposes a reinforced concrete (RC) boundary beam-wall system that requires less construction material and a smaller floor height compared to the conventional RC transfer girder system. The structural performance of this system subjected to axial compression was evaluated by performing a structural test on four specimens of 1/2 scale. In addition, three-dimensional nonlinear finite element analysis was also performed to verify the effectiveness of the boundary beam-wall system. Three test parameters such as the lower wall length-to-upper wall length ratio, lower wall thickness, and stirrup details of the lower wall were considered. The load-displacement curve was plotted for each specimen and its failure mode was identified. The test results showed that decrease in the lower wall length-to-upper wall length ratio significantly reduced the peak strength of the boundary beam-wall system and difference in upper and lower wall thicknesses resulted in lateral bending caused by eccentricity in the out-of-plane direction. Additionally, incorporating cross-ties and reducing stirrup spacing in the lower wall significantly improved initial stiffness and peak strength, effectively minimizing stress concentration.","author":"Dae-Jin Kim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"95831fd29b4c41546a15512fe7bf4766716d24733b0e9d31d31c68242dbe2440","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
