{"title":"The Taxonomic Status of Genera within the Fabeae (Vicieae), with a Special Focus on Pisum","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0495/v1","date":1717763551000,"content":"The taxonomy of the Fabeae (Vicieae) has long been problematic, but an analysis by Schaefer et al in 2012 gave an exceptionally clear view of the tribe and noted the possibility that some nomenclatural adjustments may be required at some future date. These authors suggested several options, expressing some preferences. However, there has been a recent change to formally accepted names implementing one of these possibilities, but without any additional relevant information. This change seems unjustified and unhelpful. We therefore present an argument for the retention, or re-instatement, of the genera Pisum, Vavilovia and Lens until such time as new data supports this requirement and there is no nomenclatural solution that is both accurate and convenient.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c924e3adda2ef0b0003ce43b70e16be3dec622829a075b638df5f4213073d06c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
