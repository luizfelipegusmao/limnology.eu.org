One of the main purposes for the development of this methodology is to use this type of samples in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) chips for <span>in situ</span> transmission electron microscopy heating/biasing experiments, concomitant with maintaining the mechanical integrity and the absence of contamination of samples. This is accomplished through a modification of the standard FIB procedure for the preparation of lamellas, the adaptation of conventional chips, as well as the specific transfer of the lamella onto the chips. This method is versatile enough to be implemented in most commercially available FIB systems and MEMS chips.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c38be2731041f1e661312f4c1a554951023da318bb01315ec44cdd0938d80182","category":"Environment"}
