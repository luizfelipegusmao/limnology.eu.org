{"title":"Validity and reliability of the Balance Error Score System (BESS) Thai version in patients with chronic non-specific neck pain","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301386","date":1711634400000,"content":"<p>by Arisa Leungbootnak, Rungthip Puntumetakul, Thiwaphon Chatprem, Surachai Sae-Jung, Rose Boucaut</p>\r\nBackground <p>Neck pain has been found to affect the somatosensory system, which can lead to impaired balance control. To assess the balance of patients with neck pain and other conditions, the balance error scoring system (BESS) is commonly used as a static balance measurement tool. However, this tool is seldom used in Thailand due to its English language format.</p> Objective <p>To translate and determine the content, convergent validity, and reliability of a Thai version of the BESS tool.</p> Material and methods <p>A process of cross-cultural adaptation was utilized to translate BESS into a Thai version, called BESS-TH. To assess content validity, five physical therapy lecturers specializing in the musculoskeletal field used BESS to measure balance in participants with neck pain. For the convergent validity process, 130 patients diagnosed with chronic non-specific neck pain (CNSNP) were randomly assessed using four static balance tests (BESS, Single-leg balance test (SLBT), Romberg test, and Tandem stance test). For reliability, two assessors with varying years of work experience independently assessed videos of the participants twice using the BESS-TH, with a minimum 7-day interval between assessments.</p> Results <p>The BESS-TH used to assess balance of patients with neck pain demonstrated acceptable content validity (index of item objective congruence (IOC) = 0.87). The Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient was calculated between the BESS-TH and three other measures: the SLBT with eyes open and eyes closed, the Romberg test with eyes open and eyes closed, and the Tandem stance test with eyes open and Tandem stance test with eyes closed. The values obtained were as follows: -0.672, -0.712, -0.367, -0.529, -0.570, and -0.738, respectively. The inter-rater and intra-rater reliability were 0.922 (95% CI = 0.864–0.956) and 0.971 (95% CI = 0.950–0.983), respectively. Minimum detectable change (MDC) for the total BESS score of inter-rater and intra-rater reliability were 7.16 and 4.34 points, respectively.</p> Conclusion <p>The BESS-Thai version was acceptable, reliable, and valid for evaluating balance performance in patients with CNSNP. This tool can be used and applied to clinically evaluate postural control in Thailand.</p>","author":"Arisa Leungbootnak","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b6082b535a81b8c0dc9599ea4afa2681d7982b5730428cfc1df786eca55fa796","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
