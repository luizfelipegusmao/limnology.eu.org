{"title":"Enhancing Reliability and Efficiency: An ASHRAE Level 2 Energy Audit of a Regional Hospital","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1664/v1","date":1721634450000,"content":"This study investigates the energy profile of a regional hospital in North America using an ASHRAE Level 2 Energy Audit. The audit aimed to assess the efficiency of existing systems, identify areas for improvement, and recommend cost-effective measures to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact. The analysis revealed a well-maintained heating system with efficient boilers. However, a critical concern emerged regarding operational risks due to the lack of redundancy in the cooling system. To address this vulnerability, the study recommends installing an air-cooled chiller for increased operational resilience. The economic feasibility of proposed improvements was evaluated, highlighting the balance between initial investment and long-term savings in energy costs and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The findings contribute to the discourse on sustainable healthcare practices, emphasizing the importance of energy audits, strategic planning, and redundancy measures for optimized performance and environmental responsibility in hospitals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d177c5bebabd2ab14136a6b553a9c79c512ea6e8b91bb856f7962c510cc98f95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
