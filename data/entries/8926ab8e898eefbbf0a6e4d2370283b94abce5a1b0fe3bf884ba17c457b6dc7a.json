{"title":"Bacterial Infections Features in Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis: Review of a 2016&ndash;2021 Cohort","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0936/v1","date":1723552426000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Bacterial infections (BI) are a major cause of mortality in patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH); however, only a few studies have investigated BI in AH in the last decade. Therefore, we aimed to assess the features and outcomes of BI in patients with AH. Methods: This observational descriptive study included patients with AH admitted to a tertiary academic hospital between 2016â€“2021. Clinical and complete microbiological data were recorded and complications, including acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), and mortality over 90-days were compared between infected and non-infected patients. Results: Overall, 115 patients with AH were recruited and 75 had severe AH; among them, 66 started corticosteroid treatment. We identified 69 cases of BI in 44 patients; the incidence of BI at hospital discharge was 32.2%, which reached 38.2% at 90 days. The predominant infection site was the chest (35%). Among the identified bacteria (52.1%), half were gram-positive and half gram-negative. A low rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria (14%) was also noted. Infected patients during hospitalization (n=37) exhibited higher rates of hepatic decompensation and ACLF p=0.001) and lower survival (81.8% vs. 95.8%, p=0.015) than did non-infected patients (n=78). In-hospital infected patients (n=22) exhibited worse survival (72.7%) than did those infected upon admission (93.3%) or non-infected patients (94.9%) (p=0.009). Corticosteroid-treated patients displayed a nonsignificant increase in the total number of BI; however, without greater mortality. Conclusions: BI were common in our cohort of patients with AH. Patients with in-hospital infections commonly experienced serious complications, including high ACLF and death rates. Infections diagnosed upon admission were treated without affecting survival.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8926ab8e898eefbbf0a6e4d2370283b94abce5a1b0fe3bf884ba17c457b6dc7a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
