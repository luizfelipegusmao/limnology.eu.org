{"title":"Extracellular Vesicles: The Next Generation of Biomarkers and Treatment for Central Nervous System Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1717/v1","date":1714103728000,"content":"It has been widely established that the characterization of extracellular vesicles (EVs), particularly small EVs (sEVs), shed by different cell types into biofluids, helps identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies are also exploring the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles naturally enriched with therapeutic microRNAs and proteins for treating various diseases. Besides, EVs released by various neural cells play a crucial function in the modulation of signal transmission in the brain in physiological conditions. However, in pathological conditions, such EVs can facilitate the spread of pathological proteins from one brain region to the other. On the other hand, analysis of EVs in biofluids can identify sensitive biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and disease progression. This review discusses the potential therapeutic use of stem cell-derived EVs in several central nervous system diseases. It lists their differences and similarities and confers various studies exploring EVs as biomarkers. Further advances in EV research in the coming years will likely lead to the routine use of EVs in therapeutic settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"567576bcd990900a82f8d09e6039f723ca8297052380d8ac6c03f89c83b55b7e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
