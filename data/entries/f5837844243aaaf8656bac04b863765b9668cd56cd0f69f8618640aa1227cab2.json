{"title":"Advances in Targeted Therapy: Addressing Resistance to BTK Inhibition in B‐Cell Lymphoid Malignancies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1534/v1","date":1721316245000,"content":"B-cell lymphoid malignancies is a heterogeneous group of hematologic cancers, where Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors have received FDA approval for several subtypes. The first-in-class covalent BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, binds to the C481 amino acid residue to block the BTK enzyme and prevent the downstream signaling. Resistance to covalent BTK inhibitors can occur through mutations at the BTK binding site (C481S) but also other BTK sites and the phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCγ2) resulting in downstream signaling. To bypass the C481S mutation, non-covalent BTK inhibitors, such as pirtobrutinib, were developed and are active against both wild-type and the C481S mutation. In this review, we discuss the molecular and genetic mechanisms which contribute to acquisition of resistance to covalent and non-covalent BTK inhibitors. In addition, we discuss the new emerging class of BTK degraders, which utilize the evolution of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) to degrade the BTK protein and constitute an important avenue of overcoming resistance. The moving landscape of resistance to BTK inhibitors and the development of new therapeutic strategies highlight the ongoing advances, that are being made towards the pursue of cure of B-cell lymphoid malignancies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5837844243aaaf8656bac04b863765b9668cd56cd0f69f8618640aa1227cab2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
