{"title":"Enhanced Electron Backscatter Correction for Electron Probe Microanalysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.088/7719396?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) is an element identification technique which generates and records the wavelength of released characteristic x-ray radiation from a given sample. For a quantitative measurement of the relative proportion of elements, we need to correct for the backscattering of incident electrons out of the sample. These lost electrons cannot produce further x-rays, so a sample with significant backscattering will have lower intensity characteristic peaks, underestimating the amount of the element in the sample. To account for this, microanalysts calculate a backscatter correction in terms of an (iteratively determined) average atomic number Z¯ for the specimen. A typical approach, dating back to the dawn of the field [<a href=\"#ozae044.088-B1\">1</a>], uses the mass concentration ci to weight components in calculating the average Z¯. This is a flawed approach that works best when constituent elements have approximately the same ratio A/Zof atomic weight to atomic number [<a href=\"#ozae044.088-B2\">2</a>]. Low-<span>Z</span> elements, however, have largely varying A/Z ratios: H, He, C, N, and O are almost exactly A/Z=2, but the A/Z ratios of Li, Be, B, and F range between 2.111 and 2.313. We have shown previously [<a href=\"#ozae044.088-B3\">3</a>] that a superior averaging technique for a compound is</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"65b9e66fbaf1afce609fe2234b53915f0ddc6bc9e58fc8d517ce32517e243e68","category":"Environment"}
