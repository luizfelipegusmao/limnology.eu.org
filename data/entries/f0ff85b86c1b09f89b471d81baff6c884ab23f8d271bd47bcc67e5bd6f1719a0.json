Earth system model analysis of how astronomical forcing is imprinted onto the marine geological record: The role of the inorganic (carbonate) carbon cycle and feedbacks, <i>Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology</i>, 36, e2020PA004090. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2020PA004090\">https://doi.org/10.1029/2020PA004090</a>. The above article, published online on 17 September 2021, in Wiley Online Library (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wileyonlinelibrary.com\">wileyonlinelibrary.com</a>), has been retracted by agreement between the authors; the journal Editor-in-Chief, Matthew Huber; the American Geophysical Union; and Wiley Periodicals LLC. The retraction has been agreed upon following the authors identification of an error in the insolation code, based on a previously unknown error in the legacy code inherited from a widely used family of climate models, which resulted in a mistake in the orbital calculation affecting the conclusions of their work. The authors have also notified the maintainers of the underlying code.</p>\n<p>The authors have revised the above article after correcting the errors in the insolation code and re-running the simulations. A description of the corrections to the code and detailed evaluation of the resulting insolation maps can be found in the republished article and its revised supporting information. This includes a comparison between the original and corrected daily and annual mean insolation, and those calculated from the online tool provided in Laskar et al. (2004). Because the calculated insolation is integral to the main results and interpretation of the simulations in this study, and because the erroneous insolation code may have been used in other studies, a retraction and new publication was the mutual agreement.</p>\n<p>The new manuscript reflecting the corrected information is now republished here: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2023pa004826\">https://doi.org/10.1029/2023PA004826</a>.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Wiley: Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"69a881e15689378344e2f544f17d899603864e0695b4208841b63784555058e2","entryHash":"f0ff85b86c1b09f89b471d81baff6c884ab23f8d271bd47bcc67e5bd6f1719a0","category":"Environment"}
