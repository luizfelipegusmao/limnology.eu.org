The dynamic membrane showed high membrane flux and high suspended sludge retention.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Anaerobic co-digestion using an anaerobic dynamic membrane bioreactor (AnDMBR) can separate the sludge retention time and hydraulic retention time, retaining the biomass for efficient degradation and the use of less expensive large pore-size membrane materials and more sustainable dynamic membranes (DMs). Therefore, anaerobic co-digestion of toilet blackwater (BW) and kitchen waste (KW) using an AnDMBR was hypothesized to increase the potential for co-digestion. Here, the efficiency and stability of AnDMBR in anaerobic co-digestion of toilet BW and KW were investigated. DM morphology and structural characteristics, filtration properties, and composition, as well as membrane contamination and membrane regeneration mechanisms, were investigated. Average daily biogas yields of the reactor in two membrane cycles before and after cleaning were 788.67 and 746.09 ml/g volatile solids, with average methane content of 66.64% and 67.27% and average COD removal efficiencies of 82.03% and 80.96%, respectively. The results showed that the bioreactor obtained good performance and stability. During the stabilization phase of the DM operation, the flux was maintained between 43.65 and 65.15 L/m<sup>2</sup>/h. DM was mainly composed of organic and inorganic elements. Off-line cleaning facilitated DM regulation and regeneration, restoring new Anaerobic morphology and structure.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nHigh efficiency co-digestion of BW and KW was realized in the DMBR system.\nAverage daily biogas yields before and after membrane cleaning were 788.67 and 746.09 ml/g volatile solids.\nOff-line cleaning facilitated DM regulation and regeneration as well as system stability.\nThe flux was maintained between 43.65 and 65.15 L/m<sup>2</sup>/h during operation.\n</p>","author":"Xincheng Zhao, \nGuixia Ji, \nRunshan Li, \nJiao Li, \nQingchen Meng, \nChengyang Wu, \nHongbo Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"341809fbe116aad82410164dc90e20d352ee76c2cd64860a7343d54794126458","category":"Environment"}
