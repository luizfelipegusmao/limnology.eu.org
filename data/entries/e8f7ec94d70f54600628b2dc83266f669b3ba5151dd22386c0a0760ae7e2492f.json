{"title":"Validation of the compassionate engagement and action scales, compassion scale, and Sussex-Oxford compassion scales in a French-Canadian sample","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305776","date":1719237600000,"content":"<p>by Kyla Brophy, Matthew Emery, Ceilagh MacDonald, Catherine Isadora Côté, Annett Körner</p>\r\n\r\nCompassion towards oneself and towards others has been associated with positive psychological outcomes, however, research is limited by the availability of valid psychometric measures, particularly in languages other than English. The current study translated (English to French) and validated the following measures: the Compassionate Engagement and Action Scales (CEAS), assessing self-compassion (CEAS-SC), compassion to others (CEAS-TO), and compassion from others (CEAS-FROM); the Compassion Scale (CS); and the Sussex-Oxford Compassion Scales for Self (SOCS-S) and Others (SOCS-O). French-speaking participants were recruited online (<i>N</i> = 384) and completed the translated measures as well as questionnaires assessing self-compassion, depression, anxiety, stress, insecure attachment, mindfulness, and well-being. Confirmatory Factor Analysis supports the original factor structures proposed for the CEAS-FROM (two-factor hierarchical), CS (four-factor hierarchical), SOCS-S and SOCS-O (five-factor hierarchical), with alternate factor structures proposed for CEAS-SC (three-factor) and CEAS-TO (two-factor). Results showed good internal consistency and convergent validity for all scales, supporting the use of total scores for the translated measures.","author":"Kyla Brophy","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e8f7ec94d70f54600628b2dc83266f669b3ba5151dd22386c0a0760ae7e2492f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
