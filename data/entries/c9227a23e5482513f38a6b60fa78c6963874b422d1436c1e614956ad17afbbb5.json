{"title":"The Imaginary Universe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202212.0045/v9","date":1679924792000,"content":"Imaginary dimensions in physics require an imaginary set of base Planck units and some negative parameter $c_n$ corresponding to the speed of light in vacuum $c$. The second, negative fine-structure constant $\\alpha_2^{-1} \\approx -140.178$ present in Fresnel coefficients for the normal incidence of electromagnetic radiation on monolayer graphene leads to the imaginary Planck units. Furthermore, it sets $c_n \\approx -3.06 \\times 10^8~\\text{[m/s]}$. It follows that electric charges are the same in real and imaginary dimensions. Neutron stars and white dwarfs, objects emitting perfect black-body radiation, need energy exceeding their mass-energy equivalence ratios. Complex energies are defined in terms of real and imaginary Planck units. Their imaginary parts, inaccessible for direct observation, store the excess of these energies. It follows that black holes are fundamentally uncharged, charged micro neutron stars and white dwarfs with masses lower than $5.7275 \\times 10^{-10}~[\\text{kg}]$ are unphysical, and the radii of white dwarfs' cores are limited to $R_{\\text{WD}} &lt; 6.7933~G M_{\\text{WD}}/c^2$. It is conjectured that the maximum atomic number $Z=238$. A black-body object is in the equilibrium of complex energies of masses, charges, and wavelengths if its radius $R_\\text{eq} \\approx 2.7665~G M_{\\text{BBO}}/c^2$, which corrects the value of the photon sphere radius $R_{\\text{ps}}=3G M/c^2$, taking into account the value(s) of the fine-structure constant(s), which is otherwise neglected in general relativity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c9227a23e5482513f38a6b60fa78c6963874b422d1436c1e614956ad17afbbb5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
