{"title":"Multiple ornaments: trade-offs and redundancy in signalling functions in male and female varied tits (Sittiparus varius)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/biolinnean/blad150/7334317?rss=1","date":1698710400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Signals conveyed by ornaments can be indicators in the process of sexual selection. Specifically, signals may be superimposed on each other to represent an individualâ€™s quality, convey different information, or offer redundant information. As much of the research in this area has focused on relationships between diverse signals in males, those of females have largely been overlooked. From 2022 to 2023, we tested whether three traits, namely acoustic (song display) and visual ornaments (patch size and carotenoid-based plumage coloration), and morphology (wing and tail length), were interrelated in males and whether visual ornaments and morphology were interrelated in females in a wild population of varied tits (<span>Sittiparus varius</span>). We found that males with brighter and more reddish plumage sang at lower maximum and minimum frequencies, with narrower bandwidths and lower frequency peaks. Similarly, a negative correlation between tail length and carotenoid-based plumage coloration was observed in both sexes. Furthermore, a positive relationship was found between signals within traits. These results highlight the trade-offs in signals between different traits, as well as the consistency within the same traits.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"84e80ad6648fd4f85d19088c92dcd9b20b3a163002332f36d1fd6c9748112a61","category":"Environment"}
