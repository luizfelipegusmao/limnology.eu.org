{"title":"Molecular Confirmation, Epidemiology, and Pathophysiology of Ehrlichia canis Prevalence in Eastern India","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1512/v1","date":1724222397000,"content":"The present study aimed to undertake a detailed investigation of pathological epidemiology and molecular confirmation of Ehrlichia canis among pet dogs in smart city Bhubaneswar, Odisha, a state in eastern India. A total of 178 dogs were screened for Ehrlichiosis on the basis of history, clinical signs, blood, and buffy coat smear examination, resulting in only 56 dogs (31.46%) screening positive. The epidemiological study recorded an increase in incidences among dogs less than one year of age (41%), males (68%), German Shepherds (25%), dogs more than 20 kg body weight (75%), summer months (55%) and dogs housed on pukka houses with exposure to the outside (59%). The majority of the infected dogs had a history of tick infestation (79%) at some point in their life. Clinical signs showed non-typical manifestations like fever, lethargy, diarrhoea, epistaxis, hind limb edema, and corneal opacity. Haematological studies revealed anaemia and thrombocytopenia along with neutrophilia with relative lymphopenia and monocytosis. A decreasing trend was observed in the levels of total protein and albumin with an increase in the levels of globulin, AST, ALT, BUN, and creatinine. The ultrasonography studies revealed hepatosplenomegaly along with hyper-echogenicity in various organs. Pro-teinuria and haematuria were consistent, along with the presence of bile salts in the urine of affected dogs.  Molecular confirmation from n-type PCR data using Ehrlichia-specific primers targeting p28 gene (843 bp) was done, and the identified gene sequences submitted to NCBI databases have accession numbers OQ383671-OQ383674 and OP886674-OP886677. Ticks collected from dogs were identified morphologically through microscopy and scanning electron microscopy as Rhipicephalus sanguineus.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d0c0ecaa86bc67b976dfb6dbf2b8dbcdb18cb7d3fa3816e1552c2c84114e3d6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
