{"title":"Optimization of Enzymatic Assisted Extraction of Bioactive Compounds from Olea Europaea Leaves","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1970/v1","date":1716975613000,"content":"Nowadays circular economy trend drives researchers in the recovery of various bioactive compounds from agri-food by-products. Enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE) is shown as an innovative green technology for the effective extraction of various phytochemicals from agri-food section by-products, therefore this study aimed to evaluate the application of EAE as green technology to obtain extracts from olive leaves (Olea europaea) for potential industrial production. EAE was conducted under various enzyme dose combinations, and incubation time (120 min). Obtained extracts were characterized in terms of total polyphenols (TP) and Total Antioxidant Activity (AA). Firstly, the enzyme synergistic effect in enzymatic extraction of polyphenols was evaluated. TP optimal extraction conditions (468.19 mg GAE/L) were achieved after EAE (50-50%) and for AA (69.85 AA%). According to the above results, a second experimental part occurred for the incubation time (min.) and enzyme dose (mL) of optimal extraction conditions of olive leaves. Results indicated EAE as an excellent choice for green extraction of polyphenols from the olive leaves.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6eccd2ebad59a0cef1f050896e4598fa14241331d062813d5eac444d7e7b372","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
