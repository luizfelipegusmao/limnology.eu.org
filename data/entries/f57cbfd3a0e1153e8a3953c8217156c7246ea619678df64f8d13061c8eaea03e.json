{"title":"Some Aspects of Differential Topology of Subcartesian Spaces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1490/v1","date":1724289129000,"content":"In this paper we investigate the differential topological properties of  a subclass of singular space--subcarteisan spaces. First, we get further result on partition of unity for differential spaces. Second, we establish the tubular neighborhood theorem for subcartesian spaces with constant structural dimension. Third, we generalize the concept of Morse functions on smooth manifolds to differential  spaces. For  subcartesian space  with constant structural dimension, we provide examples of Morse functions; With the assumption that the subcartesian space can be embedded as a bounded subset of an Euclidean space, we prove that smooth bounded functions on this space can be approximated by Morse functions; We study the infinitesimal stability of Morse functions on subcartesian spaces. Classical results on Morse functions on  smooth manifolds can be treated directly as corollaries of our results here.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f57cbfd3a0e1153e8a3953c8217156c7246ea619678df64f8d13061c8eaea03e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
