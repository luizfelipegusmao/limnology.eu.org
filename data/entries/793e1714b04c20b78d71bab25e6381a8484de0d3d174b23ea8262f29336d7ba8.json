{"title":"Exploring S-Benzyl-L-Cysteine as an O-acetylserine(thiol) Ly-Ase Inhibitor: Effects on Growth, Photosynthesis, and Oxidative Balance of Ipomoea grandifolia Plants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0608/v1","date":1720425722000,"content":"L-cysteine, a precursor of essential components for plant growth, is synthesized by the cysteine synthase complex, which includes O-acetylserine(thiol) lyase (OAS-TL) and serine acetyltrans-ferase. In this work, we investigated how S-benzyl-L-cysteine (SBC), an OAS-TL inhibitor, affects the growth, photosynthesis, and oxidative stress of Ipomoea grandifolia plants. SBC impaired gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence, indicating damage that compromised photosynthesis and reduced plant growth. Important parameters such as light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (PNmax), light saturation point (LSP), maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (Vcmax), electron transport rate (J), and triose phosphate utilization (TPU) decreased as a result. The quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry (Ï•PSII) and the electron transport rate through PSII (ETR) also decreased, as did the stomatal conductance (gs) and the photochemical quenching coefficient (qP). Additionally, SBC decreased the maximum fluorescence yield (Fm), variable fluorescence (Fv), and chlorophyll index, indicating possible damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. SBC triggered oxidative stress by increasing reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and conjugated dienes. We hypothesize that dysfunctions in the sulfur-containing components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, such as the cytochrome b6f complex, ferredoxin, and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) centers are the cause of these effects, which ultimately reduce the efficiency of electron transport and hinder photosynthesis in I. grandifolia plants. In short, our findings suggest that targeting OAS-TL with inhibitors such as SBC could be a promising strategy for the development of novel herbicides.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"793e1714b04c20b78d71bab25e6381a8484de0d3d174b23ea8262f29336d7ba8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
