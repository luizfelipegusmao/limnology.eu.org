{"title":"High-Intensity Interval Training in Different Slopes on Aerobic Performance: A Randomized Controlled Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0848/v1","date":1726043817000,"content":"This study investigated the impact of six high-intensity interval training (HIIT) running sessions at 1% or 10% slope on various physiological and performance parameters in 25 men. The partic-ipants underwent assessments of VO2max, time to exhaustion at 1% slope (TLim1%), and time to exhaustion at 10% slope (TLim10%) in the initial three visits. They were then randomly assigned to control (CON), HIIT at 1% slope (GT1%), or HIIT at 10% slope (GT10%) groups. Over three weeks, participants performed six HIIT sessions with equalized workload based on their indi-vidual maximal oxygen uptake (vVO2max). The sessions comprised 50% of TLim, with a 1:1 ratio of exercise to recovery at 50% vVO2max. Results indicated significant improvements in VO2max and peak velocity (VPeak) after HIIT at both slopes. Heart rate (HR) behavior differed between sessions for GT1%, while no significant differences were observed for GT10%. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) significantly reduced for GT1% after the third session, with a similar trend for GT10%. In summary, six sessions of 1% or 10% slope HIIT effectively enhanced VO2max and VPeak, but there was no improvement in TLim performance, suggesting no adaptive transfer between training groups.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e35c169cdcb6d10681b7409f0f957a132a82fdba20e7f9855e738673c801a1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
