{"title":"Agricultural Innovations and Adaptations to Climate Change in the Northern Cameroon Region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1174/v1","date":1723732603000,"content":"Climate disruption has serious impact on the entire agricultural production system at global scale. Research and development efforts as well as innovations may be necessary to offset the negative impact of climate change. Adaptation to climate change has remained a major socio-ecological issue in the Northern Region of Cameroon for three decades. Several agricultural innovations have been promoted in this region by international organizations and NGO, within the framework of different projects and programs, with a strong potential for adaptation to climate change. However, little is still known about agricultural innovations that have evolved over time in response to climatic factors. Therefore, research aiming at identifying adaptation strategies and practices at the local level is still limited. Also, rural communities and households do not always have access to these agricultural innovations because of lack of efficient innovation support service for agriculture. Through surveys and focus group discussions carried out in several villages in the Northern Cameroon Region, this study provides empirical data on emerging agricultural innovations in contrasting socio-economic, agricultural and ecological contexts. The study demonstrated that the process of adaptation at the village level using agricultural innovations is the result of various forms of support provided by a diversity of actors. However, heads of household (83%) are more involved in innovative initiatives to the detriment of other social strata, resulting in an imbalance in access and proximity to agricultural innovations. Also, support for agricultural innovations is segmented over time and weakens the sustainable transformation of adaptation due to the lack of coordination and the very low visibility of permanent structures dedicated to supporting agricultural innovations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7cbeee6abe0486c968324d31783c1fd8599ed9d049253ab928e59e526a2d404","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
