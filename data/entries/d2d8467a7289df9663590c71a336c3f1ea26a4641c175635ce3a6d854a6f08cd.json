Since these low voltages were compatible with the scanning electron microscope (SEM) range, these instruments were naturally selected as potential providers of transmission capabilities at lower costs [<a href=\"#ozae044.323-B1\">1-3</a>]. In addition to these financial considerations, it has been demonstrated that working at voltages between 20 and 30 kV allowed to produce sufficiently small probes, but at the same time, to significantly increase the scattering in the sample, thus generating images with higher contrasts compared to higher accelerating voltages. The advantage of LV-STEM was recognized quickly and led to the development of commercial systems, and more recently, the Hitachi SU-9000EA [<a href=\"#ozae044.323-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d2d8467a7289df9663590c71a336c3f1ea26a4641c175635ce3a6d854a6f08cd","category":"Environment"}
