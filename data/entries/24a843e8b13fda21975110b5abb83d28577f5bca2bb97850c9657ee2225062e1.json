{"title":"Gene Interactions in Cerebral Cavernous Malformations: A Brief Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0746/v1","date":1715596213000,"content":"Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a collection of irregular small blood vessels that may be present in the brain or spinal cord. These vessels contain slow â€“ moving blood that commonly clot. These malformations are frequently caused by mutations in one of the CCM genes. The CCM1 (also known as KRIT1) gene is essential for vascular morphogenesis however, its interactions with transcriptional regulators are unknown. Inhibitor of DNA-Binding/Differentiation-3 (ID3) has been recognized to be involved in different vascular/blood vessel diseases such as peripheral arterial disease, stroke, arteriovenous malformations, and atherosclerosis. We show interactions between ID3 and additional key differential expressed genes (DEGs) in microarray data of overexpressed CCM1 in endothelial cells through bioinformatic and data analytic tools. Improved understanding of how ID3, CCM1, and DEGs interact will play an important role in adding to the increasing knowledge for creating therapeutic targets for cerebral cavernous malformations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24a843e8b13fda21975110b5abb83d28577f5bca2bb97850c9657ee2225062e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
