{"title":"Research on Flexible Pressure Sensor Based on Carbon Nanotubes/PDMS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1042/v1","date":1720775276000,"content":"Abstract: Flexible pressure sensors are electronic devices that can be attached to various irregular surfaces to measure the pressure. It is widely used in wearable devices and for health detection. In this study, a general carbon nanotubes/polydimethylsiloxane (CNTs/PDMS) sponge electrode was fabricated as the elementary component of the compressible system. The sensitivity of the flexible pressure sensor is improved by optimizing the preparation process of the conductive sponge and surface modification of the CNTs, and the highest sensitivity reached 71.831 kPa-1(0~2 kPa). The flexible pressure sensor can be used to detect subtle pressure quickly and accurately so that it can be used as wearable sensor to measure the radial artery wave of a human body, which has potential applications in health care and other fields.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4620d1def7a57dacbfc2b226b79c1bffbf4360b5642e4d40174a355773499fd1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
