{"title":"WTI, Brent or implied volatility index: Perspective of volatility spillover from oil market to Chinese stock market","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302131","date":1714053600000,"content":"<p>by Peng Qin, Manying Bai</p>\r\n\r\nThis study investigates the impact of oil market uncertainty on the volatility of Chinese sector indexes. We utilize commonly used realized volatility of WTI and Brent oil price along with the CBOE crude oil volatility index (OVX) to embody the oil market uncertainty. Based on the sample span from Mar 16, 2011 to Dec 31, 2019, this study utilizes vector autoregression (VAR) model to derive the impacts of the three different uncertainty indicators on Chinese stock volatilities. The empirical results show, for all sectors, the impact of OVX on sectors volatilities are more economically and statistically significant than that of realized volatility of both WTI and Brent oil prices, especially after the Chinese refined oil pricing reform of March 27, 2013. That implies OVX is more informative than traditional WTI and Brent oil prices with respect to volatility spillover from oil market to Chinese stock market. This study could provide some important implications for the participants in Chinese stock market.","author":"Peng Qin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e001099a61bb367d4c82f23c3fca0c36336d91dcc3aac56356fbc15631a14be1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
