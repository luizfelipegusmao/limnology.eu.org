However, how earthworms modify the soil microorganisms and thus affect plant growth is still unclear. Although fertilizers alter the assembly of microbial communities, further investigations are required to test the effect of fertilizer type on the relationship between earthworms, soil microbial communities and plants.\n\nWe evaluated the role of earthworms in soil microorganisms and maize plant growth characteristics under organic or chemical fertilizers in field and greenhouse experiments. We explored the relationships between earthworms, soil microbial community and plant growth under different fertilizer types.\n\nWe found that the presence of earthworms promoted plant growth, increased the amount of plant root exudates, and enhanced the connections between rhizosphere bacterial, fungal and protist communities. Both earthworms and fertilizer application significantly changed the structure of soil bacterial, fungal and protist communities. The complexity of the soil microbial community network increased under organic, compared to chemical fertilizer application. The greenhouse experiment showed that the effect of earthworms on plant growth was weakened when maize plants were grown in sterilized soil under organic or chemical fertilizers.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>: Our study provides solid evidence that earthworms largely depend on soil microorganisms for their effects on plants under the application of different fertilizer conditions. This may provide new insights into reducing the amounts of fertilizer used by enhancing the role of earthworms and soil microorganisms.\n</p>","author":"Jin‐Hua Shi, \nXin‐Jun Hu, \nZi‐Xuan Zeng, \nZe Sun, \nChao Wang, \nHazem Abdelnabby, \nHuanan Jin, \nMan‐Qun Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ea12fccecb0d31a49741c726eda58c700903553dacb4deca14c5e50acabee724","entryHash":"e4073b88b4214e06ff3e0f2ba578e3f61fb5973e60cc2669d217b40cb1813800","category":"Environment"}
