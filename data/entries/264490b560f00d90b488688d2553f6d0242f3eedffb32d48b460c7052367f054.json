{"title":"Simulation System for V2X Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0662/v1","date":1728469278000,"content":"The issue of organizing efficient interaction between V2X system elements has become increasingly critical in recent years. Utilizing vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology enables achieving the necessary balance of safety, reducing system load, and ensuring a high degree of vehicle automation. This study aims to develop a simulation system for V2X applications in various element placement configurations and conduct a numerical analysis of several V2X system interaction schemes. The research analyzes various methods, including clustering, edge computing, and fog computing, aimed at minimizing system losses. The results demonstrate that each proposed model can be effectively implemented on mobile nodes. Results also provide insights into the average expected request processing times, thereby enhancing V2X system organization. The authors propose a comprehensive model that enables the distribution and prediction of system parameters and resources for diverse computational tasks, essential for the successful implementation and utilization of V2X technology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"264490b560f00d90b488688d2553f6d0242f3eedffb32d48b460c7052367f054","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
