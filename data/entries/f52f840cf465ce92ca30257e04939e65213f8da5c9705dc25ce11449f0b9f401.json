{"title":"Quantifying bivalve phytoplankton depletion in a eutrophic system: an integrated approach","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12680?af=R","date":1726814051000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The removal of organic particulate matter, predominantly phytoplankton, in eutrophic coastal seas and estuaries is considered an ecosystem service performed by large bivalve assemblages. Mussel farming has been proposed as a measure to mitigate eutrophication, as filtration directly reduces the concentration of chlorophyll <i>a</i> (Chl <i>a</i>), a primary ecological indicator. Seston depletion is typically assessed by in situ investigation, which generally lacks spatiotemporal coverage of features relative to greater ecosystem dynamics. To assess the scale and structure of this service, the present study couples multiple measurement approaches, including moored stations, synoptic transect surveys, flow cytometry, a preliminary drone survey technique, and satellite remote sensing within and around a large mussel farm. Significant depletion patterns were observed with all methods, and mixing gradients could be detected hundreds of meters beyond the farm, with repeatable patterns but distinct findings between methods. The intensity of the depletion signal was correlated with mussel biomass loads, ambient conditions, and hydrodynamic regimes, ranging from 5% to 91% relative Chl <i>a</i> depletion and Secchi depth increases of up to 2â€‰m. Changes in particle size distributions were impacted in all downstream areas, as well as phytoplankton diversity. Observed depletion gradients with satellite imagery were consistent with other measurements and can be used to complement in situ field measurements. The findings of this study, will inform carrying capacity assessments, farm configuration, and development of impact assessment programs on seston removal for bivalve aquaculture.</p>","author":"Daniel Taylor, \nHans Jakobsen, \nMaren Moltke Lyngsgaard, \nMiroslaw Darecki, \nMortimer Werther, \nMarie Maar, \nCamille Saurel","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"483837404a651916bc0fc2a986656bb768431b5eda97cb95890947a6f32d3b51","entryHash":"f52f840cf465ce92ca30257e04939e65213f8da5c9705dc25ce11449f0b9f401","category":"Environment"}
