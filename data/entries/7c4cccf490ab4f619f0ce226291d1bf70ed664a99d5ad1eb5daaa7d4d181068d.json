{"title":"Vitamin D Supplementation Does Not Enhance Gains in Muscle Strength and Lean Body Mass or Influence Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Vitamin D Insufficient Middle-aged Men Engaged in Resistance Training","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1760/v1","date":1724426083000,"content":"This study checked whether vitamin D (Vit-D) supplementation improves the efficacy of resistance training (RT) in terms of increasing muscle strength and lean body mass (LBM) and influencing cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) in Vit-D insufficient middle-aged healthy men. Participants (n = 28) were quasi‐randomly assigned to one of the two groups, which, in a double‐blind manner, supplemented their diet daily with either Vit‐D (8000 IU; VD) or placebo (PLC) during participation in a 12‐week supervised RT program. During the intervention, serum Vit‐D concentrations increased 2.6‐fold (p &lt; 0.001) in the VD group, while no changes occurred in the PLC group. Muscle strength gains (p &lt; 0.001) as measured in seven exercises performed on RT equipment and increases (p &lt; 0.001) in LBM were similar in the two groups. Total fat mass, percent total fat, and percent android fat decreased (p &lt; 0.05) to a similar extent in both groups, but there was no change in VO2max in either group. In conclusion, in healthy Vit‐D insufficient middle-aged men engaged in resistance training, Vit‐D supplementation increases serum 25(OH)D levels but does not enhance gains in muscle strength and LBM or decreases in fat mass and fat percentage and does not affect cardiorespiratory fitness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c4cccf490ab4f619f0ce226291d1bf70ed664a99d5ad1eb5daaa7d4d181068d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
