{"title":"Microhabitat association and resistance of Tanaidacea (Crustacea) to tropical cyclones in rocky intertidal areas of central-eastern Taiwan","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05579-2","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The community ecology and microhabitat association of tanaidaceans in three rocky intertidal areas of central-eastern Taiwan were investigated in April and August 2012. Typhoon Saola impacted the study areas 2 weeks before the August survey, providing an opportunity to examine community responses to extreme wave exposures. Among the 3,622 individuals and 12 species collected, <em>Chondrochelia taitungensis</em>, <em>Paraleptochelia setosa</em>, <em>Synapseudes hansmuelleri</em>, <em>Zeuxo shitipingensis</em>, and <em>Zeuxo zorro</em> comprised approximately 95% of the total abundance. Surprisingly, the tanaidacean abundance, diversity, composition, and microhabitat specialization exhibited little impact from the typhoons, indicating that these tube dwellers can resist such extreme wave impacts. Spatial variation in the abundance of dominant species, species diversity, and composition among tanaidacean communities was attributed to differences in rock formations, microhabitat availability, and species’ limited dispersive ability and potential interspecific competitive interactions. While the dominant species exhibited a more generalized microhabitat association, the relatively rare species displayed some specialization. This study pioneers investigation into microhabitat associations among rocky intertidal tanaidaceans. Future studies should incorporate sustained monitoring of community dynamics and microhabitat associations, integrating essential climatic variables into the analysis to predict community responses to natural or anthropogenic disturbances.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"78a8311578facee2255fe062e2afe299070e791f64530813d52b4de3a20f7243","category":"Environment"}
