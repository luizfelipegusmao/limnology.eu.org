{"title":"Mapping environmental risk of fluoride exposure of drinking water in a community of Zacatecas, México.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1677/v1","date":1721635036000,"content":"Fluoride (iF) is important inorganic pollutant in groundwater in central México. The aim of this study was estimated environmental risk exposure of iF in residents of Jerez Zacatecas México. Fifty-five tap water samples were collected from households to determine iF concentrations using the ion-selective electrode method. Based on these environmental values, the Hazard Quotient (HQ) was estimated following the methodology of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Subsequently, risk maps were generated from these values to visualize the spatial distribution of high-risk areas within the city. iF in tap water ranger in concentration from 1.3 – 7.3 mg/L (ppm). We estimated HQ in a range of 0.63 to 3.73. iF ex-posure in tap water is a health problem that must be addressed, carrying out risk communication actions that allow the population to take care of their health through simple actions, avoiding future health costs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d47a2a23cf4a3dc3fa3afd18bff8b43adbb38a5a5468ba2b6ef481e9b3ad6c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
