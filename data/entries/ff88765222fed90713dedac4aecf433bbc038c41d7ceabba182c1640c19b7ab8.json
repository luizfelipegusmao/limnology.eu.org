{"title":"Basis-Dependent Quantum Nonlocality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1505/v1","date":1713855127000,"content":"Quantum nonlocality represents correlation properties between subsystems of a composite quantum system, usually including the four types: Bell nonlocality, steerability, entanglement, and quantum correlation (quantum discord). \nGiven a basis $e_{AB}=\\{|e_{ij}\\&gt;\\}_{i\\in[d_A],j\\in[d_B]}$ for the Hilbert space $\\H_A\\otimes \\H_B$ of a bipartite system $AB$, a density operator $\\rho^{AB}$ (quantum state) of $AB$ can be represented as a $d_Ad_B\\times d_Ad_B$ matrix $\\hat{\\rho}_{e_{AB}}=[\\]$,  called the density matrix of a density operator $\\rho^{AB}$. A natural question is what is the relationship between the quantum nonlocality of a density operator $\\rho^{AB}$ and its corresponding density matrix $\\hat{\\rho}_{e_{AB}}$? In this work, we discuss the relationships between  quantum locality and basis, and prove that one type of quantum locality of density operators and that of their density matrices under a basis are the same if and only if the chosen basis is the tensor product of the bases of subsystems.  Consequently, different bases define different quantum nonlocality  density operators.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff88765222fed90713dedac4aecf433bbc038c41d7ceabba182c1640c19b7ab8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
