{"title":"Space-time analysis of the relationship between landslides occurrence, rainfall variability and ENSO in the Tropical Andean Mountain region in Colombia","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10346-024-02225-9","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>According to studies by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), tropical mountainous areas are experiencing increasingly unfavorable climatic conditions regarding geohazards due to a heightened occurrence of intense rainfall events. These climatic shifts contribute to heightened geological risks, notably an elevated frequency of landslides, exacerbating the challenges faced by these regions. There is an urgent need to understand and measure how rainfall variability affects geo-hydrological hazards, which remain difficult to determine and predict. The complex and non-linear space-time relationships and dynamics of rainfall, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and landslides in the Tropical Andean Mountain region in Colombia require an adequate analysis and understanding of their link in terms of its spatial and temporal component at different scales. By evaluation in annual, seasonal, and monthly scales, additional insights on the relationships using a wavelet spectral analysis and a space-time permutation scan statistics method using SaTScan<sup>™</sup> are provided. In this study, a space-time and frequency analysis of landslides using a 42-year (1981–2022) rainfall and Multivariate ENSO Index v2.0 time series is presented. According to the results, landslides closely aligned with rainfall patterns, exhibiting a bimodal annual cycle. The ENSO added complexity, with La Niña years leading to more frequent landslides throughout the year and El Niño years showing concentrated occurrences in specific months. This study highlights the influence of rainfall patterns and antecedent rainfall on landslide occurrence, the impact of ENSO phases on rainfall and landslides, and the increasing trend of landslides in Colombia.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"9475778b3921674853e5ec64665106ddcb445fe5cb98b913fe90f9567d1ef7f8","category":"Environment"}
