{"title":"Chelating Gels in Root Canal Preparation: A Survey of the Membership of the Australian Society of Endodontology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1862/v1","date":1716959102000,"content":"Chelating gels may assist initially in root canal preparations to help establish a glide path. While irrigation surveys have investigated liquid chelators, and gels to a minor extent, no endodontic survey has focused on EDTA gels, and why clinicians use them. All 395 members of the Australian Society of Endodontology (ASE) were emailed an 11-question survey concerning chelation gel usage via Qualtrics. Paper copies were also distributed at ASE events. Descriptive statistics was performed for practitioner and chelating gel data. Cross-tabulations of practitioner type with case percentage usage of gels were analyzed with the chi square test (adjusted P value &lt;0.0083). The overall response rate was 181/395 (46%). For 174 eligible responses, those who never/rarely used a gel was: endodontic residents 12/14 (86%), endodontists 53/71 (75%), general dentists 39/86 (45%), and other members 0% (0/3). Most gel users said that gels helped establish a glide path. Those who never/rarely used chelating gels commented that they held no benefits over liquid EDTA. Endodontists were less likely to use a chelation gel than general dentists (P &lt;0.0083). Older members had higher gel usage than younger members (P &lt;0.0083), indicating a possible trend to diminished gel usage over time amongst ASE members.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6da33943f89980b369a98264e9d57b32ac4068706197685838705e6f9a13504f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
