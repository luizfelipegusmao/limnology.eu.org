{"title":"Clinical Outcomes After Dental Surgery With Two Antiseptic Protocols.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0296/v1","date":1718015141000,"content":"Little has been written in literature about the clinical comparison of the single use of chlorhexidine (CHX) rather than its combination with cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC). The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical effectiveness of two at-home antiseptic regimens. Healthy subjects scheduled for dental surgery were enrolled. After the surgery, patients were randomly allocated in a first group (Group A) which received a manual ultra soft toothbrush (Mentadent Professional®), an antiseptic toothpaste with 0,12% CHX and Vitamin B3 (Mentadent Professional Azione Intensiva Gengive®) and an antiseptic mouthwash with 0,12% CHX and 0,07% CPC. The second group (Group B) received solely an antiseptic mouthwash with 0,2% in conjunction with Anti Discoloration System (Curasept ADS/DNA®) and were encouraged to use their usual toothbrush and toothpaste. Patients were instructed to use the products twice a day and to rinse for 30 seconds. On day 7, patients were examined for the Early Healing Score, Visual Plaque Index of the sutures, Numerical Rating Scale and mouthwash taste. Group A showed a statistically significant levels of EHS and taste satisfaction. The regimen based on CHX associate with vitamin B3 in the toothpaste and CPC in the mouthwash resulted in superior clinical outcomes and satisfaction compared to solely CHX.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44da78f938e6ea532067a262df2633a21076300b431c1671bf4332b805c7b69d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
