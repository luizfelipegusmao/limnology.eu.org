{"title":"Model to Improve Classrooms&rsquo; Visual Comfort Using Waste-Based Shading and Its Validation in Mediterranean Schools","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0313/v1","date":1728022673000,"content":"In Europe, non-residential building stock built before building energy codes consumes more energy and resources than new buildings. Existing educational buildings comprise 17% of this outdated stock. These buildings can be retrofitted to create a conducive learning environment that can improve students’ comfort. Facade renovation has become the first choice for elevating the building performance of the education stock because it is less expensive than other alternatives. This study develops a methodology to optimize facade renovation solutions including: 1) preparation, 2) simulations of the simplified model using local shading, and 3) modelling realistic optimized facade design. This study evaluates visual comfort by considering multiple-dimensional metrics such as useful daylight illuminance (UDI), annual sunlight exposure (ASE), illuminance uniformity and the daylighting factor. The methodology was first applied to improve the facade proposal “Roof to Façade” in the project Waste-based Intelligent Solar Control Devices for Envelope Refurbishment (WiSeR) and simulations with the software DesignBuilder to design tile system facades. The results illustrate that implementing these solutions could efficiently improve indoor visual comfort by considering multiple daylight metrics. Moreover, for a constant gaps surface, the facade distribution with staggered gaps performs better in terms of the daylighting factor, solar gains and uniformity than more continuously connected gaps.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"012ca0e5b992d5c2148356edf5fdeb0121637d28bf3b1f3bb86bdb5f9516b951","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
