{"title":"Health conditions contribution to disability burden in Spain and the role of ethnicity and migrant status: A nation-wide study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306526","date":1720792800000,"content":"<p>by Javier Casillas-Clot, Pamela Pereyra-Zamora, Andreu Nolasco</p>\r\nBackground <p>Disability is frequently associated with contextual or lifestyle factors. Some health conditions may affect the prevalence of disability differently, especially for some minority groups. This study aims to assess the impact and contribution of different health conditions to disability burden in Spain in Roma and immigrant populations, compared to the general population.</p> Methods <p>This is a cross-sectional study. We have used data from the Spanish National Survey of 2017 and the National Health Survey of the Roma Population 2014. We have calculated frequencies of demographic variables and prevalence of health conditions grouped by body function. We also have fitted binomial additive hazard models, using the attribution method, to assess disabling impact and contribution of health conditions to disability burden. The software R was used for the computations.</p> Results <p>Roma and immigrant populations had worse socioeconomic status than the general population, although the gap was more heavily marked among Roma. Roma population showed a higher prevalence in all health conditions, with a disability prevalence of 57.90%, contrary to the immigrant population, that showed a lower prevalence in all health conditions, including disability (30.79%), than the general population (40.00%). However, all health conditions were more disabling in the immigrant population. Neurological and cardiovascular diseases, and accidents among Roma, were the most disabling conditions. Nevertheless, musculoskeletal, chronic pain, and sensory diseases among Roma, had a greater contribution to disability burden, mainly due to a combination of a great prevalence and a great impact in functions of those health conditions.</p> Conclusion <p>Both ethnicity and migrant status have shown differences in the burden of disability. While in the general population, musculoskeletal problems have the greatest contribution to the disability burden, in immigrants it was chronic pain and in the Roma population it was sensory problems. Disparities by sex were also found, with the contribution of musculoskeletal diseases being more important in females.</p>","author":"Javier Casillas-Clot","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c32aaf271b91aea765efac2bb7742d4da3fb2234b96653c575269f5341b5014a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
