{"title":"Rotifer-heliozoan interactions: a population growth study","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05315-2","date":1719792000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>We quantified the population growth of the predatory heliozoan <em>Actinosphaerium eichhornii</em> fed separately four rotifer prey (<em>Anuraeopsis fissa</em>, <em>Brachionus calyciflorus</em>, <em>Brachionus havanaensis</em> and <em>Plationus patulus</em>) at three densities (0.5, 1 and 2 ind. ml<sup>−1</sup> per day). All the four prey rotifer species were consumed by <em>A. eichhornii</em>. Regardless of the prey species, increasing rotifer prey density resulted in an increased population growth of the heliozoans. Higher cyst production in <em>A. eichhornii</em> occurred at higher prey densities on all prey species. <em>A. fissa</em> offered at the lower densities of 0.5–1.0 ind. ml<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> did not lead to cyst production by <em>A. eichhornii</em>. The predator did not survive beyond 2 days on <em>Chlorella vulgaris</em> alone. When cultured together with heliozoans, <em>A. fissa</em>, <em>B. calyciflorus</em> and <em>B. havanaensis</em> were eliminated within 4 days. However, the prey rotifer <em>Plationus patulus</em> continued to survive for about 10 days with heliozoans. The highest rate of population increase of heliozoans (0.91 day<sup>−1</sup>) was recorded when fed <em>B. calyciflorus</em> at a density of 2 ind. ml<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>, while of those of prey varied from 0.30 to 0.41 day<sup>−1</sup> when fed <em>Chlorella vulgaris</em> at 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells ml<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>. We have analyzed the impact of heliozoan predation on rotifers.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"ea52156945ec67eed34586f14fa81e76cdf93319d6be1baed1a09dd7948897c3","category":"Environment"}
