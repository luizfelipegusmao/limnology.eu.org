{"title":"PSI-1 Genetic and non-genetic factors influencing beef cattle attractiveness to horn fly","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/479/7757704?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Horn flies are the most common summer pests of cattle, leading to substantial economic losses due to impaired production and decreased animal welfare. Genetic and non-genetic factors have been reported to influence cattle susceptibility to horn flies. However, the wide range of heritability estimates, and few identified genomic regions associated with cattle resistance to horn fly may be due to subjective assessment in collecting the fly load phenotype and the small size of the population assessed. Here, beef calves from the UF purebred Brahman (BRA) and Multibreed Angus-Brahman (MAB) populations were video recorded at weaning using a GoPro camera mounted on the top of the chute. Fly infestation was determined as the average fly count obtained from five longitudinal images of each animal using ImageJ software. A total of 748 crossbred and 415 purebred calves born from 2021 to 2023 were evaluated during summer (August or September). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed within herd by fitting linear models that included collection date, age, skin color, coat color, and pre-weaning average daily gain (ADG) as fixed effects, and residual as a random effect. For MAB calves, breed groups (BG) determined based on the percentage of Brahman breed, with BG1 ranging from 0 to 19%, BG2 from 20 to 39%, BG3 from 40 to 59%, BG4 from 60 to 79%, BG5 from 80 to 100%, were also fit in the model. Fly count was transformed to a natural log value (log[count +1]) ensuring normally distribute residuals. As expected, darker colors were significantly more attractive to horn flies, while animals with greaterr percentage of Brahman were less susceptible than animals with greater percentage of Angus breed. Considerable variability in fly load was observed within purebred Brahmans, indicating that additional genetic factors, other than breed, influence cattle resistance to flies. Positive estimates were observed between horn fly load and average daily gain in both herds, which can be due to the fly load below the previously reported economic injury level of 200 flies (BRA: 28.78 ± 38.20, MAB: 19.31 ± 26.72). Variance components were estimated within herds by fitting the same aforementioned effects and a genomic-based relationship matrix (G) constructed with genotypes from the GeneSeek Genomic Profiler F250 SNP chip. The moderate heritability estimate demonstrates the feasibility of selecting cattle resistant to horn flies. Overall, our findings have the potential to contribute to reducing losses and costs in beef cattle operations, while reducing the impact on the environment of overuse of insecticides.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"c8031377a889e91f2e5877819765e9db662436f206059b3fcd0e773c6e9020f0","category":"Environment"}
