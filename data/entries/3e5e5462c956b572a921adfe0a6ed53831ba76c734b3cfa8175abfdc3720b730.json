{"title":"Animal Models of Autistic-Like Behavior: Is the Time for a Scoring System with More Accurate Definitions?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1812/v1","date":1719389478000,"content":"Appropriate animal models of human diseases are a cornerstone in the advancement of science and medicine. To create animal models of neuropsychiatric and neurobehavioral diseases such as ASD necessitates the development of sufficient neurobehavioral measuring tools to translate human behavior to expected measurable behavioral features in animals. Indeed, at least in rodents, adequate neurobehavioral and neurological tests have been developed. Since ASD is characterized by a number of specific behavioral trends with significant severity, animal models of autistic-like behavior have to demonstrate the specific characteristic features, namely impaired social interactions, and communication, restricted, repetitive behavioral patterns with association to several additional impairments such as somatosensory, motor and memory impairments. Thus, an appropriate model must show behavioral impairment of a minimal number of neurobehavioral characteristics using an adequate number of behavioral tests. \nThe proper animal models enable the study of ASD like-behavior from the etiologic, pathogenetic and therapeutic aspects. From the etiologic aspects, models have been developed by the use of immunogenic substances like polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyIC), Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and propionic acid or other well-documented immunogens or pathogens, like mycobacterium tuberculosis. Another approach is the use of chemicals like valproic acid, Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organophosphate pesticides - chlorpyrifos (CPF) and others. These substances were administered either prenatally, generally after the period of major organogenesis, or, especially in rodents, during the early postnatal life. In addition, using modern genetic manipulation methods, genetic models have been created of almost all human genetic diseases that are manifested by autistic like behavior (i.e. fragile X, Rett syndrome, SHANK gene mutation Neuroligin genes and others). Ideally, we should not only evaluate the different behavioral modes affected by the ASD-like behavior but also assess the severity of the behavioral deviations by an appropriate scoring system, as applied to humans.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e5e5462c956b572a921adfe0a6ed53831ba76c734b3cfa8175abfdc3720b730","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
