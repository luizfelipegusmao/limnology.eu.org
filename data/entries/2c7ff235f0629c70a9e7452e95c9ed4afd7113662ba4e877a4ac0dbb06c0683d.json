Characteristics of mussel assemblage change varied from non-directional change that is consistent with the loose-equilibrium concept, to strong directional change.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\n\nThe loose-equilibrium concept (LEC) predicts that ecological assemblages change transiently but return towards an earlier or average structure. The LEC framework can help determine whether assemblages vary within expected ranges or are permanently altered following environmental change.\n\nLong-lived, slow-growing animals typically respond slowly to environmental change, and their assemblage dynamics may respond over decades, which transcends most ecological studies. Unionid mussels are valuable for studying dynamics of long-lived animals because they can live &gt;50 years and occur in dense, species-rich assemblages (mussel beds). Mussel beds can persist for decades, but disturbance can affect species differently, resulting in variable trajectories according to differences in species composition within and among rivers.\n\nWe used long-term data sets (10–40 years) from seven rivers in the eastern United States to evaluate the magnitude, pace and directionality of mussel assemblage change within the context of the LEC.\n\nSite trajectories varied within and among streams and showed patterns consistent with either the LEC or directional change. In streams that conformed to the LEC, rank abundance of dominant species remained stable over time, but directional change in other streams was driven by changes in the rank abundance and composition of dominant species.\n\nCharacteristics of mussel assemblage change varied widely, ranging from those conforming to the LEC to those showing strong directional change. Conservation approaches that attempt to maintain or create a desired assemblage condition should acknowledge this wide range of possible assemblage trajectories and that the environmental factors that influence those changes remain poorly understood.\n</p>","author":"Garrett W.
