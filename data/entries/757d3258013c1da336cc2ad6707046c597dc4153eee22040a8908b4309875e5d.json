REEs have emerged as essential metals in modern-day technology due to their unique functions. Long-term large-scale mining and utilization of rare earths have caused serious environmental pollution and constitutes a global health issue, which raised concerns about human health safety. However, the toxicity profile of suspended particulate matter of REEs in the environment interacts with the human body in remain largely unknown. Studies have shown that REEs can enter the human body through a variety of pathways, leading to a variety of organ and system dysfunctions through changes in genetics, epigenetics, and signaling pathways. Through an extensive literature search and critical analysis, we provide a comprehensive overview of the available evidence, identify knowledge gaps, and make recommendations for future research directions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"757d3258013c1da336cc2ad6707046c597dc4153eee22040a8908b4309875e5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
