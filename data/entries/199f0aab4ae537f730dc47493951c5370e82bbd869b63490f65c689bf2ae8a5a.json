{"title":"A Preliminary Experimental Study on Biodegradation of 3D Printed Samples from Biomass-Fungi Composite Materials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1721/v1","date":1724406329000,"content":"Products made from petroleum-derived plastic materials are linked to many environmental problems such as greenhouse gas emissions and plastic pollution. It is desirable to manufacture products from environmentally friendly materials instead of petroleum-based plastic materials. Products made from biomass-fungi composite materials are biodegradable and can be utilized for packaging, construction, and furniture. In biomass-fungi composite materials, biomass particles (derived from agricultural wastes) serve as the substrate and the fungal hyphae network binds the biomass particles together. There are many reported studies on 3D printing of biomass-fungi composite materials. However, there are no reported studies on biodegradation of 3D printed samples from biomass-fungi composite materials. In this study, two types of biomass materials were used to prepare printable mixture hemp hurd and beechwood sawdust. The fungi strain used was Trametes versicolor. Extrusion based 3D printing was used to print samples. 3D printed samples were left for five days to allow fungi to grow. The samples were then dried in an oven for 4 hours at 120ºC to kill all the fungi in the samples. The samples were buried in the soil using a mesh bag and kept in an environmental chamber at 25℃ with a relative humidity of 48%. The weight of these samples was measured every week over the period of three months. Both types of samples (prepared from beechwood sawdust and hemp hurd, respectively) showed weight change after three months. Furthermore, the samples made from hemp hurd had more weight change than the samples made from beechwood sawdust. The SEM (scanning electron microscope) micrographs and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectroscopy showed evidence of biodegradation of these samples.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"199f0aab4ae537f730dc47493951c5370e82bbd869b63490f65c689bf2ae8a5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
