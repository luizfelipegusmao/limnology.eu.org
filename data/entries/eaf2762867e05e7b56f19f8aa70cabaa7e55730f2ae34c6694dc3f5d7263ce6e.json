(Chlamydomonadales, Chlorophyta) from the Cascade Mountains, USA","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13454?af=R","date":1718080861000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Chlainomonas</i> (Chlamydomonadales, Chlorophyta) is one of the four genera of snow algae known to produce annual pink or red blooms in alpine snow. No <i>Chlainomonas</i> species have been successfully cultured in the laboratory, but diverse cell types have been observed from many field-collected samples, from multiple species. The diversity of morphologies suggests these algae have complex life cycles with changes in ploidy. Over 7 years (2017–2023), we observed seasonal blooms dominated by a <i>Chlainomonas</i> species from late spring through the summer months on a snow-on-lake habitat in an alpine basin in the North Cascade Mountains of Washington, USA. The Bagley Lake <i>Chlainomonas</i> is distinct from previously reported species based on morphology and sequence data. We observed a similar collection of cell types observed in other <i>Chlainomonas</i> species, with the addition of swarming biflagellate cells that emerged from sporangia. We present a life cycle hypothesis for this species that links cell morphologies observed in the field to seasonally available habitat. The progression of cell types suggests cells are undergoing both meiosis and fertilization in the life cycle. Since the life cycle is the most fundamental biological feature of an organism, with direct consequences for evolutionary processes, it is critical to understand how snow algal life cycles will influence their responses to changes in their habitat driven by climate warming. For microbial taxa that live in extreme environments and are difficult to culture, temporal field studies, such as we report here, may be key to creating testable hypotheses for life cycles.</p>","author":"Maya Matsumoto, \nClare Hanneman, \nA.
