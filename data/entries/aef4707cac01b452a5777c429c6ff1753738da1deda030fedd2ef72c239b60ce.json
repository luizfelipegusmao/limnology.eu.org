It was further fabricated into composites with silver. Phase formation was confirmed using x-ray diffraction (XRD). Microstructures were captured using electron microscopy. Inclusion of silver creates more efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Further, these powder sample were exposed to corona poling with electric field of 4 kV/mm. These was clear improvement in electrochemical properties of poled sliver-BCT-BZT composites than that of unpoled samples.</p>","author":"Nada Alfryyan, \nV. P.
