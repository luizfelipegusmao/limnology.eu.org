{"title":"Identification of major QTLs for drought tolerance in soybean, together with a novel candidate gene, GmUAA6","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/7/1852/7558217?rss=1","date":1705363200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Drought tolerance is a complex trait in soybean that is controlled by polygenetic quantitative trait loci (QTLs). In this study, wilting score, days-to-wilting, leaf relative water content, and leaf relative conductivity were used to identify QTLs associated with drought tolerance in recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between a drought-sensitive variety, Lin, and a drought-tolerant variety, Meng. A total of 33 drought-tolerance QTLs were detected. Of these 17 were major QTLs. In addition, 15 were novel drought-tolerance QTLs. The most predominant QTL was on chromosome 11. This was detected in at least three environments. The overlapped mapping interval of the four measured traits was 0.2 cM in genetic distance (about 220 kb in physical length). <span>Glyma.11g143500</span> (designated as <span>GmUAA6</span>), which encodes a UDP-<span>N</span>-acetylglucosamine transporter, was identified as the most likely candidate gene. The allele of <span>GmUAA6</span> from Lin (<span>GmUAA6</span><sup><span>Lin</span></sup>) was associated with improved soybean drought tolerance. Overexpression of <span>GmUAA6</span><sup><span>Lin</span></sup> in Arabidopsis and soybean hairy roots enhanced drought tolerance. Furthermore, a 3-bp insertion/deletion (InDel) in the coding sequence of <span>GmUAA6</span> explained up to 49.9% of the phenotypic variation in drought tolerance-related traits, suggesting that this InDel might be used in future marker-assisted selection of drought-tolerant lines in soybean breeding programs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"dbb09cee2991577832f97137abeb039400eede357310079dd6e1d715c9e79a19","category":"Environment"}
