{"title":"How to Become a Terran. Return to Earth as Geo-Gastro-Politics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0034/v1","date":1711962760000,"content":"This article argues that philosophy and its influential narrative should take and think \"food\" - the gastro-world - in order to radically renew itself and develop a gastrocentric view of the world and the future of humanity. It discusses first some of the basic ideas of a gastrocentric understanding of the world, second the adventure of becoming a Terran, and third the daily practice of what I will call \"terra madre forming\". It tells us this: If there is to be a future of human survival and well-being on Earth, if we are to achieve the goals of sustainable development, then we have a clear agenda for tomorrow with the re-humidification of the soil - madre terra - that nourishes us. What needs to be done is quite simple and down-to-earth: We, each of us, if possible, must participate in the regeneration of the earth. In conclusion, it is time for the Slow Food movement to blossom into a geo-gastro-activism. The future task of this organization is to make itself electable as a political party to support the much-needed transformation of humans into Terrans.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"23bab5a687d7daa8ea600719f7ca12cb182b25331b2d80dc09fdea7f3cbe6fe3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
