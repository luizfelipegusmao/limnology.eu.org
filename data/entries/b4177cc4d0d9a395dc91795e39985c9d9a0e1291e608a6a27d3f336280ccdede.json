{"title":"Infidelity Analysis of Digital Counter-Diabatic Driving in Two Qubit System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2130/v1","date":1721980766000,"content":"Digitized counter-diabatic (CD) optimization algorithms have been proposed and extensively studied to enhance performance in quantum computing by accelerating adiabatic processes while minimizing energy transitions. While adding approximate counter-diabatic terms can initially introduce adiabatic errors that decrease over time, Trotter errors from decomposition approximation persist. On the other hand, increasing the high-order nested commutators for CD terms may improve adiabatic errors but could also introduce additional Trotter errors. In this article, we examine the two-qubit model to explore the interplay between approximate CD, adiabatic errors, Trotter errors, coefficients and commutators. Through these analysis, we aim to gain insights into optimizing these factors for better fidelity, shallower circuit depth, and reduced gate number in near-term gate-based quantum computing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4177cc4d0d9a395dc91795e39985c9d9a0e1291e608a6a27d3f336280ccdede","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
