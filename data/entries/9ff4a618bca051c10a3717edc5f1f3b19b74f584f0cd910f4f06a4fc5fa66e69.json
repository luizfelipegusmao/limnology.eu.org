{"title":"The Timing of Detectable Increases in Seasonal Soil Moisture Droughts Under Future Climate Change","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF004174?af=R","date":1717740241000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Global warming exacerbates the increase of soil moisture drought by accelerating the water cycle, posing potential threats to food security and ecological sustainability. The design of drought prevention and mitigation policies should be based on the reliable detection of the future change signal in droughts, so it is critical to know when the signal can be detected (Time of Emergence, ToE) in the background noise of the climate system. While the ToE framework has been successfully applied for temperature-related signal detection, the ToE for changes in drought has not been well studied. Based on 66 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model ensemble members under four Shared Socio-economic Pathways, we conduct a global ToE analysis of seasonal soil moisture drought characteristics and discuss the impact of different warming levels. Six subregions with robust increase in soil moisture droughts are identified. For drought frequency, most of the subregion's ToE is centered around 2080, however for drought intensity it is much earlier and can even reach around 2040 in AMZ. For drought frequency and drought intensity, approximately 14%–22% and 47%–49% of global land areas would reach ToE in 21st century. The global land areas with ToE of increasing droughts would increase by at least 1/5 when global warming level is kept to 2°C rather than 1.5°C above pre-industrial conditions. This suggests that limiting global warming can significantly delay the emergence time of increases in seasonal soil moisture droughts, allowing additional adaptation time for the drought-related sectors.</p>","author":"Sisi Chen, \nXing Yuan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Earth's Future: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2958dd76fb7907b9b5d9ef7cbca00ecda25efa9c5b75e193900a164a1ec3c84c","entryHash":"9ff4a618bca051c10a3717edc5f1f3b19b74f584f0cd910f4f06a4fc5fa66e69","category":"Environment"}
