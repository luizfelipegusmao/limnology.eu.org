{"title":"Bayesian joint modeling of multivariate longitudinal and survival outcomes using Gaussian copulas","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/25/4/962/7658810?rss=1","date":1714089600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>There is an increasing interest in the use of joint models for the analysis of longitudinal and survival data. While random effects models have been extensively studied, these models can be hard to implement and the fixed effect regression parameters must be interpreted conditional on the random effects. Copulas provide a useful alternative framework for joint modeling. One advantage of using copulas is that practitioners can directly specify marginal models for the outcomes of interest. We develop a joint model using a Gaussian copula to characterize the association between multivariate longitudinal and survival outcomes. Rather than using an unstructured correlation matrix in the copula model to characterize dependence structure as is common, we propose a novel decomposition that allows practitioners to impose structure (e.g., auto-regressive) which provides efficiency gains in small to moderate sample sizes and reduces computational complexity. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo model fitting procedure for estimation. We illustrate the methodâ€™s value using a simulation study and present a real data analysis of longitudinal quality of life and disease-free survival data from an International Breast Cancer Study Group trial.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biostatistics Current Issue","siteHash":"d3a47065211a18721436d2ad1f713237ccbb15b7790ebb347bb018c26cfcb04f","entryHash":"486ae463aa10f30686782e6fdc367d08ee508f0eff7c2b574795d9a388c59802","category":"Environment"}
