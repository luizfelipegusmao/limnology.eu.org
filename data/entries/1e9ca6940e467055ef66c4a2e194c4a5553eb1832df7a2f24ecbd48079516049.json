{"title":"Optimization of 3D printing supply chain in the era of live streaming e-commerce","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303218","date":1715695200000,"content":"<p>by Zhen Chen, Ying Tang</p>\r\n\r\nThis study examines the effects of the rising live streaming e-commerce on the 3DP supply chain, employing system dynamics to develop separate models for pure polymer and polymer-metal mixed printing. The analysis focuses on optimizing the 3DP supply chain configuration. Results indicate that, based solely on printing time, cost, and quality metrics, Corporate-live-3DP services are optimal for live commerce scenarios. However, despite this, Private-live-3DP maintains a substantial consumer base in practice, as evidenced by literature data and case studies. Both models pose significant challenges to conventional supply chains, necessitating adaptation. For Corporate-live-3DP, optimization strategies may include technology advancements, digital transformation, agile manufacturing, global network optimization, innovative management, collaborative R&amp;D, fine-tuned inventory control, quality system upgrades, talent development, and organizational restructuring. Conversely, Private-live-3DP can be optimized through consolidation of private 3D printing resources, demand prediction and order optimization, supply chain collaboration platforms, quality management extensions, inventory strategy adjustments, increased transparency, regulatory compliance, and risk mitigation measures.","author":"Zhen Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1e9ca6940e467055ef66c4a2e194c4a5553eb1832df7a2f24ecbd48079516049","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
