{"title":"Optimization of Business Processes through BPM Methodology: A Case Study on Data Analysis and Performance Improvement","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1248/v1","date":1729074438000,"content":"This study explores the application of the BPM lifecycle to optimize the Market Analysis process within the Market Intelligence department of a major energy company. The semi-structured, virtual nature of the process necessitated careful adaptation of BPM methodology, starting with process discovery through data collection, modeling, and validation. Qualitative analysis, including value-added and root-cause analysis, revealed inefficiencies. The redesign strategy focused on selective automation using Python scripts and Power BI dashboards, incorporating techniques such as linear programming and forecasting to improve process efficiency and quality while maintaining flexibility. Post-implementation, monitoring through a questionnaire showed positive results, though ongoing interviews were recommended for sustained performance evaluation. This study highlights the value of BPM methodology in enhancing decision-critical processes and offers a model for adaptable, value-driven process improvements in complex organizational environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be587657db6160dad457a6dcd0d021094731842137a696b80f27ead17d224ff1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
