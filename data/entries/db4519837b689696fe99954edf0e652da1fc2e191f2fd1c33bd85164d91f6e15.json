{"title":"E3 ligase DECREASED GRAIN SIZE 1 promotes degradation of a G-protein subunit and positively regulates grain size in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/948/7695730?rss=1","date":1718668800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Grain size is one of the most important traits determining crop yield. However, the mechanism controlling grain size remains unclear. Here, we confirmed the E3 ligase activity of DECREASED GRAIN SIZE 1 (DGS1) in positive regulation of grain size in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) suggested in a previous study. Rice G-protein subunit gamma 2 (RGG2), which negatively regulates grain size, was identified as an interacting protein of DGS1. Biochemical analysis suggested that DGS1 specifically interacts with canonical Gγ subunits (rice G-protein subunit gamma 1 [RGG1] and rice G-protein subunit gamma 2 [RGG2]) rather than non-canonical Gγ subunits (DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 1 [DEP1], rice G-protein gamma subunit type C 2 [GCC2], GRAIN SIZE 3 [GS3]). We also identified the necessary domains for interaction between DGS1 and RGG2. As an E3 ligase, DGS1 ubiquitinated and degraded RGG2 via a proteasome pathway in several experiments. DGS1 also ubiquitinated RGG2 by its K140, K145, and S147 residues. Thus, this work identified a substrate of the E3 ligase DGS1 and elucidated the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of the G-protein signaling pathway in the control of grain size.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"db4519837b689696fe99954edf0e652da1fc2e191f2fd1c33bd85164d91f6e15","category":"Environment"}
