{"title":"Modeling and Control of Reconfigurable Quadrotors Based on Model Reference Adaptive Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1324/v1","date":1711079633000,"content":"With much more challenging scenarios encountered in engineering, traditional quadrotors couldnâ€™t accomplish all desired missions perfectly. Task-driven based reconfigurable quadrotors have more latent capacity in environment with dense obstacles and narrow corridors. The translational reconfigurable quadrotors and rotational reconfigurable quadrotors are proposed in this presentation, assumptions, mathematical models and related motion control laws are given subsequently, in order to cope with hazard missions, model reference adaptive control laws are proposed, sufficient numerical simulations demonstrate the validity of the proposed control laws.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c3e95c768fa133bc48b6c156b48793318fae4f91661c75663fc860302085b87b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
