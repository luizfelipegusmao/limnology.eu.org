{"title":"Prevalence and correlates of mental disorders among Chinese overseas students during the COVID-19: A multi-regional cross-sectional analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303283","date":1715608800000,"content":"<p>by Yijia Gao, Yuanyan Ma, Yaxin Li, Yuanji Zhao, Zhen Zeng, Xiaozhi Yao, Yingjun Nie</p>\r\nBackground <p>The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic extends beyond physical health, significantly affecting mental health. Chinese overseas students are particularly susceptible to the adverse psychological effects of the pandemic. Understanding the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders in this population is essential for developing targeted interventions and support systems.</p> Methods <p>Employing a snowball sampling technique, this study recruited Chinese overseas students from diverse regions. The 50-item Self-evaluation Table was utilized to assess the presence of mental disorders. Descriptive statistics, including percentages, 95% confidence intervals, means, and standard deviations, characterized the survey population. The chi-square test identified disparities among categorical variables, while logistic regression explored risk factors for mental disorders among Chinese overseas students.</p> Results <p>Out of the total sample size of 10,864 Chinese overseas students, a staggering 7,090 (65.4%) met the diagnostic criteria for mental disorders. Furthermore, the degree of mental disorder varied significantly across different regions (p &lt; 0.001), education levels (p &lt; 0.05), the duration of anti-epidemic measures (p &lt; 0.05), and age (p &lt; 0.05), while no significant differences were observed in terms of gender (p &gt; 0.05). Several risk factors contributing to the mental disorder burden among Chinese overseas students during the pandemic were identified, including the seriousness of the epidemic in their residential area, the apprehension of getting infected, anxieties regarding academic performance, the infection control policies implemented by the host government, preventive measures taken locally to counter the epidemic, and challenges encountered in returning to their home country.</p> Conclusion <p>Given the significant challenges in mental health faced by Chinese overseas students during the COVID-19 crisis, addressing their specific needs and implementing tailored measures is imperative. Future public health emergencies should consider the potential mental disorders and disease risks faced by Chinese overseas students. By providing comprehensive support and targeted interventions, policymakers, educational institutions, and healthcare providers can help mitigate the adverse psychological effects and promote the well-being of this vulnerable population.</p>","author":"Yijia Gao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bc63c6f154d6db14eebe59b771f869a8b2851ec2a6e253c2f8b05e922dcc2c29","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
