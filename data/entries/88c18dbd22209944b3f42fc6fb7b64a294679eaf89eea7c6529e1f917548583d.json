A combination of histological evaluation, qPCR analysis, and in situ hybridization was used to examine the cellular transitions taking place in the germinal epithelium from late winter through to a seasonal spawn in summer. We observed clear seasonal transitionary changes in the spermatogenic cell population making up the germinal epithelium (i.e., spermatogonial stem cells, spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa) extending from February to July. These seasonal transitions in spermatogenic cell type coincided with significant variation in the spatiotemporal expression of two molecular markers for spermatogenesis (i.e., <i>Kelch-like protein 10</i> [<i>KLHL10</i>] and <i>Armadillo repeat-containing protein 4 isoform X2</i> [<i>ARMC4</i>]) but not for expression of a gamete-specific <i>Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I</i> (MT-COI). The spatiotemporal expression of these genes is directly linked to the cellular changes taking place in the germinal epithelium during spermatogenesis. These observations not only corresponded to seasonal changes in physiological condition but also environmental temperature and chlorophyll <i>a</i>, thus further supporting the link between male gametogenesis and environment in higher latitude regions.</p>","author":"Harry M.
