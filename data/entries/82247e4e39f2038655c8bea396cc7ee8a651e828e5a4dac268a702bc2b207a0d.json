{"title":"Thermography, Temperature, Pressure Force Distribution and Physical activity as Predictors of Ulcers in Diabetic Foot: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0548/v1","date":1723112726000,"content":"In diabetic foot injury prevention, no studies relate physical activity with the inflammatory response of the plantar tissues, evaluated by thermography and pressure distribution. These measurements are easy to be implemented in diabetic foot follow-up. The objective of this study was to analyze whether the plantar skin response, evaluated with thermography, after physical activity in healthy or diabetic patients, is a foot ulcer prognostic tool and to asses if there is a correlation between exercise intensity, plantar pressure and plantar thermographic response. A systematic review was carried out following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) format in the PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases, with no year limit during the second quarter of 2024. A total of 14 studies have been included in this review. The use of infrared thermography for early inflammatory tissue detection, plantar pressures and the monitoring of controlled physical activity, make possible to monitor changes that allow the identification of patients at risk of developing foot ulcers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"82247e4e39f2038655c8bea396cc7ee8a651e828e5a4dac268a702bc2b207a0d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
