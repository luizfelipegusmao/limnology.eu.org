{"title":"The Fourier Continuous Derivative: A New Approach to Fractional Differentiation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.0913/v3","date":1719326534000,"content":"The Fourier Continuous Derivative ($D_C$) offers a unique perspective on fractional differentiation grounded in the theory of Fourier series. This approach has the potential to address problems across various disciplines, including physics, engineering, and mathematics. The primary insight underpinning this approach is that a convex function defined on $\\mathbb{Z}$ retains its convexity on $\\mathbb{R}$. This paper delves into the Fourier Continuous Derivative, compares it with traditional fractional derivatives, and outlines its possible real-world applications, such as modeling viscoelastic materials, solving wave equations, and financial data analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ffdc7ea49633ba5503505b21d3b561c858d5aa0ef9214a2d1ac342f63ed954c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
