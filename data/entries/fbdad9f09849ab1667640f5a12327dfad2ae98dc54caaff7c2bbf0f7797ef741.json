{"title":"Regulated ICP-OES Detectible Elements in Utah Lake: Characterization and Discussion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0368/v1","date":1720077365000,"content":"During 2021 and 2022 summers, we measured the total and dissolved (&amp;lt; 0.45 mm) concentration of 25 elements in Utah Lake using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). Utah regulates twelve of these elements. ICP-OES sensitivity is at the ppb-level but is not the approved regulatory method. All regulations are for dissolved concentrations; except aluminum (Al) and phosphorus (P) which are for total recovery. We found total Al concentrations above allowable, but dissolved concentrations were well below allowable concentrations. We attribute high total concentrations to suspended clays. Dissolved copper (Cu) concentrations were below regulatory levels in 2021, but some samples were above regulatory levels in 2022. This could be related to the use of Cu-based algaecide treatments, or from other sources. Lead (Pb) data were inconclusive; dissolved Pb concentrations were well below the acute (1-hour average) limit, but the chronic concentration limit (4-hour average) is below the ICP-OES minimal detection limit. Arsenic (As) concentrations exhibit a seasonal trend that we attribute to groundwater inflows. This ppb-level study provides insight into regulated elements in Utah Lake previously not available due to the high sensitivity of the method and measurements of both total and dissolved concentrations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fbdad9f09849ab1667640f5a12327dfad2ae98dc54caaff7c2bbf0f7797ef741","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
