{"title":"Variability of Dry Days and Sequences of Dry Days in the Polish Carpathians in the Period 1986‐2020","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1646/v1","date":1726837514000,"content":"This study aims at providing a climatological analysis of annual and long-term variability of dry periods in the Polish Carpathians in the period of 35 years between 1986 and 2020. Aside days with precipitation, dry periods, namely sequences of days with no precipitation, constitute an inherent characteristic of the climate. The input data for the research was formed by daily precipitation totals from 17 meteorological stations acquired from the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management - National Research Institute, and T. Niedźwiedź catalogue of circulation types over southern Poland. Frequency of dry periods of different duration has been presented. The incidence of long-term periods has been related to the atmospheric circulation. An analysis was performed regarding the change of the average quantity and average length of dry sequences in the 35-year period covered. At most stations, there were no statistically significant trends with respect to the analysed dry day characteristics. This is an obvious result of high variability year-to-year, which means that exclusively large changes may achieve statistical significance. Dry days have been evidenced to related to circulation types. A vast majority of dry days is related to anti-cyclonal systems, particularly the anti-cyclonal wedge (Ka) and western anti-cyclonal (Wa) situations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"71bd83c20f64c1fe4f4f2ce8bffd2be7397d7385b7cc45487ecf7dbfef586dc6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
