{"title":"Modelling Canopy Height of Forest-Savannah Mosaics in Togo Using ICESat-2 and GEDI Spaceborne LiDAR and Multisource Satellite Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1176/v1","date":1726473831000,"content":"Quantifying forest carbon storage to better manage climate change and its effects requires accurate estimation of forest structural parameters such as canopy height. Variables from remote sensing data and machine-learning models are tools that are being increasingly used for this purpose. This study modelled canopy height of forest-savannah mosaics in the Sudano-Guinean zone of Togo. Relative heights were extracted from GEDI and ICESat-2 products, which were combined with optical, radar and topographic variables for canopy height modelling. We tested four methods: Random Forest (RF); Support Vector Machine (SVM); Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost); and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The RF algorithm obtained the best predictions using 98% relative height (RH98). The best performing result was obtained from variables extracted from GEDI data (r = 0.84; RMSE = 4.15 m; MAE = 2.36 m), compared to ICESat-2 (r = 0.65; RMSE = 5.10 m; MAE = 3.80 m). Models that were developed during the study, from the combination of multisource and multisensor data, can be applied over large areas in forest-savannah mosaics, thereby contributing to better monitoring of forest dynamics according to the objectives and requirements of REDD+.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc2f0b68db77f46db6c44baf97d32117a27186efb11785b0ee1b5b4f0ef39885","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
