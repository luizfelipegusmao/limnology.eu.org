{"title":"Effect of wheat middling incorporation into wet corn distillers grains with solubles on apparent diet digestibility and ruminal fermentation characteristics in growing and finishing diets","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae083/7671434?rss=1","date":1715644800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Two separate cross-over experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of incorporating wheat middlings into wet corn distillers grains with solubles (WDGS) on apparent diet digestibility and ruminal fermentation characteristics in growing and finishing diets. In experiment 1, four ruminally cannulated heifers (313 ± 42.9 kg) were limit fed a high-energy growing diet that included WDGS (CON) or WDGS + wheat middlings (CON + WM) at 40% of diet dry matter (DM). The diet also contained (DM basis) 39.5% dry-rolled corn, 7.5% supplement, and 13% warm-season grass hay. In experiment 2, four ruminally cannulated Holstein steers (321 ± 17.4 kg) were fed a finishing diet that included WDGS (CON) or WDGS + wheat middlings (CON + WM) at 30% of diet DM. The diet also contained (DM basis) 60.3% dry-rolled corn, 2.7% supplement, and 7.0% warm-season grass hay. Experiments consisted of two 15-d periods that were conducted concurrently. Each period included 10 d of diet adaptation, 4 d of fecal collection, and 1 d of ruminal fluid collection. Fecal samples were collected on days 11 to 14 of each period and composite samples were analyzed for chromium to estimate apparent diet digestibility. On day 15, ruminal fluid samples were collected prior to feeding and again at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24-h post-feeding. In experiment 1, DM, organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) intake did not differ (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.11) between diets; however, starch intake was greater (<span>P</span> = 0.03) for heifers fed CON + WM compared with CON. Apparent DM, OM, NDF, and starch digestibilities were similar between diets (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.13), but feeding CON + WM tended to lead to lesser (<span>P</span> = 0.06) apparent ADF digestibility. Ruminal pH and total volatile fatty acid concentrations did not differ between diets (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.16); however, ruminal ammonia concentrations tended to be less (<span>P</span> = 0.09) for CON + WM compared with CON. In experiment 2, DM intake did not differ (<span>P</span> = 0.65) between diets. Apparent DM digestibility was greater (<span>P</span> = 0.01) for CON + WM compared with CON but the difference was small. Intake and apparent digestibility of OM, NDF, ADF, and starch did not differ (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.25) between diets. Ruminal ammonia concentrations were lesser (<span>P</span> = 0.03) while ruminal pH was greater (<span>P</span> = 0.02) for CON + WM compared with CON. Overall, incorporation of wheat middlings into WDGS had minimal impacts on feed intake, apparent diet digestibility, and ruminal fermentation characteristics when fed to growing and finishing cattle.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"6a5c71860492e5b426fe1e5c1f17e8fc0286e7a6d04c3ee1d44d992df34a57ba","category":"Environment"}
