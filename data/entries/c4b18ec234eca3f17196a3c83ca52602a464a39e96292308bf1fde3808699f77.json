{"title":"The potent effect of selenium nanoparticles insight into: the antifungal activity and preservation of postharvest strawberries from gray mold diseases","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13502?af=R","date":1712064592000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Most microorganisms cause food decay and the lower shelf life of foods is fungi. Nanotechnologies can combat various diseases and deals with the application of nanomaterial to target cell or tissue. In this study was synthesized selenium nanoparticle (Se-NPs) by using ascorbic acids, and characterized by UV–Visible, TEM, XRD, and zeta potential. The different concentrations of As/Se-NPs were tested against different fungi such as<i>, Alternaria linicola, Alternaria padwickii, Botrytis cinerea; Bipolaris sp, Cephalosporium acremonium; Fusarium moniliform; Fusarium semitectum.</i> This study tested the influence of coated As/Se-NPs on healthy and infected strawberries fruits with <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> during 16 days of storage periods on shelf life, decay percentage, weight loss, total titratable acidity percentage (TA), total soluble solids content (TSS), and anthocyanin content.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The results indicated the EDX analysis showed only two elements Selenium and Oxygen. TEM image demonstrates the size ranged between 26 to 39 nm, and rhombohedral in shape. Selenium nanoparticles have antifungal activities against all tested fungi, the most effective against <i>Botrytis cinerea, Cephalosporium acremonium, and Fusarium semitectum</i>. During storage periods of strawberries fruits coated with As/Se-NPs, the shelf life was increased, and the number of decaying fruits was less than in control (uncoated) and coated infected fruits. The decline in weight loss is lower in coated fruits than control.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>These findings displayed that As/Se-NPs could effectively maintain the postharvest quality of strawberries, even when the fruit was infected with <i>B. cinerea</i>.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
