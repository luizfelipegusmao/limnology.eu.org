Visualizing molecular mechanisms within their natural context is often challenging and limited to small histological tissue sections. Here, we introduce a novel method for correlative light sheet microscopy and X-ray microtomography, enabling simultaneous localization of fluorescent markers and visualization of tissue architecture with cellular resolution in organisms and organoids with hundreds of micrometres in size.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"df14d7b631a818089cac9b8342349dceefab3331a826b37aed1ef04c5c6564ea","category":"Environment"}
