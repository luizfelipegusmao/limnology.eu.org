{"title":"Bone Regeneration and PEEK Implants in Maxillo-Facial Surgery and Neurosurgery: A Multidisciplinary Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1737/v1","date":1714284712000,"content":"Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) in the last few years emerged as an exceedingly promising material for craniofacial defect, due to its biocompatibility and mechanical properties. However, its utilization remains controversial due to its inertness and low osteoinductivity. This study aimed to investigate the postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing maxillo-facial and neurosurgical procedures with PEEK implants. The focus is on evaluating bone regrowth on the surface and edges of the implant, periosteal reactions, and implant positioning. A retrospective analysis of 12 maxillo-facial surgery patients and 10 neurosurgery patients who received PEEK implants was conducted. CT scans performed at least one-year post-operation, were examined for bone regrowth, periosteal reactions, and implant positioning. In maxillo-facial cases, the analysis included mandibular angle and fronto-orbital reconstruction, while neurosurgical cases involved cranioplasty. In maxillofacial surgery, 11 out of 12 patients showed radiological evidence of bone regrowth around PEEK implants, with favorable outcomes observed in craniofacial reconstruction. In neurosurgery, 9 out of 10 patients exhibited minimal or none bone regrowth, while one case demonstrated notable bone regeneration beneath the PEEK implant interface. The study highlights the importance of implant design and patient-specific factors in achieving successful outcomes, providing valuable insights for future implant-based procedures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ca93b5dce9217fec5d68a1781586626ff7ad7a15f829b2a0bd9534a3494ea40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
