{"title":"Fault Diagnosis of Maritime Equipment Using an Intelligent Framework","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0192/v1","date":1722822156000,"content":"The task of automatically and intelligently diagnosing faults in marine equipment is of great significance due to the numerous duties that shipboard professionals must handle. Incorporating automated and intelligent systems on ships allows for more efficient equipment monitoring and better decision-making. This approach has attracted considerable interest in both academia and industry because of its potential for economic savings and improved safety. Several fault diagnosis methods are documented in the literature, often involving mathematical and control theory models. However, due to the inherent complexity of some processes, not all characteristics are precisely known, making mathematical modeling highly challenging. As a result, fault diagnosis often depends on data or heuristic information. Fuzzy logic theory is particularly well-suited for processing this type of information. Therefore, this paper employs fuzzy models to diagnose faults in a marine pneumatic servo-actuated valve. The proposed fault diagnosis framework analyzes the discrepancy signals between the outputs of the fuzzy models and the actual process outputs. These discrepancies, known as residuals, help in detecting and isolating equipment faults. The fault isolation process uses an intelligent decision-making approach to determine the specific fault in the system. This method is applied to diagnose abrupt faults in a marine pneumatic servo-actuated valve.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e27cbcee43c37c4c5f3ea809e8fadd11c8e2ff4eb3759a4029c1fe3f3b5aa7ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
