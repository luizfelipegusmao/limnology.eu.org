This research addresses the urgent need for accurate and reliable water quality monitoring by introducing a novel method for estimating the water quality index (WQI). The proposed approach combines cutting-edge optimization techniques with Deep Capsule Crystal Edge Graph neural networks, marking a significant advancement in the field. The innovation lies in the integration of a Hybrid Crested Porcupine Genghis Khan Shark Optimization Algorithm for precise feature selection, ensuring that the most relevant indicators of water quality (WQ) are utilized. Furthermore, the use of the Greylag Goose Optimization Algorithm to fine-tune the neural network's weight parameters enhances the model's predictive accuracy. This dual optimization framework significantly improves WQI prediction, achieving a remarkable mean squared error (MSE) of 6.7 and an accuracy of 99%. By providing a robust and highly accurate method for WQ assessment, this research offers a powerful tool for environmental authorities to proactively manage river WQ, prevent pollution, and evaluate the success of restoration efforts.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nNovel method combines optimization and Deep Capsule Crystal Edge Graph for WQI estimation.\nPreprocessing includes data cleanup and feature selection using advanced algorithms.\nDeep Capsule Crystal Edge Graph neural network predicts WQI with high accuracy.\nGreylag Goose Optimization fine-tunes network parameters for precise forecasts.\nProposed method achieves low MSE of 6.7 and high accuracy of 99%.\n</p>","author":"Anusha Nanjappachetty, \nSuvitha Sundar, \nNagaraju Vankadari, \nTapas Bapu Bathey Ramesh Bapu, \nPradeep Shanmugam","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"2c268361c7e4aff7520c03279c69e0824233485a2d9466b0f4da8f1685b3f170","category":"Environment"}
