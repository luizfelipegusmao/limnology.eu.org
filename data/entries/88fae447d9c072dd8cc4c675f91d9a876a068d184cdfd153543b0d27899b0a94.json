{"title":"Comparison of New Inflammatory Marker Scoring Systems and Conventional Inflammatory Markers in Patients Over 65 Years of Age Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1412/v1","date":1716384570000,"content":"Background: The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effects of inflammation markers, on infection and mortality in patients over 65 years of age monitored in the intensive care unit. In the study, the significance of pan-immune inflammation (PIV), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII), systemic immune response index (SIRI), multi-inflammatory index (MII) 1-2-3, and CRP/albumin ratios, new biomarkers, were attempted to be determined as prognostic and mortality markers in patients over 65 years of age monitored in the ICU. Methods: This multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted in two tertiary-level ICUs with patients aged 65 and over who were admitted. Patients with cirrhosis, bone marrow transplantation, hematologic malignancy, undergoing chemotherapy, and neutropenia at admission to the ICU were excluded from the study. Results: A total of 333 patients were included in the study. The 28-day mortality was found to be 31.8%. When each inflammatory marker associated with 28-day mortality was examined the CRP/albumin ratio performed better than both NLR and SIRI, and the results were statistically significant (AUC: 0.665, 95% CI: 0.604-0.726 and p &lt;0.001). NLR had a moderate discriminative ability in distinguishing mortality risk (AUC: 0.593, 95% CI: 0.526-0.660 and p = 0.006). Although SIRI was lower than NLR, it had a statistically significant result (AUC: 0.580, 95% CI: 0.514-0.646 and p = 0.019). CRP/albumin ratio was the most effective inflammatory marker in predicting mortality risk in geriatric patients admitted to the ICU.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88fae447d9c072dd8cc4c675f91d9a876a068d184cdfd153543b0d27899b0a94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
