{"title":"2D Materials for Integrated Optical Polarizers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1135/v1","date":1711089749000,"content":"Optical polarizers are essential components for the selection and manipulation of light polarization states in optical systems. Over the past decade, the rapid advancement of photonic technologies and devices has led to the development of a range of novel optical polarizers, opening avenues for many breakthroughs and expanding applications across diverse fields. Particularly, two-dimensional (2D) materials, known for their atomic thin film structures and unique optical properties, have become attractive for implementing optical polarizers with high performance and new features that were not achievable before. This paper reviews recent progress in 2D-material-based optical polarizers. First, an overview of key properties of various 2D materials for realizing optical polarizers is provided. Next, the state-of-the-art optical polarizers based on 2D materials, which are categorized into spatial-light devices, fiber devices, and integrated waveguide devices, are reviewed and compared. Finally, we discuss the current challenges of this field as well as the exciting opportunities for future technological advances.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5eb12fb77176c1165129afba8d55177cafef9dd679aa41fcffd35a995cb281d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
