{"title":"PSX-24 Effects of dietary protein level and gastrointestinal nematode parasite infection on carcass and non-carcass yield and meat composition of goats","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/812/7757534?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A study was conducted to evaluate carcass and non carcass yield of parasite challenged goats, parasitized (INF) or non parasitized (NIF) with gastrointestinal nematode parasite <span>Haemonchus contortus</span>. Goats were fed either high protein (HP) diet containing 24% CP or low protein (LP) diet containing 20% CP. Sixteen growing, intact male meat goats were divided into two main groups of INF and NIF goats and were further divided into two groups of four goats and fed either a high (24% CP) or low (20% CP) containing diet. At the end of the study, empty (fasted) body weights were recorded after an overnight fast and animals transported to a commercial abattoir, and harvested. The weights of the hot carcass, blood and non-carcass pool, which included head, hide and visceral organs (intestine, lung, liver, kidney and spleen), and blood were recorded. Carcass yield was evaluated as dressing percentage (hot carcass weight/empty body weight). There was no difference (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) in carcass yield (%), (HP diet=53.77 and LP diet=54.70; INF=53.85 and NIF=54.62); blood (gm) (HP diet=1029.52 and LP diet=1146.47) and INF = 1142.45 and NIF = 1032.54), head and hide (gm) (HP diet = 5645.32 and LP diet = 970.54; INF = 6221.32 and NIF = 5394.54); visceral organs (gm) (HP diet = 4151.66 and LP diet = 4740.92; INF = 4728.35 and NIF = 4164.23). The results of this study showed that supplementation of high dietary protein level above animals need may not be beneficial in improving the variables monitored against <span>Haemonchosis</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"4f9cf48c5c337d8784a1804b9ea35a579872aba15dfa6f3d220428cffd1fe4af","category":"Environment"}
