{"title":"Enhanced SAR Compression through Multi-Look Doppler Compensation and Auto-Focusing Technique","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1479/v1","date":1726727962000,"content":"This paper presents a simple and streamlined compensation technique for improving the quality of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images based on the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA). Incorrect Doppler estimation in space orbit, caused by unexpected radar motion errors, orbit mismatches, and other factors, can significantly degrade SAR image quality. These inaccuracies result in mismatches between the azimuth-matched filter and the received Doppler chirp signal. To address this issue, we propose a Doppler estimation method that leverages the Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) and cross-correlation techniques. The received signals are compared with the azimuth-matched filter based on the rotation angle in the FrFT domain, and the Doppler centroid is adjusted to achieve optimal alignment. This process ensures high correlation values and enhanced resolution in the final SAR image. The efficacy of the proposed technique is validated through experiments using real spaceborne SAR data from the practical satellite. The results demonstrate significant improvements in image quality and resolution compared to conventional algorithms, highlighting the advantages of our approach for various remote sensing applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f49e9a07268dc953032c6317c5bb121bc2f3240275f01c8f1f82586151bc3d10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
