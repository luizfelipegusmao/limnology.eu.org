Equipping FIB based instruments with various detection units for the different accessible signals gives the user access to very complementary techniques to perform advanced correlative studies on a vast variety of sample systems. Most commonly, secondary electron (SE) detection is used to perform high-resolution imaging with good topographic contrast, while the mass filtered detection of emitted secondary ions (SI) enables high-sensitivity chemical analysis of the sample in 2D and 3D.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ca416dbce30d4918b974f541a45cd9aed45e6e0f0a2920bdbf2b78267e36c8a7","category":"Environment"}
