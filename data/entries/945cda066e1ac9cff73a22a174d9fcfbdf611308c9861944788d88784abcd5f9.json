{"title":"Ghrelin/GHSR System in Depressive Disorder: Pathologic Roles and Therapeutic Implication","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0039/v1","date":1717462413000,"content":"Depression is the most common chronic mental illness and is characterized by low mood, insomnia, and affective disorders. However, the pathological mechanisms of depression remain unclear. Numerous studies have suggested that the ghrelin/GHSR system may be involved in the pathophysiologic process of depression. Ghrelin plays a dual role in the experimental animals, increasing depressed behavior and decreasing anxiety. By combining several neuropeptides and traditional neurotransmitter systems to construct neural networks, it modifies signals connected to depression. The present review emphasizes the role of ghrelin in neuritogenesis, astrocyte protection, inflammatory factor production, and endocrine disruption in depression. Furthermore, ghrelin/GHSR can activate multiple signaling pathways to produce antidepressant effects, including cAMP/CREB/BDNF, PI3K/Akt, Jak2/STAT3, and p38-MAPK. Given the antidepressant effects of ghrelin/GHSR1a system, it is expected to become a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of depression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"945cda066e1ac9cff73a22a174d9fcfbdf611308c9861944788d88784abcd5f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
