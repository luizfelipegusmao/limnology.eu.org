{"title":"Underutilised palm stearin as hard stock for deep‐frying medium and its performance for oil uptake in instant noodles","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13278?af=R","date":1712732400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>As a by-product of the palm oil industry, palm stearin is often overlooked despite having several beneficial properties, such as excellent stability, which is critically essential to meet the demand of the global food trend in producing safer processed food. Specifically, deep frying of food is often associated with the production of toxic compounds that could potentially migrate into the food system when oils are degraded under continuous heating. The incorporation of palm stearin is regarded as a cost-effective and efficient method to modify the fatty acid composition of oils, enhance the frying qualities and lower the degradation rate.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>This study blended 5% and 10% palm stearin into palm oil to investigate the deep-frying performance and impact on food quality. Increasing the palm stearin content improved the frying oil's oxidative and hydrolytic stability, evidenced by reduction of total polar material, free fatty acid and total oxidation value. Addition of palm stearin increased the slip melting point which improved the oil's oxidative stability but no significant increase in oil content of instant noodles was observed. Scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy showed the formation of larger pores in the noodle structure that facilitated oil retention.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Blending palm stearin into frying oil enhanced the frying stability and minimally affected the oil uptake in instant noodles. This article presents the viability of blending palm stearin into frying oils to develop longer-lasting frying oils. © 2024 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Eldwin Ze Hao Ooi, \nNur Azwani Ab Karim, \nEng‐Seng Chan, \nYong Wang, \nTeck‐Kim Tang, \nShi Cheng Tong, \nYih Phing Khor, \nYee‐Ying Lee","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"9ed0f85add74a147de37eb35a63f1586b3103b33f17edfb9119dd6a21a9312ae","category":"Environment"}
