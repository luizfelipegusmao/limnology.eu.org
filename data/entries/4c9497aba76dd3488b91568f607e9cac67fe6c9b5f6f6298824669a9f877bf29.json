{"title":"Extreme Behavior of Competing Risks with Random Sample Size","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0661/v1","date":1720513311000,"content":"This paper examines the impact of random sample sizes on the extreme value theory of competing risks, a significant area in finance and environmental science. We capture limit distributions of two extreme types under random sampling sizes, known as accelerated mixed l-max and p-max stable type distributions. The study presents results for both maxima and minima in competing risks scenarios, addressing cases of independent and non-independent random sample sizes. Numerical examples validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the applicability of our approach to various random sample size distributions, including time-shifted Poisson or binomial, geometric, and negative binomial distributions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c9497aba76dd3488b91568f607e9cac67fe6c9b5f6f6298824669a9f877bf29","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
