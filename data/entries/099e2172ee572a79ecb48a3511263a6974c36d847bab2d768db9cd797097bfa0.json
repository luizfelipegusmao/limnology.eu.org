{"title":"Experimental System for Optical Wireless Video Transmission Based on Adaptive Block Sampling Compressive Sensing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0048/v1","date":1725269178000,"content":"Optical wireless video transmission technology combines the advantages of high data rates, enhanced security, large bandwidth capacity, and strong anti-interference capabilities inherent in optical communication, establishing it as a pivotal technology in contemporary data transmission networks. However, video data comprises a large volume of image information, resulting in substantial data flow with significant redundant bits. To address this, we propose an adaptive block sampling compressive sensing algorithm that overcomes the limitations of sampling inflexibility in traditional compressive sensing, which often leads to either redundant or insufficient local sampling. This method significantly reduces the presence of redundant bits in video images. First, the sampling mechanism of the block-based compressive sensing algorithm was optimized. Subsequently, a wireless optical video transmission experimental system was developed using a Field-Programmable Gate Array chip. Finally, experiments were conducted to evaluate the transmission of video optical signals. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio by over 3 dB compared to other algorithms, with an enhancement exceeding 1.5 dB even in field tests, thereby significantly optimizing video transmission quality. This research contributes essential technical insights for the enhancement of wireless optical video transmission performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"099e2172ee572a79ecb48a3511263a6974c36d847bab2d768db9cd797097bfa0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
