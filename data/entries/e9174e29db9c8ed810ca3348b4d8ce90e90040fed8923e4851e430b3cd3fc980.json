Reducing the abundance of this pathogen in poultry meat is challenging but essential. This study assessed the impact of <i>Lactobacillus</i>-fermented rapeseed meal (LFRM) on broilers exposed to <i>C. jejuni-</i>contaminated litter, evaluating growth performance, <i>Campylobacter</i> levels, and metagenomic profile.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>By day 35, the litter contamination successfully colonized broilers with <i>Campylobacter</i> spp., particularly <i>C. jejuni</i>. In the grower phase, LFRM improved (<i>P &lt;</i> 0.05) body weight and daily weight gain, resulting in a 9.2% better feed conversion ratio during the pre-challenge period (the period before artificial infection; days 13–20). The LFRM also reduced the <i>C. jejuni</i> concentration in the ceca (<i>P &lt;</i> 0.05), without altering alpha and beta diversity. However, metagenomic data analysis revealed LFRM targeted a reduction in the abundance of <i>C. jejuni</i> biosynthetic pathways of <span>l</span>-tryptophan and <span>l</span>-histidine and gene families associated with transcription and virulence factors while also possibly leading to selected stress-induced resistance mechanisms.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The study demonstrated that LFRM inclusion improved growth and decreased cecal <i>Campylobacter</i> spp. concentration and the relative abundance of pivotal <i>C. jejuni</i> genes. Performance benefits likely resulted from LFRM metabolites. At the molecular level, LFRM may have reduced <i>C. jejuni</i> colonization, likely by decreasing the abundance of energy transduction and <span>l</span>-histidine and <span>l</span>-tryptophan biosynthesis genes otherwise required for bacterial survival and increased virulence. © 2024 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Farina Khattak, \nSalvatore Galgano, \nNinfa Rangel Pedersen, \nYan Hui, \nRikke Matthiesen, \nJos Houdijk","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"e9174e29db9c8ed810ca3348b4d8ce90e90040fed8923e4851e430b3cd3fc980","category":"Environment"}
