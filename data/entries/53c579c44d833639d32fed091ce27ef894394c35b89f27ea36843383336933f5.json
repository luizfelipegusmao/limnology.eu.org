{"title":"Digital Transformation in SMEs: Pre and Post-Covid-19 Era: A Comparative Bibliometric Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0944/v1","date":1728688633000,"content":"This paper presents a comparative bibliometric analysis of digital transformation in small and medium enterprises, focusing on the before and after the Covid-19 pandemic. Using data from the Scopus database, the study analyzes 1,566 articles published between 2001 and 2024, focusing on pre-COVID (2001–2018) and post-COVID (2019–2024). Bibliometric tools, including VOSviewer and Biblioshiny, were employed to conduct performance analysis, scientific mapping, and co-occurrence analyses of keywords and co-authorship. The results demonstrate a substantial increase in research output post-COVID, particularly in areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and e-commerce. These technologies have become vital for the survival and competitiveness of SMEs in the post-pandemic world. However, the study also highlights significant challenges, including limited financial resources and a lack of skilled personnel, which have hindered SMEs' ability to implement digital transformation fully. Government intervention, through financial assistance and strategic support, is identified as crucial in enabling SMEs to overcome these obstacles and successfully navigate the digital era. This analysis contributes to the growing body of literature on SMEs' digitalization, offering key insights for policymakers, researchers, and businesses aiming to adapt to the evolving digital landscape in a post-pandemic economy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53c579c44d833639d32fed091ce27ef894394c35b89f27ea36843383336933f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
