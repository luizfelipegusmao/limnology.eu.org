{"title":"First detection of hepatitis B virus subgenotype A5, and characterization of occult infection and hepatocellular carcinoma-related mutations in Latin American and African immigrants in Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0971/v1","date":1718356085000,"content":"This study aims to characterize the molecular profile of hepatitis B virus (HBV) among socially vulnerable immigrants residing in Brazil to investigate the introduction of uncommon HBV strains into the country. Serum samples from 102 immigrants with positive serology for HBV core antibody (anti-HBc) were tested for the presence of HBV DNA by PCR assays. Among these, 24 were also positive for the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). The full or partial genome was sequenced to determine genotype by phylogenetic analysis. Participants were from Haiti (79.4%), Guinea Bissau (11.8%), Venezuela (7.8%), and Colombia (1%). Of the 21 HBV DNA-positive samples, subgenotypes A1 (52.4%), A5 (28.6%), E (9.5%), F2 (4.8%), and F3 (4.8%) were identified. Among the 78 HBsAg-negative participants, four were positive for HBV DNA, resulting in an occult HBV infection rate of 5.1%. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that most strains were likely introduced to Brazil by migration. Importantly, 80% of A5 sequences had the A1762T/G1764A double mutation, linked to an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma development. In conclusion, this study is the first report of HBV subgenotype A5 in Brazil, shedding new light on the diversity of HBV strains circulating in the country. Understanding the genetic diversity of HBV in immigrant communities can lead to better prevention and control strategies, benefiting both immigrants and the broader society.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"159d8e45edb28eff7f36ad4b3683df0641ceaae18c52e5dd2ae13988f484d7f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
