Lowes</p>\r\nPurpose <p>This single-arm prospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and utility of in-home body weight support harness system (BWSS) use in children treated for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).</p> Methods <p>Individuals with 2 or 3 copies of <i>SMN2</i> who received pharmacotherapeutic treatment, had head control, and weight &lt;50lbs were enrolled. Families were provided a BWSS and documented use. Motor outcome assessments were completed at baseline, month 3 and month 6. Families provided feedback in an end of study survey.</p> Results <p>All 32 participants (2.9 (SD 1.9) yrs), improved or remained stable on all outcomes. Average reported frequency of use was 4.1(2.3) hrs/week. Controlling for other covariates, frequency of use explained over 70% of the variability in change scores. Family feedback was overwhelmingly positive.</p> Conclusion <p>Use of in-home BWSS is a safe, feasible and useful option to increase exercise dosage after treatment in SMA and may help optimize motor abilities.</p> Trial registration <p>Study registered with: Clinicaltrials.govClinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT05715749.</p>","author":"Megan A.
