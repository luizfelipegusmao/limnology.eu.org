{"title":"The Interplay between 2-Arachidonoylglycerol and Anandamide Amidohydrolase in Neuropathy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0771/v1","date":1715596230000,"content":"The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a complex neuromodulatory network in the human body that have enormous impact in developing the central nervous system, as well as modulates various physiological processes. The ECS is made up of anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), which are responsible for the synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids, and enzymes such as FAAH and MAGL ensures the precise control over endocannabinoid levels. The ECS relies on CB1 receptors found in the central nervous system (CNS), and CB2 receptors found in the peripheral nervous system and immune cells.  Dysregulation of the ECS has been associated with several health conditions, prompting investigations into its association with phytocannabinoids to harness their therapeutic potential. The ECS is intricately linked with the nervous system, and it is known to modulate neuronal activities in the CNS, influencing pain and mood modulation. The ECS is also associated with neuropathies-peripheral nerve damage leading to symptoms such as weakness, numbness and pain as evidenced in diabetic neuropathy, Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, and postherpetic neuralgia.  The focus of this review is on the interplay between 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide amidohydrolase in neuropathy, elucidating their roles in pain regulation, inflammation, and specific neuropathies. The knowledge generated is expected to have broad implications, providing comprehensive insights into neuropathic conditions and how to improve on them. Ultimately, this understanding may lead to more effective treatments and improved quality of life for individuals affected by these conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39082b6ccaf5b571162fac8b6e65f5d78771390096e7dd54f49efe94991328ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
