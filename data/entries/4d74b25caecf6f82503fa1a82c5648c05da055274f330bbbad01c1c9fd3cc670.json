{"title":"Effect of Temperature Over the Growth and Biofilm Formation of the Thermotolerant Aspergillus flavus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1082/v1","date":1726219549000,"content":"Aspergillus flavus is a medically relevant fungus, particularly in tropical regions. Thermotolerance is a key virulence factor as an opportunistic pathogen, as well as its ability to form biofilms, which can impact therapeutic outcomes. To know how temperature affects the growth and biofilm formation of an A. flavus isolate, we assessed its growth on solid media and described the morphological changes during conidial germination. We also examined formation and composition of in vitro biofilm incubated at different temperatures and compared the susceptibility of planktonic and biofilm cells to antifungal agents. Our results showed that temperature promotes conidiation on solid media. The radial growth was higher at 28 °C, but total conidia was higher at 37 °C, however, conidial density was stronger at 42 °C. Moreover, incubation at 37 °C accelerates conidial germination and is the optimal temperature for biofilm formation. We described four distinct phases in A. flavus biofilm development: initiation (0-12h), consolidation (12-48h), maturation (48-72h), and dispersion (&amp;gt;72h), where the presence of aspergillar heads was notable at 42 °C. Carbohydrates and proteins are the main components of the extracellular matrix. We observed lipid droplets within the biofilm hyphae, and mature biofilms are resistant to amphotericin B and itraconazole, with MICs exceeding 16 g/mL for both antifungals, regardless of the incubation temperature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d74b25caecf6f82503fa1a82c5648c05da055274f330bbbad01c1c9fd3cc670","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
