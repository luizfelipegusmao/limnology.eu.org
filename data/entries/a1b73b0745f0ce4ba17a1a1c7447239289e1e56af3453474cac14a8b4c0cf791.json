{"title":"A review of using duckweed (Lemnaceae) in fish feeds","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/raq.12892?af=R","date":1718694827000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>One of the primary sustainability challenges in aquaculture is replacing fish meal with plant-based ingredients in aquafeeds. Plants are not optimal due to low protein content and antinutritional factors which can cause gut dysbiosis. Duckweed (<i>Lemnaceae</i>) is a family of aquatic plants with high protein content and has been used successfully for various types of animal feeds. In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 58 papers, we summarize the extent by which duckweed has been used in fish production including the species of fish tested, the grow-out stage of fish, and method of application. Duckweed studies spanned a total of 18 species of fish (16 freshwater and two marine) that collectively are valued at 263 billion USD annually, and comprise 28% of total aquaculture production by mass. The average experiment length was 72â€‰days (SD 42), primarily at the fingerling life stage. Duckweed was fed to the fish through live grazing, dried, and pelleted forms with 20% inclusion as the most common formulation. The <i>Lemna</i> spp., dominated by <i>L</i>. <i>minor</i>, <i>L</i>. <i>gibba</i>, and unknown <i>Lemna</i> species, were the most commonly used for feeds. <i>Spirodela polyrhiza</i> was the second most common. Duckweed inclusion levels between 15% and 30% were associated with positive outcomes on fish growth and feed conversion ratio without any negative impact on survival rates. Most duckweed species, especially from <i>Wollfiella</i> have not been tested as a fish feed but should be explored whereas most studies focused on freshwater fishes rather than marine.</p>","author":"Jeremiah J.
