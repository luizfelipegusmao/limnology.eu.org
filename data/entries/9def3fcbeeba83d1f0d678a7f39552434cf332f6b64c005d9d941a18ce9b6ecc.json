The sub-nm resolution 3D atomic distributions found in atom probe tomography (APT) data make an atom probe an ideal microscope for obtaining statistically significant MNP sizes and compositions. Unfortunately, collecting data from many MNPs is difficult because of the sample geometry needed for an APT experiment and the ease at which MNP containing samples fracture. There are limited published MNP APT data due to these major challenges [<a href=\"#ozae044.047-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9def3fcbeeba83d1f0d678a7f39552434cf332f6b64c005d9d941a18ce9b6ecc","category":"Environment"}
