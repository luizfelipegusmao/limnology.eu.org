{"title":"Bacterial Communities from the Antique Roman City of Carnuntum (Austria):16S r-RNA-Based Comparison of Soil Samples from Different Archaeological Horizons","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2333/v1","date":1727619864000,"content":"During recent archeological excavations in the Roman city of Carnuntum three spots with residues of streets, houses and side buildings from the time span between 1st and 4th century have been investigated. 40 soil samples taken from different layers gave the possibility to investigate the local soil bacterial communities by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of 16S rRNA. The background of this study was to check similarities and differences in the composition of microbial communities and to check of special types of proved bacteria or groups of them could be related to the archaeological findings. In result, the 16S rRNA data shows similarities between some samples, but also important differences in the compositions of soil bacterial communities of single samples. On the one hand, some samples are distinguished by the dominance of single major components from other samples. On the other hand, specific differences between soil samples are reflected by the patterns of mediate and less abundant bacterial groups. This supports the hypothesis, that differences in soil bacteria composition are strongly influenced by differences of the deposed soil material and, therefore, dependent on ancient human activities which created the deposits and local ancient environmental conditions many hundred years ago. This “echo” of ancient human impact on local soil bacteria composition is reflected, for example, by manure- and oil-related OTUs originating from two different street surfaces as well as by contaminated and mixed soil fills and ancient hearths and fire places. The findings support the concept of “ecological memory of soil” meaning that early impacts impress traces in the composition of soil bacterial communities which are detectable up to the present.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3bfd75dc1d7e49c12006da79d49e0da157ad05a63428e63462d6765af5b38d41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
