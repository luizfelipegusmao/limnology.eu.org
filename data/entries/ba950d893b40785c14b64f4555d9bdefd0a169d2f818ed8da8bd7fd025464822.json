{"title":"From Phonons to Domain Walls, the Central Peak and &ldquo;Critical Slowing Down&rdquo;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0837/v1","date":1723467033000,"content":"We investigate perovskite oxides from different aspects, namely their pseudoharmonic dynamical properties, their dynamical properties when strong anharmonicity exists and the intriguing functionalities arising from domain walls. Taking these viewpoints together yields a rather complex picture of this material class which was not anticipated in previous approaches. It opens pathways to novel applications and reveals the rich ground states beyond the fictitious belief in ‘simplicity of perovskites and such structures’.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba950d893b40785c14b64f4555d9bdefd0a169d2f818ed8da8bd7fd025464822","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
