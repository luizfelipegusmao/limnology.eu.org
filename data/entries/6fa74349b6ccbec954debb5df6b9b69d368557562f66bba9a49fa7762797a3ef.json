{"title":"Analysis of Sea Surface Observation Trajectory Based on the External Coincident Accuracy of Seafloor Geodetic Station Positioning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1062/v1","date":1728905211000,"content":"Seafloor geodetic station positioning generally uses internal precision to judge the quality of the positioning result, which has many limitations. This paper proposes to use a seafloor geodetic station structure, which can obtain the external coincident accuracy of the acoustic beacon positioning, to evaluate the quality of the observation configuration. The results of the sea trial show that a circular line with a radius of 2 times the depth of the water has an internal precision and an external coincident accuracy of approximately 0.02m; this circular line path also happens to be the best trajectory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6fa74349b6ccbec954debb5df6b9b69d368557562f66bba9a49fa7762797a3ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
