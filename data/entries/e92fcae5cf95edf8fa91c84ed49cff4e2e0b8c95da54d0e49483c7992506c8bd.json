Here, we present a protocol for generating skin organoids (SKOs) from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) via direct embryoid body formation. This method provides a consistent start point for hiPSC differentiation, resulting in SKOs with complex skin architecture and appendages (e.g. hair follicles, sebaceous glands, etc.) across hiPSC lines from two different somatic sources.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"e92fcae5cf95edf8fa91c84ed49cff4e2e0b8c95da54d0e49483c7992506c8bd","category":"Environment"}
