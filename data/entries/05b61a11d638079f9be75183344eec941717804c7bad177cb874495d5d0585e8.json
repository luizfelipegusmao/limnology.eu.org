{"title":"Air Pollution and Blood Pressure: Evidence From Indonesia","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GH001014?af=R","date":1719921966000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Indonesia faces significant air quality issues due to multiple emissions sources, including rapid urbanization and peatland fires associated with agricultural land management. Limited prior research has estimated the episodic shock of intense fires on morbidity and mortality in Indonesia but has largely ignored the impact of poor air quality throughout the year on biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. We conducted a cross-sectional study of the association between particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and blood pressure. Blood pressure measurements were obtained from the fifth wave of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS5), an ongoing population-based socioeconomic and health survey. We used the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to simulate daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations at 0.5° × 0.625° resolution across the IFLS domain. We assessed the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and diastolic and systolic blood pressure, using mixed effects models with random intercepts for regency/municipality and household and adjusted for individual covariates. An interquartile range increase in monthly PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure was associated with a 0.234 (95% CI: 0.003, 0.464) higher diastolic blood pressure, with a greater association seen in participants age 65 and over (1.16 [95% CI: 0.24, 2.08]). For the same exposure metric, there was a 1.90 (95% CI: 0.43, 3.37) higher systolic blood pressure in participants 65 and older. Our assessment of fire-specific PM<sub>2.5</sub> yielded null results, potentially due to the timing and locations of health data collection. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence for an association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and blood pressure in Indonesia.</p>","author":"Jaime Madrigano, \nDaisy Yan, \nTianjia Liu, \nEimy Bonilla, \nNina Yulianti, \nLoretta J.
