{"title":"Beliefs and Previous Concepts about Physical Education in Primary Education Undergraduate Students","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1849/v1","date":1714294729000,"content":"The approach to the personal experience and previous ideas about Physical Education of future Primary Education teachers is a starting point of great interest for the teaching of the subject of Didactics of Physical Education. The study aims to investigate these prior beliefs and to verify to what extent this initial perception changes after taking the course on “Didactics of Physical Education”. A concurrent mixed-methods study was conducted, which included two data collection procedures: (1) a pre-experimental design with a single group featuring pre-test and post-test; (2) the analysis of students' autobiographical accounts of their school experience with physical education. The participants were students enrolled in the Bachelor’s degree program in Primary Education at the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC) who undertook the course last year. The results obtained reveal that after taking the subject of Didactics of Physical Education, students give greater value to more positive concepts of learning, socializing, participating, and playing, among others. Similarly, in the post-test, the assessment of concepts such as competitiveness and physical fatigue diminished. In their autobiographical memories, students associate good memories with relationships with classmates and the playful and socializing nature of the subject; and among the bad memories, they highlight the content related to physical performance, competitiveness, and lack of attention to the diversity of students and their individual characteristics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57eedc38ba53a6551bfb57c91480ade3aa474378fe78385f709662b273ee2fbb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
