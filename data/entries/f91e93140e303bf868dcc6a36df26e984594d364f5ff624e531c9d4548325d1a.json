{"title":"Exploring needs and requirements for a prototype device measuring physical activity in pediatric physical therapy: A qualitative study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305968","date":1719324000000,"content":"<p>by Barbara Engels, Corelien J.

Bloemen</p>\r\nAims <p>To analyze needs and requirements of Pediatric Physical Therapists (PPTs), parents, children and adolescents with and without developmental disabilities in the future use of an activity monitor prototype (AM-p) in everyday clinical practice.</p> Methods <p>Qualitative exploratory study with a thematic analysis approach, based on Braun and Clarke’s six steps. Codes derived from the analysis and central themes were collated, based on Fleuren et al.’s groupings of determinants.</p> Results <p>We interviewed 25 PPTs, 12 parents, and 12 children and adolescents. Within four groupings of determinants, we found nine themes: 1) development of information materials; 2) application: output visualization and ease of use; 3) design; 4) relevance and acceptance; 5) shared decision-making; 6) compatibility in daily living; 7) finances, 8) time, and 9) legislation and regulations.</p> Conclusions <p>End-users have similar basic needs, with individual fine-tuning to be addressed during further development of the AM-p. A child-friendly design, information material, and an easy-to-use application to read and interpret results, need to be developed. Efficient training for PPTs is important for the use of the AM-p and analysis of results. Communication between PPTs and children as well as parents enhances shared decision-making. We recommend involving diverse end-users to enable maximum customization of the AM-p.</p>","author":"Barbara Engels","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f91e93140e303bf868dcc6a36df26e984594d364f5ff624e531c9d4548325d1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
