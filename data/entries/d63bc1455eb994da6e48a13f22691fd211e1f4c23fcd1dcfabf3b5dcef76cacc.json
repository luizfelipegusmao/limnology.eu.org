Increasing recognition of the interaction between biological, geomorphological and hydrological processes has led to the development of ‘Stage 0’ river restoration. Stage 0 reaches are typically multi-thread anabranching systems connected to the floodplain and its ecosystems. It is suggested that the defining characteristic of Stage 0 conditions is that of connectivity (longitudinal, lateral and vertical) at base flows. The methods or mechanisms that can re-create such reaches are described, namely valley floor reset, beaver activity, beaver dam analogues and the use of large wood in the channel and floodplain. The scope for wider adoption of Stage 0 is then discussed and recommendations for expanding this approach across temperate regions with a long history of river modification and higher population densities are presented.</p>","author":"Stewart J.
