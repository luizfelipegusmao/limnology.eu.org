{"title":"Comparative Simulation of Plasmonic Nanostructures: Optical Response of Periodic Metal Nanostrip and Nanodisk Arrays on Mirror","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1593/v1","date":1711450488000,"content":"In this work, two plasmonic structures with two different periodic nanostructures (nanodisk and nanostrip arrays) separated from the gold layer by an ultrathin dielectric Al2O3 layer are proposed, and their optical properties are simulated as 3-dimensional models using COMSOL Multiphysics software tool. The optical responses, such as the amplification of the electric field and the scattering, absorption and extinction cross sections of the two structures, are investigated and compared. The results show that both structures show strong field enhancement in their gap layer, and the structure with the periodic array of metal nanodisks shows stronger field enhancement and larger absorption, extinction, and scattering cross sections in its dipole resonance wavelength, which is defined as a bright plasmonic mode. In addition, some weaker resonant modes are observed for both structures and the reason for their generation is dis-cussed. The analysis of different possible modes in such structures is crucial for their application in various fields.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"365a2b8499d7d0052b1bcf0510064f9683077a4af32f94d1a40c8718dd6bbeb4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
