Part 1: Synthesis and Analytical Description","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0375/v1","date":1717748000000,"content":"This study describes the synthesis and characterization of mixed hydrotalciteâ€“organosilica membrane for gas separation. Hydrotalcite exhibits the capability to adsorb carbon dioxide at elevated temperatures. High surface area and favorable coating properties are essential to harness its potential for practical applications. Stable alcohol-based dispersions are needed for thin film applications of mixed membranes containing hydrotalcite. Currently, producing such dispersions without the need for delamination and dispersion agents is a challenging task. This work introduces for the first time a manufacturing approach to overcoming the drawbacks mentioned above. It includes a synthesis of hydrotalcite nanoparticles, followed by agent-free delamination of their layers and final dispersion into alcohol without dispersion agents. Further, the hydrotalcite-derived sorption agent is dispersed in a matrix based on organo-silica gels derived from 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane (BTESE). The analytical results indicate that the interconnection between hydrotalcite and BTESE-derived gel occurs via forming a strong hydrogen bonding system between the interlayer species (OH groups, CO32-) of hydrotalcite and oxygen and silanol active gel centers. These findings lay the foundation for applications involving incorporating hydrotalcite-like compounds into silica matrices, ultimately enabling the development of materials with exceptional mass transfer properties. In part 2 of this study, gas separation performance of the organo-silica and the hydrotalcite-like materials and their combined form will be investigated","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbd0777e9e2d6b0556b1712db5c49171b271d7de367b87b433dc048bebc91b0d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
