{"title":"Seasonal dynamics of the microbial community in a strong‐flavor baijiu fermentation","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13485?af=R","date":1720851246000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The microbial community plays a crucial role in Chinese strong-flavor baijiu (SFB) fermentation. However, the seasonal dynamics of the microbial community in the SFB fermentation system and its contribution to the unique flavor of SFB have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the seasonal dynamics of the microbial community through 16S rRNA and ITS gene sequencing.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results revealed significant temporal dynamics of microbial communities and environmental variables throughout the four seasons. The influence of seasons on fungal communities was found to be more significant than on bacterial communities. The diversity of bacteria was higher during the winter and summer, whereas fungal diversity was more prominent in summer and autumn. Stochastic processes maintained their dominance in microbial assembly throughout all four seasons but the significance of heterogeneous selection increased during summer for both bacteria and fungi, whereas homogeneous selection became more pronounced during winter for fungi. The pH and environmental temperature were important drivers of microbial community assembly across different seasons, primarily impacting the core genera responsible for the production of major volatile flavor compounds (VFCs), especially ethyl caproate.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These findings provide new insights into the impact of seasons on microbial communities and hold promise for improving the quality-control measures for SFB brewed in different seasons. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Lingjuan Li, \nJing Wu, \nYong Tao, \nZhancheng Xu, \nQinglan Tang, \nMenghua Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"f5dccfd7c8083bcb2aab9c142152a589ec934f4cce6e693075847382b5f65d13","category":"Environment"}
