{"title":"Exploring the Challenges and Opportunities of Social Media for Organizational Engagement in SMEs: A Comprehensive Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1438/v1","date":1729262470000,"content":"Social media platforms have become pivotal tools for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), offering vast opportunities for enhanced organizational engagement. However, these platforms also present challenges such as data privacy concerns, feedback management, and content saturation. This systematic review critically evaluates the existing literature on the dual role of social media in fostering organizational engagement while addressing key barriers faced by SMEs. We systematically assessed 104 peer-reviewed articles sourced from Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, focusing on the impact of social media on marketing strategies and organizational outcomes in SMEs. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for quality assessment, and effect measures, including mean difference and odds ratio, were employed to evaluate performance metrics such as customer engagement, business performance, and long-term organizational impact. Key findings indicate that 74% of SMEs reported improvements in brand visibility, with customer engagement increasing by 65%. However, significant concerns were identified, with 45% of studies highlighting privacy issues and 52% addressing challenges in managing negative feedback. The review emphasizes that while social media can enhance market reach and customer interaction, its effectiveness largely depends on strategic content management and planning. This review provides actionable insights for SMEs aiming to optimize social media use, highlighting the need for future research to address privacy management and feedback strategies for sustained success.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"42244de23e988e936e1121dbd05fc3cb27c8e8a8cda86cefa0c183227c63e131","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
