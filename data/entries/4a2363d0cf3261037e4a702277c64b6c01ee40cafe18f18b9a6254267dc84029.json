{"title":"Correlation of ammonia and blood laboratory parameters with hepatic encephalopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307899","date":1725372000000,"content":"<p>by Ali Sepehrinezhad, Negin Ghiyasi Moghaddam, Navidreza Shayan, Sajad Sahab Negah</p>\r\nBackground and objectives <p>Emerging research suggests that hyperammonemia may enhance the probability of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a condition associated with elevated levels of circulating ammonia in patients with cirrhosis. However, some studies indicate that blood ammonia levels may not consistently correlate with the severity of HE, highlighting the complex pathophysiology of this condition.</p> Methods <p>A systematic review and meta-analysis through PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Virtual Health Library were conducted to address this complexity, analyzing and comparing published data on various laboratory parameters, including circulating ammonia, blood creatinine, albumin, sodium, and inflammation markers in cirrhotic patients, both with and without HE.</p> Results <p>This comprehensive review, which included 81 studies from five reputable databases until June 2024, revealed a significant increase in circulating ammonia levels in cirrhotic patients with HE, particularly those with overt HE. Notably, significant alterations were observed in the circulating creatinine, albumin, sodium, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFÎ±) in HE patients.</p> Conclusions <p>These findings suggest an association between ammonia and HE and underscore the importance of considering other blood parameters such as creatinine, albumin, sodium, and pro-inflammatory cytokines when devising new treatment strategies for HE.</p>","author":"Ali Sepehrinezhad","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4a2363d0cf3261037e4a702277c64b6c01ee40cafe18f18b9a6254267dc84029","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
