{"title":"Microvesicles from quiescent and TGF-β1 stimulated hepatic stellate cells: Divergent impact on hepatic vascular injury","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306775","date":1720620000000,"content":"<p>by Jianlong Xie, Zhirong Ye, Xiaobing Xu, Anzhi Chang, Ziyi Yang, Qin Wu, Qunwen Pan, Yan Wang, Yanyu Chen, Xiaotang Ma, Huilai Miao</p>\r\nBackground <p>This study evaluated the effect of microvesicles(MVs) from quiescent and TGF-β1 stimulated hepatic stellate cells (HSC-MVs, TGF-β1HSC-MVs) on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) injury and CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced rat hepatic vascular injury.</p> Methods <p>HUVECs were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to establish a model for vascular endothelial cell injury. HSC-MVs or TGF-β1HSC-MVs were co-cultured with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated HUVECs, respectively. Indicators including cell survival rate, apoptosis rate, oxidative stress, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis were measured. Simultaneously, the expression of proteins such as PI3K, AKT, MEK1+MEK2, ERK1+ERK2, VEGF, eNOS, and CXCR4 was assessed, along with activated caspase-3. SD rats were intraperitoneally injected with CCl<sub>4</sub> twice a week for 10 weeks to induce liver injury models. HSC-MVs or TGF-β1HSC-MVs were injected into the tail vein of rats. Liver and hepatic vascular damage were also detected.</p> Results <p>In H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated HUVECs, HSC-MVs increased cell viability, reduced cytotoxicity and apoptosis, improved oxidative stress, migration, and angiogenesis, and upregulated protein expression of PI3K, AKT, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, VEGF, eNOS, and CXCR4. Conversely, <sup>TGF-β1</sup>HSC-MVs exhibited opposite effects. CCl<sub>4</sub>- induced rat hepatic injury model, HSC-MVs reduced the release of ALT and AST, hepatic inflammation, fatty deformation, and liver fibrosis. HSC-MVs also downregulated the protein expression of CD31 and CD34. Conversely, TGF-β1HSC-MVs demonstrated opposite effects.</p> Conclusion <p>HSC-MVs demonstrated a protective effect on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated HUVECs and CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced rat hepatic injury, while TGF-β1HSC-MVs had an aggravating effect. The effects of MVs involve PI3K/AKT/VEGF, CXCR4, and MEK/ERK/eNOS pathways.</p>","author":"Jianlong Xie","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"02787e3132ca7a08c840e1d42a508e58bd91b4e10b7170a3a8f12b88cc965d30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
