{"title":"The Impact of TMB on Immunotherapy Protocols: A Comprehensive Analysis of Four Major Cancers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2623/v1","date":1722592244000,"content":"Background: Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is increasingly recognized as a vital biomarker for predicting the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer treatment. Despite its growing importance, the effectiveness of TMB as a predictive marker are well established in lung cancer and melanoma but remain ambiguous for breast and prostate cancers. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the role of TMB in predicting response to ICIs across four major cancer types—lung, melanoma, breast, and prostate—and to address the variability in TMB's predictive value in different cancers. Methods: A comprehensive review of the current literature was performed, analysing studies that investigated TMB and its association with ICI therapy outcomes in the specified cancer types. Results: The analysis reveals a strong consensus on the predictive value of TMB in lung cancer and melanoma, where high TMB levels are associated with improved clinical outcomes and better responses to ICIs. In contrast, the evidence for breast and prostate cancers is less conclusive, with variability in results highlighting the need for further research. Specifically, high TMB in these cancers does not consistently predict better responses to ICIs, suggesting that additional biomarkers or refined criteria might be necessary. Conclusion: TMB is a promising biomarker for predicting responses to ICI therapy, particularly in lung cancer and melanoma. However, its predictive value in breast and prostate cancers remains uncertain, underscoring the need for more extensive studies. Future research should focus on standardizing TMB evaluation methods and exploring additional biomarkers to improve treatment personalization and outcomes in these cancer types.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c766871b72cf025ca825f84669b6a35f73dd0e99e1f32d59926c19b57941acb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
