{"title":"Stability and Gas Diffusion: A Theoretical Approach to Evanescence and Permanence in Oxyhydrogen Nanobubbles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2384/v1","date":1727685412000,"content":"Nanobubbles, gas-filled entities that possess a size of less than , have notably emerged as critical components within various domains such as environmental science and medicine, primarily due to their remarkable stability and distinctive diffusion characteristics that differentiate them from larger bubbles. This comprehensive study meticulously explores the diffusion rates and stability of hydrogen and oxygen when encapsulated in oxyhydrogen nanobubbles, specifically within aqueous environments, utilizing the Chapman-Enskog theory, which is a well-established framework for understanding gas diffusion processes, alongside a modified Arrhenius equation to effectively evaluate activation volume and stability parameters. The findings from this investigation reveal that the diffusion processes of both gasses experience a significant reduction in rate due to the influence of high internal pressure, as well as the molecular interactions occurring with water, whereby hydrogen is observed to exhibit a marginally accelerated diffusion rate in comparison to oxygen. It is crucial to understand that elements like surface charges, zeta potential, and the idea of activation volume significantly influence the enduring stability of nanobubbles, particularly in specific environmental scenarios that could boost their longevity. These significant findings pose a challenge to classical diffusion models, thereby suggesting a promising potential for the sustained application of nanobubbles in various fields such as water treatment processes and therapeutic medical interventions. Future research endeavors should prioritize the refinement of theoretical models while also aiming to experimentally validate the mechanisms of stability that have been observed across a range of diverse applications to further substantiate these findings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93ff52ef11bfea69c5531ea4cffd9e84507cbfd62c2b5d889efd7bb745190ead","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
