{"title":"From Ventricular Zone to Rich Club Networks: Tracing the Developmental Trajectory of Brain Connectivity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0213/v1","date":1714964032000,"content":"This article explores the intricate journey of neural progenitor cells from the ventricular zones of the embryonic brain, focusing on their pivotal role in the formation of rich club networks, which are integral to the brain's functional architecture. Initially, the ventricular zones, particularly the cerebral ventricular zone, serve as the primary sites for the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors, giving rise to various types of neurons and glial cells. We delve into the sequential migration patterns of these cells, emphasizing how early-migrating neurons, destined to form deeper cortical layers, establish extensive and robust connections, potentially evolving into rich club nodes. These nodes are characterized by their high-degree connectivity and serve as crucial hubs for integrating and disseminating information across disparate brain regions.The article further discusses the implications of this developmental pathway in the context of brain network efficiency, resilience, and cognitive function. We highlight how disruptions in early cell migration can lead to anomalies in rich club formation, drawing connections to various neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, ADHD and schizophrenia. Additionally, the significance of rich club nodes in maintaining efficient information transfer and network resilience is elucidated, underscoring their role in supporting complex cognitive processes and overall brain dynamics.In summary, this article offers a comprehensive overview of the developmental trajectory from the ventricular zones to the establishment of rich club networks, providing insights into the fundamental processes that shape the brain's intricate connectivity and functional capabilities.
