{"title":"The Small and Moderate Earthquake Parameters Training Catalog on the Main Faults in Sichuan, China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1484/v1","date":1718957252000,"content":"Numerous investigations have suggested that seismic source parameters and properties of the surrounding medium harbor valuable information regarding alterations in stress fields and medium properties at the focal depth. Monitoring the spatial and temporal evolution of these parameters can yield insights into variations in stress fields or medium properties within the seismogenic zone, offering a critical avenue to overcome the Earth's inaccessible nature. In recent years, modern seismic parameters such as seismic moment, focal mechanism solution, source stress drop, corner frequency, radiated seismic energy, rupture radius, and apparent stress have been increasingly used to characterize source characteristics. The Sichuan region is situated on the southeastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and is known for its strong eastward extrusion and structural deformation. The main fault zones in the area include the Xianshuihe Fault, Anninghe Zemuhe Fault, and Longmenshan Fault. This paper estimates source parameters of small to medium-sized earthquakes (ML 1.5-5.2) in the main fault zones and adjacent areas in Sichuan. A total of 4,310 earthquake stress drop measurements from 2019 to 2023 were analyzed to create a stress distribution image along the fault. This earthquake parameters training catalog provides insight into how coseismic stresses change and their relationship with other geophysical factors, as well as their spatial and temporal evolution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3da1af88683c994dbf7a820e467782d47f7b352953fe24aade3599ce98fa8d76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
