{"title":"The Cloud Model-Based Evaluation of Public Building Renewal Potential with the Game Theory Combination Weighting Methods-Case Study in China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0059/v1","date":1725260548000,"content":"Currently, urban renewal activities in China are booming. And promoting the renovation of public buildings is the key due to its large scale, high cost and significant impact to the nature and social environment. To reduce the ambiguity and uncertainty in evaluating the potential for renewal of existing public buildings, a renewal potential evaluation model combining game theory combination weighting method and cloud model theory is proposed. The paper constructs a comprehensive evaluation index system based on relevant standards and literature. Game theory is used to optimize the weights obtained by AHP and entropy weight methods to obtain a combined weight. MATLAB programming is used to calculate the comprehensive cloud parameters of the evaluation index for the potential renewal of existing public buildings and therefore generate cloud Graphs. Through case study in Nanjing of China, it has been demonstrated that the combination empowerment cloud model can objectively reflect the relationship between the fuzziness and randomness of evaluation indicators for public building renewal potential. The expression of cloud Graphs can intuitively reflect the magnitude of renewal and renovation potential and the degree of uncertainty in evaluation results. The research result provides useful references for the sustainable utilization of building resources in the era of building.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e876076251999424f6c6b2fb554d2550f328a6fe5dd3a479bbdb1e6c3f3e05f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
