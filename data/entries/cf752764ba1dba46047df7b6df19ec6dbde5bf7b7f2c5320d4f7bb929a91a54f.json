{"title":"Sustainability in Long-term Surface Mine Planning: A Systematic Review of Operations Research Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1474/v1","date":1726738392000,"content":"The mining industry, critical for global resource supply, has historically been linked to significant environmental degradation and social challenges including habitat disruption, water and soil contamination as well as fatalities. But recently the industry has been undergoing a transformative change to meet evolving environmental and societal expectations. Operations Research (OR) provides essential tools and techniques to optimize decision-making processes in this context. This paper presents a comprehensive review of different OR methods and their applications in balancing economic, social and environmental objectives in surface mine planning. By evaluating the strengths and limitations of these techniques, this review offers valuable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming to improve production efficiency and sustainability through advanced planning strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf752764ba1dba46047df7b6df19ec6dbde5bf7b7f2c5320d4f7bb929a91a54f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
