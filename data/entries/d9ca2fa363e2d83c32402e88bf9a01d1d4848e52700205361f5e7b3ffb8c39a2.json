{"title":"Volunteering as Meaningful Activity for People Living with Young Onset Dementia: A Thematic &lsquo;Co-Analysis&rsquo;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0114/v2","date":1727346094000,"content":"Volunteering has many social, emotional and health benefits and could be an option for people with younger/early onset dementia to engage in stage and age-appropriate, personally meaningful activities within their local communities. This study explored how people with young onset dementia volunteer in the UK, the benefits and barriers, and how we can improve access to volunteering opportunities. Audio data of people with young onset dementia discussing their experiences of volunteering were taken from the Dementia Diaries audio and video diary project (https://dementiadiaries.org/). The data were co-analysed by a co-production team, (X), made up of six researchers living with young onset dementia and two facilitators. The findings suggest that stigma is the overarching concept (or net) which influences peopleâ€™s experiences of volunteering with dementia. Within the stigma net, three themes were developed that employed a lifespan approach to challenging said stigma: 1) Valuing the past, 2) Valuing the present and 3) Valuing the future, each with additional subthemes. This research contributes to the limited pool of literature that highlights the clear benefits of volunteering for people with young onset dementia, while also considering how dementia stigma can create practical and institutional barriers to accessing volunteering. Guidance is provided for how to deliver meaningful and accessible volunteering opportunities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9ca2fa363e2d83c32402e88bf9a01d1d4848e52700205361f5e7b3ffb8c39a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
