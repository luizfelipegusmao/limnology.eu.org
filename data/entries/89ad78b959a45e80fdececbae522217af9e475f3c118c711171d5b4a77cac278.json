In addition, the fabrication of a considerable number of composites using PANI is found in the literature nowadays. Among other composites, PANI/metal composites are recognized for their useful electrochemical properties and versatility regarding the preparation of combined materials. Moreover, silver (Ag) nanoparticles were considered as a promising nanocomponent due to their compatibility in biological interactions with numerous biomolecules [<a href=\"#ozae044.301-B1\">1</a>]. The intrinsic efficiency of these metallic particles can be further improved by incorporating active organic compounds over the surface of these nanomaterials [<a href=\"#ozae044.301-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"89ad78b959a45e80fdececbae522217af9e475f3c118c711171d5b4a77cac278","category":"Environment"}
