{"title":"Genetic Diversity, Virulence, and Antibiotic Resistance Determinants of Campylobacter jejuni Isolates in Romania","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1430/v1","date":1721212495000,"content":"The emergence of antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter jejuni, a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, presents a significant public health challenge requiring vigilant surveillance and disease control. This study aimed to characterize C. jejuni strains isolated in Romania from 2017-2020, focusing on genetic diversity, virulence, and antibiotic resistance determinants. The isolates underwent phenotypical testing, PCR, and antibiotic resistance assessment using Disc Diffusion Kirbyâ€“Bauer for ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, erythromycin, and tetracycline. Genetic analysis identified resistance and virulence genes, point mutations, and performed sequence typing (7-gene MLST) to determine genetic relatedness. Results indicated substitutions at position 86 in the amino acid sequence or position 257 in the nucleotide sequence of the gyrA gene in 47 fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates. Additionally, mutations in the rRNA23S gene at positions 2074 and 2075, associated with macrolide resistance, were found in 12 of the 66 isolates. Allelic profiles generated 38 sequence types (STs), including three new STs not present in the reference database. The sequence data analysis revealed a genetically diverse C. jejuni population with a weak clonal structure. This study provides crucial insights into the genetic diversity and antibiotic resistance of C. jejuni strains in Romania, highlighting the need for ongoing surveillance and control measures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b9d8fdf31028a27693b88b9ba2a39fa0caa1729296f09b4d7cc5c3342eedd6df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
