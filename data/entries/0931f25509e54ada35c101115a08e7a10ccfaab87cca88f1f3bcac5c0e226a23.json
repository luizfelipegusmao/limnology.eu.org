{"title":"Rise in Cyber Threats in the United States and the Need for Advanced Cyber Risk Mitigation Tools and Adequate Skills to Combat Cyber Threats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1813/v1","date":1727129678000,"content":"The United States is facing an alarming surge in cyberattacks, with data breaches rising by 72% since 2021, presenting grave national security risks. Notable incidents, including Chinese hackers attempting to access high-level government information and Iranian-linked cyber groups targeting U.S. water systems, highlight the fragility of critical infrastructure. These attacks pose dangers not only to national security but also to economic stability and public health, amplified by the rapid growth of interconnected technologies and global digitalization. In response to these escalating threats, the U.S. must take a multifaceted approach. Key strategies include strengthening cybersecurity education and workforce development, enforcing more rigorous regulatory frameworks, and enhancing preparedness through incident response and recovery planning. Additionally, increased international cooperation is essential to address state-sponsored cyber threats and foster a global framework for cybersecurity defense. As cyber threats continue to evolve, future efforts will rely on technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time threat detection, the adoption of zero-trust security models, and the development of adaptive, resilient cybersecurity infrastructures. Collaboration between the public and private sectors, coupled with ongoing innovation and education, will be critical to maintaining national security and promoting economic growth in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0931f25509e54ada35c101115a08e7a10ccfaab87cca88f1f3bcac5c0e226a23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
