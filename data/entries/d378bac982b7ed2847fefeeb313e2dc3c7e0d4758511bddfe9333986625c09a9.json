{"title":"Phase Transformation Characterization of High-Pressure Olivine Polymorphs in Shocked Meteorites using STEM-EDS and 4D-STEM","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.1049/7720323?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Understanding the physical and chemical properties of high-pressure minerals is essential to understanding the structure and composition of the Earth’s interior [<a href=\"#ozae044.1049-B1\">1</a>]. However, knowledge of underlying transformation mechanisms is needed to explain dynamic geophysical processes such as subducted slab geometry and deep-focus earthquakes [<a href=\"#ozae044.1049-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1049-B3\">3</a>]. Whereas high-pressure transitions of the dominant mantle mineral olivine (Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> to wadsleyite (wds) at ∼410 km and to ringwoodite (rwd) at ∼520 km depth occur at geological timescales, these transformations can also occur during shock processes in chondritic meteorites, thought to represent the building blocks of the Earth [<a href=\"#ozae044.1049-B1\">1</a>]. There are different olivine to rwd/wds phase transformation mechanisms that could occur simultaneously during high velocity asteroid collisions because of the rapid pressure-temperature-time path that remain to be determined. However, characterizing these mechanisms is challenging due to the nano- and microscale size of the crystals. Luckily, advances in electron microscopy have opened new avenues for multimodal, microstructural and chemical characterization of Earth and planetary materials. This study aims to untangle the shock-transformation mechanisms of high-pressure polymorphs of Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> in heavily shocked meteorites using Raman spectroscopy and 4D-STEM.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d378bac982b7ed2847fefeeb313e2dc3c7e0d4758511bddfe9333986625c09a9","category":"Environment"}
