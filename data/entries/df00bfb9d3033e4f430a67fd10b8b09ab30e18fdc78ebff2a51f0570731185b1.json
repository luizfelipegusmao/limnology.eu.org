The high resolution of this technique offers precise non-destructive morphological analysis and in combination with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) or/and Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (WDS) provides the elemental composition. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique for the identification and analysis of pigments and dyes contained within materials of historical relevance. Integrated into SEM, it provides a spatially resolved solution for chemical identification of organic and inorganic components in a material. Finally, the addition of BEX detection for combined BSE and X-ray imaging enables rapid identification of regions of interest. BEX also enables the micro-structure to be understood in the context of the macro-structure of the whole sample. Using these techniques in combination, to better understand these unique chemical compositions not only offers an insight into the diverse cultures of our past but also plays a vital role in helping to preserve and repair culturally significant works.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"df00bfb9d3033e4f430a67fd10b8b09ab30e18fdc78ebff2a51f0570731185b1","category":"Environment"}
