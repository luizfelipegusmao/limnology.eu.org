{"title":"Sympathetic Innervation of Interscapular Brown Adipose Tissue Is Not a Predominant Mediator of OT-Induced BAT Thermogenesis in Female High Fat Diet-Fed Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0284/v1","date":1725509297000,"content":"Previous studies in our lab show that that administration of OT into the fourth ventricle (4V; hindbrain) elicits weight loss and stimulates interscapular brown adipose tissue temperature (TIBAT) in male DIO rats. What remains unclear is whether chronic hindbrain (4V) OT can impact body weight in female high fat diet-fed (HFD) rodents and whether this involves activation of BAT. We hypothesized that OT-elicited stimulation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation of IBAT contributes to its ability to activate BAT and reduce body weight in female high fat diet-fed rats. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of disrupting SNS activation of IBAT on OT-elicited stimulation of TIBAT and reduction of body weight in DIO rats. We first measured the impact of bilateral surgical SNS denervation to IBAT on the ability of acute 4V OT (0.5, 1, and 5 µg ≈ 0.5, 0.99, and 4.96 nmol) to stimulate TIBAT in female HFD-fed rats. We found that the high dose of 4V OT (5 µg ≈ 4.96 nmol) stimulated TIBAT similarly between sham rats and denervated rats (P=NS). We subsequently measured the effect of bilateral surgical denervation of IBAT on the effect of chronic 4V OT (16 nmol/day ≈ 16.1 mg/day) or vehicle infusion to reduce body weight, adiposity and energy intake in female HFD-fed rats (N=7-8/group). Chronic 4V OT reduced body weight gain (sham:  -18.0±4.9 g; denervation:  -15.9±3.7 g) and adiposity (sham:  -13.9±3.7 g; denervation:  -13.6±2.4 g) relative to vehicle treatment (P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1c753abc190254ad1fdc8d0a622f90bad60b1052e10b7c84b46e1be7ae543db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
