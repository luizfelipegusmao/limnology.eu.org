{"title":"Designing a Scalable and Area-Efficient Hardware Accelerator Supporting Multiple PQC Schemes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0039/v1","date":1719814241000,"content":"This study introduces a hardware accelerator to support various Post-Quantum Cryptosystem (PQC) schemes, addressing the quantum computing threat to cryptographic security.\nPQCs, while more secure, also bring significant computational demands, especially problematic for lightweight devices.\nPrevious hardware accelerators are typically scheme-specific, which is inefficient given the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s multiple finalists.\nOur approach focuses on the shared operations among these schemes, allowing a single design to accelerate multiple candidate PQCs at the same time.\nThis is further enhanced by allocating resources according to performance profiling results.\nOur compact, scalable hardware accelerator supports four of NIST PQC finalists, achieving an area efficiency of up to 81.85\\% compared to the current state-of-the-art multi-scheme accelerator while supporting twice as many schemes.\nThe design demonstrates average throughput improvements ranging from 0.97$\\times$ to 35.97$\\times$ across the four schemes and their main operations, offering an efficient solution for implementing multiple PQC schemes within constrained hardware environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94b8a7679349b1ea2ffbe8384c4d335a824c476e48a9d051cfce7d2ab82a1fe4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
