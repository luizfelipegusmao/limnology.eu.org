Neonates are at risk of nutrient deficiencies because of maternal deficiencies, minimal body stores at birth and decreased nutritional intake. The pre-ruminant lamb relies solely on milk for adequate immunity and nutrition until they begin ingesting forages. Insufficiencies can lead to increased mortality and morbidity. However, deficiencies in the ewe are common due to variation in management, feeding and health protocols. A total of 10 lambs (5 sets of twins) were enrolled into the study. The lambs were divided into two groups (one twin from each set) received a treatment of an oral vitamin-mineral supplement (VitaFerst-Care) 3 mL and the control lambs a saline solution of 3 mL, all at 3 d of age (d0). Blood samples were collected, prior to, and again following supplementation (d 0, d 21) by jugular venipuncture. Vitamin A, vitamin E, iron (Fe) and selenium (Se) concentrations were determined in blood serum/plasma of the lambs by HPLC. Kidney and liver function markers were analyzed using HESKA DC5X veterinary analyzer to confirm the safety of the supplement. Variables tested included alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CREA), glucose (GLU), total protein (TP), total bilirubin (T-BILI), albumin (ALB), phosphorus (PHOS), calcium (CA), cholesterol (CHOL), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). All lambs remained with their mothers. The average difference was calculated between d 21 and d 0 (baseline) for treated versus control animals for vitamin A, vitamin E, Se, and Fe. Significance was calculated using a two-tailed studentâ€™s t-test where <span>P</span> &lt; 0.10 between d 21 control and treated animals. Control animals had an average vitamin E plasma concentration of 1.168 + 0.355 ppm on d 21, whereas treated animals had an average of 1.547 + 0.559 ppm. Significance was calculated at <span>P</span> = 0.09. Vitamin A, Fe and Se concentrations did not reach significance. Kidney and liver panel checks for animals in each group were not concerning. Future studies should look at modifying first and second sampling timepoints to be closer together. Based on results in calves with a similar study design, shortening the time between treatment and second sampling would give a clearer picture of how the neonatal supplement influenced the nutritional status of the treatment versus control animals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"c83e52a15966d48ef5a2950385d97893d5e64e756ebbeeed9220b4b0eea5cb4f","category":"Environment"}
