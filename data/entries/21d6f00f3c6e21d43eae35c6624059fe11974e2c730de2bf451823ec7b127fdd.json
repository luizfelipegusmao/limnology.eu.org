{"title":"Progressive Optimal Fault-Tolerant Control Combining Active and Passive Control Manners","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0920/v1","date":1710501049000,"content":"This study develops a progressive optimal fault-tolerant control method based on insufficient fault information. By combining passive and active fault-tolerant control manners during the process of fault diagnosis, insufficient fault information is fully used, and optimal fault-tolerant control effect is achieved. In addition, the fault-tolerant control method based on guaranteed robust cost control is introduced. The proposed progressive optimal fault-tolerant control method considers two aspects. First, as the amount of fault information continually increases, the performance index of the progressive optimal fault-tolerant controller improves. Second, at each moment, based on the corresponding insufficient fault information and prior knowledge, optimal fault-tolerant control is achieved according to current fault information. The process of progressive optimal fault-tolerant control converges to active fault-tolerant control when the fault is completely identified and the optimal fault-tolerant controller is no longer reconfigured until no more useful fault information can be provided. Furthermore, a progressive optimal fault-tolerant control algorithm based on the grid segmentation in the parameter uncertainty domain and the selection of different auxiliary center points is introduced. The simulation results verify the feasibility of the proposed algorithm and the validity of the proposed theory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"21d6f00f3c6e21d43eae35c6624059fe11974e2c730de2bf451823ec7b127fdd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
