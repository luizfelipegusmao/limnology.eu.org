Compared to microtomy or physical dissection, digital dissection and manipulation using 3D X-ray data is preferable for unique specimens, museum collections, or samples where it is important that structures or internal anatomy remain undisturbed [<a href=\"#ozae044.444-B1\">1</a>]. The reliability of micro-CT models for anatomical study allows for multiple dissections of the same individual that can be compared with other datasets at a quality comparable to a real dissection [<a href=\"#ozae044.444-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e739aae1ed170e324106a49370afb1c357efcc1eae8c774adfe02051062f0601","category":"Environment"}
