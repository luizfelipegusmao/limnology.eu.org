{"title":"Faster dieback of rainforests altering tropical carbon sinks under climate change","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1038/s41612-024-00793-0","date":1728172800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Carbon sinks in the tropical rainforests are restricting the global warming to attain unprecedented heights. However, deforestation and climate change is switching them to a net carbon source at some of the deforested patches. Using machine learning algorithm we predict that more than 50% of the tropical rainforests will undergo rapid “Savannisation”/transformation by the end of 21<sup>st</sup> century under high emission scenarios. Climate change projects ‘El Niño-like’ warming condition, which decreases precipitation in the rainforests and favors atmospheric dryness. In Central Amazonia vegetation degradation saturates the carbon sink and more than 25% of the rainforests will transform into a net carbon source due to increase in soil microbial respiration. This transition will accelerate if Eastern Pacific/Global temperature warms beyond 1.5<sup>◦</sup>K/2.3<sup>◦</sup>K (by 2050’s) and will undergo a steeper transit by ~2075 (2.45<sup>◦</sup>K/3.8<sup>◦</sup>K warming). This alteration will exacerbate global warming and has consequences for policies that are intended to stabilize Earth’s climate.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"80827fe4f997a9ae6eb6c24a30d91921bd664209f7eb67c7b347745da1c14cd3","category":"Environment"}
