This study employs a data-driven machine learning approach to determine whether bilinguals and monolinguals can be distinguished based on spectrally-resolved resting-state dynamics. The model showed excellent performance (AUC: 0.91 ± 0.12) in subject-level discrimination. Strength in beta (15–30 Hz) and delta (2–4 Hz) rhythms were identified as top-ranked predictive features, indicative of neuroplastic changes in language and default-mode networks.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Can lifelong bilingualism be robustly decoded from intrinsic brain connectivity? Can we determine, using a spectrally resolved approach, the oscillatory networks that better predict dual-language experience? We recorded resting-state magnetoencephalographic activity in highly proficient Spanish-Basque bilinguals and Spanish monolinguals, calculated functional connectivity at canonical frequency bands, and derived topological network properties using graph analysis. These features were fed into a machine learning classifier to establish how robustly they discriminated between the groups. The model showed excellent classification (AUC: 0.91 ± 0.12) between individuals in each group. The key drivers of classification were network strength in beta (15–30 Hz) and delta (2–4 Hz) rhythms. Further characterization of these networks revealed the involvement of temporal, cingulate, and fronto-parietal hubs likely underpinning the language and default-mode networks (DMNs). Complementary evidence from a correlation analysis showed that the top-ranked features that better discriminated individuals during rest also explained interindividual variability in second language (L2) proficiency within bilinguals, further supporting the robustness of the machine learning model in capturing trait-like markers of bilingualism. Overall, our results show that long-term experience with an L2 can be “brain-read” at a fine-grained level from resting-state oscillatory network organization, highlighting its pervasive impact, particularly within language and DMN networks.</p>","author":"Lucia Amoruso, \nAdolfo M.
