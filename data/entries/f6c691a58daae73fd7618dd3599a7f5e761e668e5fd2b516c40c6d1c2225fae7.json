{"title":"Influence of Long-Term Humid Ageing and Temperature on the Mechanical Properties of Hybrid FRP Composite Specimens","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0738/v1","date":1720577597000,"content":"Present experimental study assesses the mechanical properties of glass/carbon/glass hybrid composite laminates after exposure to moisture and elevated temperatures for extended periods. The top and bottom layers of the hybrid laminates are glass fiber reinforced and the middle layer is carbon fiber reinforced with the matrix specified as a polymer material. The hybrid laminates were manufactured using the resin transfer molding method and their compressive and tensile properties were determined using a tensile testing machine. The material parameters such as the storage modulus, the loss modulus, and the damping factors of the laminates were identified using dynamic mechanical analysis as a function of the temperature and the vibration frequency. The experimental results on compressive and tensile properties revealed slight variations when the hybrid laminates were kept at low temperatures for extended periods. This might occur due to the increasing molecular cross-linking of the polymer network. As the temperature increased, compressive, tensile, storage modules, loss modulus, and damping factors decreased. This might occur due to the increasing mobility of the binder material. Particularly, the highest stiffness parameters were obtained on -80Â°C/GCG (Glass/Carbon/Glass) laminates due to the presence of beta transition on the glassy region. The relationships between the glass transitions and the targeted frequencies were characterized. The values of the glass transition shift towards higher temperatures as the frequency increases. This might occur due to a reduction in the gaps between the crosslinking of the epoxy network when the frequency increases. The accuracy of the storage modulus results was compared with the empirical models. The model based on the Arrhenius law provided the closest correlation. Meanwhile, another model was observed that was not accurate enough to predict when gamma and beta relaxations occur under a glassy state.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6c691a58daae73fd7618dd3599a7f5e761e668e5fd2b516c40c6d1c2225fae7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
