In August 2021, a female pink salmon displaying pale gills and abnormal behaviour was captured in River Lakselva in Northern Norway and later submitted to the Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI) for post-mortem examination. Histological examination of organ samples revealed structures indicative of systemic ichthyophoniasis, caused by <i>Ichthyophonus</i> sp. The parasites appeared to be especially abundant in the heart and skeletal musculature, and local tissue responses were assessed to be absent or very mild. Sequences of the ribosomal 18S rRNA and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) genes confirmed the diagnosis and identified the pathogen as <i>Ichthyophonus</i> sp. The CO1 sequence further established that the isolate from pink salmon was most similar to sequences of <i>Ichthyophonus</i> sp. from Atlantic salmon, <i>Salmo salar</i>, from the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast of the US and from Atlantic herring, <i>Clupea harengus</i>, from Iceland. We here report the first detection of <i>Ichthyophonus</i> sp. in pink salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean.</p>","author":"Toni Erkinharju, \nHaakon Hansen, \n√Öse Helen Garseth","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"a09d42eafde9f41eaae16fe139cac98a05a7e84206fafd807c37da1971d5f1c7","category":"Environment"}
