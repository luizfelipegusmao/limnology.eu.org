{"title":"Retrospective Cohort Study on Patients with Urinary Tract Infections in a Multidisciplinary Hospital in Romania","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0975/v1","date":1728725028000,"content":"Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a significant health concern, particularly among the elderly, often leading to hospitalization. A comprehensive study conducted at the \"Dr. Carol Davila\" Central Military Emergency University Hospital in Bucharest analyzed 948 adult patients hospitalized for symptomatic UTI. The findings revealed that the majority of admitted patients were elderly, presenting with high comorbidity rates and severe dependence. The study also identified common risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens, with one-third of patients hospitalized within 30 days preceding their current admission. The research uncovered several independent predictors of prolonged hospital stay, including the degree of dependence and comorbidity, female sex, obesity, and the presence of bacteremia. These findings underscore the changing landscape of UTI epidemiology and presentation in hospitalized patients. This study emphasizes the need for improved management strategies, particularly in areas such as urinary incontinence care, judicious use of catheterization, and preventive measures. As the elderly population continues to grow, healthcare providers must adapt their approaches to effectively address the evolving challenges associated with UTIs in this vulnerable population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"358f0a1bb4b30f057ee02f196b00198a51a116541798774367b49d85f6c36054","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
