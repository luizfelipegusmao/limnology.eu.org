{"title":"Influence of ultrasound pretreatment on drying characteristics of cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) slices during convective hot air drying","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13196?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Convective hot air drying of cocoyam is risk-free and inexpensive to a significant level. However, hot air drying causes negative changes to the color, texture, flavor and nutritional content of cocoyam as a result of the prolonged drying. Recently, the innovative technology of ultrasound pretreatment has been applied in food processing to reduce the processing time, conserve energy and preserve the quality of the food product. Thus, there is need to investigate the effect of ultrasound pretreatment with distilled water (UDW) and ultrasound with osmotic dehydration (UOD) for different ultrasonic times (10–30 min) on the drying kinetics of cocoyam slices during convective hot air drying. Ultrasound pretreatment was applied at a frequency of 20 kHz and an output power of 600 W for UDW and UOD. The ultrasound-pretreated samples were further dried in a convective hot-air drying oven at 70 °C.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>UDW and UOD samples, respectively, had a 25% and 46% reduction in drying time compared to untreated samples. The UOD samples had the lowest activation energy (10.697×103 kJ), as well as the highest moisture diffusivity (3.782  × 10<sup>−10</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) and mass transfer coefficient (2.006  × 10<sup>−8</sup> m s<sup>−1</sup>), among the untreated and UDW samples. Wang and Singh, Page and Peleg models were found to be the most fitted models with respect to the drying characteristics of cocoyam for untreated, UDW and UOD samples, respectively.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Ultrasound pretreatment technology is a potential non-thermal process that can be incorporated as a pretreatment method in the convective drying of cocoyam to reduce processing time, conserve energy and enhance cocoyam product shelf life. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Owoidoho Michael Nkem, \nAyobami Olayemi Oladejo, \nAkindele Folarin Alonge","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"0d2475f9eb30ce5cb43b7f373bb957c281bc41a5f38168943f92892a21ef415e","category":"Environment"}
