{"title":"Protozoan Infections Acquired from Food or Drinking Water: An Update","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1207/v1","date":1710930767000,"content":"This review summarizes the most recent developments of research on protozoan parasite infections ac-quired through food and drinking water and is aimed at gathering updated knowledge on the risk factors, illnesses caused, and measures for prevention.\nReports included dated from 2019 to the present and regarded recent outbreaks and cases of severe infec-tions, prevalence in different population segments and food handlers, and occurrence in food and drinking water. Cryptosporidium spp., Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, Trypanosoma cruzi and Toxoplasma gondii were the microorganisms most frequently involved in large outbreaks and/or severe infections, while Cyclospora cayetanensis was most frequently involved in single case reports. Cystoisospora belli was implied in severe infections in immunocompromised patients, while Blastocystis homi-nis, Sarcocystis spp., Dientamoeba fragilis, Endolimax nana and Pentatrichomonas hominis appeared to be less relevant for number of symptomatic infections and pathogenic potential.\nA progressive improvement in surveillance of protozoan infections and infection sources was highlighted, especially in developed countries. The apparent increase in cases was concomitant with the implementa-tion of reporting systems and the application of molecular diagnostic methods that represent valuable in-struments for establishing epidemiological links and preventing or limiting outbreaks. The pathogenic role and sources of infection should be better elucidated for some species.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"608a100ea722f9aa4ce3b3eed7f6423c559b81b55afb792a2dfdc513b945ce58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
