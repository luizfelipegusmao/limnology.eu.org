{"title":"PSI-21 Limited impact of hypothyroidism on porcine fetal growth during mid to late gestation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/476/7757758?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In the fetal pig, both circulating thyroid hormone and growth rate are known to increase throughout gestation; however, the functional association between these coincident factors has not been established. Thus, the objective of this project was to investigate this cause-and-effect relationship by evaluating the impact of induced fetal hypothyroidism on fetal growth during mid to late gestation. To induce fetal hypothyroidism, n = 12 pregnant gilts were orally treated with the goitrogen methimazole (MMI) at a dose of 5 mg/kg/d for 21 d, with n = 3 gilts starting treatment on gestation d 34, 45, 55 and 65. An equivalent group n = 12 of gilts were sham treated for the same periods to produce gestationally age-matched euthyroid control litters (CON). Upon completion of the treatment period, gilts were humanely euthanized, and the resulting populations of n = 174 MMI and n = 166 CON fetuses deeply phenotyped. No meconium-stained fetuses were observed at any time point, and only 5 mummified fetuses were observed (3 CON, 2 MMI), indicating treatment has no effect on fetal viability. Fetal body weight (BW) and the weights of individual organs including thyroid, liver, heart, lung, kidney, spleen, and brain were collected. In addition, fetuses were imaged in both left and right lateral recumbency for subsequent morphometric assessment using a custom analysis pipeline in ImageJ. Image analysis yielded parameters including crown-rump length, girth, brow length, depth at the snout/skull junction, depth at the snout/nose junction, and area under the skull curvature (AUC). Left and right measurements for all morphometric parameters were found to be highly correlated (r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.9) indicating a repeatable measure using this approach. Statistical analysis of all phenotypic differences was carried out using a linear mixed effect model including gestational age and treatment as fixed effects and gilt as a random effect. A significant increase in both absolute and relative thyroid weights indicated the development of goiter and thus, successful induction of hypothyroidism within the MMI litters. In addition, a significant treatment by time interaction was observed, with 0.014 g and 0.21 g increase at d 55 and 66, respectively, indicating reduced compensatory action within the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis during this earliest period. Liver weight as a percentage of BW decreased from 6.06% to 2.56% between d 55 and 86 in the CON group but was significantly increased at all time points in response to MMI induced hypothyroidism (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). A corresponding increase in brain to liver weight ratio over time was suppressed in MMI fetuses (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). While all other phenotypic parameters were significantly altered by gestational age, there was no significant impact of fetal hypothyroidism. Collectively, the results indicate that fetal growth during mid to late gestation is not driven by fetal thyroid hormone.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"2e483a947db2b0a8245ede3de92fd73cd905f9e32d91f60294bab51727ce8070","category":"Environment"}
