{"title":"Impact of Selected Eutectic Solvents on the Volatile Composition of Citrus Lemon Essential Oil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1143/v1","date":1728987288000,"content":"The development of new materials for the controlled release of molecules represents a topic of primary importance in medicine as well as in food science. Herein, three eutectic systems respectively composed by choline chloride and ethylene glycol (1:2 molar ratio), methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide and ethylene glycol (molar ratio 1:5), and choline chloride and glycerol (molar ratio 1:1.5) were tested as materials for the controlled release of an essential oil derived from citrus lemon leaves.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05c11eb68cc920518cbeb1000c5b979a6de51ac611c3985305fa68d0b42aefde","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
