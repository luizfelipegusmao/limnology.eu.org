{"title":"Humane, Nearing Launch of Ai Pin, Is Gathering Steam","link":"https://humane.com/media/humane-and-softbank","date":1709247856000,"content":"\n<p>Humane, yesterday:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This partnership, as part of a strategic investment opportunity, \nwill see SoftBank become the exclusive telecom provider for Ai Pin \nin Japan, leveraging SoftBank’s top-class services and compelling \ncustomer touchpoints to bring Ai Pin to a new market. SoftBank and \nHumane will also explore bringing CosmOS to other mobile devices \nand be working together on an app-less ecosystem of third-party \nservices and AI-driven user experiences in Japan. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And in <a href=\"https://humane.com/media/humane-and-sk-telecom\">a separate announcement the day before</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Humane Inc and South Korea’s biggest mobile telecommunication \ncompany SK Telecom (SKT) today announced a Telco partnership for \nthe Humane Ai Pin, the world’s first stand-alone Ai device and \nproprietary Ai-driven OS, CosmOS. </p>\n\n<p>This partnership, as part of a strategic investment opportunity, \nwill see SKT become the exclusive telecom provider for Ai Pin in \nSouth Korea, combining Humane’s groundbreaking AI technology with \nSKT’s expertise in advanced mobile networks, IoT, Cloud, AI, and \n5G technologies. Alongside Ai Pin, both companies will explore \nlicensing Humane’s CosmOS, creating an entirely new operating \nmodel between carriers and OEMs. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT\">NeXT</a> shipped their first workstations in 1989, but got out of the hardware business in 1993 and tried to make a go of just licensing their OS. Humane might be starting that same pivot two months before their first device ships.</p>\n\n<p>Humane seemingly <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/best-of-mwc-2024#section-best-ai-device-humane-ai-pin\">had a great Mobile World Congress (MWC) this week</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeySaiK/status/1763243084970651876\">winning awards</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kocienda/status/1762598094884020330\">garnering crowds</a>, and attracting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/som3cat/status/1763157254197428699\">media attention</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samsheffer/status/1762861682261659744\">Here’s a series of short videos</a> from Humane’s Sam Sheffer showing off the entire kit of hardware.</p>\n\n<p>I remain deeply skeptical of the form factor, but just like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22wlLy7hKP4\">the Rabbit R1</a> — at this point, Humane’s only rival — I can’t wait to try it. Whether the form factor is the right idea or not, the Humane AI assistant sure as shit blows Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant out of the water.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/29/humane-japan-korea\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"bcee3576ccd2c4d22e855cea7944239ba66386fc4316bbb4fecbe02b57e8447b","category":"Tech"}
