{"title":"A Model for Determining the Dependability of Continuous Subsystems in Coal Mines Using the Fuzzy Logic Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1952/v1","date":1721814687000,"content":"This study presents a unique model for assessing the dependability of continuous parts of combined systems in open-pit mining through the application of fuzzy logic. Continuous sub-systems as part of the combined system of coal exploitation in surface mines have the basic function of ensuring safe operation, high capacity with high reliability and low costs. These subsystems are usually part of the thermal power plant's coal supply system and ensure stable fuel supply. The model integrates various independent partial indicators of dependability into an expert system specifically designed for evaluating these systems. It deconstructs the complex parameter of system dependability into distinct partial indicators: reliability, maintainability, and logistical support. These indicators are then integrated using fuzzy composition (max-min composition). Historical data from 2018 to 2023 is utilized alongside the fuzzy model to provide a retrospective analysis of system dependability, serving to validate the model's effectiveness. What sets this model apart from conventional approaches is its consideration of practical dependability indicators, thereby obviating the need for extensive long-term monitoring and data collection to portray the system's status accurately over time. This model serves as a valuable tool for assisting decision-makers in open-pit mining operations, facilitating planning, exploitation control, and the selection of maintenance strategies to ensure consistent production and cost reduction. Designed for quick assessment, the model relies on expert judgments and assessments to determine system dependability efficiently.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4569ba56514e92fe8d05e6d4323833a4e64b2f6fe185b40590d8895beb7c3da0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
