{"title":"Induced abortion in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302824","date":1715090400000,"content":"<p>by Teklehaimanot Gereziher Haile, Teklehaymanot Huluf Abraha, Gebreamlak Gebremedhn Gebremeskel, Kidane Zereabruk, Tesfay Hailu Welu, Teklit Grum, Negasi Asres</p>\r\nBackground <p>One of the main factors contributing to maternal morbidity and mortality is induced abortion. The WHO estimates that over 44 million induced abortions take place annually around the world. The majority of these abortions—about 50%—are unsafe, significantly increasing maternal morbidity and contributing to 13% of maternal deaths. Thus, this review aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of induced abortion and its associated factors in Africa.</p> Methods <p>To find literature on the prevalence of induced abortion and its associated factors, a thorough search of the internet databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE, African Journals Online, and Google Scholar was conducted. The data were extracted using a structured method of data collection. Software called STATA 14 was used to do the analysis. funnel plot and Egger regression test were used to evaluate potential publication bias. I<sup>2</sup> statistics and Cochrane’s <i>Q</i> were used to measure the heterogeneity at a p-value &lt; 0.05.</p> Results <p>976 studies were found through a thorough search of electronic databases. Finally, 46 full-text abstract papers were included in this study. The estimated pooled prevalence of induced abortion was 16% (95% CI: 13%-19%). According to the sub-group analysis, most studies were conducted in Ethiopia, and the pooled prevalence was 19% (95% CI: 10%–30%). Similarly, the subgroup analysis by year of study showed that the prevalence of induced abortion was 39% (95% CI: 17%–64%) among studies conducted in 2019.</p> Conclusion <p>The results of this study thus imply that the pooled prevalence of induced abortion is higher than that of earlier studies that were published in some nations. the data from this study are needed to support reproductive and adolescent health programmers and policymakers and to formulate recommendations for future clinical practice and guidelines.</p>","author":"Teklehaimanot Gereziher Haile","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"550517a57c33c628bb2c63d3ca3cc28d1b593a17ead910ada6d2140203db0fea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
