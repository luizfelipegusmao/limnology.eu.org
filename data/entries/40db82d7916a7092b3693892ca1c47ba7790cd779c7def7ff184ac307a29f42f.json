Intensive farming practices have led to the outbreak of <i>Lactococcus garvieae</i> (LG), which causes Lactococcosis in MR. Recently, LG has re-emerged and the number of mortalities in prawn farms has increased in Taiwan. However, there is no preventative strategy described and a lack of knowledge on virulence factors and pathogenesis from LG in MR. The most virulent strain of <i>L. garvieae</i> from <i>M. rosenbergii</i> was screened in vivo among seven isolates selected for infectivity testing injecting 0.1 mL of 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL bacterial concentration. Among the seven isolates screened, <i>L. garvieae</i> 109-6 resulted in 100% mortality within 3 days post-infection. Furthermore, 109-6 <i>L. garvieae</i> LD<sub>50</sub> dosage from in MR was found to be 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL. Subsequently, the most virulent strain 109-6 was sequenced using MinIon Nanopore sequencing. Results indicated that the LG genome yielded a protein-coding of 3857 with 59 tRNA and 16 rRNA and no plasmid. Interestingly, the distribution of subsystems in the annotated genome revealed genes related to virulence, defence, and disease among LG 50 genes. Altogether, the virulent strain and its genome data revealed distinctive features of LG, which hinted toward its pathogenicity and could facilitate for better preventive strategies.</p>","author":"Rubicely Balan, \nSudarshan Pandey, \nPei‐Chi Wang, \nOmkar Vijay Byadgi, \nShih‐Chu Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"40db82d7916a7092b3693892ca1c47ba7790cd779c7def7ff184ac307a29f42f","category":"Environment"}
