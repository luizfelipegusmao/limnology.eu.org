{"title":"Blending gestation and lactation diets during the transition period reduces energy mobilization by sows in late gestation, with no impact on subsequent lactation performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae096/7695954?rss=1","date":1718755200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Fifty-three gilts and fifty-three multiparous (<strong>MP</strong>) sows were used to evaluate a blended feeding program using gestation and lactation diets during the transition period on changes in sow back fat (<strong>BF</strong>) depth and BW, blood metabolites, and litter growth performance in the subsequent lactation period. A 2 × 2 factorial experimental design was generated including the factors of parity and feeding program. The MP sows and gilts were assigned to one of two feeding programs on day 104 ± 1 of gestation: 1) 2 kg/d of a standard lactation diet until farrowing when sows received step-up access to the lactation diet until ad libitum access was given on day 4 of lactation (<strong>CON</strong>) and 2) a dynamic blend of standard gestation and lactation diets that met estimated daily requirements for standardized ileal digestible Lys and net energy according to the <a href=\"#CIT0014\">NRC (2012)</a> until day 4 of lactation where sows were provided ad libitum access to the lactation diet (<strong>TRAN</strong>). Litters were standardized to 13 ± 1 piglets within 24-h of birth. In gestation, ADFI was greatest for TRAN-MP sows (interaction; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), with greater ADFI for TRAN versus CON sows (main effect; 2.95 vs. 2.13 ± 0.08 kg; <span>P </span>&lt; 0.05). Feeding program did not influence ADFI in lactation, but MP sows had greater ADFI versus gilts (main effect; 5.96 vs. 4.47 ± 0.28 kg; <span>P </span>&lt; 0.001). Immediately after farrowing, TRAN sows had greater BW and BF vs. CON sows, regardless of parity (main effect; 224.1 vs. 215.4 ± 4.1 kg and 17.3 vs. 16.2 ± 0.4 mm, respectively; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). At weaning, no feeding program-related differences were observed for BW or BF, but MP sows had thicker BF compared to gilts (main effect; 14.4 vs. 13.4 ± 0.5 mm; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). The TRAN-MP sows had heavier piglets at birth compared to all other groups (interaction; <span>P </span>&lt; 0.05) and MP sows had greater litter birth weight and average piglet BW at birth versus gilts (main effect; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). No effect of feeding program was observed for piglet BW at weaning. On lactation day 1, serum beta-hydroxybutyric acid and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations were lower for TRAN compared to CON sows (main effect; 12.0 vs. 19.4 ± 7.8 mmol/L and 0.35 vs. 0.57 ± 0.10 mmol/L, respectively; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) and serum glucose concentration was greater for TRAN compared to CON sows (main effect; 4.41 vs. 3.88 ± 0.22 mmol/L; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), but these differences were no longer detectable at weaning. Therefore, a simple transition feeding program using a blend of a standard gestation and lactation diets reduced energy mobilization by sows in late gestation, with no impact on subsequent lactation performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"4d45d7630194df1cf09decf5b84d8a0bbea274e8fb9c4451fc37803a1f6296f2","category":"Environment"}
