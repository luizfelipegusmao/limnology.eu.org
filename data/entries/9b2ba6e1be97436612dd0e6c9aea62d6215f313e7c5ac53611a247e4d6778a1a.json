Methods: Conducting a structured interview. Results: It was pointed out that 70.1% had heard about HPV, however, 38.1% stated that it is a virus that causes cancer and 11.3% related it to the virus that causes warts. The free availability of the vaccine was known to 57.7% of participants and 62.3% were vaccinated with at least one dose. 79 students were vaccinated during the actions. Conclusion: There is a lack of knowledge, as the majority did not know how to relate HPV to the development of cervical cancer. The interaction between primary health care and schools resulted in the dissemination of knowledge about HPV, an increase in vaccine doses administered, favoring an increase in vaccination coverage among students.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b2ba6e1be97436612dd0e6c9aea62d6215f313e7c5ac53611a247e4d6778a1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
