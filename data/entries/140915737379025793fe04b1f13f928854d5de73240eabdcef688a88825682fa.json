The engineering of ZnO nanostructures (nZnO) has been achieved by controlling size and crystalline facets, enabling various applications. Morphology plays a pivotal role in its antibacterial properties, and the presence of defects in its structure is noteworthy. Recent research focuses on synthesizing and characterizing platelet and quasi-rounded morphologies to determine their antimicrobial properties in the presence of oxygen vacancies (Vo) [<a href=\"#ozae044.463-B2\">2-9</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"140915737379025793fe04b1f13f928854d5de73240eabdcef688a88825682fa","category":"Environment"}
