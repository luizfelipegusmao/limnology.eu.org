Traditional data acquisition through electron microscopes has been predominantly grid-based. This approach yields high amounts of redundant data, and often requires minimization of beam damage. For spectral images and especially 4D Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM), the data now require high throughput data storage and data transfer infrastructure. Here we develop the scientific workflow ecosystem integrating the STEM with the high-performance computer and realize both the efficient data transfer and storage and ML-based workflows to make acquisitions smarter and more efficient in terms of time and amount of data [<a href=\"#ozae044.164-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f4660784524361aa8b54b11071df089a1fb2376c10750e52add44c8dfa0debc8","category":"Environment"}
