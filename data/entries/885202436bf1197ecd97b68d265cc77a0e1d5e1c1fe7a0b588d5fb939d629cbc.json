{"title":"Gold Nanoparticles in Nanomedicine: Unique Properties and Therapeutic Potential","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1908/v1","date":1729758610000,"content":"Gold nanoparticles (NPs) have demonstrated significance in several important fields, including drug delivery and anticancer research, due to their unique properties. Gold NPs possess significant optical characteristics that enhance their application in biosensor development for diagnosis, photothermal and photodynamic therapies for anticancer treatment, as well as in targeted drug delivery and bioimaging. The broad surface modification possibilities of gold NPs have been utilized in the delivery of various molecules, including nucleic acids, drugs, and proteins. Moreover, gold NPs possess strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties, facilitating their use in surface-enhanced Raman scattering for precise and efficient biomolecule detection. These optical properties are extensively utilized in anticancer research. Both photothermal and photodynamic therapies show significant results in anticancer treatments using gold NPs. Additionally, the properties of gold NPs demonstrate potential in other biological areas, particularly in antimicrobial activity. In addition to delivering antigens, peptides, and antibiotics to enhance antimicrobial activity, gold NPs can penetrate cell membranes and induce apoptosis through various intracellular mechanisms. Among other types of metal NPs, gold NPs show more tolerable toxicity capacity, supporting their application in wide-ranging areas. Gold NPs hold a special position in nanomaterial research, offering limited toxicity and unique properties. This review aims to address recently highlighted applications, current status of gold NP research and discuss their future in nanomedicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"885202436bf1197ecd97b68d265cc77a0e1d5e1c1fe7a0b588d5fb939d629cbc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
