{"title":"A highly sensitive stem-loop RT-qPCR method to study siRNA intracellular pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biomethods/article/doi/10.1093/biomethods/bpae029/7665785?rss=1","date":1714953600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a powerful tool for sequence-specific silencing of disease-related genes. In this study, we established and validated a stem-loop reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method applicable for both chemically unmodified and modified siRNA, aiming to elucidate mechanistic intracellular pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of siRNA. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of factors affecting intracellular siRNA quantification. Our study revealed that immobilization-based siRNA extraction introduced high variation, making it unsuitable for absolute quantification. Conversely, direct cell lysis followed by stem-loop RT-qPCR demonstrated excellent reproducibility, with a quantification range from 0.0002 to 20 femtomole (fmole) for unmodified siRNA and 0.02 to 20 fmole for modified siRNA. The design of a 6-bp overlapping RT primer facilitated the distinction of full-length antisense from its 3′-metabolites, and pre-annealing of antisense to RT primer enhanced sensitivity and reproducibility. Differences in siRNA loss during storage and sample processing were noted among microcentrifuge tubes from various manufacturers. Endogenous miR-16 served as a reference for normalizing cytoplasmic siRNA, while protein concentration post-immunoprecipitation lysis was used to normalize RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-loaded siRNA levels. This method successfully enabled a detailed characterization of the time profiles of cytoplasmic and RISC-loaded siRNA, advancing the <span>in vitro–in vivo</span> translation of siRNA therapeutics.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"e2e217ccc4eeeb3687980f8c91c0cc633d2d9545f75ba633fffc3bdbf7774f46","category":"Environment"}
