{"title":"Growth–feeding linkage in small pelagic fish larvae in the Kii Channel, Japan","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fog.12678?af=R","date":1716956311000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The linkage between growth rate and feeding success has been shown to strengthen the effects of early growth rate on later growth rate in the early life history of fish. However, the growth–feeding linkage largely remains to be tested at the individual level within the same populations/cohorts. We examined the growth–feeding linkage for multiple populations/cohorts in Japanese anchovy <i>Engraulis japonicus</i> larvae and Pacific round herring <i>Etrumeus micropus</i> larvae, through otolith microstructure analysis, based on samples collected from the commercial fishery for larval fish in the Kii Channel, Japan. The three growth–feeding mechanisms, which are based on the respective potential advantages of larger somatic size, higher growth rate, and earlier morphological development for achieving feeding success, were tested to understand how growth rate relates to feeding success. The “somatic size” mechanism was supported for all of six samples for anchovy larvae and three of four samples for round herring larvae. The “growth rate” mechanism was supported for two of six samples for anchovy larvae and three of four samples for round herring larvae. The “morphological development” mechanism was supported for three of four samples for anchovy larvae and all of three samples for round herring larvae. Overall, the present analysis supported the growth–feeding linkage but revealed the dynamics of the growth–feeding mechanisms. All the mechanisms were shown to operate at least for certain populations/cohorts, but none of them were universally effective over all populations/cohorts across the two species. Understanding the dynamics of the growth–feeding mechanisms would provide precious hints for considering strategies of predicting recruitment dynamics.</p>","author":"Shizuna Togoshi, \nShota Tanaka, \nNaotaka Yasue, \nMasahiro Nakamura, \nDominique Robert, \nAkinori Takasuka","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ddf10675d11d4e916ea2c59904318f6a27094a133dc6841be0937d77cc7558c9","entryHash":"f426b9e499fb7817ce695de6b2e900223c61761c712be1d37225da764cd42385","category":"Environment"}
