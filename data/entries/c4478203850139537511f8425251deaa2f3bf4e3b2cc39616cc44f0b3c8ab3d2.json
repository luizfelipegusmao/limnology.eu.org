{"title":"Dereplication of Tetronic Acid Derivatives Produced by Calea pinnatifida (Asteraceae) Endophytes and Their Antimicrobial Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1039/v1","date":1726217006000,"content":"Almost fifty years after the introduction of antibiotics as an antimicrobial agent, we are facing an increasing number of multi-resistant microbials. The search for new antimicrobial compounds emerged as a promising alternative to treatments for diseases caused by microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria. Thus, endophytic fungi are gaining recognition for their varied metabolites that may possess antimicrobial properties. In our research, we isolated, from Calea pinnatifida, six endophytic fungi identified as Colletotrichum siamense, Colletotrichum karstii, Hypomontagnella barbarensis, Neopestalotiopsis clavispora, Nigrospora sacchari-officinarum and Annulohypoxylon moriforme. Analyses of microbial secondary metabolites by utilizing UHPLC-HR-ESI-MS/MS in conjunction with molecular networking, allowed the annotation of 9 compounds, 5 of them from GNPS spectral library match, and 4 from prediction-based on the molecular network, and allowed the isolation of two pairs of Acyl-tetronic acid derivatives distereoisomeric identified by NMR spectrum. In this sense, the present study underlines the value of endophytic fungi as a reservoir of potentially new antimicrobial agents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4478203850139537511f8425251deaa2f3bf4e3b2cc39616cc44f0b3c8ab3d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
