{"title":"IoHT and Edge Computing Aided Pandemic-Compliant, Resilient and Perceptive Platform for Smart-City Human Habitat","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1035/v1","date":1726209612000,"content":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a robust medical infrastructure and crisis management strategy as part of smart-city applications, with technology playing a crucial role. The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging sensor arrays, wireless communication networks, and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven decision-making. Advancements in Edge Computing (EC), Deep Learning (DL), and Deep Transfer Learning (DTL) have made IoT more effective in healthcare and pandemic-resilient infrastructure. When combined with medically oriented IoT setups, DL-architectures are suitable for integrating into pandemic-compliant medical infrastructure. The development of intelligent pandemic-compliant infrastructure requires combining IoT, edge and cloud computing, image processing, and AI tools to monitor adherence to social distancing norms, mask-wearing protocols, and contact tracing. The proliferation of 5G wireless communication has enabled ultra-wide broadband wireless communication, with high reliability and low latency, thereby enabling seamless medical support as part of smart-city applications. Such set-ups are designed to be ever-ready to deal with virus-triggered pandemic-like medical emergencies. This study presents the design of a pandemic-compliant mechanism leveraging IoT optimized for healthcare applications, edge- and cloud-computing frameworks, and a suite of DL-tools. The framework uses a composite attention-driven framework incorporating various DL-pre-trained models (DPTM) for protocol adherence and contact tracing. When connected to public networks, it can detect specific cyber-attacks. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"458db0dd19699e880c6b03ae14b3c974e963f60fba637077a5b8a49ee730cc87","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
