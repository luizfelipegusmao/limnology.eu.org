{"title":"A Comparative Literature Review of Multi-Beam and Adaptive Array Antennas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1590/v1","date":1716530752000,"content":"The application of adaptive antennas in wireless communication systems is examined in this review of the literature, with particular attention to how well they can transmit and receive signals by dynamically adjusting radiation patterns. The review covers a range of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that have been used to enhance adaptive antenna performance in beamforming, channel estimation, interference mitigation, and spectrum utilization. Although adaptive antennas have the potential to improve wireless communication systems, the paper also discusses their limitations, including computational complexity, interference sensitivity, and the significance of precise channel state information (CSI) estimates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b937c4d6376a45f635eabd20badc0b575eaa099485e4aedb678231b58509a7e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
