{"title":"Trends, and patterns, of premarital sexual intercourse and its associated factors among never-married young women aged 15–24 in Sierra Leone","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309200","date":1724335200000,"content":"<p>by Augustus Osborne, Castro Ayebeng, Peter Bai James, Camilla Bangura, Richard Gyan Aboagye, Bright Opoku Ahinkorah</p>\r\nBackground <p>Premarital sexual intercourse has essential implications for the sexual and reproductive health and rights of young women. These include increased sexual pleasure and satisfaction as well as exposure to the risks of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. This study examined the trends, patterns, and associations of premarital sexual intercourse among young women aged 15–24 in Sierra Leone.</p> Methods <p>Nationally representative cross-sectional data from the 2008, 2013, and 2019 Demographic and Health Surveys in Sierra Leone were used for the study. A weighted sample of 9,675 never-married young women was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of premarital sexual intercourse in Sierra Leone. Percentages were used to present the results of the trends and patterns of premarital sexual intercourse. We employed a multilevel binary logistic regression modelling technique to examine the associations of premarital sexual intercourse. The results were presented using adjusted odds ratio with their respective 95% confidence interval.</p> Results <p>The pooled prevalence of premarital sexual intercourse among the young women in Sierra Leone was 62.9%. Over the survey years, premarital sexual intercourse increased from 59.8% in 2008 to 65.1% in 2013. However, it declined by 3.5% to 61.6% in 2019. Young women aged 20–24 (aOR = 12.47, 95% CI = 10.54–14.76) had higher odds of engaging in premarital sexual intercourse than those aged 15–19. Young women with higher educational levels (aOR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.17–2.99), those who were working (aOR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.44–1.78), those who listened to the radio (aOR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.29–1.60), and those who lived in the Northwestern (aOR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.68–2.84), Eastern (aOR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.23–1.760, Northern (aOR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.25 -, 1.76), and Southern (aOR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.36–1.94) regions were more likely to engage in premarital sexual intercourse compared to those with no formal education, those not working, those who did not listen to the radio, and those who lived in the Western region, respectively. Young women in the richest wealth category (aOR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.49–0.78), and residing in rural areas (aOR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.72–0.98) had lower odds of engaging in premarital sexual intercourse relative to those from the poorest wealth quintile and those living in urban areas.</p> Conclusion <p>Our study found a high prevalence of premarital sexual intercourse among young women in Sierra Leone. Premarital sexual intercourse was associated with age, educational level, wealth, employment, and region. This necessitates providing them with comprehensive information regarding sexual and reproductive health behaviours, specifically emphasising the benefits and adverse consequences of engaging in sexual experimentation. Additionally, it is crucial to promote the adoption of abstinence, injections, implants, and condom usage through consistent advocacy for youth-risk communication.</p>","author":"Augustus Osborne","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3c253383827062df000149bf875c134ac168ec6983dac248a778d3f5952b04b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
