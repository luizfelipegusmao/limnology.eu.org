The study was conducted in from April 2020â€“March 2022. A total of 85 bird species belonging to 43 families were observed during the study period. The most abundant families were Motacillidae with Six species, followed by Cisticolidae, Columbidae, Muscicapidae, Sturnidae with five species each. Out of total 73 residents and 10 winters migratory and 2 summer migratory species were identified. The percentage of resident, winter visitor and Summer Migratory avian species was found to be 85.58, 11.76 and 2.35% respectively. The Analysis of RDi (relative diversity) results indicated that the family Motacillidae was the most diverse family, with the highest RDi value of 7.1. Total three avian species namely Red-vented bulbul (<em>Pycnonotus cafer</em>) and Rock Pigeons (<em>Columba livia</em>) and Rose-ringed parakeet (<em>Psittacula krameri</em>) were dominantly spared in the University Campus. One species Alexandrine Parakeet (<em>Psittacula eupatria</em>) which observed during the study falls under the Near Threatened (NT) category. The results of the study reflect the importance of such areas as important bird habitats where various local and migratory birds are found to rest and feed.</p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"4ff7353421d8158f32924d524926ba6b369bfe3492296ff63f1efcdea5719252","category":"Environment"}
