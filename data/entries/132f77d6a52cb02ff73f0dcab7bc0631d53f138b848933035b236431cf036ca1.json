{"title":"Analysis of Cooling Technologies in the Data Center Sector on the Basis of Patent Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0363/v1","date":1717751321000,"content":"The cooling of server components has been continuously developed over the past few years in order to meet the increasing cooling requirements of server component manufacturers such as for the processor chips. The growth in performance and power density increases the cooling demand. These requirements directly influence the energy consumption and performance of the hardware. To gain a better understanding of the historical evolution and possible future technology development paths in the field of data center cooling, a patent analysis method was used. The focus is on previous and current development priorities and possible research gaps within the server and computer room levels. The European patent database was selected as data source. To determine relevant patents, the search terms for various cooling technologies were developed iteratively. After the patent extraction for the period 2000 - 2023 (earliest priority year), the search results were classified and analysed. Most of the patents deal with air or liquid cooling. In the area of liquid cooling, the focus was on direct liquid cooling, followed by total liquid cooling. Since 2015 a technological shift from air to liquid cooling can be identified on the level of patent activities. In this context, the patent groups with focus on “constructional details for different types of electric apparatus” and “electrical digital data processing” have the largest share of patents. In addition, the technology focus of the TOP 10 patent applicants was in the field of liquid cooling. In conclusion from the patent analysis, it can be derived that liquid cooling will continue to gain in importance in the future and could also be combined with other approaches in the form of hybrid cooling. However air cooling may still be relevant, even if the main cooling load is handled by liquid-based approaches. At the same time, the optimisation potential for air cooling seems to have been largely exploited in comparison to liquid cooling, as can be seen from the falling number of the patent applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"132f77d6a52cb02ff73f0dcab7bc0631d53f138b848933035b236431cf036ca1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
