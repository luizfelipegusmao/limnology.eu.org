{"title":"Health Risks Associated with Oral Contraceptive Pills: A Comprehensive Review of Complications and Safer Alternatives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0467/v1","date":1728369333000,"content":"Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are widely used for contraception and the management of various gynecological conditions, offering significant benefits to womenâ€™s health. However, their use is associated with a range of potential health risks, including cardiovascular complications, certain cancers, metabolic disturbances, and psychiatric effects. Despite these serious risks, the adverse effects of OCPs are often underappreciated or neglected in both clinical practice and public perception. This review explores the physiological mechanisms behind these complications, discusses the scope of the problem, and highlights the need for greater awareness and personalized healthcare. It also examines alternative contraceptive methods that may offer safer options for women, including intrauterine devices (IUDs), barrier methods, fertility awareness, implants, injectables, and permanent solutions. The review calls for improved patient education, risk assessment, and research into new non-hormonal contraceptive options to reduce the dependence on OCPs and minimize associated health risks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d098a6e0f3e827f8aa6b9f832eaca5eb14cd70a65f035d49d06d9a3e7933280","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
