Electron microscopes traditionally operate under high vacuum, which requires specimens to be dried on a sample stage. However, liquid-phase imaging is possible with closed cells, in which the liquid is encapsulated behind an ultrathin electron-transparent membrane. While developments in liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (LP-TEM) have accelerated over the past few decades [<a href=\"#ozae044.271-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.271-B2\">2</a>], liquid-phase scanning electron microscopy (LP-SEM) has seldom been explored. LP-SEM is advantageous for its fewer sample size restrictions, increased surface sensitivity, and reduced beam damage [<a href=\"#ozae044.271-B3\">3</a>]. Here we explore LP-SEM as a means for expanding the fields of in situ and correlative microscopy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"58b8536cfbbd0ea46d9e7e77973d4741a621428149305453f069d9d283215108","category":"Environment"}
