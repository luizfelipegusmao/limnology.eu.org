{"title":"Phytoplankton abundance and biodiversity in adjacent estuaries: the importance of submarine groundwater discharge","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05497-3","date":1722470400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>A near-unique pair of adjacent bays in the karst region of western Ireland provided the opportunity to compare phytoplankton diversity and abundance in an area of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) side by side with a ‘control’ region of similar size and with the same marine influences. Freshwater input to Kinvara Bay comes from the surrounding karst hinterland via a subterranean groundwater network, emerging at several sites within the inner bay as submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). Aughinish Bay in contrast has no connection to a SGD network and negligible overground fresh water input. Sampling was carried out in both bays during spring and neap tides over Winter, Spring/Summer and Summer/Autumn of 2016 and 2017. Comparison of the phytoplankton communities in the two bays showed higher diversity in Aughinish, while a bloom of <em>Prorocentrum micans</em> (Ehrenber, 1834), a brackish-water-tolerant marine dinoflagellate, was observed only in Kinvara. This work demonstrates how SGD can control phytoplankton community structure even in well-flushed macro-tidal bays and thus controls the biogeography at local scales.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"3cc7b0667356872eeb6db9b9f5ba7bffb680703b37dac10c9a5617379c6ab427","category":"Environment"}
