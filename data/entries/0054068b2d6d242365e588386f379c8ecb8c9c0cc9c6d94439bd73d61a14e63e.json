{"title":"Comparative Study of Fishing Performance and Underwater Stability according to the Giant Octopus Pot Shape off the East Coast of Korea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1926/v1","date":1719540588000,"content":"The giant octopus caught off the east coast of Korea is an important fishery resource with the largest haul and is mostly caught using net pots. While giant octopus pots have different shapes, drum, rectangular, and cylinder pots are mostly used. However, these pots have not been thoroughly evaluated. Here, we evaluated the fishing performance of three giant octopus pots, their fluid resistance, and underwater movement. Six sea trials were conducted near the Hupo region in Gyeongsangbuk-do. In total, 163 individuals (62,724 g), 190 individuals (49,913 g), and 154 individuals (52,364 g) were caught using drum, rectangular, and cylinder pots, respectively. Drum pots showed significant differences in the amount of catch by weight (ANOVA test, p&amp;lt;0.05). Moreover, the percentage of minimum conservation size was the lowest in cylinder pots (6.5%). Drum pots showed the highest stability in the underwater stability test, while underwater fluid resistance at 2.5 kt fluid speed was in the following order: drum pots (7.66 kgf) &amp;gt; rectangular pots (7.16 kgf) &amp;gt; cylinder pots (7.04 kgf). Therefore, drum pots showed excellent fishing performance. This study provides foundational data for developing managing systems for giant octopus resources and establishing the extent of fishing gear usage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0054068b2d6d242365e588386f379c8ecb8c9c0cc9c6d94439bd73d61a14e63e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
