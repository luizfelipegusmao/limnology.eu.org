{"title":"Tissue distribution of <i>Coxiella burnetii</i> and antibody responses in macropods co-grazing with livestock in Queensland, Australia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303877","date":1716300000000,"content":"<p>by Anita Tolpinrud, Mythili Tadepalli, John Stenos, Louis Lignereux, Anne-Lise Chaber, Joanne M. Devlin, Charles Caraguel, Mark A. Stevenson</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Coxiella burnetii</i>, the causative agent of Q fever, is a zoonotic bacteria of global public health significance. The organism has a complex, diverse, and relatively poorly understood animal reservoir but there is increasing evidence that macropods play some part in the epidemiology of Q fever in Australia. The aim of this cross-sectional survey was to estimate the animal- and tissue-level prevalence of coxiellosis amongst eastern grey (<i>Macropus giganteus</i>) and red (<i>Osphranter rufus</i>) kangaroos co-grazing with domestic cattle in a Q fever endemic area in Queensland. Serum, faeces and tissue samples from a range of organs were collected from 50 kangaroos. A total of 537 tissue samples were tested by real-time PCR, of which 99 specimens from 42 kangaroos (84% of animals, 95% confidence interval [CI], 71% to 93%) were positive for the <i>C</i>. <i>burnetii</i> IS<i>1111</i> gene when tested in duplicate. Twenty of these specimens from 16 kangaroos (32%, 95% CI 20% to 47%) were also positive for the <i>com1</i> or <i>htpAB</i> genes. Serum antibodies were present in 24 (57%, 95% CI 41% to 72%) of the PCR positive animals. There was no statistically significant difference in PCR positivity between organs and no single sample type consistently identified <i>C</i>. <i>burnetii</i> positive kangaroos. The results from this study identify a high apparent prevalence of <i>C</i>. <i>burnetii</i> amongst macropods in the study area, albeit seemingly with an inconsistent distribution within tissues and in relatively small quantities, often verging on the limits of detection. We recommend Q fever surveillance in macropods should involve a combination of serosurveys and molecular testing to increase chances of detection in a population, noting that a range of tissues would likely need to be sampled to confirm the diagnosis in a suspect positive animal.","author":"Anita Tolpinrud","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"36878ac285e7afbf6f9f315d0d26e3252373c2dc355e7a4e72aacdd857cfec68","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
