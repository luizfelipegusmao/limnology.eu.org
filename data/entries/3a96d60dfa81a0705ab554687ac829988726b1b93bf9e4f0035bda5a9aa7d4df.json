{"title":"Field longevity of methyl eugenol and cue-lure plugs and associated insecticidal strips: captures of Bactrocera dorsalis and Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Diptera: Tephritidae) in Hawaii","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/5/782/7704521?rss=1","date":1719878400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Certain species of true fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) cause tremendous damage to commercially important fruits and vegetables, and many countries operate continuous trapping programs which rely on male-specific lures such as trimedlure (TML), methyl eugenol (ME), and cue-lure (CL). Traditionally, these attractants have been applied as liquids to cotton wicks inside traps, although this results in high evaporative loss of the lure. Slow-release, polymeric plugs have been widely adopted for TML, but such devices are not widely used for ME or CL. Recent data, however, suggest that ME and CL plugs may be attractive for as long as 12 wk in the field. The present study investigates whether ME and CL plugs weathered for 18 or 24 wk are effective in capturing males of <span>Bactrocera dorsalis</span> (Hendel) and <span>Zeugodacus cucurbitae</span> (Coquillett), respectively. For <span>B</span>. <span>dorsalis</span>, 6 g ME plugs were as effective as the control treatment (fresh liquid on a wick) after 12 wk of weathering but not after 18 or 24 wk. For <span>Z</span>. <span>cucurbitae</span>, 3 g CL plugs were as effective as the control treatment (fresh CL plugs) after 12 and 18 wk of weathering but not after 24 wk. The residual content and release rate of the 2 lures were also measured over time, but, with the exception of the residual content of ME, we did not find a direct correlation between these parameters and numbers of flies captured.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"3a96d60dfa81a0705ab554687ac829988726b1b93bf9e4f0035bda5a9aa7d4df","category":"Environment"}
