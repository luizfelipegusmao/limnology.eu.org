{"title":"Evaluating the Impact of Copper Concentrations on Apple Variety Performance: Insights from a Callus-Media System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1660/v1","date":1727314511000,"content":"Copper (Cu)-based fungicides are widely used in agriculture, but excessive Cu accumulation in soils threatens crop performance, particularly in perennial fruit crops like apples. This study investigated the effects of varying Cu concentrations on the physiological responses of three apple varieties—Braeburn, Fuji, and Cripps Pink—using a callus-media system. Callus cultures were exposed to Cu concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 mg Cu kg⁻¹ to assess traits such as growth, fresh and dry weight, copper accumulation, and bioconcentration factor (BCF). Results revealed that media Cu concentration had a stronger effect than variety on most traits, especially above 10 mg Cu kg⁻¹, where copper stress reduced genetic variability. At lower Cu concentrations, varietal differences were more apparent, with Cripps Pink showing greater copper tolerance. These findings suggest that high Cu levels suppress varietal differences, leading to a uniform stress response. This study provides valuable insights into copper toxicity in apple varieties and highlights the need to maintain soil Cu levels below critical thresholds to preserve varietal performance, with potential implications for soil-plant systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea06937a1a5db9e6fc93a5f2e4617bff5437528fe613c43429552fa20f1791a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
