{"title":"Recent Progress in Terrestrial Biota Derived Antibacterial Agents for Medical Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1476/v1","date":1724229523000,"content":"Abstract: Conventional antibiotic and multidrug treatments become less and less effective and a discovery of new effective and safe antibacterial agents got a global priority. The returning to the natural antibacterial product is relatively new current trend. Terrestrial biota is a rich source of biologically active substances whose antibacterial potential was not fully utilized. \nAim of this review is to present the current state-of-the art of terrestrial biota-derived antibacterial agents and inspired by nature treatments. It is a summary of the most important sources and new identified or modified antibacterial agents and treatments during the last 5 years. It focuses on the significance of plants- animals- and bacteria-derived biologically active agents as powerful alternatives to antibiotics as well as on the advantages of utilizing natural antibacterial molecules alone or in combinations with antibiotics. \nThe main conclusion is that the terrestrial biota derived antibacterial products and substances open variety of new ways to modern improved therapeutic strategies. New terrestrial sources of known antibacterial agents and new antibacterial agents from terrestrial biota were discovered during the last 5 years, which are under investigation together with some long ago known but now surviving their renaissance for the development of new medical treatments. Use of natural antibacterial peptides as well as combinational therapy by commercial antibiotics and natural products outlines as the most promising for treating of bacterial infections. In vivo testing and clinical trials are necessary to reach clinical application.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da53414e3764c19b40e4f1e75060fb827bc50cacab70ce110c4fc661e51ce006","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
