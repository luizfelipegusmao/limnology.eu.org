{"title":"Advances in the Diagnosis of Atypical Polypoid Adenomyoma Through Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1221/v1","date":1721048535000,"content":"Atypical Polypoid Adenomyoma (APA) is a benign uterine lesion that occurs in women of reproductive age. The histological pattern is characterized by irregular epithelial proliferation and muscular stroma. Our work consists of a systematic review of the literature, including the description and analysis of a case study, and assesses the main immunohistochemical and molecular markers that contribute to making a differential diagnosis against endometrial adenocarcinoma. This allows offering patients conservative treatment compared to the radical management required for endometrial cancer, due to the significant physical and psychological consequences that one procedure or another can have on women's health. The goal of this research is to carry out an adequate diagnosis of APA by providing the necessary information to guide clinical management, establish patient prognosis, and minimize the emotional impact associated with the disease, all in combination with clinical and histopathological findings and complementary imaging tests. In conclusion, an appropriate immunohistochemical and molecular approach, along with the presumptive histological diagnosis, determine the correct classification of the lesion as APA and not as other malignant pathologies, which allows establishing a treatment protocol adjusted to the biological reality of this pathology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"08c92249f5c3a22df7068eddb416c8ed3ce7703de9f35d402fcb82d075bbf8b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
