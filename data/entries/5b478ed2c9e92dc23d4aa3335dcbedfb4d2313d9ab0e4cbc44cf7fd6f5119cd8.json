Pristine MOF compounds provide several intriguing benefits for catalytic applications, including high interior surface areas and densities of active sites, allowing high catalytic reaction rates per volume, post-synthesis modified with com-plementary catalytic groups, enabling multiple functional groups to catalyze the reaction. Most of large-scale catalytic applications, including those in fuel processing, gas emission reduction and chemical synthesis, nevertheless the pristine MOFs often reveal limited stabilities and opportuni-ties for regeneration at high temperatures. As a result, the real applications of MOFs in these tech-nologies are likely to be constrained, and their controlled thermal modification aiming the prepa-ration of MOF-derivative compounds has been applied to induce crystalline structural changes and increase their structural stability, enhancing its potential applicability in more severe catalytic processes. Recent advances concerning the use of this strategy to boost the catalytic potential of the MOF-derivative compounds are outlined in this short-review article.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b478ed2c9e92dc23d4aa3335dcbedfb4d2313d9ab0e4cbc44cf7fd6f5119cd8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
