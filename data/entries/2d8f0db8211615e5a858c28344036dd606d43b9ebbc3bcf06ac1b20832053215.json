Their increasing amounts in the ambient and in indoor air pose a risk to human health.In two human cell lines (A549 and THP-1) we assessed the proinflammatory behavior of polystyrene nanoplastics (nPS) and microplastics (mPS) (Ø 0.1 and 1 μm). Reproducing environmental aging, in addition to virgin, the cells were exposed to oxidized nPS/mPS. To study the response of the monocytes to the inflammatory signal transmitted by the A549 through the release of soluble factors (e.g. alarmins and cytokines), THP-1 cells were also exposed to the supernatants of previously nPS/mPS-treated A549. After dynamic-light-scattering (DLS) analysis and protein measurements for the assessment of protein corona in nPS/mPS, real-time PCR and enzyme-linked-immunosorbent (ELISA) assays were performed in exposed cells. The pro-inflammatory effects of v- and ox-nPS/mPS were attested by the imbalance of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in A549, which was able to trigger the inflammatory cascade, inhibiting the immunologically silent apoptosis. The involvement of NFkB was confirmed by the overexpression of p65 after exposure to ox-nPS and v- and ox-mPS. The fast and higher levels of IL-1β, only in THP-1 cells, underlined the NLPR3 inflammasome activation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"2d8f0db8211615e5a858c28344036dd606d43b9ebbc3bcf06ac1b20832053215","category":"Environment"}
