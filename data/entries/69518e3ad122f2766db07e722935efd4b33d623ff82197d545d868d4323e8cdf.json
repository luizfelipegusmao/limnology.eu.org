{"title":"Optimization of Magnetic Susceptibility Weighted Imaging for Female Pelvic Scans","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0479/v1","date":1717748665000,"content":"Background and Objectives: The existing recommendations for female pelvic magnetic susceptibility weighted imaging MRI (FP-SWI) have not been optimized to capture the disease characteristics of the female pelvis. Therefore, it is imperative to explore acquisition parameters before conducting larger-scale studies. To establish optimized flip angle (FA) for acquiring FP-SWI to improve the image quality of female pelvic lesion sites. Materials and Methods: To evaluate signal quality and lesion conspicuity, regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn within the lesion on SWI sequences. Signal intensity was measured within the ROIs. Additionally, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated for SWI sequences acquired at three FA: 10°, 15°, and 20°. Finally, a qualitative assessment of anatomical detail visualization, geometric distortion extent, artifacts, and lesion clarity was performed using a four-point scale. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was employed to compare the qualitative evaluation parameters. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to determine the consistency of subjective ratings between two observers. Results: FA=10° showed significantly higher SNR than FA=15° and 20° in most anatomical regions (P&amp;lt;0.05), while the CNR was significantly higher than FA=15° and 20° (P&amp;lt;0.05). Compared with FA=15° and 20°, the image quality of FA=10° was significantly higher, with less distortion and ghosting, and better image contrast (P&amp;lt;0.05). Lesions with FA=10° exhibited higher clarity compared to FA=15° and 20° (P&amp;lt;0.05). Conclusions: The image quality of FP-SWI images at FA=10° exceeds that at FA=15° and 20°. We recommend that when conducting SWI examination of the female pelvic cavity, the FA value should be set at 10° to stabilize the SWI sequence and improve image quality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"69518e3ad122f2766db07e722935efd4b33d623ff82197d545d868d4323e8cdf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
