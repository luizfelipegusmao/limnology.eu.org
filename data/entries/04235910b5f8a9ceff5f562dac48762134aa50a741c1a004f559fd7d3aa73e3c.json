{"title":"Understanding Customer Satisfaction Based on Experience with Subscription Video on Demand (SVoD)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0139/v1","date":1722571483000,"content":"This research aimed to discover how to create a customer experience that includes FEEL, SENSE, THINK, ACT, and RELATE to increase satisfaction with the Subscription Video on Demand (SVoD) application. A descriptive quantitative method was used, and the sample was 423 respondents in Indonesia who had used the application for at least 1 month. Furthermore, this research used probability sampling using a technique for random sampling. Based on the data available, experience accounted for 0.509, or 50.9%, of the application satisfaction. With a beta value of 0.295, the FEEL variable was the only one in this study to significantly and positively affect customer satisfaction; the other variables, SENSE, THINK, ACT, and RELATE, had no discernible effects. It is anticipated that the theoretical foundation provided by this research will be beneficial to the entertainment industry, particularly the SVoD application sector. This includes the product and service development division that focuses on customer inner feelings and emotions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04235910b5f8a9ceff5f562dac48762134aa50a741c1a004f559fd7d3aa73e3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
