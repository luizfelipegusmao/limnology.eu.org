{"title":"Combining Scanning Nanobeam Electron Diffraction with 3D Electron Diffraction to Investigate Crystal Defects","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.901/7720219?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The experimental determination of crystal defects in organic materials remains a widely unexplored area although defects may play key roles in mechanisms of growth and likely also the mechanical properties of these materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.901-B1\">1</a>]. Traditional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques have been widely used to explore defects in beam-resistant inorganic materials, but beam damage has limited the extension of conventional TEM to organic materials such as pharmaceuticals. In this work, we apply a variant of 4D-STEM, low dose scanning electron diffraction (SED), to investigate sub-crystal microstructure in two small organic molecule samples: firstly indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and secondly xanthine, a purine base whose derivatives include theophylline and caffeine. This is also supported by insights from 3D electron diffraction (3D-ED) [<a href=\"#ozae044.901-B2\">2</a>], which we first use to elucidate the previously unknown crystal structure of xanthine, allowing subsequent SED analysis. For both samples, SED microscopy was performed using either a JEOL ARM 300F or Thermo Fisher Spectra 300 microscope operated at 300 kV and 200 kV respectively with a convergence semi-angle of ∼ 0.5 - 1 mrad, a 1 ms dwell time, and a beam current of 2 pA. These conditions resulted in a cumulative electron dose of ∼10 e Å<sup>−2</sup> per scan. Diffraction patterns were acquired using a Medipix3 direct electron detector and crystals were deposited directly onto carbon-coated quantifoil TEM support grids. Postprocessing and analysis of SED data was performed using the open-source Python library Pyxem [<a href=\"#ozae044.901-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2c9ef19c6551fffb71082ad993837b69cd0b18914c844df95aaeb1e1d761cdcb","category":"Environment"}
