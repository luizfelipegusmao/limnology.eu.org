This study aimed to assess the utility of Sentinel-2A vegetation indices in enhancing delineation and sub-classify depressional HGM types. (2) Methods: We sampled 84 pairs of four vegetation indices from 10x10m plots along 14 belt transects in eight depressional wetlands in Mpumalanga, South Africa. We evaluated vegetation index differences between and within wetlands, focusing on lit-toral gradients. (3) Results: Significant differences (Bonferroni p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62e821de3ef68364479665ded5a455d22d765a83e5416266168871f940e19d47","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
