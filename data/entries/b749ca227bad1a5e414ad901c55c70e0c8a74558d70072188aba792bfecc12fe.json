{"title":"A Conservative and Compact Finite Difference Scheme for the Sixth-Order Boussinesq Equation with the Surface Tension","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0770/v1","date":1728540877000,"content":"In this study, we propose a conservative and compact finite difference scheme designed to preserve both the mass change rate and energy for solving the sixth-order Boussinesq equation with the surface tension. Theoretical analysis confirms that the proposed scheme achieves second-order accuracy in temporal discretization and fourth-order accuracy in spatial discretization. The solvability, convergence, and stability of the difference scheme are rigorously established through the application of the discrete energy method. Additionally, a series of numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and reliability of the conservative scheme for long-time simulations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b749ca227bad1a5e414ad901c55c70e0c8a74558d70072188aba792bfecc12fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
