{"title":"Safety Profile of Vitamin D Supplements Using Real-World Data from 445,493 Participants of the UK Biobank: Slightly Higher Hypercalcemia Prevalence but Neither Increased Risks of Kidney Stones nor Atherosclerosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1027/v1","date":1718589848000,"content":"Background: Potential calcium-related adverse events of vitamin D supplement use have not been addressed in large-scale, real-world data so far.\nMethods: Leveraging data from the UK Biobank, encompassing 445,493 individuals aged 40-69, we examined associations of high 25-hydroxyvitamin (25[OH]D) levels â‰¥100 nmol/L and vitamin D supplementation with hypercalcemia (plasma calcium &gt;2.6 mmol/L), kidney stones, and atherosclerosis assessments (pulse wave arterial stiffness index and carotid intima-medial thickness). Regression models were comprehensively adjusted for 49 covariates.\nResults:  Approximately 1.5% of the participants had high 25(OH)D levels, 4.3% regularly used vitamin D supplements, and 20.4% reported regular multivitamin use. At baseline, the hypercalcemia prevalence was 1.6%, and 1.1% were diagnosed with kidney stones during follow-up. High 25(OH)D levels were neither associated with calcium-related adverse events nor atherosclerosis assessments. Vitamin D and multivitamin supplementation were associated with an increased prevalence of hypercalcemia (odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals: 1.46[1.32-1.62] and 1.11[1.04-1.18], respectively) but were neither associated with atherosclerosis nor future kidney stones. \nConclusion: High 25(OH)D levels observable in routine care were not associated with any adverse outcome. Vitamin D users have a slightly higher prevalence of hypercalcemia, possibly due to co-supplementation with calcium, but without higher atherosclerosis prevalence or risk of kidney stones.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d26bae165cc9c7afea1b02af48a961e3db1a8e66b00afd41c89f021c4b3dfe1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
