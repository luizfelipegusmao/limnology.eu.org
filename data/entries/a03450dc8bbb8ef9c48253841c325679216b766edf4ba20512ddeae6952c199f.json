{"title":"Artificial Intelligence Application for Thoracic Surgeon: &ldquo;Phe-Nomenal Cosmic Powers into the Magic Lamp&rdquo;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0759/v1","date":1715596248000,"content":"In the digital age, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative force in various sectors, in-cluding medicine. This article explores the potential of AI, akin to the magical genie of Aladdin's lamp, particularly within thoracic surgery and lung cancer management. It examines AI applications like ma-chine learning and deep learning in achieving more precise diagnoses, preoperative risk assessment, and improved surgical outcomes. The challenges and advancements in AI integration, especially in computer vision and multi-modal models, are discussed alongside their impact on robotic surgery and operating room management. Despite its transformative potential, implementing AI in medicine faces challenges regarding data scarcity, interpretability issues, and ethical concerns. Collaboration between AI and medi-cal communities is essential to address these challenges and unlock the full potential of AI in revolution-izing clinical practice. This article underscores the importance of further research and interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure the safe and effective deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a03450dc8bbb8ef9c48253841c325679216b766edf4ba20512ddeae6952c199f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
