{"title":"Unsupervised Color Based Flood Segmentation in UAV Imagery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1049/v1","date":1713260448000,"content":"We propose a novel unsupervised semantic segmentation method for fast and accurate flood area detection utilizing color images acquired from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully unsupervised method for flood area segmentation in color images captured by UAVs, without the need of pre-disaster images. The proposed framework addresses the problem of flood segmentation based on parameter-free calculated masks and unsupervised image analysis techniques. First, a fully unsupervised algorithm gradually excludes areas classified as non-flood utilizing calculated masks over each component of the LAB colorspace, as well an RGB vegetation index and the detected edges of the original image. Unsupervised image analysis techniques, such as distance transform, are then applied, producing a probability map for the location of flooded areas. Finally, flood detection is obtained by applying the hysteresis thresholding segmentation. The proposed method is tested and compared with variations, and other supervised methods in two public datasets, consisting of 953 color images in total, yielding high-performance results, with 87.4% and 80.9% overall accuracy and F1-Score, respectively. The results and computational efficiency of the proposed method show that it is suitable for on board data execution and decision-making during UAVs flight.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e849f91b6973dc89000a8999e0cb9590fb6f742c8c4491b4d14aa0cccff5e4f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
