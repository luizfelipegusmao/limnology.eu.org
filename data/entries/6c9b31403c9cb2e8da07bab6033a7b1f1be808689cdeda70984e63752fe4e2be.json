{"title":"Exploring the Relationship Between Ichthyosis and Scalp Paresthesia: Potential Connection and Treatment Approach with Fluocinolone","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0880/v1","date":1723531740000,"content":"Ichthyosis is a genetic skin disorder marked by hyperkeratosis, pruritus, and scaling. This case study explores a potential association between ichthyosis and scalp paresthesia, a symptom not commonly linked with this dermatological condition. In a longstanding history of ichthyosis patients, we detail the therapeutic use of fluocinolone, a synthetic corticosteroid, in managing scalp paresthesia. The effectiveness of fluocinolone in reducing paresthesia episodes underscores its potential as a critical component in the symptomatic treatment of this complex interplay between skin and neurological symptoms. This case prompts a broader discussion on the need for increased awareness and education among healthcare providers regarding the diverse manifestations of ichthyosis. Enhanced understanding and recognition of these associations can lead to improved patient counseling, tailored management strategies, and, ultimately, better quality of life for individuals affected by ichthyosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c9b31403c9cb2e8da07bab6033a7b1f1be808689cdeda70984e63752fe4e2be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
