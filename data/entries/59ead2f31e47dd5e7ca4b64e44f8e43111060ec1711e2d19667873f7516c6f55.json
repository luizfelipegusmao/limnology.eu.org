{"title":"Impact of Early Surfactant Administration on Ductus Arteriosus Assessed at 24 Hours in Preterm Neonates Less than 32 Weeks of Gestational Age","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0351/v1","date":1712245833000,"content":"Background and Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether early surfactant administration affects the status of ductus arteriosus (DA) in preterm infants ≤32 weeks of gestational age (GA) within 24 hours of birth. Materials and Methods: It is a prospective study conducted from March 15, 2022, to November 15, 2023, in a tertiary academic center. In-born infants ≤ 32 weeks of gestation (n = 88) were enrolled. The study group was further divided into surfactant (n=44) and non-surfactant (n=44) subgroups. Results: 76% of the preterm infants who received surfactant therapy (RRR = 0.839) recorded an increase in Kindler Score at 24 hours of life (1-RR = 1-0.24 = 76%). Surfactant administration was significantly associated with decreased pre-ductal diastolic pressure (29.9 mmHg vs. 34.8 mmHg, p=0.0231), post-ductal diastolic pressure (28.7 mmHg vs. 32.2 mmHg, p=0.0178) pre-ductal MAP (41.6 mmHg vs. 46.5 mmHg, p=0.0210) post-ductal MAP (41.0 mmHg vs. 45.3 mmHg, p=0.0336). There were no significant changes in ductus arteriosus parameters at 24 hours of life. Conclusions: Early surfactant administration does not affect the status of ductus arteriosus in preterm infants ≤32 weeks of gestational age at 24 hours of life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59ead2f31e47dd5e7ca4b64e44f8e43111060ec1711e2d19667873f7516c6f55","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
