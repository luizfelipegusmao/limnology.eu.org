Whole genome sequencing of hRSV has been challenging from respiratory tract specimens with low viral loads. Herein, we describe an amplicon-based protocol for whole genome sequencing of hRSV subgroup A validated with 24 isolates from nasopharyngeal swabs and infected cell cultures, which showed cycle threshold (Ct) values ranging from 10 to 31, as determined by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. MinION nanopore generated 3200 to 5400 reads per sample to sequence over 93% of the hRSV-A genome. Coverage of each contig ranged from 130× to 200×. Samples with Ct values of 20.9, 25.2, 27.1, 27.7, 28.2, 28.8, and 29.6 led to the sequencing of over 99.0% of the virus genome, indicating high genome coverage even at high Ct values. This protocol enables the identification of hRSV subgroup A genotypes, as primers were designed to target highly conserved regions. Consequently, it holds potential for application in molecular epidemiology and surveillance of this hRSV subgroup.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"896dbb6dc83e221aa5045369e400b3053bbe817fa1aab23087abdcc635afef73","category":"Environment"}
