{"title":"Sustainable Technologies for Ecological Societies Directed to Energy Transition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0806/v1","date":1720616602000,"content":"Ecological Society is based on socioeconomic systems directed to the equilibrium of inter-relationships between environment, climate, production systems, technologies and human communities to promote the overall well-being of people and the Earth planet. It has a main goal for supporting sustainable development and equitable societies and achieving optimal health outcomes recognizing the interconnection between people, technologies, animals, plants, and their shared environment for the one health. Using data of scientific publications and patents until the year 2024, this study shows new technologies that can support the energy transition with the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources in an effort to reduce CO2 emissions for an ecological society having, whenever possible, zero-carbon economies to reduce environmental pollution and climate change and foster health and wellbeing of people. Results reveal that sustainable technologies supporting the transformation of the energy sector, economies and societies, and having a rapid growth, are blue hydrogen, floating photovoltaic systems, carbon capture and utilization, green hydrogen and liquid metal batteries. These findings can guide decisions of policymakers and stakeholders towards fruitful investments driving the transition from fossil-based to zero-carbon socioeconomic systems to have a long-run sustainable development of overall world system that has to direct towards an  ecological society associated with one health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68c13546dd4432631e09110cffb0fae9666fd558573354cb3c90845631b212db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
