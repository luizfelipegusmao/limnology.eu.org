Female preferences were found to have multiple consequences, including increased trait value, higher offspring viability, and reduced mutational load. These findings highlight that female sexual preferences for specific male traits can also have further consequences for individual fitness and evolution of specific morphological characteristics.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"c521233d416f76d9bd5c90c8d2e459134030d71b1e78256871d3181e32988d45","category":"Environment"}
