{"title":"Introducing Novel Geometric Insights and Three-Dimensional Depictions of the Pythagorean Theorem for Any Triangles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.1120/v2","date":1712657831000,"content":"The paper primarily demonstrates that the three internal triangles formed by connecting any point on a midsegment with the vertices of a generic triangle satisfy the geometric Proof of the Pythagorean theorem in Euclidean geometry. Moreover, this study elucidates the Pythagorean relationships inherent within three-dimensional geometric constructs resulting from the arrangement of three-dimensional spatial triangles. This geometric relationship, akin to a generalized extension of the Pythagorean theorem, unveils a unique spatial region characterized by this harmonious area interrelation among triangles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75ab0db5918f2ffa7668deb29a84aa664a05d595262e7aebb814b933ecf2e1c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
