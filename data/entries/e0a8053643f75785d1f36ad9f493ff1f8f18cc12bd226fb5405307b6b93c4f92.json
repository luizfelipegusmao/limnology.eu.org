Here we investigated an additional PAD4 role in which it associates with and promotes the maturation of the immune-related cysteine protease RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION 19 (RD19). We found that RD19 and its paralog RD19c promoted EDS1- and PAD4-mediated effector-triggered immunity to an avirulent <span>Pseudomonas syringae</span> strain, DC3000, expressing the effector AvrRps4 and basal immunity against the fungal pathogen <span>Golovinomyces cichoracearum</span>. Overexpression of RD19, but not RD19 protease-inactive catalytic mutants, in Arabidopsis transgenic lines caused EDS1- and PAD4-dependent autoimmunity and enhanced pathogen resistance. In these lines, RD19 maturation to a pro-form required its catalytic residues, suggesting that RD19 undergoes auto-processing. In transient assays, PAD4 interacted preferentially with the RD19 pro-protease and promoted its nuclear accumulation in leaf cells. Our results lead us to propose a model for PAD4-stimulated defense potentiation. PAD4 promotes maturation and nuclear accumulation of processed RD19, and RD19 then stimulates EDS1–PAD4 dimer activity to confer pathogen resistance. This study highlights potentially important additional PAD4 functions that eventually converge on canonical EDS1–PAD4 dimer signaling in plant immunity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"e0a8053643f75785d1f36ad9f493ff1f8f18cc12bd226fb5405307b6b93c4f92","category":"Environment"}
