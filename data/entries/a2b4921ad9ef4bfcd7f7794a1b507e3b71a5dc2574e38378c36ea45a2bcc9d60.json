Event-based electron counting (EBEC), in particular, holds promise as an approach for atomic structure determination by continuous-rotation electron diffraction (MicroED, or 3DED). Fast EBEC is particularly well-suited for quickly measuring weak diffraction signals [<a href=\"#ozae044.455-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.455-B2\">2</a>]. The approach promises to more efficiently measure weak diffraction, which is especially beneficial for samples that are sensitive to radiolytic damage by incident electrons [<a href=\"#ozae044.455-B3\">3</a>]. However, electron counting presents unique challenges for crystallographic diffraction measurements since at Bragg reflections, localized clusters of pixels are more likely to experience counts far exceeding those of the average pixel. Under such conditions, the primary limitation to achieving accurate electron counts is coincidence loss (CL), where the number of electrons that contact a pixel over a given time exceeds the maximum that can be counted, resulting in lost counts. CL reduces the dynamic range of the measured data, and if sufficiently present in a diffraction dataset can result in integrated reflection intensities no longer proportional to the true squared structure factor amplitudes for the crystal.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a2b4921ad9ef4bfcd7f7794a1b507e3b71a5dc2574e38378c36ea45a2bcc9d60","category":"Environment"}
