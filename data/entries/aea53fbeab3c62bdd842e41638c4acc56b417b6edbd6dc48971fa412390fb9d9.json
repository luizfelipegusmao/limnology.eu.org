It has been used to study fluctuations in supercooled liquids [<a href=\"#ozae044.918-B2\">2</a>] and aging in glasses [<a href=\"#ozae044.918-B3\">3</a>]. The equivalent synchrotron technique, x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) has been used to study a wider variety of problems, including colloids, polymers, and ferroelectric and ferromagnetic domain fluctuations. In principle, ECM could be applied to many of these areas as well.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"aea53fbeab3c62bdd842e41638c4acc56b417b6edbd6dc48971fa412390fb9d9","category":"Environment"}
