Therefore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to fabricate the structure into an ideal profile. It is necessary to fabricate a large number of test samples and analyze fabricated profiles for obtaining the ideal profile. The cross-section of fabricated profiles is observed using an electron microscope. The observations are currently done manually and require a large amount of labor and time. To reduce such costs, we study an automatic observation technique for a cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (X-SEM).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5b0776a1e70e7943b1c2d03635aeb6440e3b3519146a12d62cbb5ce842ffd63b","category":"Environment"}
