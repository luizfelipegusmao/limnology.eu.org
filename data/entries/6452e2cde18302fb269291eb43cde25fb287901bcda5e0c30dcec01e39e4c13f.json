{"title":"Spatial Augmented Reality for Expanding the Reach of Individuals with Tremor beyond Their Physical Limits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1887/v1","date":1716903321000,"content":"Tremor is a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by involuntary shaking or trembling of body parts. This condition impairs fine motor skills and hand coordination to varying degrees and can even affect overall body mobility. As a result, tremors severely disrupt the daily lives and work of those affected, significantly limiting their physical activity space. This study developed an innovative Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) system aimed at assisting individuals with tremor disorders to overcome their physical limitations and expand their range of activities. The system integrates eye-tracking and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, enabling users to smoothly control objects in the real world through eye movements. It employs a virtual stabilization algorithm for stable interaction with objects in the real environment. The study comprehensively evaluated the system's performance through three experiments: 1) assessing the effectiveness of the virtual stabilization algorithm in enhancing the system's ability to assist individuals with tremors in stable and efficient interaction with remote objects; 2) evaluating the system's fluidity and stability in performing complex interactive tasks; 3) investigating the precision and efficiency of the system in remote interactions within complex physical environments. The results demonstrate that the system significantly improves the stability and efficiency of interactions between individuals with tremor and remote objects, reduces operational errors, and enhances the accuracy and communication efficiency of interactions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6452e2cde18302fb269291eb43cde25fb287901bcda5e0c30dcec01e39e4c13f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
