{"title":"Analysis of the Impact of Environmental Regulation Heterogeneity on the Eco‐Economic Efficiency of Mariculture Industry","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/7005370?af=R","date":1728300840000,"content":"<p>Mariculture has not fundamentally reduced its dependence on resources and the environment; ecological and economic efficiency has become an important target of concern for the sustainable and healthy development of China’s mariculture industry. Environmental regulation (ER) is a core tool to realize the synergistic development of economic development and environmental resource protection in mariculture. In this paper, the provincial panel data of China’s coastal areas from 2007 to 2020 was selected, and the level of ecological and economic efficiency of mariculture in different provinces of China was measured by using the super slacks-based measurement–data envelopment analysis model considering the undesirable output of mariculture, and the impact of different ERs on ecological and economic efficiency was explored. It was found that the impacts of different ER methods on the eco-economic efficiency (EEF) of mariculture may be non-linearized, and there is also regional heterogeneity in the optimal choice and combination of ER methods to improve the EEF of mariculture.</p>","author":"Jinli Dong, \nManhong Shen, \nPragyan Dash","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"73f2568615454b0560e36ed4aec6b5f75d16836cfe2ab9374526005f61a998f1","category":"Environment"}
