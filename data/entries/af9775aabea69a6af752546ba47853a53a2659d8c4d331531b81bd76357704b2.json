To study the characteristics of high-quality development of the urban mining industry, the high-quality development capacity of this industry from 2006 to 2020 is evaluated based on the entropy weighting – catastrophe progression method, and its development pattern and influencing factors are discussed. The analysis results show that: ①The high-quality development capacity of the urban mining industry declines slowly, with an average annual decline of about 0.399% from 2006 to 2020, and the overall development quality level is on average. The provinces with high-quality development are scattered from the east region of the Hu Line to the north and south regions, and non-high-quality development provinces are contiguous. ②The positive spatial correlation of the urban mining industry is significant, but the agglomeration degree in high-quality development provinces is low-high-low. According to the spatial agglomeration characteristics, the high-quality development pattern is divided into five zones. ③Among the factors driving the high-quality development of the urban mining industry, regional GDP per capita, R&amp;D investment, the number of patent applications granted and Internet penetration rate are the core influencing factors. High-quality sustainable zone and high-quality restoration zone need to rely on the number of granted patent applications to achieve high-quality maintenance and restoration, high-quality compensation zone and high-quality stability maintenance zone need GDP per capita and R&amp;D investment, high-quality development zone relies on Internet penetration rate to explore high-quality development potential.</p>","author":"Yusu Wang, \nJinlong Liu, \nLuomeng Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"af9775aabea69a6af752546ba47853a53a2659d8c4d331531b81bd76357704b2","category":"Environment"}
