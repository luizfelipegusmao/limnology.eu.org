{"title":"The Increasing Role of the Allergist in the Management of Infusion Reactions at the Oncology Day Hospital","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0978/v1","date":1713183479000,"content":"Same-day desensitization (SDD) is a procedure in which desensitization to the drug suspected of causing the hypersensitivity reaction (HR) is performed on the same day as the patient's reaction. In rapid drug desensitization (RDD), desensitization to the suspected drug is performed after an allergological study. The aim of the study was to analyze the diagnostic capacity of the allergist in Oncology Day Hospital (ODH) to establish the phenotype of the HR, in the context of SDD, based exclusively on clinical biomarkers. This is a study of patients treated with desensitization on the same day they had a HR. Later an allergological study (clinical history, skin test, risk assessment, serological biomarkers, drug provocation test if applicable) was performed prior to the following administrations. A total of 35 successful SDDs were performed. A high concordance (91.5% of patients) was found between the phenotype suspected by the allergist after the initial assessment of the patient prior to SDD and the final phenotype after subsequent allergological study performed in the Allergy Department. The presence of the allergist at the ODH allows, in addition to initial treatment according to phenotype, desensitization on the day of the reaction. This will lead to personalized and precision allergology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6090bac8194de3bc9cdde660008e90cac0e0336f0eb8d69aa83ca0a13210338","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
