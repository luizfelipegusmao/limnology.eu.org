The gram-negative bacterium <span>Acinetobacter baumannii</span> exhibits an interesting and unique phenotype characterized by the complete loss of LPS. In this study, we developed a novel system for producing recombinant proteins completely devoid of endotoxin contamination using LPS-deficient <span>A. baumannii</span>. We purified endotoxin-free functional green fluorescent protein, which reduced endotoxin contamination by approximately three orders of magnitude, and also purified the functional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Additionally, utilization of the Omp38 signal peptide of <span>A. baumannii</span> enabled the extracellular production of variable domain of heavy chain of heavy chain (VHH) antibodies. With these advantages, mNb6-tri-20aa, a multivalent VHH that specifically binds to the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, was purified from the culture supernatant, and endotoxin contamination was reduced by a factor of approximately 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> compared with that in conventional expression systems. A virus neutralization assay demonstrated the functionality of the purified antibody in suppressing viral infections. Moreover, we applied our system to produce ozoralizumab, a multispecific VHH that binds to human TNF-α and albumin and are marketed as a rheumatoid arthritis drug. We successfully purified a functional antibody from endotoxin contamination. This system establishes a new, completely endotoxin-free platform for the expression of recombinant proteins, which distinguishes it from other bacterial expression systems, and holds promise for future applications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"6e099a48307cdeeace82f44e03b86b9d73f85f150e34aea2db64908da4e54799","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
