{"title":"Double &ndash; Gold/Nitrogen &ndash; Nanosecond-Laser Doping of Gold-Coated Silicon Wafer Surface in Liquid Nitrogen","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0898/v1","date":1728634891000,"content":"Novel double-impurity doping process for silicon (Si) surfaces was developed, utilizing nanosecond-laser melting of a top 11-nm thick gold (Au) film and a Si wafer substrate in a laser plasma-activated liquid-nitrogen (LN) environment. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the fluence- and exposure-independent surface micro-spike topography, while energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy identified minor Au (0.05 at. %) and major N (1-2 at. %) dopants, localized within a 0.5-m thick surface layer, and slight surface post-oxidation of the micro-relief (oxygen (O), 1.5-2.5 at. %). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy identified bound surface (SiNx) and bulk doping chemical states of the introduced nitrogen (10 at. %), metallic (&amp;lt;0.01 at. %) and cluster (&amp;lt;0.1 at. %) forms of gold dopant, and evaluated their depth distributions, strongly affected by the competition between gold dopant in its marginal local concentrations and other more abundant dopants (N, O). 532-nm Raman micro-spectroscopy indicated the slight reduction of the crystalline order revealed in the second-order Si phonon band, nanoscale dimensions of the resolidified Si nano-crystallites envisioned by the main Si optical-phonon peak, negligible a-Si abundance and a low-wavenumber peak of Si3N4 structure. In contrast, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) 2D-mapping exhibited the only broad structureless absorption bands in the range of 600-5500 cm-1 related to dopant absorption and light-trapping in the surface micro-relief. The room-temperature electrical characteristics of the laser-double-doped Si layer – carrier mobility of 1050 cm2/Vs and background carrier sheet concentration 21010 cm-2 (bulk concentration 1014-1015 cm-3) – are superior regarding previously reported parameters of nitrogen-implanted/annealed Si samples. This novel facile double-element laser-doping procedure paves the way toward local mask-less on-demand introduction of multiple intra-gap intermediate donor and acceptor bands in Si, providing its related multi-wavelength IR photoconductivity for optoelectronic applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56738e3c7ec7d24942bd72682bb506a5af36020205a4a409de94ea5c4269697f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
