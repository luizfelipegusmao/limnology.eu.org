{"title":"Downregulation of circ‐RAPGEF5 inhibits colorectal cancer progression by reducing the expression of polypeptide N‐acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GALNT3)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24278?af=R","date":1716373252000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Circular RNA (circRNA) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the current understanding of the emerging function and mechanism of circ-RAPGEF5 in CRC remains poorly understood.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>We first evaluated the expression level of circ-RAPGEF5 in CRC tissues and cells by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Then, we analyzed cell proliferation (EdU and colony formation assay), migration (cell wound healing assay), invasion (transwell assay), and apoptosis (flow cytometry assay). To further elucidate the mechanism of circ-RAPGEF5 in CRC, bioinformatics tools, Dual-luciferase reporter assay, Ago2 RNA immunoprecipitation assay, and RNA pull-down assay were employed. Moreover, we established a CRC transplantation tumor model to evaluate the effect of circ-RAPGEF5 on tumor growth in vivo.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>circ-RAPGEF5 was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues and CRC cells. Furthermore, the downregulation of circ-RAPGEF5 restrained CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis in vitro. Mechanistically, circ-RAPGEF5 accelerated the malignant behaviors of CRC cells by sponging miR-545-5p, which targeted polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GALNT3). In addition, we revealed that circ-RAPGEF5 silence curbed tumor growth in vivo.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>These findings revealed that circ-RAPGEF5 played an oncogenic role through the miR-545-5p/GALNT3 axis in CRC progression, providing potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of CRC.</p>","author":"Duo Cheng, \nFeifei Chu, \nFang Liang, \nNan Zhang, \nJingjing Wang, \nWenli Yue","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"3ff39d2f48dd0ad0aefdbf742dc22603a0a749f0b37cacd64f7f691d76cf9180","category":"Environment"}
