{"title":"A Comparative Review of Quantum Bits: Superconducting, Topological, Spin, and Emerging Qubit Technologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0608/v1","date":1728436134000,"content":"Quantum computing operates using qubits, the basic units of quantum information, which enable quantum algorithms to solve complex problems that classical computers cannot efficiently handle. This review provides a comparative analysis of several promising qubit technologies, including superconducting qubits, topological qubits, spin qubits, photonic qubits, ion trap qubits, and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds. We discuss the operational principles, key researchers and institutions in each field, current advancements, challenges, and future directions for these technologies. This paper aims to present a thorough overview of the different approaches in qubit technologies and their potential impacts on quantum computingâ€™s future landscape.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5fe00e4b5bfa773d1e6546ee1a0d3ef8b8df6c586aceefe250d8a3a2785c8e41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
