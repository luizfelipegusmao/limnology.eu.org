{"title":"Pregnant Women: A Global Perspective of the Scientific Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1095/v1","date":1718606048000,"content":"For the World Health Organization, and specifically for the International Coordination Committee, the need to bring forward discussions on non-clinical trials in human models, such as vaccine trials in pregnant women, with the aim of demonstrating immunity in newborns, has been addressed. This literature review seeks to investigate the relationship between mothers and newborns in terms of the transfer of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Most of the literary evidence shows that the substantial transfer of transplacental and lactational antibodies to infants confers protection even when the baby is exposed to the disease. However, accurate and conclusive evidence on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy will be a key factor in facilitating the decision-making process for pregnant women to ensure the safety of mother and baby.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4d70914afc4f6b42bcb0b5ca30a1b22edb74cc1c1cb72788862b2f38b38099d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
