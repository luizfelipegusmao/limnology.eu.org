Treatment of 1,4-dioxane at the landfill decreases the concentration of 1,4-dioxane at downstream wastewater and potable reuse facilities protecting finished water quality.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>1,4-Dioxane is a probable human carcinogen and a persistent aquatic contaminant. Cometabolic biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane is a promising low-cost and effective treatment technology; however, further demonstration is needed for treating landfill leachate. This technology was tested in two full-scale moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) treating raw landfill leachate with tetrahydrofuran selected as the cometabolite. The raw leachate contained on average 82 μg/L of 1,4-dioxane and before testing the MBBRs removed an average of 38% and 42% of 1,4-dioxane, respectively. First, tetrahydrofuran was added to MBBR 1, and 1,4-dioxane removal was improved to an average of 73%, with the control MBBR removing an average of 37% of 1,4-dioxane. During this period, an optimal dose of 2 mg/L of tetrahydrofuran was identified. Tetrahydrofuran was then fed to both MBBRs, where the 1,4-dioxane removal was on average 73% and 80%. Cometabolic treatment at the landfill significantly reduced the concentration of 1,4-dioxane received from the landfill at a downstream wastewater treatment and indirect potable reuse facility, reducing the load of 1,4-dioxane from 44% to 24% after the study.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nCometabolic degradation of leachate 1,4-dioxane with THF in MBBRs is a feasible treatment technology and a low-cost technique when retrofitting existing biological treatment facilities.\nThe MBBRs can be operated at a range of temperatures, require no operational changes beyond THF addition, and operate best at a mass ratio of THF to 1,4-dioxane of 24.\nSource control of 1,4-dioxane significantly reduces the concentration of 1,4-dioxane in downstream wastewater treatment plants and potable reuse facilities.\n</p>","author":"Hannah Stohr, \nRohan Menon, \nMicaela Griffin, \nJames Sabo, \nMike Martin, \nBrian Brazil, \nCharles Bott","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"c1e4cdc693d9d2a09d9a75fa6f9f09d71121a8a70e6211be5ddcf0b9ca4a0810","category":"Environment"}
