{"title":"Exploring the impact of ITGB2 on glioma progression and treatment: Insights from non‚Äêapoptotic cell death and immunotherapy","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24231?af=R","date":1710506975000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In the realm of glioma treatment, our groundbreaking research has uncovered the pivotal role of Integrin Beta 2 (ITGB2) in non-apoptotic cell death and its profound implications for immunotherapy efficacy. Gliomas, known for their aggressive and infiltrative nature, demand innovative therapeutic strategies for improved patient outcomes. Our study bridges a critical gap by examining the interplay between non-apoptotic cell death and immunotherapy response in gliomas. Through comprehensive analysis of ten diverse glioma datasets, we developed a unique death enrichment score and identified ITGB2 as a significant risk marker. This study demonstrates that ITGB2 can predict immune activity, mutation characteristics, and drug response in glioma patients. We reveal that ITGB2 not only mediates glioma proliferation and migration but also crucially influences immunotherapy responses by modulating the interaction between gliomas and macrophages by single-cell sequencing analysis (iTalk and ICELLNET). Employing a variety of molecular and cellular methodologies, including in vitro models, our findings highlight ITGB2 as a potent marker in glioma biology, particularly impacting macrophage migration and polarization. We present compelling evidence of ITGB2's dual role in regulating tumor cell behavior and shaping the immune landscape, thereby influencing therapeutic outcomes. The study underlines the potential of ITGB2-targeted strategies in enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy and opens new avenues for personalized treatment approaches in glioma management. In conclusion, this research marks a significant stride in understanding glioma pathology and therapy, positioning ITGB2 as a key biomarker and a promising target in the quest for effective glioma treatments.</p>","author":"Junhong Zhuang, \nChangfeng Miao, \nChao Liu, \nBiying Zeng, \nLinwang Hu, \nJun Peng, \nYing Xia, \nZigui Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"be93bc2d475a6036e64ab1eb89724a56055dc6fc3463a964f4b2569a132ebf04","category":"Environment"}
