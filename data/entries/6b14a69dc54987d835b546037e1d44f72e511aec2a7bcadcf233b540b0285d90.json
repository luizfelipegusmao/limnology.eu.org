Millisecond coherence times, telecom emission and electrical readout have been demonstrated in addition to the benefits from SiCâ€™s technological maturity [<a href=\"#ozae044.773-B1\">1</a>]. Point defects for spin qubits are usually created using ion implantation with subsequent annealing to activate them. The first step towards understanding the behavior of these defects is to study the effects of ion implantation on local structure and its evolution with annealing. A variety of point defects such as interstitials and higher order defects such as dislocation loops are known to be generated [<a href=\"#ozae044.773-B2\">2</a>]. Thus, strategies for characterizing or engineering point defects relevant to spin quantum computing must be able to account for the effects of processing on the host material.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6b14a69dc54987d835b546037e1d44f72e511aec2a7bcadcf233b540b0285d90","category":"Environment"}
