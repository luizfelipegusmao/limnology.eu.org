{"title":"A State-Space Analysis and an Optimal Control Synthesis for a Class of Linear Time-Optimal Control Problems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1431/v1","date":1726818582000,"content":"The paper deals with two new properties of the linear time-optimal control problems with real non-positive eigenvalues of the system. They are the foundation of a new method of synthesizing the time-optimal control without the need to describe the switching hyper-surfaces. The so called “axes initialization” and the synthesis technique are illustrated on the already classical example of the time-optimal control of a double integrator.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0e7b38ef9ae41d1be196beba1a493fa78757a643e23cd3ac18e573f74ef61d5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
