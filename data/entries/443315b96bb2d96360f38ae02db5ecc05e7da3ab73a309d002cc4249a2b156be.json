However, their functionality is often worse than the synthetic or animal-derived ingredients they are meant to replace. The functional performance of plant proteins can be improved by conjugating them with polyphenols. In this study, the formation and stability of oil-in-water emulsions prepared using faba bean protein–grape leaf polyphenol (FP-GLP) conjugates as emulsifiers. Initially, FP-GLP conjugates were formed using an ultrasound-assisted alkali treatment. Then, corn oil-in-water emulsions were prepared using high-intensity sonication (60% amplitude, 10 min) and the impacts of conjugate concentration, pH, ionic strength, freezing–thawing, and heating on their physicochemical properties and stability were determined.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Microscopy and light scattering analysis showed that oil-in-water emulsions containing small oil droplets could be formed at conjugate concentrations of 2% and higher. The addition of salt reduced the electrostatic repulsion between the droplets, which increased their susceptibility to aggregation. Indeed, appreciable droplet aggregation was observed at ≥ 50 mmol/L sodium chloride. The freeze–thaw stability of emulsions prepared with protein–polyphenol conjugates was better than those prepared using the proteins alone. In addition, the emulsions stabilized by the conjugates had a higher viscosity than those prepared by proteins alone.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study showed that FP-GLP conjugates are effective plant-based emulsifiers for forming and stabilizing oil-in-water emulsions. Indeed, emulsions formed using these conjugates showed improved resistance to pH changes, heating, freezing, and salt addition. © 2024 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Tugba Dursun Capar, \nElif Meltem Iscimen, \nDavid Julian McClements, \nHasan Yalcin, \nMehmet Hayta","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"443315b96bb2d96360f38ae02db5ecc05e7da3ab73a309d002cc4249a2b156be","category":"Environment"}
