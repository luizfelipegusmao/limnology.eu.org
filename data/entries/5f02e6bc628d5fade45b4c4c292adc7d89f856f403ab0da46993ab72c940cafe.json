{"title":"System Energy Analysis and COMSOL Simulation of a Superconducting Shielding Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0087/v1","date":1727848152000,"content":"This article proposes a superconducting shielding magnetic field model based on the Meissner effect of superconductors, which blocks magnetic fields. By utilizing the shielding effect of the superconductor on the magnetic field during the phase transition, the model achieves intermittent shielding of electromagnetic force, allowing the electromagnetic force to work intermittently on the moving magnet within the model during its operation. The model is analyzed on the basis of superconducting thermodynamic theory, with a focus on the electromagnetic energy of the system. It is concluded that the energy is not conserved during the operation of the model. To verify the correctness of the analysis, electromagnetic simulations and data analysis were conducted via the COMSOL electromagnetic module and Amp√®re's law superconducting model parameters, which yielded identical results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f02e6bc628d5fade45b4c4c292adc7d89f856f403ab0da46993ab72c940cafe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
