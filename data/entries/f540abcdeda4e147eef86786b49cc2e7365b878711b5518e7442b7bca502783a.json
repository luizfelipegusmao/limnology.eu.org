{"title":"Extensive evaluation of a new LC–MS-MS method to quantify monofluoroacetate toxin in the kidney","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/4/210/7641816?rss=1","date":1712361600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Monofluoroacetate is a highly lethal toxin that causes death by inhibiting cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The heart and brain are the primary target organs. Acute death is attributed to cardiac fibrillation and/or convulsions. Although it occurs naturally in some plants, a major source of animal intoxication is access to sodium monofluoroacetate (NaMFA) pesticide, which continues to be a concern in the USA and around the world despite restricted use in some countries including the USA. There are also concerns about misuse of this pesticide for malicious poisoning. Currently, a tissue-based diagnostic method for NaMFA intoxication in animals is lacking. There is a critical need by the veterinary diagnostic community for a simple, sensitive and reliable tissue-based diagnostic test to confirm NaMFA poisoning in animals. We have developed and extensively evaluated a sensitive novel liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry method suitable for this purpose. The limits of detection and limits of quantitation are 1.7 and 5.0 ng/g, respectively. The accuracy and precision met or exceeded expectations. The method performance was verified using the incurred kidney obtained from animal diagnostic cases. This novel kidney-based method is now available for clinical use and can help with diagnostic purposes, including detecting potential issues related to animal foods.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"f540abcdeda4e147eef86786b49cc2e7365b878711b5518e7442b7bca502783a","category":"Environment"}
