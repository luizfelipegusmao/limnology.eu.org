{"title":"Riverbank fascines mostly fail due to scouring: Consistent evidence from field and flume observations","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4356?af=R","date":1723433991000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The willow fascine soil bioengineering technique is commonly used worldwide in river restoration projects to stabilize riverbanks, thanks to high theoretical shear stress resistance and adaptable configuration. Fascines are composed of bundles of living branches fixed between stakes. When positioned in meanders at bank toe, they are subjected to strong hydraulic constraints. Here, we present the field back-analysis of 470 willow fascines alongside experiments in a small-scale model (scale 1:25). We describe the dynamics of failure in various situations. The field analysis revealed that 78% of fascines present no signs of bank instability. No fascines were pulled out, and they rarely showed signs of destruction once vegetation had established. Flume experiments confirmed that the main mechanical process of failure is erosion at fascine toe and extremities (9% and 3% of occurrence in the field, respectively). The dynamics of failure occur through: (i) erosion at the fascine toe, removing materials under the bundle; (ii) bank sediments, sliding underneath the fascine; (iii) scouring, leaving stakes exposed to falling into the river. Based on these observations, the fascine toe should be protected sufficiently deeply against undermining to keep sediments in place while vegetation is established. Bank slopes should be reduced as far as possible to decrease scouring. Finally, the mean shear stress values used as reference when designing bioengineering techniques do not capture the local and continuous scouring processes leading to failure. Thus, bend curvature, degradation, grain sizes, and level of fascine implementation should be considered when adapting design.</p>","author":"Solange Leblois, \nGuillaume Piton, \nAlain Recking, \nDelphine Jaymond, \nAlexis Buffet, \nAndr√© Evette","siteTitle":"Wiley: River Research and Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"dd8f8dcb48cf1db6f6edba43098839a842d88bad9f088e9d186fa05ae3366ba7","entryHash":"97b51448143fdfea0dfb7f730a2e77cb6c673724f23b5d1b3f474f26a20ad762","category":"Environment"}
