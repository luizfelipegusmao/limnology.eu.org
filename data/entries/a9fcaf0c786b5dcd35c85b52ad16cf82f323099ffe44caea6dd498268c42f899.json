{"title":"Practice Recommendations for the Management of MASLD in Primary care: Consensus Results","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1206/v1","date":1718701862000,"content":"Introduction: Despite its high prevalence and impact on health, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is inadequately addressed in European primary care (PC), with a large proportion of cases going undiagnosed or diagnosed too late. A multi-country European re-search consortium led a project to design and evaluate a patient-centered, integrated model for MASLD screening, diagnosis and linkage to specialty care for European PC settings. \nAim: Based on the lessons from this project, the latest research evidence and existing guidelines for the management of MASLD, we sought to develop a set of practice recommendations for screening, referral and management of MASLD in PC. \nMethods: The Rand/UCLA modified Delphi panel method, with two rounds, was used to reach consensus on practice recommendations. The international panel consisted of experts from six countries, representing family medicine, gastroenterology, hepatology, cardiology and public health. Initially, fifteen statements were drafted based on a synthesis of evidence from the literature and earlier findings from our consortium. Prior to the consensus meeting, the statements were rated by the experts in a first round. Then, in a hybrid meeting, the experts discussed findings of round one, adjusted the statements and reassessed the updated recommendations in a second round. \nResults: In round one, there was already a high level of consensus on 10 out of 15 statements. After round 2, there were fourteen statements with a high agreement (&gt;90%). One statement was not endorsed. The approved recommendations addressed the following practice areas: risk screening and diagnosis, management of MASLD â€“ Lifestyle interventions, pharmacological treatment of MASLD/MASH, pharmacological treatment for co-morbidity, integrated care, surgical management and other referrals to specialists. \nConclusion: The final set of 14 recommendations focuses on increasing comprehensive care for MASLD in PC. The recommendations provide practical evidence-based guidance tailored to PC practitioners. We expect that these recommendations will contribute to the ongoing discussion on systematic approaches to tackle MASLD and support European PC providers by integrating the latest evidence into practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a9fcaf0c786b5dcd35c85b52ad16cf82f323099ffe44caea6dd498268c42f899","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
