{"title":"May Combination Therapy with Endothelin Receptor Antagonist and PDE5 Inhibitors Prevent Echocardiographic Findings Suspicious for PAH? Description of a Real-Life Case Series","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0928/v1","date":1710504950000,"content":"Objective: to retrospectively evaluate the incidence rate (IR) of echocardiographic signs suspected for pulmonary hypertension (PH) in Systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients after the introduction of a combination therapy with bosentan and sildenafil for treatment or prevention of digital ulcers. Methods: patients attending the Scleroderma Unit of the Universital Hospital of Careggi from July 2010 to July 2023 were enrolled. Patients older than 18 years old, with an history of digital ulcers, treated with bosentan and sildenafil in combination for at least 12 months were included. Patients with a diagnosis of PH preceding the introduction of the therapy were excluded. Demographical data, disease duration, laboratoristic and instrumental data (pulmonary function tests, echocardiographic estimation of pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs) and ultrasonographic value of renal resistive index) were collected. The IR of echocardiographic signs suspected for pulmonary hypertension and their 95% confidence interval were calculated in events/1000 patients-years.Results: forty-seven patients were enrolled; mean disease duration was 12,14 years (SD 5,87). Mean duration of the combination treatment was 78.33 (SD 41.37) months and total at-risk time was 3525 months. Two patients (4,2%) presented echocardiographic signs of PH (sPAP 50 mmHg and 40 mmHg); the IR was calculated to be 6.8/1000 patients-years (95% CI 6,02-7,7). In one of the 2 patients RHC excluded PAH, while the other patient refused to undergo to RHC and PAH could not be confirmed/excluded. A stability of PFTs and echocardiografic PAPs was observed during the observation time. Conclusions: the results of this retrospective study suggest that combination therapy with endothelin receptor antagonist and Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors could help in preventing PAH in SSc; prospective case-control studies on larger population are needed to improve knowledge in this field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e16045241d4d0365e01673cb8e10db697df8e0910e45b78a4730e9140c9d997","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
