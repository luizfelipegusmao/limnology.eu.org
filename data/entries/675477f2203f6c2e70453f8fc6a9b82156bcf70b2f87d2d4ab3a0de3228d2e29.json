Bolnga</p>\r\nBackground <p>Pregnancy termination or induced abortion is not decriminalized, and access to safe abortion services is largely unavailable in Papua New Guinea (PNG). However, the practice is common throughout the country. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and determine factors associated with pregnancy termination among married women aged 15–49 years in PNG.</p> Methods <p>Secondary data from the 2016–2018 PNG Demographic and Health Survey (PNGDHS) was used. A total weighted sample of 6,288 married women were included. The Complex Sample Analysis method was used to account for the cluster design and sample weight of the study. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression were used to assess factors associated with pregnancy termination. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) were reported.</p> Results <p>The prevalence of pregnancy termination was 5.3%. Nearly half (45.2%) of all pregnancy terminations occurred in the Highlands region. Women aged 35–44 years (aOR = 8.54; 95% CI: 1.61–45.26), not working (aOR = 6.17; 95% CI: 2.26–16.85), owned a mobile phone (aOR = 3.77; 95% CI: 1.60–8.84), and lived in urban areas (aOR = 5.66; 95% CI: 1.91–16.81) were more likely to terminate a pregnancy. Women who experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) were 2.27 times (aOR = 2.27; 95% CI: 1.17–4.41) more likely to terminate a pregnancy compared to those who did not experience IPV. Women with unplanned pregnancies were 6.23 times (aOR = 6.23; 95% CI: 2.61–14.87) more likely to terminate a pregnancy. Women who knew about modern contraceptive methods and made independent decisions for contraceptive use were 3.38 and 2.54 times (aOR = 3.38; 95% CI: 1.39–8.18 and aOR = 2.54; 95% CI: 1.18–5.45, respectively) more likely to terminate a pregnancy.</p> Conclusion <p>The findings highlight the role of sociodemographic and maternal factors in pregnancy termination among married women in PNG. Efforts aimed at reducing unplanned pregnancies and terminations should focus on comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education and improving easy access to contraceptives for married couples. Post-abortion care should also be integrated into the country’s legal framework and added as an important component of existing sexual and reproductive health services.</p>","author":"McKenzie Maviso","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"675477f2203f6c2e70453f8fc6a9b82156bcf70b2f87d2d4ab3a0de3228d2e29","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
