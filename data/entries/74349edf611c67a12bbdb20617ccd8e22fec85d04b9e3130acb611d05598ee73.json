{"title":"Selectivity filter mutations shift ion permeation mechanism in potassium channels","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae272/7706351?rss=1","date":1720137600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channels combine high conductance with high ion selectivity. To explain this efficiency, two molecular mechanisms have been proposed. The “direct knock-on” mechanism is defined by water-free K<sup>+</sup> permeation and formation of direct ion–ion contacts in the highly conserved selectivity filter (SF). The “soft knock-on” mechanism involves co-permeation of water and separation of K<sup>+</sup> by water molecules. With the aim to distinguish between these mechanisms, crystal structures of the KcsA channel with mutations in two SF residues—G77 and T75—were published, where the arrangements of K<sup>+</sup> ions and water display canonical soft knock-on configurations. These data were interpreted as evidence of the soft knock-on mechanism in wild-type channels. Here, we test this interpretation using molecular dynamics simulations of KcsA and its mutants. We show that while a strictly water-free direct knock-on permeation is observed in the wild type, conformational changes induced by these mutations lead to distinct ion permeation mechanisms, characterized by co-permeation of K<sup>+</sup> and water. These mechanisms are characterized by reduced conductance and impaired potassium selectivity, supporting the importance of full dehydration of potassium ions for the hallmark high conductance and selectivity of K<sup>+</sup> channels. In general, we present a case where mutations introduced at the critical points of the permeation pathway in an ion channel drastically change its permeation mechanism in a nonintuitive manner.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"74349edf611c67a12bbdb20617ccd8e22fec85d04b9e3130acb611d05598ee73","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
