{"title":"Estimation of actual evapotranspiration from different ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau based on a generalized complementary evapotranspiration theory model","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2635?af=R","date":1713494518000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Actual evapotranspiration constitutes a vital component of the exchange of energy and water vapour between the soil-vegetation and atmospheric systems on terrestrial terrain. Nevertheless, the Tibetan Plateau, owing to its austere environmental conditions, harbours a scarcity of terrestrial monitoring stations. This circumstance presents a formidable challenge in attaining precise estimations of actual evapotranspiration. The complementary relationship method is a potential approach because it requires only routine meteorological data to estimate actual evapotranspiration on a regional or global scale. However, the suitability of the complementary relationship model across diverse ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau necessitates further investigation. In this study, we scrutinized the simulation of daily and monthly actual evapotranspiration across 18 observation sites spanning eight distinct land use categories on the Tibetan Plateau. We employed the polynomial generalized complementary function introduced by Brutsaert (B2015), alongside its enhanced rendition proposed by Szilagyi (S2017) and Crago (C2018). The outcomes reveal that all three models adeptly replicate the fluctuations in actual evapotranspiration, irrespective of land use category or temporal scale—whether daily or monthly. This is true regardless of whether original or calibrated parameter values are applied. However, there exist significant variations in the performance of these models. In general, the C2018 model demonstrates superior performance across most ecosystems when original parameters are employed. Following parameter calibration, the simulation efficacy of the models experienced marked enhancement. Post parameter calibration, the B2015 model outperforms the other two models notably in desert and wetland environments. Furthermore, the simulation outputs from all three models display heightened sensitivity to parameter α, particularly in the context of the C2018 and S2017 models. These findings suggest that accurate estimation of parameter values is critical to improving the accuracy of estimating actual evapotranspiration. Calibrated parameter values, contingent on a fusion of vegetation, meteorology and surface roughness, exhibit variability across diverse ecosystems.</p>","author":"Yanyu Dai, \nFan Lu, \nJintao Liu, \nBenqing Ruan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"505bee8e8238fd880f8abe7e77fd06d2c07d0f1e81c6d0334e1cca869f40bb89","category":"Environment"}
