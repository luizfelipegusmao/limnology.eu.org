{"title":"Circulating hypervirulent Marek’s disease viruses in vaccinated chicken flocks in Taiwan by genetic analysis of <i>meq</i> oncogene","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303371","date":1715349600000,"content":"<p>by Ming-Chu Cheng, Guan-Hua Lai, Yi-Lun Tsai, Yi-Yang Lien</p>\r\n\r\nMarek’s disease (MD) is an important neoplastic disease caused by serotype 1 Marek’s disease virus (MDV-1), which results in severe economic losses worldwide. Despite vaccination practices that have controlled the MD epidemic, current increasing MD-suspected cases indicate the persistent viral infections circulating among vaccinated chicken farms in many countries. However, the lack of available information about phylogeny and molecular characterization of circulating MDV-1 field strains in Taiwan reveals a potential risk in MD outbreaks. This study investigated the genetic characteristics of 18 MDV-1 strains obtained from 17 vaccinated chicken flocks in Taiwan between 2018 and 2020. Based on the sequences of the <i>meq</i> oncogene, the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the circulating Taiwanese MDV-1 field strains were predominantly in a single cluster that showed high similarity with strains from countries of the East Asian region. Because the strains were obtained from CVI988/Rispens vaccinated chicken flocks and the molecular characteristics of the Meq oncoprotein showed features like vvMDV and vv+MDV strains, the circulating Taiwanese MDV-1 field strains may have higher virulence compared with vvMDV pathotype. In conclusion, the data presented demonstrates the circulation of hypervirulent MDV-1 strains in Taiwan and highlights the importance of routine surveillance and precaution strategies in response to the emergence of enhanced virulent MDV-1.","author":"Ming-Chu Cheng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"99f56c771d6fdf6aad212f733fa8d562f032498c8220a3a0af259923eb7d6fad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
