{"title":"Addressing Waste Management Challenges in Costa Rica: An Analysis of Current Practices, Government Initiatives, and Future Projections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0274/v1","date":1722910617000,"content":"Costa Rica, renowned for its environmental sustainability, faces a significant waste management crisis. Despite its commitment to renewable energy and biodiversity conservation, waste management inefficiencies, particularly in urban areas such as San Jos√©, pose severe environmental and public health risks. This study investigated the current state of waste management in Costa Rica, highlighting critical issues of landfill capacity, regional practices, and public participation in recycling. Using data from 2015 to 2023, linear regression models predict trends in waste minimization practices, providing insights into the potential impacts of ongoing government initiatives. The key findings indicate that Costa Rica's recycling rate is approximately 9%, which is significantly lower than the global average of 32% and is well below that of the EU at 47% and that of Germany at 67%. This underscores the need for improved infrastructure and public education. The Environmental Health Route policy aims to increase the recycling rate to 25% by 2033, while the National Circular Economy Strategy targets comprehensive waste management improvements.Effective implementation, increased funding, and enhanced enforcement are essential, particularly in rural areas where recycling participation is less than 10%. This research offers a comprehensive analysis of Costa Rica's waste management challenges and proposes actionable recommendations to improve practices and increase recycling rates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1533c6a60c485f30f307a1341cb31fbe27fb28a76151ad6852063d236a7a4c90","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
