{"title":"Fractianal Calculus for Non-discrete Signed Measures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0488/v1","date":1723046006000,"content":"In this paper we suggest a first ever construction of fractional integral\n\tand differential operators based on signed measures including a vector-valued case. The study focuses on constructing the fractional power of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral with a signed measure, using semigroup theory. The main result is a theorem that provides the exact form of a semigroup for the Riemann-Stieltjes integral with a measure having a countable number of extrema. The article provides examples of semigroups based on integral operators with signed measures and discusses the fractional powers of differential operators with partial derivatives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"641fcc70b22f9506e40ca3c5684cb6bde7bebfca1696a741650c3533f79e9aa3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
