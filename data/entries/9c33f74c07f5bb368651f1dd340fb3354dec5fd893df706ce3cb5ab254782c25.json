{"title":"Chemical Diversity of Ketosteroids as Potential Therapeutic Agents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2387/v1","date":1722328000000,"content":"This article presents a comprehensive overview of recent discoveries and advancements in the field of steroid chemistry, highlighting the isolation and characterization of various steroidal compounds from natural sources. The paper discusses a wide range of steroids, including pregnane steroids, steroidal alkaloids, ketosteroids, and novel triterpenoids, derived from marine organisms, fungi, and plants. Significant findings include the isolation of bioactive compounds such as the cytotoxic erectsterates from microorganisms, soft corals, the unusual tetracyclic steroid penicillitone from a fungal culture, and innovative steroidal derivatives with potential anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. The synthesis of steroids from microorganisms as a tool for pharmaceutical development is also explored, showcasing the role of microbial biotransformation in generating steroidal drugs. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the ecological and medicinal relevance of these compounds, which are often used in traditional medicine and have potential therapeutic applications in treating diseases like cancer and microbial infections. This article serves as a vital resource for researchers interested in the chemical diversity of steroids and their applications in drug discovery and development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9c33f74c07f5bb368651f1dd340fb3354dec5fd893df706ce3cb5ab254782c25","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
