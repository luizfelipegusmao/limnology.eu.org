{"title":"Bioactive compound composition and cellular antioxidant activity of fig (Ficus carica L.)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13214?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Fig (<i>Ficus carica</i> L.) fruit is consumed worldwide as a functional food. It contains phytochemicals that have been related to health benefits. However, the characteristic chemicals remain unclear. In this work, phytochemicals were prepared from figus by ultrasound-assisted extraction under optimized conditions. The chemical composition of fig fruit and leaves was characterized by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>One hundred and fifty-seven compounds were identified, including 58 flavonoids, 29 coumarins, 19 acids, 15 terpenoids, 11 alkaloids, and 25 other compounds. The mass spectrum (MS) fragmentation pathways of representative chemicals were elucidated. Flavonoid glycosides and prenylated flavonoids were mainly present in fig fruit, whereas coumarins were abundant in leaves. Both fig fruit and leaf extracts showed good cellular antioxidant activity.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The full phytochemical profile of fig was revealed by UPLC-MS/MS. Prenylated flavonoids and prenylated coumarins were the characteristic phytochemicals. These data provided useful information for the extensive utilization of fig fruit in functional food.
