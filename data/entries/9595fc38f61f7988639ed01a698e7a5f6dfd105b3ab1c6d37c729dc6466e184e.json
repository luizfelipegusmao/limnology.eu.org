{"title":"Measuring trust in one’s physician: A scoping review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303840","date":1715954400000,"content":"<p>by Linda R.

However, the conceptualization and subsequent operationalization of trust have become clouded due to the multitude of approaches that have resulted in several different measures with varied dimensions and indicators. The objectives of this scoping review were: 1) to discover any new developments in the measurement of trust, 2) to identify those measures of trust, whether newly created or refined in the last ten years, that have known reliability and validity, and 3) to compare those instruments’ conceptualizations, dimensions, and indicators. This researcher conducted an electronic search of three databases (PubMed, SOCAB, and PsycINFO). Two reviewers screened those selected studies and identified the following six key measurement tools, of which three had shorter, more abbreviated derivatives: the Trust in Physician Scale and its modification, the Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale and its short form, the Health Care Relationship Trust Scale and its refinement, the Trust in Oncologist Scale and its shortened form, the Trust in Health Care Providers Scale, and the Trust in My Doctor Scale. Of these six distinct tools, only the Trust in Oncologist Scale was developed and validated in non-US populations. Also identified were ten dimensions of trust: fidelity, technical competence, communicative competence, interpersonal competence (i.e., caring), honesty, confidentiality, global, behavioral, fairness, and system trust/accountability. Interpersonal competence and fairness emerged as newer dimensions that deserve further study. A comparative analysis of the indicators of these trust dimensions revealed some discrepancies that deserve theoretical and psychometric attention. In addition, incorporating item-response theory to assess measurement invariance has enhanced the assessment of external validity. This review provides a resource for researchers that will lead to a more uniform understanding of trust, thereby setting the basis for future theoretical integration and measurement development.","author":"Linda R.
