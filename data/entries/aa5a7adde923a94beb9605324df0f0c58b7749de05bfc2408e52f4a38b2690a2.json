{"title":"Prevention of Pregnancy Complications Using a Multimodal Lifestyle, Screening, and Medical Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1331/v1","date":1718789334000,"content":"Understanding and preventing the “great obstetrical syndromes” has been the focus of pregnancy research for decades. The combined global impact from these syndromes on maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality is compounded by increased long-term risk of adverse health effects following pregnancy. Accumulating evidence indicates that conditions such as pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, spontaneous preterm labour, and stillbirth, are syndromes with etiologic heterogeneity that share common pathophysiologic pathways involving placental dysfunction. Recently, the importance of the interaction between fetal and maternal genomes has been extended to include the epigenetic impact of pre-existing maternal pathophysiology on placental development and highlights the importance of nutritional and environmental factors in altered placentation. Validated first-trimester screening algorithms for preeclampsia can identify high-risk women and prophylactic treatment with low-dose aspirin can be initiated. High-risk women can be monitored during the second trimester using clinical assessment, ultrasound, and biochemical markers, that are able to predict complications prior to the development of clinical signs and symptoms. The integration of lifestyle interventions, pregnancy screening, and medical management represents a conceptual advance in pregnancy care. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce pregnancy complications, maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, adverse health outcomes later in life, and health-care costs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa5a7adde923a94beb9605324df0f0c58b7749de05bfc2408e52f4a38b2690a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
