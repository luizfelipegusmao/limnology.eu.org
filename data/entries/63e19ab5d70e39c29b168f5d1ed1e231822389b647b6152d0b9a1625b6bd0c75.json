{"title":"Trypsin and Trypsinogen Activation Peptide in the Prediction of Severity of Acute Pancreatitis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0681/v1","date":1710227596000,"content":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the predictive value of serum trypsin and Trypsinogen Activation Peptide (TAP) for the severity of AP by means of a single center cohort study as well as a systematic review of the current literature. METHODS: The literature search was conducted using Medline (PubMed), EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register. A total of 142 patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) were included in the cohort study and parameters of the revised Atlanta criteria of 2012 and the APACHE II were assessed. RESULTS: The review showed promising results for the predictive value of serum trypsinogen-2, but conflicting results for serum TAP and trypsin. In the cohort study, patients were observed for 4 days after diagnosis of AP: 9 patients had severe AP, 35 patients had moderate AP and 81 patients had mild AP. The ratio of the geometric mean of severe vs mild AP for trypsin was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.51-1.00), p=0.053 and for TAP 0.74 (95% CI: 0.54-1.01), p=0.055 respectively. CONCLUSION: The cohort study showed an inverse correlation of serum levels of TAP and trypsin with severity of AP. Serum TAP and trypsin have an inferior predictive value of severity of AP compared to the clinical APACHE II score.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63e19ab5d70e39c29b168f5d1ed1e231822389b647b6152d0b9a1625b6bd0c75","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
