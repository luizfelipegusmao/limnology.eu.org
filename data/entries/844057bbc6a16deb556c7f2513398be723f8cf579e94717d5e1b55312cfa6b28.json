{"title":"Efficient production of isomaltulose using engineered Yarrowia lipolytica strain facilitated by non‐yeast signal peptide‐mediated cell surface display","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13426?af=R","date":1709564351000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Isomaltulose is a ‘generally recognized as safe’ ingredient and is widely used in food, pharmaceutical and chemical industries. Exploration and development of efficient technologies are essential for enhancing isomaltulose yield.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>In this study, a simple and efficient surface display platform mediated by a non-yeast signal peptide was developed in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> and was utilized to efficiently produce isomaltulose from sucrose. We discovered that the signal peptide SP1 of sucrose isomerase from <i>Pantoea dispersa</i> UQ68J (PdSI) could guide SIs anchoring to the cell surface of <i>Y. lipolytica</i>, demonstrating a novel and simple cell surface display strategy. Furthermore, the PdSI expression level was significantly increased through optimizing the promoters and multi-site integrating genes into chromosome. The final strain gained 451.7 g L<sup>−1</sup> isomaltulose with conversion rate of 90.3% and space–time yield of 50.2 g L<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This study provided an efficient way for manufacturing isomaltulose with high space–time yield. This heterogenous signal peptide-mediated cell surface display strategy featured with small fusion tag (~2.2 kDa of SP1), absence of enzyme leakage in fermentation broth, and ample room for optimization, providing a convenient way to construct whole-cell biocatalysts to synthesize other products and broadening the array of molecular toolboxes accessible for engineering <i>Y. lipolytica</i>.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
