{"title":"Efficient production of isomaltulose using engineered Yarrowia lipolytica strain facilitated by non‐yeast signal peptide‐mediated cell surface display","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13426?af=R","date":1710221666000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Isomaltulose is a ‘generally recognized as safe’ ingredient and is widely used in the food, pharmaceutical and chemical industries. The exploration and development of efficient technologies is essential for enhancing isomaltulose yield.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In the present study, a simple and efficient surface display platform mediated by a non-yeast signal peptide was developed in <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> and utilized to efficiently produce isomaltulose from sucrose. We discovered that the signal peptide SP1 of sucrose isomerase from <i>Pantoea dispersa</i> UQ68J (PdSI) could guide SIs anchoring to the cell surface of <i>Y. lipolytica</i>, demonstrating a novel and simple cell surface display strategy. Furthermore, the PdSI expression level was significantly increased through optimizing the promoters and multi-site integrating genes into chromosome. The final strain gained 451.7 g L<sup>−1</sup> isomaltulose with a conversion rate of 90.3% and a space–time yield of 50.2 g L<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study provides an efficient way for manufacturing isomaltulose with a high space–time yield. This heterogenous signal peptide-mediated cell surface display strategy featured with small fusion tag (approximately 2.2 kDa of SP1), absence of enzyme leakage in fermentation broth and ample room for optimization, providing a convenient way to construct whole-cell biocatalysts to synthesize other products and broadening the array of molecular toolboxes accessible for engineering <i>Y. lipolytica</i>. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Juanjuan Liu, \nJiao Li, \nPeng Chen, \nYan Zeng, \nJiangang Yang, \nYuanxia Sun","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"844057bbc6a16deb556c7f2513398be723f8cf579e94717d5e1b55312cfa6b28","category":"Environment"}
