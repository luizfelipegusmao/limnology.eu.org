{"title":"The Impact of Parental Depression, Anxiety, and Stress on Adolescents&rsquo; Mental Health and Quality of Life: The Moderating Role of Parental Rejection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1329/v1","date":1726573319000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Parental internalizing issues, particularly maternal mental health, can significantly influence adolescents' mental health by altering parenting behaviors and roles. This study aims to explore how parental rejection, a dimension of both maternal and paternal behavior, moderates the relationship between parental depression, anxiety, and stress with adolescents' mental health and quality of life. We hypothesized that parental rejection would have a significant moderating effect on these relationships; Methods: This cross-sectional, non-interventional study involved 206 parents (138 mothers) of adolescents aged 12-18 years from the general population. Participants were recruited online via convenience sampling and completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), the Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire, the KIDSCREEN-27 to evaluate adolescents' quality of life, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire to assess adolescents' mental health; Results: Parental rejection was found to moderate the relationship between maternal anxiety and adolescents' quality of life, as well as between maternal anxiety and adolescents' mental health problems. Paternal rejection moderated the relationship between paternal stress and adolescents' mental health. However, parental rejection did not moderate the relationship between parental depression and adolescents' quality of life or mental health; Conclusions: These findings emphasize the significant role of maternal rejection in the association between maternal mental health, particularly anxiety, and adolescents' mental health outcomes. Paternal rejection also showed some moderating effects, though to a lesser extent. These results underscore the importance of considering both maternal and paternal influences in adolescent mental health and quality of life. Further research is necessary to fully understand the gender-specific dynamics of these relationships.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c8f4e67d57835be3fac54276d688a6b9aa3dfb9de25ca25cadef494e0e9199a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
