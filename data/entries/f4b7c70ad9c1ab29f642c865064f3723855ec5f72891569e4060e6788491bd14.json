{"title":"Interleukin-33 and Obesity-Related inflammation and Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0252/v1","date":1725398919000,"content":"Obesity and chronic inflammation are well-known risk factors for cancer. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) functions in inflammatory diseases, particularly those related to obesity and cancer. However, the correlation and molecular mechanisms linking IL-33, obesity, and cancer remain unclear. IL-33 is a nuclear cytokine released as an alarm signal when cells are damaged or stressed. It is expressed in epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblast-like cells during normal conditions and in-flammation. When IL-33 is present, immune cells expressing the IL-1RL1/ST2 receptor are alerted in response to tissue damage or cell injury. Research on IL-33 and its correlation with obesity has revealed improvements in inflammatory and metabolic changes associated with obesity. IL-33 can have both pro-tumorigenic and antitumorigenic effects, depending on the cellular content, in-flammatory environment, expression levels, and bioactivity of IL-33. This review will discuss the various functions of IL-33 in obesity-driven inflammation and cancers and how they intersect.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f4b7c70ad9c1ab29f642c865064f3723855ec5f72891569e4060e6788491bd14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
