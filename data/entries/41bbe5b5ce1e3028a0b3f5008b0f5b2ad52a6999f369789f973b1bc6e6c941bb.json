{"title":"The Na+/Ca2+ antiporter slr0681 affects carotenoid production in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 under high‐light stress","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13205?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Carotenoids play key roles in photosynthesis and are widely used in foods as natural pigments, antioxidants, and health-promoting compounds. Enhancing carotenoid production in microalgae via biotechnology has become an important area of research.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>We knocked out the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> antiporter gene <i>slr0681</i> in <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 via homologous recombination and evaluated the effects on carotenoid production under normal (NL) and high-light (HL) conditions. On day 7 of NL treatment in calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)-free medium, the cell density of Δ<i>slr0681</i> decreased by 29% compared to the wild type (WT). After 8 days of HL treatment, the total carotenoid contents decreased by 35% in Δ<i>slr0681</i>, and the contents of individual carotenoids were altered: myxoxanthophyll, echinenone, and β-carotene contents increased by 10%, 50%, and 40%, respectively, while zeaxanthin contents decreased by ~40% in Δ<i>slr0681 versus</i> the WT. The expression patterns of carotenoid metabolic pathway genes also differed: <i>ipi</i> expression increased by 1.2- to 8.5-fold, whereas <i>crtO</i> and <i>crtR</i> expression decreased by ~90% and 60%, respectively, in ∆<i>slr0681 versus</i> the WT. In addition, in ∆<i>slr0681</i>, the expression level of <i>psaB</i> (encoding a photosystem I structural protein) doubled, whereas the expression levels of the photosystem II genes <i>psbA2</i> and <i>psbD</i> decreased by ~53% and 84%, respectively, compared to the WT.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These findings suggest that slr0681 plays important roles in regulating carotenoid biosynthesis and structuring of the photosystems in <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. This study provides a theoretical basis for the genetic engineering of microalgae photosystems to increase their economic benefits and lays the foundation for developing microalgae germplasm resources with high carotenoid contents. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jiaye Zhang, \nHuairong Zhong, \nNing Xuan, \nRubina Mushtaq, \nYahui Shao, \nXue Cao, \nPengchong Wang, \nGao Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"41bbe5b5ce1e3028a0b3f5008b0f5b2ad52a6999f369789f973b1bc6e6c941bb","category":"Environment"}
