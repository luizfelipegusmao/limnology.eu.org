{"title":"CRUMPLED LEAF supports plastid OUTER ENVELOPE PROTEIN OF 80 KDA complex formation in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2422/7571221?rss=1","date":1705449600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Embedded β-barrel proteins in the outer envelope membrane mediate most cellular trafficking between the cytoplasm and plastids. Although the TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER ENVELOPE MEMBRANE OF CHLOROPLASTS 75-V (TOC75-V)/OUTER ENVELOPE PROTEIN OF 80 KDA (OEP80) complex has been implicated in the insertion and assembly of β-barrel proteins in the outer envelope membrane of Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) chloroplasts, relatively little is known about this process. <span>CRUMPLED LEAF</span> (<span>CRL</span>) encodes a chloroplast outer envelope membrane-localized protein, and its loss-of-function mutation results in pleiotropic defects, including altered plant morphogenesis, growth retardation, suppression of plastid division, and spontaneous light intensity-dependent localized cell death. A suppressor screen conducted on mutagenized <span>crl</span> mutants revealed that a missense mutation in <span>OEP80</span> suppresses the pleiotropic defects of <span>crl</span>. Furthermore, we found that OEP80 complex formation is compromised in <span>crl</span>. Additionally, we demonstrated that CRL interacts with OEP80 in vivo and that a portion of CRL is present at the same molecular weight as the OEP80 complex. Our results suggest that CRL interacts with OEP80 to facilitate its complex formation. CRL is involved in plastid protein import; therefore, the pleiotropic defects in <span>crl</span> are likely due to the combined effects of decreased plastid protein import and altered membrane integration of β-barrel proteins in the outer envelope membrane. This study sheds light on the mechanisms that allow β-barrel protein integration into the plastid outer envelope membrane and the importance of this finding for plant cellular processes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"506beb837f22b1fb2179ac73b1fa8be78b1b61d22368861d57c61d0299a6d9bb","category":"Environment"}
