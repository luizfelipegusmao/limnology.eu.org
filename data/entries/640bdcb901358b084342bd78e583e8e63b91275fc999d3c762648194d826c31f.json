{"title":"Towards the development of a standardized method to monitor lakeshore hydromorphological restoration measures","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4152?af=R","date":1713769200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nLakes host a high level of biodiversity, especially in their littoral zone, and provide various ecological and socio-economic services. Lake ecosystems are impacted by a combination of pressures from different human activities (industry, hydroelectricity, agriculture, recreational activities, domestic and urban uses). Anthropic pressures can lead to alterations and dysfunctions in lakes, particularly in the littoral zone.\nThe 2000 EU Water Framework Directive led to considerable efforts to improve the ecological status of European water bodies. However, in France, measures implemented by lake managers to counteract, limit or suppress anthropogenic impacts are still poorly identified. Moreover, their effects on hydromorphology, physico-chemistry and biotic communities are often only partially reported (the monitoring being incomplete or heterogeneous, if not missing).\nThis paper proposes a framework to harmonize the monitoring of habitat improvement actions conducted in the littoral zone of lakes. The monitoring method is presented as well as the sampling protocols and techniques set out to survey both the restored and control zones at the European French territory scale.\nLong-term monitoring of hydromorphological, biological and physicochemical features is expected to improve our understanding of recolonization mechanisms following restoration. The proposed approach will therefore guide practitioners to identify the best restoration options and ultimately contribute to the conservation of recipient populations and communities.\n</p>","author":"Coralie Garron, \nAlthaea Pangaud, \nMarine Taubaty, \nMarlène Rolan‐Meynard, \nChristine Argillier, \nJean‐Claude Raymond, \nJulien Dublon, \nSamuel Westrelin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems: Table of Contents","siteHash":"53f1a0c472ad7591633d0b281e1df2834126145a77ec9c0585f4049ad3e52c8f","entryHash":"640bdcb901358b084342bd78e583e8e63b91275fc999d3c762648194d826c31f","category":"Environment"}
