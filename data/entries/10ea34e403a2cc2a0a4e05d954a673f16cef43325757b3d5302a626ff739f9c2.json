{"title":"Transcription factor PbNAC71 regulates xylem and vessel development to control plant height","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/395/7514058?rss=1","date":1704844800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Dwarfism is an important agronomic trait in fruit breeding programs. However, the germplasm resources required to generate dwarf pear (<span>Pyrus</span> spp.) varieties are limited. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying dwarfism remain unclear. In this study, “Yunnan” quince (<span>Cydonia oblonga</span> Mill.) had a dwarfing effect on “Zaosu” pear. Additionally, the dwarfism-related NAC transcription factor gene <span>PbNAC71</span> was isolated from pear trees comprising “Zaosu” (scion) grafted onto “Yunnan” quince (rootstock). Transgenic <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> and pear OHF-333 (<span>Pyrus communis</span>) plants overexpressing <span>PbNAC71</span> exhibited dwarfism, with a substantially smaller xylem and vessel area relative to the wild-type controls. Yeast one-hybrid, dual-luciferase, chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that PbNAC71 downregulates <span>PbWalls are thin 1</span> expression by binding to NAC-binding elements in its promoter. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that PbNAC71 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase PbRING finger protein 217 (PbRNF217). Furthermore, PbRNF217 promotes the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PbNAC71 by the 26S proteasome, thereby regulating plant height as well as xylem and vessel development. Our findings reveal a mechanism underlying pear dwarfism and expand our understanding of the molecular basis of dwarfism in woody plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"10ea34e403a2cc2a0a4e05d954a673f16cef43325757b3d5302a626ff739f9c2","category":"Environment"}
