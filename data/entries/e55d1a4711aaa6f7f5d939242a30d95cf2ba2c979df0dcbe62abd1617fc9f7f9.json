{"title":"Altered Expression of C4BPA and CXCL1 Genes in the Endometrium of Patients with Recurrent Implantation Failure after In Vitro Fertilization and Thin Endometrium","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0869/v1","date":1723531441000,"content":"Nowadays recurrent implantation failure (RIF) after invitro fertilization is common problem that reproductive specialists usually faced. The phenomenon of thin endometrium in RIF patients has yet not completely understood and properly treated. This study aimed to reveal significantly dysregulated selected genes expression between RIF patients with thin endometrium and fertile women. Endometrial samples were collected in the implantation window days (LH+7 â€“ LH+10) of the natural menstrual cycle from RIF patients (n=20) and fertile women (n=14). Ten genes were chosen as target genes regarding their possible relations with the implantation process. Endometrial gene expression levels showed differences in RIF samples compared to fertile samples. The significant downregulation was observed for CXCL1 (p=0.005) and C4BPA (p=0.03) genes. There was no statistically significant difference between the RIF groups and the fertile group in the expression of 8 genes: CXCL8, HPRT1, MMP10, INFG, VEGFB, HAND2, IL15 and TNC (p&amp;gt;0.05). The use of a combination of two markers (C4BPA + CXCL1) allows for good discrimination of RIF patients from fertile women (AUC 0.806).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e55d1a4711aaa6f7f5d939242a30d95cf2ba2c979df0dcbe62abd1617fc9f7f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
