We aimed to investigate purchase patterns in households with at least one member with overweight in childhood by describing expenditure on different food groups.</p> Methods <p>This Danish register-based cohort study included households where at least one member donated receipts concerning consumers purchases in 2019–2021 and at least one member had their Body mass index (BMI) measured in childhood within ten years prior to first purchase. A probability index model was used to evaluate differences in proportion expenditure spent on specific food groups.</p> Results <p>We identified 737 households that included a member who had a BMI measurement in childhood, 220 with overweight and 517 with underweight or normal weight (reference households). Adjusting for education, income, family type, and urbanization, households with a member who had a BMI classified as overweight in childhood had statistically significant higher probability of spending a larger proportion of expenditure on ready meals 56.29% (95% CI: 51.70;60.78) and sugary drinks 55.98% (95% CI: 51.63;60.23). Conversely, they had a statistically significant lower probability of spending a larger proportion expenditure on vegetables 38.44% (95% CI: 34.09;42.99), compared to the reference households.</p> Conclusion <p>Households with a member with BMI classified as overweight in childhood spent more on unhealthy foods and less on vegetables, compared to the reference households. This study highlights the need for household/family-oriented nutrition education and intervention.</p>","author":"Kathrine Kold Sørensen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"80501425d40fd7f0e858940748c546c64e8aa6f9ec044ee6de1c9cbc32935baf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
