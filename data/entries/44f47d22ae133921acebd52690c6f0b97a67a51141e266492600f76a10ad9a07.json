{"title":"Metabolic Consequences of Thyroidectomy and Patient-Centered Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1134/v1","date":1723696225000,"content":"Thyroidectomy has been post-operatively managed by hormone replacement therapy in order to satisfy the reference ranges of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) levels. While medication and standardized reference ranges have proven to be effective, many patients continue to report unintentional weight gain despite adequate amounts of treatment and levels of TSH and T4. Physicians, over the years, have become complacent to these “normal” ranges, and have ignored the metabolic consequences that are affecting thyroidectomy patients. This paper aims to redefine the approach to post-thyroidectomy clinical care by: challenging the current standardized hormonal range values, exploring the gaps in thyroid hormone conversion, investigating the metabolic pathways of T3, considering the influence of inflammatory markers, and proposing the future for patient-centered management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44f47d22ae133921acebd52690c6f0b97a67a51141e266492600f76a10ad9a07","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
