Manipulating the AFE phase, however, presents a challenge due to the complex relationship between chemical and structural environments in these otherwise highly ordered materials. To better understand these factors, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has proven to be invaluable, offering a local probe of polar displacements and chemistry in a wide variety of AFE/FE materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.572-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.572-B3\">3</a>]. Despite this, characterization of extremely nanoscale phenomena or subtle structural perturbations is often limited by projection of the three-dimensional (3D) sample in STEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.572-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.572-B5\">5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f623731c57127d33d236abd0d1afb35613e735e15b7e8a20dd1ace931fe55898","category":"Environment"}
