{"title":"Resilience Benchmarking: How Small Hotels Can Ensure Their Survival and Growth During Global Disruptions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1724/v1","date":1716797143000,"content":"The study is aimed at developing a resilient benchmarking system for small hotels in Ukraine, designed to ensure their survival and growth amid global disruptions and local crises. Given the severe challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and military actions, the resilience of the regional tourism business becomes particularly relevant. The methods used in the study, including factor and cluster analysis, the method of taxonomy, and dendrograms, have enabled the development of development programs for two clusters of hotels: those located in areas with increased military risk and those in relatively safe territories. The taxonomic analysis revealed significant differences in managerial practices and operational efficiency, largely determined by the geographic location of the hotels. Hotels in active combat zones experience a 40% reduction in tourist flow and financial instability, while hotels in safe areas demonstrate a 30% higher level of customer satisfaction. The application of advanced security systems and modern marketing techniques has led to a 40% reduction in incidents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"20a330a77ff8d8e5084fa63cf43832dbfcd428290d7cae66b282363c51481a09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
