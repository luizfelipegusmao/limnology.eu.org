For ECCI a crystalline sample is observed with the backscattered electron signal. The basic principle of contrast formation is that electrons channel into a crystal lattice when the incident beam hits the lattice along the Bragg angle of a set of crystal planes. In this case very few electrons are backscattered and the observed crystal appears dark. Under this condition, every defect that disturbs the order of the lattice planes leads to backscattering and are visible in the ECC image as bright features in a dark grain. Dislocations, for example, appear as bright lines, stacking faults as bright areas.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1eaf4576a377050c925bbd034dfc86e47703d0066f0f49d633bf11bf195f634f","category":"Environment"}
