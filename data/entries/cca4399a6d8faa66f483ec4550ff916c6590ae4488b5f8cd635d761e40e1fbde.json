{"title":"Sodium‐Glucose Co‐Transporter‐2 Inhibitor Empagliflozin Attenuates Sorafenib‐Induced Myocardial Inflammation and Toxicity","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24362?af=R","date":1718619025000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Environmental antineoplastics such as sorafenib may pose a risk to humans through water recycling, and the increased risk of cardiotoxicity is a clinical issue in sorafenib users. Thus, developing strategies to prevent sorafenib cardiotoxicity is an urgent work. Empagliflozin, as a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor for type 2 diabetes control, has been approved for heart failure therapy. Still, its cardioprotective effect in the experimental model of sorafenib cardiotoxicity has not yet been reported. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), immunoblot, and immunohistochemical analyses were applied to study the effect of sorafenib exposure on cardiac SGLT2 expression. The impact of empagliflozin on cell viability was investigated in the sorafenib-treated cardiomyocytes using Alamar blue assay. Immunoblot analysis was employed to delineate the effect of sorafenib and empagliflozin on ferroptosis/proinflammatory signaling in cardiomyocytes. Ferroptosis/DNA damage/fibrosis/inflammation of myocardial tissues was studied in mice with a 28-day sorafenib ± empagliflozin treatment using histological analyses. Sorafenib exposure significantly promoted SGLT2 upregulation in cardiomyocytes and mouse hearts. Empagliflozin treatment significantly attenuated the sorafenib-induced cytotoxicity/DNA damage/fibrosis in cardiomyocytes and mouse hearts. Moreover, GPX4/xCT-dependent ferroptosis as an inducer for releasing high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was also blocked by empagliflozin administration in the sorafenib-treated cardiomyocytes and myocardial tissues. Furthermore, empagliflozin treatment significantly inhibited the sorafenib-promoted NFκB/HMGB1 axis in cardiomyocytes and myocardial tissues, and sorafenib-stimulated proinflammatory signaling (TNF-α/IL-1β/IL-6) was repressed by empagliflozin administration. Finally, empagliflozin treatment significantly attenuated the sorafenib-promoted macrophage recruitments in mouse hearts. In conclusion, empagliflozin may act as a cardioprotective agent for humans under sorafenib exposure by modulating ferroptosis/DNA damage/fibrosis/inflammation. However, further clinical evidence is required to support this preclinical finding.</p>","author":"Ching‐Han Liu, \nYu‐Cheng Ho, \nWen‐Chin Lee, \nCheng‐Yi Huang, \nYung‐Kuo Lee, \nChung‐Bao Hsieh, \nNan‐Chieh Huang, \nCheng‐Chun Wu, \nNgoc Uyen Nhi Nguyen, \nChing‐Cheng Hsu, \nChiu‐Hua Chen, \nYao‐Chang Chen, \nWei‐Chun Huang, \nYen‐Yu Lu, \nCheng‐Chieh Fang, \nYi‐Chen Chang, \nChen‐Lin Chang, \nMing‐Kai Tsai, \nZhi‐Hong Wen, \nChiao‐Zhu Li, \nChiao‐Ching Li, \nPo‐Kai Chuang, \nShih‐Ming Yang, \nTian‐Huei Chu, \nShih‐Chung Huang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"cca4399a6d8faa66f483ec4550ff916c6590ae4488b5f8cd635d761e40e1fbde","category":"Environment"}
