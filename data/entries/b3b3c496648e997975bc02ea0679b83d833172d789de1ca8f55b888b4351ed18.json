{"title":"Zeolite–resin magnetic nanocomposite as an efficient adsorbent for separation of vanadium from industrial Bayer liquor","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13762-024-05551-6","date":1719792000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The recovery of vanadium by zeolite–resin magnetic nanocomposites from industrial Bayer liquor was studied in this paper. The magnetic nanocomposite was fabricated by synthesizing Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles and adding zeolite and amberlite IRA-400. Different techniques such as X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy are used to characterize the nanocomposite. Adsorption of 86% of vanadium was achieved after optimizing the parameters. The experimental result illustrated the adsorption of vanadium on magnetite–zeolite–resin nanocomposite following the pseudo-second-order model which indicates chemical reaction between the vanadium anions and the adsorbent or a combination with diffusion controls the process. Calculated thermodynamic parameters indicated that the vanadium adsorption process occurred spontaneously with an increase in enthalpy and entropy. In addition, equilibrium data are well fitted with Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich, and Temkin isotherm models. High adsorption capacity was obtained in 13.05 using the Langmuir model, which is very close to the value obtained from the Dubinin-Radushkevich model. This model is appropriate for porous materials. Furthermore, the constants derived from the Freundlich model demonstrate the tendency of vanadium to adsorb to the nanocomposite. As stated in the result, the adsorption capacity of the magnetic nanocomposite is not affected by the presence of competing ions. The presence of magnetite in the porous structure of zeolite can change the adsorption mechanism from physical to chemical adsorption by forming a binuclear-bridged complex. The performance efficiency of the nanocomposite increases due to the anion exchange capacity of the resin and this feature.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"b3b3c496648e997975bc02ea0679b83d833172d789de1ca8f55b888b4351ed18","category":"Environment"}
