{"title":"Sulfides, Sulfosalts and Sulfates in the Epithermal Au-Ag-Te Emmy Deposit (Khabarovsk Territory), Far East, Russia: Implications for the Mineralization Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1245/v1","date":1723805024000,"content":"This study considers the features of the chemical composition, internal structure, and oscillatory zoning of sulfides, sulfosalts and sulfates in the epithermal high-intermediate sulfidation type Au-Ag-Te Emmy deposit (Khabarovsk Territory), Russia. In this deposit the most widespread sulfide is pyrite occurring in two generations: pre-ore pure pyrite (I) with cubic crystal habit and dimensions from 20 Î¼m to 0.5 mm from the early barren pre-ore hydrothermal stage, and pyrite (II) of the ore stage, which is represented by (a) colloform aggregates (IIa) formed as a result of rapid precipitation from the solution, and (b) crystalline pyrite (IIb), which is precipitated due to continuous decrease in temperature. Both pyrite (II) morphological varieties contain copper (0.06-6.03 wt.%). The crystalline variety of pyrite is associated with goldfieldite, hemusite and kawazulite which were deposited during the early mineralizing event in the deposit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a7eac53b5f21fa1a61e8b3bd25a49b770030240207c862c6b38f4853a69e6c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
