{"title":"The Designs and Testing of Biodegradable Inserts for Enhanced Crashworthiness in Sports Helmets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1139/v1","date":1723711606000,"content":"The article addresses manufacturing structures made of biodegradable materials that can be successfully used as energy-absorbing liner of sports helmets of all kinds, replacing the previously used expanded polystyrene. The paper is focused on injection technological tests and tensile tests (in quasi-static and dynamic conditions) of several composites based on a PLA matrix with the addition of other biodegradable softening agents, such as PBAT and TPS. Next, the thin-walled elements (dimensions of 55 x 55 x 20 mm) were manufactured and evaluated using a spring-loaded drop hammer. The 60J impact energy was tested according to EN 1078 standard. The dynamic crushing testing included checking the influence of the materials temperature (-20, 0, 20, and 40 Â°C) and the impact velocity. The PLA15PBAT85 blend was selected as the most effective material in terms of its use as energy-absorbing liner for sport helmets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58c93808d212f18239830a1c058704b548c85a1498d829204b937901254462a3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
