{"title":"Optimal Control of Nonlinear, Nonautonomous, Energy Harvesting Systems Applied to Point Absorber Wave Energy Converters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1298/v1","date":1729088444000,"content":"Pursuing sustainable energy solutions has prompted researchers to focus on optimizing energy extraction from renewable sources. Control laws that optimize energy extraction require accurate modeling, often resulting in time-varying, nonlinear differential equations. An energy-maximizing optimal control law is derived for time-varying, nonlinear, second-order, energy harvesting systems. We demonstrate that sustaining periodic motion under this control law when subjected to periodic disturbances necessitates identifying appropriate initial conditions, inducing the system to follow a limit cycle. The general optimal solution is applied to two point absorber wave energy converter models: a linear model where the analytical derivation of initial conditions suffices and a nonlinear model demanding a numerical approach. A stable limit cycle is obtained for the latter when the initial conditions lie within an ellipse centered at the origin of the phase plane. This work advances energy-maximizing optimal control solutions for nonautonomous nonlinear systems with application to point absorbers. The results also shed light on the significance of initial conditions in achieving physically realizable periodic motion for periodic energy harvesting systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c08c8c2abc0dd0b54953f910a68cd329cbed695f8627ae2b4aca4aecbc1d7b58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
