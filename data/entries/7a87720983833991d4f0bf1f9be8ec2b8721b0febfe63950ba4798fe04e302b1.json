{"title":"The genomic route to tomato breeding: Past, present, and future","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2500/7660489?rss=1","date":1714435200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Over the past 10,000 years, tomato species have undergone both unintentional and intentional selection to enhance their favorable traits for human consumption and manufacturing. These selection processes have significantly influenced the genomes of tomato species and have played a critical role in improving tomato varieties. In this review, we summarize recent advances in tomato genome sequencing, explore the impact of human-driven selection, and recapitulate key genes associated with important agronomic traits in tomato breeding. We provide several examples of genomics-guided tomato breeding to highlight the potential of genome resources in facilitating tomato improvement. Furthermore, we elaborate the progress and strategies of tomato breeding through genome design and present how such efforts can help future enhancements of tomato to align with the demands of sustainability and evolving human societies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"7a87720983833991d4f0bf1f9be8ec2b8721b0febfe63950ba4798fe04e302b1","category":"Environment"}
