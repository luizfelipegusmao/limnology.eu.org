{"title":"Standardizing Laser Speckle Orthogonal Contrast Imaging: Achieving Reproducible Measurements Across Instruments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2004/v1","date":1717059395000,"content":"Using two independent speckle imaging systems based on the recently published LSOCI method operating in contact mode on the skin, we assess the reproducibility of in vivo measurements and conduct an inter-instrument comparison. To this aim, we propose a calibration method to handle each imaging system as a comprehensive unit, which includes the laser source, optics, and camera. Our experimental results demonstrate that the microcirculation images produced by both instruments exhibit high accuracy and stability, with microcirculation activity values in excellent agreement, thereby paving the way for clinical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c2d1fa2c11ef10839b2cfb4f4cda299b853bb36f81e3f0a63b3b48b508290f1d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
