{"title":"High-Precision Roundness Measuring System for Tungsten Ball Tips with Sub-100-&micro;m Diameter","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2255/v1","date":1722231909000,"content":"Tungsten balls with sub-100-μm diameter can function as probe tips for micro-coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) to measure ultraprecise workpieces such as ceramic bearings with a high aspect ratio. A high-precision measuring system was proposed to evaluate the roundness error of the self-made tungsten ball tips. The principles and mathematical models of the measuring system are illustrated, and the fabrication principle of tungsten balls is introduced. An analysis was conducted on the maximum allowable contact force and bending strength of the tungsten ball tips, and the elastic mechanism was designed based on the analysis. A ruby probe with a sphericity error of 130 nm (A-5003-0577, Renishaw Corporation) used as a reference sphere was measured to verify the system's effectiveness. Repeated measurement experiments were performed for two tungsten ball tips. The results show the roundness error of the tungsten ball-A is between 568.3 and 586.2 nm with a standard deviation of 6.6 nm while the tungsten ball-B’s roundness error is between 898.5 and 958.0 nm with a standard deviation of 19.7 nm. The uncertainty is calculated as 125.8 nm. The developed system can stably measure the roundness of the tungsten ball tips.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca115061e51305cb34a680355dc98fed9cbb7fe0aba508f1813ea08cddc27823","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
