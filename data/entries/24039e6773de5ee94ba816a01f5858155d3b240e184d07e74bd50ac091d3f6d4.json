The impact positions and sequence of field-evaporated atoms are then recorded by a two-dimensional detector. Together with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer to reveal the chemical identities of the atoms, APT can uniquely resolve both positions and chemical identities of atoms within a bulk material and be used to generate three dimensional reconstructions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"24039e6773de5ee94ba816a01f5858155d3b240e184d07e74bd50ac091d3f6d4","category":"Environment"}
