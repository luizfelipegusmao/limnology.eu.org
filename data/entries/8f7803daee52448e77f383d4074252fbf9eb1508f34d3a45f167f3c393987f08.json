{"title":"Microstructural and Optical Effects of Zn-Doped Magnesium Oxide Nanoparticles Obtained by the Precipitation Method","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.288/7720397?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The investigation of the morphological characteristics in combination with the optical properties of magnesium oxide nanoparticles (MgO-NP) has been proposed as a potential application in antibacterial activity. It is well known that MgO-NPs exhibit a bandgap value of 7.77 eV [<a href=\"#ozae044.288-B1\">1</a>]. Previous studies have shown that Zn-doped MgO (Zn<sup>2+</sup>-MgO) reduces the value of the bandgap, which widens the absorption range in the visible, increasing the antibacterial activity [<a href=\"#ozae044.288-B2\">2</a>]. In particular, the Mg<sub>0.95</sub>Zn<sub>0.05</sub>O stoichiometry leads to a reduction of the band gap to 5.33 eV [<a href=\"#ozae044.288-B3\">3</a>]. These authors report an average size of the nanoparticles of 85 nm obtained with thermal treatment at 800 <sup>o</sup>C. Despite the progress described by previous reports [<a href=\"#ozae044.288-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.288-B4\">4</a>], important questions about the morphological effects, such as size, shape, distribution, and agglomeration of nanoparticles should be investigated further. The motivation of this work is to show the microstructural and optical effects of Zn<sup>+2</sup>-MgO on the nanometric scale (Zn<sub>0.1425</sub><sup>+2</sup>-Mg<sub>0.8575</sub>O).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8f7803daee52448e77f383d4074252fbf9eb1508f34d3a45f167f3c393987f08","category":"Environment"}
