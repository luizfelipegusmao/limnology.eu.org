{"title":"Formulation and Evaluation of Turmeric and Neem Based Topical Nanoemulgel against Microbial Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0115/v1","date":1725292947000,"content":"The combination of nanoemulgel and phytochemistry has resulted in several recent discoveries in the field of the topical delivery systems. The present study aimed to prepare turmeric (Curcuma longa) and neem (Azadirachta indica) based nanoemulgel against microbial infection as topical drug delivery. Olive oil (oil phase), Tween 80 (surfactant), and PEG600 (co-surfactant) were used for the preparation of nanoemulsion. Carbopol 934 was used as gelling agent to convert the nanoemulsion to nanoemulgel and promote to control the release of biological properties of turmeric and neem. The nanoemulsion were characterized based on particle size distribution, PDI values and compatibility using FTIR analysis. In contrast, the nanoemulgel was evaluated based on pH, viscosity, spreadability, plant extract and excipients compatibility or physical state, in-vitro study, ex-vivo mucoadhesive study, antimicrobial properties and stability. The resulting nanoemulsion was homogeneous, stable during the centrifugation process, with the smallest droplets and low PDI values. FTIR analysis also confirmed good compatibility and absence of phase separation between the oil substance, surfactant, co-surfactant with both plant extracts. The improved nanoemulgel also demonstrated a smooth texture, good consistency, pH, desired viscosity, ex-vivo mucoadhesive strength with highest spreadability, and an 18-hour in-vitro drug release study. Additionally, it exhibited better antimicrobial properties against different microbial strain. Stability studies also revealed that the product had good rheological properties and physicochemical state for a period of over 3 months. The present study has affirmed that turmeric and neem based nanoemulgel as a promising alternative for microbial infection particularly associated by microorganisms via topical application.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7670ae1fff70f8ecc4c9e2a3142e8db42e01b53635b4ac37e098229aaf9d8ac1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
