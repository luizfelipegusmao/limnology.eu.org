{"title":"Playing the field: The molecular basis of fruit morphology-based bet-hedging","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/7/2451/7646004?rss=1","date":1713139200000,"content":"<span>Extreme weather fluctuations, as well as broader changes in climate, can severely endanger the survival of germinating seedlings. To prevent the total loss of offspring in such scenarios, some plant species hedge their bets by creating multiple types of seed, each with distinct germination behaviors. Some of these seeds will germinate with the first occurrence of favorable conditions—for example, the first rainfall or the beginning of spring. Other seeds remain dormant, forming soil-based seed banks that will gradually germinate over subsequent seasons or years. While such strategies diminish the number of offspring in an ideal environment, they ensure the survival of the population through extreme conditions. This “bet-hedging” can extend to the morphology of the diaspore, which is the seed (or spore) plus tissues, such as the fruit pericarp, that aid seed dispersal. Diaspore polymorphism has independently evolved several times and can confer ecophysiological advantages in unpredictable environments and climates. Crop domestication, on the other hand, actively selected against stochastic seed dormancy—especially as related to diaspore polymorphisms—to increase predictability and yield in controlled environments (<a href=\"#koae119-B6\">Nave et al. 2016</a>). This left us with no economically important crop or model species to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind these phenomena.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"63ebf1abc3d44c8b5b4678f6997f13f8a23eed02fcd387dd9af546efde68d464","category":"Environment"}
