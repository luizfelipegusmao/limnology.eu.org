{"title":"Research of Large Inflow Angles BEMT-Based Analytical-Numerical Performance Evaluation Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0202/v1","date":1717564596000,"content":"This paper presents a comprehensive analytical-numerical algorithm constructed for proprotor performance evaluation, focusing on accommodating large inflow angles. The algorithmâ€™s design, range, and analytical features are clarified, indicating its potential to improve performance analysis, particularly for blades with substantial pitch variations. The Stahlhut model has not been validated against the conventional BEMT small-inflow angle methodology. This paper implements a modified Stahlhut model, coupled with the conventional BEMT theory. Preliminary validations of the model demonstrate promising results, with deviations reduced to -3% to 4% compared to conventional BEMT methods exhibiting deviations as high as 20% to 88% against experimental data for a highly twisted proprotor. The reconsideration of the computational module carries considerable implications for the design and refinement of proprotors, providing alternative analysis methods that could improve operational effectiveness across a range of flight scenarios. Drawing upon the theoretical framework presented by Stahlhut, the algorithm enables a more complex understanding of proprotor dynamics, facilitating accurate predictions of the loads at each blade section. The introduced algorithm emerges as a valuable asset for evaluating proprotor performance during the early stages of design and certification, offering both low computational cost and medium to high reliability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56b707efbc6c61f98d46014a53a83ddf9ec62e8f610c869b3f1c64e40601fa4f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
