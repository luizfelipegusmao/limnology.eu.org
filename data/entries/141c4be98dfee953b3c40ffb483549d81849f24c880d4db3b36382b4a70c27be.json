We show that an up-down-zero spin configuration in a triangle cluster leads to linear and nonlinear spin conductivities even without the relativistic spin–orbit coupling; the linear spin conductivity is characterized by the Drude-type one, while the nonlinear spin conductivity is characterized by the Hall-type one. We demonstrate the emergence of both spin conductivities in the breathing kagome system consisting of a triangle cluster. The nonlinear spin conductivity becomes larger than the linear one when the Fermi level lies near the region where a small partial band gap opens. Our results indicate that collinear antiferromagnets with the triangle geometry give rise to rich spin conductive phenomena.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"141c4be98dfee953b3c40ffb483549d81849f24c880d4db3b36382b4a70c27be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
