{"title":"Assembly Theory of Binary Messages (How to Assemble a Black Hole and Use it to Assemble New Binary Information?)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.1113/v7","date":1712460852000,"content":"Using assembly theory, we investigate the assembly pathways of binary strings of length N formed by joining the individual bits present in the assembly pool and the strings that entered the pool as a result of previous joining operations. We show that the string assembly index is bounded from below by the shortest addition chain for N, and we conjecture about the form of the upper bound. We define the degree of causation for the minimum assembly index and show that it features patterns that can be used to determine the shortest addition chain for certain N. We show that a string with the smallest assembly index can be assembled by an elegant trivial program of length equal to this index if the length of the string is expressible as a product of Fibonacci numbers. We conjecture that there is no binary program that has a length shorter than the length of the string having the largest assembly index that could assemble this string. We conjecture that a black hole surface is defined by a balanced distinct string that satisfies the upper bound of a distinct string assembly index. The results confirm that four Planck areas provide a minimum information capacity that provides a minimum thermodynamic (Bekenstein-Hawking) entropy. Knowing that the problem of determining the assembly index is at least NP-complete, we conjecture that the problem of determining the assembly index of a given binary string is NP-complete, while the problem of creating the string so that it would have a predetermined maximum assembly index is NP-hard. Therefore, once the new information is assembled by a dissipative structure or by a human, increasing the information entropy according to the second law of infodynamics, it is subject to the second law of thermodynamics, and nature seeks to optimize its assembly pathway.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"278d81a56ddb699db88e151214f14200bdf15ea05f94fe13c1058fb8b9601e54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
