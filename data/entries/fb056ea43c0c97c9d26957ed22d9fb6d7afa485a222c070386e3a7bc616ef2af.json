{"title":"Association between <i>BCL11B</i> gene polymorphisms and age-related hearing loss in the elderly: A case-control study in Qingdao, China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304770","date":1717423200000,"content":"<p>by Xin Li, Jingkai Zhang, Hua Zhang, Jifeng Ren, Hainan Cao, Yaoyao Xu, Dongfeng Zhang, Haiping Duan</p>\r\n\r\nAge-related hearing loss is a complex disease caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and a study have conducted animal experiments to explore the association between <i>BCL11B</i> heterozygosity and age-related hearing loss. The present study used established genetic models to examine the association between <i>BCL11B</i> gene polymorphisms and age-related hearing loss. A total of 410 older adults from two communities in Qingdao, China, participated in this study. The case group comprised individuals aged ≥ 60 years with age-related hearing loss, and the control group comprised individuals without age-related hearing loss from the same communities. The groups were matched 1:1 for age and sex. The individual characteristics of the participants were analyzed descriptively using the Mann–Whitney U test and the chi-square test. To explore the association between <i>BCL11B</i> gene polymorphisms and age-related hearing loss, conditional logistic regression was performed to construct genetic models for two single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) of <i>BCL11B</i>, and haplotype analysis was conducted to construct their haplotype domains. Two SNP sites of the <i>BCL11B</i> gene, four genetic models of rs1152781 (additive, dominant, recessive, and codominant), and five genetic models of rs1152783 (additive, dominant, recessive, codominant, and over dominant) were significantly associated with age-related hearing loss in the models both unadjusted and adjusted for all covariates (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, a linkage disequilibrium between rs1152781 and rs1152783 was revealed through haplotype analysis. Our study revealed that <i>BCL11B</i> gene polymorphisms were significantly associated with age-related hearing loss.","author":"Xin Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fb056ea43c0c97c9d26957ed22d9fb6d7afa485a222c070386e3a7bc616ef2af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
