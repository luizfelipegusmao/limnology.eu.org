{"title":"Open the Window to Lithium Detection and Nanostructure Analysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mt/article/32/3/10/7687038?rss=1","date":1717459200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The features and benefits of a new cutting-edge windowless energy-dispersive detector (EDS) detector are introduced. This innovative technology provides fast results at high signal-to-noise with ultra-high analytical spatial resolution. The benefits are demonstrated through examples of nanostructures from various nanoscale devices including lithium metal anode specimens. Using windowless EDS detector technology allows for the efficient collection of EDS data under the same conditions used for high-resolution imaging (low accelerating voltage, low probe current, and short working distance). Examples include cross sections of lithium metal anode materials prepared with a broad argon ion beam and using an air-isolated workflow. The analyses of the cycled and pristine lithium-ion battery (LIB) materials are shown, along with the contrast results of crystal-shaped impurities found within these materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"a90a7927bbfe67b21052d597a0c1cc66b275312b16c9974a11c0ea2aba58abea","category":"Environment"}
