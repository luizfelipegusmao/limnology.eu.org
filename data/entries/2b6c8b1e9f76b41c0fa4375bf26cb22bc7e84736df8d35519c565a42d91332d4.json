Deformation by stacking faults, microtwins, and complex dislocation reactions are responsible for strain accumulation and as such it is of importance to be able to assess the exact deformation substructure. Defect analysis has typically been accomplished by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques [<a href=\"#ozae044.268-B2\">2-4</a>]. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is an attractive option to perform this work due to lower cost and relatively high resolution. Limitations in the SEM arise from trying to orient to a specific diffraction condition by correlation using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) at a high tilt angle. Recent advances in detector technology have utilized a Timepix-based detector to collect EBSD in a tilt-free geometry termed reflected Kikuchi diffraction (RKD) [<a href=\"#ozae044.268-B5\">5</a>]. This allows for controlled diffraction conditions in a flat geometry enabling usage of additional detectors to correlatively image samples via diffraction contrast in transmission SEM or in backscatter electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2b6c8b1e9f76b41c0fa4375bf26cb22bc7e84736df8d35519c565a42d91332d4","category":"Environment"}
