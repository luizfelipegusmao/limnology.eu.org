Edentulism was assessed in 2006 while nutritional intake was assessed in 2013. Multimorbidity was indicated by 5 self-reported chronic conditions: diabetes, heart conditions, lung diseases, cancer, and stroke. Individuals with two or more conditions at baseline were excluded from the analysis. Nutritional intake was calculated by summing 10 nutrients (Protein, Vitamins C, D, B12, E, Calcium, Zinc, Polyunsaturated fatty acids, Folate, and ÃŸ- carotene). Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to examine the nutritional pathway between edentulism (2006) and the increase in multimorbidity from 2006- 2018.\nResults:\nIndividuals included in the analysis were 3,463. The incidence of multimorbidity between 2006 and 2018 was 24.07%. while the percentage of edentate participants in 2006 was 16.42%. The mean of total nutrition in 2013 was 4.50 (4.43, 4.55). SEM analysis showed that edentulism was negatively associated with nutritional intake {estimate -0.15(95% CI: -0.30, - 0.01)}. A negative association was found between total nutrition and multimorbidity {estimate -0.008 (95%CI: -0.01, -0.002)}. Age, wealth and smoking were included in the analysis, and had statistically significant associations with multimorbidity.\nConclusion:\nThe analysis demonstrated a longitudinal association between edentulism, nutritional intake, and the progress of multimorbidity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68c049fe87a861d41c7faad935570c7fc33f9b04d28c6618ee71609b19eae4de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
