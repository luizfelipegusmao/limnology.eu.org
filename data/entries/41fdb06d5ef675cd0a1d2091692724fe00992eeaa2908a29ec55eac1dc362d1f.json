To monitor and evaluate the changes in the vegetation cover in the study area both before the project began in 2021 and after its operations commenced, the indices and indicators of NDVI, EVI, SAVI, NDMI, and moisture stress were utilized. The five indices illustrated the project’s favorable impact on the location. The study demonstrates that despite the varying normality of moisture indicators, the vegetation indices show greater normalcy, highlighting the region’s sustained improvement in plant cover over time.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"41fdb06d5ef675cd0a1d2091692724fe00992eeaa2908a29ec55eac1dc362d1f","category":"Environment"}
