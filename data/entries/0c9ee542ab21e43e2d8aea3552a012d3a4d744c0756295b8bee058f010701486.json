{"title":"Alternative Slope-Deflection Equations for Static Analysis of Indeterminate Structures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1317/v1","date":1726565778000,"content":"This paper provides an alternative Slope-Deflection equation for performing the static analysis of the indeterminate structures. While the conventional Slope-Deflection method introduced in undergraduate structural analysis course involves the use of fixed end moments in the Slope-Deflection equations, the proposed method employs the slope of a simply supported beam to obtain the unknown moments at the joints. Three numerical examples of continuous beams with different load configurations are chosen and the efficacy of the proposed equations is demonstrated. From the perspective of undergraduate structural analysis course in Civil Engineering education, the approach proposed in this paper offers two advantages: (1) prior knowledge of fixed beams is not required and (2) the concepts gained from determinate structural analysis are directly applicable.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c9ee542ab21e43e2d8aea3552a012d3a4d744c0756295b8bee058f010701486","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
