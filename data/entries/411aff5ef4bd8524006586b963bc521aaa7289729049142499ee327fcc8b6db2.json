{"title":"Carbon-based in-situ Ti-TiC Metal Matrix Composite manufactured by Laser Powder Bed Fusion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0485/v1","date":1723006957000,"content":"This study outlines a 3-step production process for Ti-TiC Metal Matrix Composite (MMC) employing powder Mechanical Blending, Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), and a heat treatment. A TiC fraction of more than 20 vol% was formed in-situ through the reaction of titanium with carbon during the LPBF process. The manufactured MMC pieces showed a record stiffness and fracture strain combination. The LPBF energy density impacted strongly porosity type. The as-built microstructure displayed an homogeneous distribution of sub-stoichiometric TiC dendrites which were fully converted into equiaxed TiC grains during the heat treatment. The TiC C/Ti ratio was found to be close to 0.5, resulting in an effective reinforcement content nearly twice the one expected for stoichiometric TiC, leading to stronger reinforcement. The mechanical analysis revealed a Youngâ€™s modulus of up to 149 GPa and an ultimate tensile strength of up to 770 MPa, indicating a 27% and 34% improvement, respectively, compared to commercially pure Titanium produced by LPBF and heat treated in the same conditions. A fracture strain of up to 2.8% was achieved. The combination of in-situ formation of defect-free TiC reinforcement and subsequent heat treatment enables to reach an exceptional ductility, considering the 20 vol% reinforcement content.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"411aff5ef4bd8524006586b963bc521aaa7289729049142499ee327fcc8b6db2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
