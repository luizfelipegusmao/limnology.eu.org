Typical methods for minimizing electron dose include, for example, reducing the dwell time and lowering the beam current [<a href=\"#ozae044.1025-B1\">1</a>]. With the use of a bayesian dictionary learning algorithm based on Beta Process Factor Analysis (BPFA), dose can be further reduced by sampling a portion of the available pixels [<a href=\"#ozae044.1025-B2\">2</a>]. This will subject less of the specimen to degradation through the electron beam, while still being able to view a full image of the sample with live reconstruction [<a href=\"#ozae044.1025-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c9c9c1d2e2510819d47ad31724cbdd59dc3cfe669e2daa6dd71c8e01bb2bb49a","category":"Environment"}
