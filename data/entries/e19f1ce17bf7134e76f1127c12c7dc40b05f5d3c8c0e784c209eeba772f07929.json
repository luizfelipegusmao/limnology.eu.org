{"title":"A novel defensin‐like peptide C‐13326 possesses protective effect against multidrug‐resistant Aeromonas schubertii in hybrid snakehead (Channa maculate ♀ × Channa argus ♂)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13922?af=R","date":1709960884000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a defensin-like antimicrobial peptide (C-13326 peptide) identified in <i>Hermetia illucens</i> could possess protective effect against multidrug-resistant <i>Aeromonas schubertii</i> in hybrid snakehead (<i>Channa maculate</i> ♀ <i>× Channa argus</i> ♂). The cDNA of C-13326 peptide comprised 243 nucleotides encoding 80 amino acids, with six conserved cysteine residues and the classical CSαβ structure. The recombinant expression plasmid pPIC9K-C-13326 was constructed and transformed into GS115 <i>Pichia pastoris</i>, and the C-13326 peptide was expressed by induction with 1% methanol. The crude extract of C-13326 peptide was precipitated by ammonium sulfate, assayed by Braford method, detected by tricine-SDS-PAGE, evaluated by BandScan software and identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The C-13326 peptide was shown to have inhibitory activity against the growth of multidrug-resistant <i>A. schubertii</i> DM210910 by using the minimum growth inhibitory concentration and Oxford cup method. In addition, scanning electron microscopy analysis suggested that C-13326 peptide inhibited the growth of <i>A. schubertii</i> DM210910 by damaging the bacterial cell membrane. To explore the role of peptide C-13326 in vivo, hybrid snakehead was fed with peptide C-13326 as feed additives for 7 days. The results revealed that C-13326 peptide could significantly down-regulate the expression levels of <i>IL-1β</i>, <i>IL-8</i>, <i>IL-12</i> and <i>TNF-α</i> (<i>p</i> &lt; .05), and significantly improved the survival rate of hybrid snakehead after challenging with <i>A. schubertii</i> DM210910. Therefore, the C-13326 peptide is a promising antimicrobial agent for <i>A. schubertii</i> treatment in aquaculture.</p>","author":"Huanrong He, \nXinzhi Huang, \nCaiyi Wen, \nChun Liu, \nBiao Jiang, \nYanhua Huang, \nYoulu Su, \nWei Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"e19f1ce17bf7134e76f1127c12c7dc40b05f5d3c8c0e784c209eeba772f07929","category":"Environment"}
