In two dimensions, GPA is routinely used to retrieve these quantities when atomic structure is resolved using high-resolution TEM or STEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.892-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.892-B2\">2</a>]. GPA can also be extended to three dimensions (as illustrated in Fig. 1), to provide strain and defect analysis of nanomaterials. Choosing three linearly independent reciprocal lattice vectors (Bragg peaks) in k-space implicitly defines a 3D lattice in real space which serves as a reference for all atomic displacements [<a href=\"#ozae044.892-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2c7976bf6681d17a8538c447d92763c463ce5ddc69ce57ea49e1f160a550c306","category":"Environment"}
