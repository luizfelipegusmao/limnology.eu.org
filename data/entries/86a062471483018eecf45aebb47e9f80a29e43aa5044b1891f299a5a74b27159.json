{"title":"Near-Infrared Phosphorescence of the Raman Photogenerated Singlet Oxygen","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0405/v1","date":1717671595000,"content":"We report on the phosphorescence of singlet oxygen photogenerated through a stimulated Raman process. Nanosecond radiation in the green spectral region focused on hexane induces a Raman transition of the dissolved in the solvent oxygen molecules toward the singlet oxygen state producing a Stokes signal in the near infrared. The excited oxygen relaxes to ground emitting an infrared photon at 1269 nm. While the Stokes signal’s wavelength changes with the pumping light’s wavelength, the wavelength of the phosphorescent photon remains unaltered. The result confirms previously reports on stimulated Raman excitation of singlet oxygen.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"86a062471483018eecf45aebb47e9f80a29e43aa5044b1891f299a5a74b27159","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
