{"title":"Rapid Propagation of Ca2+ Waves and Electrical Signals in the Liverwort Marchantia polymorpha","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/4/660/7513496?rss=1","date":1704758400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In response to both biotic and abiotic stresses, vascular plants transmit long-distance Ca<sup>2+</sup> and electrical signals from localized stress sites to distant tissues through their vasculature. Various models have been proposed for the mechanisms underlying the long-distance signaling, primarily centered around the presence of vascular bundles. We here demonstrate that the non-vascular liverwort <span>Marchantia polymorpha</span> possesses a mechanism for propagating Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves and electrical signals in response to wounding. The propagation velocity of these signals was approximately 1–2 mm s<sup>-1</sup>, equivalent to that observed in vascular plants. Both Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves and electrical signals were inhibited by La<sup>3+</sup> as well as tetraethylammonium chloride, suggesting the crucial importance of both Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel(s) and K<sup>+</sup> channel(s) in wound-induced membrane depolarization as well as the subsequent long-distance signal propagation. Simultaneous recordings of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and electrical signals indicated a tight coupling between the dynamics of these two signaling modalities. Furthermore, molecular genetic studies revealed that a GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) channel plays a central role in the propagation of both Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves and electrical signals. Conversely, none of the three two-pore channels were implicated in either signal propagation. These findings shed light on the evolutionary conservation of rapid long-distance Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave and electrical signal propagation involving GLRs in land plants, even in the absence of vascular tissue.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"2a9fc32f51b4ae9b85d00c70549410cf966b407db654edfbc7f77963e1e71725","category":"Environment"}
