Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been confirmed to be related to the occurrence of lung cancer, and circ_0008133 has been found to be possibly related to lung cancer.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>Expression of circ_0008133, miR-760, and mex-3 RNA binding family member A (MEX3A) messenger RNA (mRNA) was detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell viability, colony number, migration, and invasion were assessed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK8), colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assays. Glucose consumption and lactate production were detected using commercial kits. Protein expression was measured using western blot. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA pull-down assay were used to analyze the relationships between miR-760 and circ_0008133 or MEX3A. The effects of circ_0008133 knockdown on tumor growth in vivo were examined by the nude mice expriment. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay analyzed Ki-67 expression.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Circ_0008133 and MEX3A were markedly boosted in lung cancer tissues and cells. Circ_0008133 knockdown decreased lung cancer cell viability, glucose consumption, lactate production, colony formation, migration, and invasion. In mechanism, circ_0008133 might positively regulate MEX3A expression by sponging miR-760. Additionally, knockdown of circ_0008133 inhibited tumor growth in vivo.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Circ_0008133 accelerated the progression of lung cancer by promoting glycolysis metabolism through the miR-760/MEX3A axis.</p>","author":"Shuhong Kang, \nYunfeng Ni, \nKe Lan, \nFeng Lv","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"636d960eb29d0a25373bb6683ab2c8588b799a0b20f3624d8f4856d52ddb9e6c","category":"Environment"}
