{"title":"High temperature ameliorates high-fat diet-induced obesity by promoting ceramide breakdown in skeletal muscle tissue","link":"https://academic.oup.com/lifemeta/article/doi/10.1093/lifemeta/loae012/7639495?rss=1","date":1712102400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Obesity is considered an epidemic often accompanied by insulin resistance (IR). Heat treatment (HT) has been shown to prevent high-fat diet-induced IR in skeletal muscle, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we discovered that high temperature alleviated the hallmarks of obesity by promoting glycogen synthesis and lowering blood glucose levels in skeletal muscle tissue (SMT). Additionally, HT maintained the decay phase of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), leading to the activation of gene expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which contributed to the alleviation of IR in SMT of diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Metabolomics and lipidomics analyses showed that HT promoted ceramide (Cer) breakdown, resulting in an elevation of both sphingomyelin (SM) and sphingosine, which further contributed to the amelioration of IR in SMT of DIO mice. Importantly, the increase in sphingosine was attributed to the heightened expression of the acid ceramidase N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1 (ASAH1), and the inhibition of ASAH1 attenuated HT-relieved IR in SMT of DIO mice. Surprisingly, high temperature increased the composition of Cer and cholesteryl ester in lipid droplets of skeletal muscle cells. This not only helped alleviate IR but also prevented lipotoxicity in SMT of DIO mice. These findings revealed a previously unknown connection between a high-temperature environment and sphingolipid metabolism in obesity, suggesting that high temperature can improve IR by promoting Cer catabolism in SMT of obese mice.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Life Metabolism Current Issue","siteHash":"d3cf61b7d69b232b580c1102d6441106867080e8dca2814adef0cc08b7e63ed3","entryHash":"8d9c41e3d0ac387df0e9f39915dbe9dd3940218978085f5cb57944e21dc62812","category":"Environment"}
