{"title":"Tracking the Evolution of Snow Drought in the U.S. Pacific Northwest at Variable Scales","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034588?af=R","date":1721912460000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Long-term and year-to-year changes in climate can cause anomalously warm and/or dry conditions, leading to periods with snowfall deficits known as snow droughts. How the occurrence of distinct types of snow drought has evolved at different spatial and temporal scales is not well understood. Here, we investigate how snow droughts and associated seasonal snow conditions vary subseasonally in the US Pacific Northwest. We specifically consider differences with spatial unit (point vs. river basin), data set and intra-annual timing of snow drought. Data sets included in the research come from in situ observations, gridded model outputs and optical remote sensing. We found that overall, snow drought occurrences have increased 10%–15% over the last 30 years based on decadal counts, but the change was non-uniform across snow drought types and winter periods. Our research showed a decrease in dry snow droughts but an increase in warm/dry snow droughts according to in situ observations and only a modest increase in the model record. We also found that dry snow droughts were more prevalent in the eastern portion of our study region while warm/dry snow droughts were generally more common in the western part of the study area. With optical remote sensing data, it was possible to identify warm/dry snow drought conditions in the mid to late winter (January–May), but not possible to distinguish other types of snow drought in the early winter. This research points to the importance of data set choice, spatial resolution and spatial/temporal aggregation when selecting parameters for snow drought research.</p>","author":"B. M.
