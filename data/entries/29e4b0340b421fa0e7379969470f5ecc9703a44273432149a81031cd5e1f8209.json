While other methods of generating short electron pulses in STEM have been demonstrated, they generally struggle to preserve electron probe coherence. [<a href=\"#ozae044.723-B1\">1-3</a>] Here, we present a pioneering approach leveraging a probe corrected STEM platform (TFS Spectra 300) and an ESBB to generate electron pulses, enabling the investigation of material dynamics under electrical excitation with angstrom level spatial resolution. Our technique also enables 5D-STEM (time-resolved Four-Dimensional STEM), pushing the boundaries of spatiotemporal resolution in the study of electrically induced phase transformations, carrier dynamics, and thermal diffusion in various materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"29e4b0340b421fa0e7379969470f5ecc9703a44273432149a81031cd5e1f8209","category":"Environment"}
