{"title":"A Smart Computer Program to Assist Healthcare Providers in Selecting the Best Treatment for Patients with Urinary Stones","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2160/v1","date":1717155936000,"content":"Urinary tract stones can obstruct the urinary tract, resulting in severe lower back pain, blood in the urine, vomiting, and painful urination. While small stones can pass naturally through the urine stream, larger ones necessitate fragmentation with shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) or laser ureteroscopy (URS) to prevent urinary tract blockage. A smart computer program was developed to predict treatment efficacy for removing a stone and potential complications for individual patients based on factors such as age, health conditions, stone details, and treatment instruments, ultimately recommending the most suitable option. Here, I present three case studies and their predicted outcomes.
