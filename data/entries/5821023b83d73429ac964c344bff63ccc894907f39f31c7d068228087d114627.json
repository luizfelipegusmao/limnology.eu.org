{"title":"Acceptance Sampling Plans Based on Conformance Probability&mdash;Inspection of Lots and Processes by Attributes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2228/v1","date":1727601739000,"content":"A novel approach for designing acceptance sampling plans is presented. It is based on the Bayesian conformity assessment framework from JCGM 106. In particular, the concept of conformance probability plays a central role in the new approach. The new approach takes into account both the producer's and the consumer's perspective by allowing each to have their own prior. In parallel, the JCGM 106 framework allows the definition of Bayesian consumer's and producer's risks which complement the \"classical\" risks defined in the ISO 2859 and ISO 3951 series. The new approach also casts a new light on the plans from the ISO standards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5821023b83d73429ac964c344bff63ccc894907f39f31c7d068228087d114627","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
