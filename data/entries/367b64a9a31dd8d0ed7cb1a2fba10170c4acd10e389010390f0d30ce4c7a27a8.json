{"title":"Stream CO2 emissions are overestimated without consideration of diel water and atmospheric CO2 variability","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10405?af=R","date":1726662711000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Streams are significant emitters of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere that are influenced by diel CO<sub>2</sub> dynamics. However, we know little about diel CO<sub>2</sub> variability within streams, the diel dynamics of CO<sub>2</sub> in the air above streams, and the consequences for emission calculations. We studied five pre-alpine streams by equipping three sites per stream in close proximity (~ 1 km apart) with automatic logging stations that continuously recorded water and air CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressures (pCO<sub>2</sub>) for 2–4 d. All streams and sites showed increased pCO<sub>2</sub> at night and decreased pCO<sub>2</sub> during the day, however, with fourfold higher diel amplitudes for atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub> compared to the water. Calculating diffusive CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes with fixed compared to dynamic measured atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> resulted in negligible to 431% lower estimates. We might thus currently overestimate fluvial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and should include diel water and air CO<sub>2</sub> variability to more accurately assess stream CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>","author":"Theresa Reichenpfader, \nKatrin Attermeyer","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Letters: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e3d6bd1d0a248694da65f62e7591c05124a8fbc5456d1cafb66209dfd7ae6238","entryHash":"367b64a9a31dd8d0ed7cb1a2fba10170c4acd10e389010390f0d30ce4c7a27a8","category":"Environment"}
