{"title":"Neuropsychiatric Approaches to Essential and Functional Tremor: A Comparative Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0745/v1","date":1718143732000,"content":"Background: Differentiating essential tremor (ET) and functional tremor (FT) remains challenging due to their overlapping clinical presentations. Objective: In this study, we aimed to elucidate the demographic and psychometric differences between the aforementioned tremor types to enhance the diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic strategies. Methods: In this prospective study, we included 96 patients diagnosed with ET or FT and analysed their related demographic data, clinical symptoms, and psychometric evaluation scores. Our statistical analysis involved Pearson’s chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests, and logistic regression to assess how the different variables impact tremor diagnosis. Results: Our study demonstrated a higher ET prevalence in males (p = 0.015). Furthermore, we demonstrated that patients with ET displayed a significantly lower body mass index and a lower age of onset compared to those with FT (p = 0.050 and p = 0.023, respectively). Our psychometric assessments revealed higher cognitive and body image scores in patients with ET, whereas those with FT scored higher on depression and anxiety scales. The misdiagnosis rate was 14.5%, emphasising the need for improved diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: We established specific demographic and psychometric distinctions between ET and FT, which could potentially benefit clinicians in making accurate diagnoses and tailoring treatment approaches. These findings support the inclusion of comprehensive psychometric evaluations into standard diagnostic procedures to better differentiate tremor types.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"088b3c6f019091766ca16d45b98f42f8e75c80c7278615dc61bd191bd1688ec0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
