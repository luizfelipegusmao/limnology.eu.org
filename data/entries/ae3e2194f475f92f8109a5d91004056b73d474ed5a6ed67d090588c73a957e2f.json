{"title":"The Evolution of Hunting Strategies in Tyrannosaurus rex: Analyzing Bite Force and Predatory Behavior","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1810/v1","date":1721743640000,"content":"This literature review aims to gain a deeper understanding of the anatomy behind the jaw strength of Tyrannosaurus rex and analyze how these features contribute to its predatory behavior. This review will examine various studies and fossil excavations, exploring ideas such as the bite force of T. rex and its variations across different life stages. This will be obtained from numerous biomechanical models of both juvenile and adult Tyrannosaurus rex, as well as reference animals and dinosaurs for comparison. To provide additional information behind T. rex’s hunting techniques, we will also discuss the fauna of herbivorous dinosaurs that were part of T. rex’s diet. Furthermore, we will explore how mandibular stress concentration can vary between ages, a crucial topic in determining what T. rex could consume at certain stages of its life. Finally, we obtain a well-evidenced analysis of the various aspects of Tyrannosaurus rex’s hunting strategies throughout its lifetime.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ae3e2194f475f92f8109a5d91004056b73d474ed5a6ed67d090588c73a957e2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
