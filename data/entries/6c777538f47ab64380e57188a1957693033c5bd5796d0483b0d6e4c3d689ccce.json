Variations in these PMN functions, however, may not only be influenced by the health status of the animals but also by technical, non-animal related factors. Our objectives were to assess the PMN viability, PC and OB capacities from blood samples collected in tubes coated with different anticoagulants (acid citrate dextrose (ACD) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) and stored for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h at 4°C (to mimic transportation timeframe). Furthermore, we evaluated the PMN functionalities (PC and OB) in samples incubated in culture medium with glucose (7.2 mM) versus no glucose. Over five replicates, coccygeal blood samples were collected from three nulliparous Holstein heifers (5 ACD and 5 EDTA per heifer) and allocated in a refrigerated container (4°C) for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h. At each time point, PMN were isolated using gradient centrifugation. Immunolabeled PMN (CH138A) were subjected to a tricolor fluorescent staining to evaluate their viability (viable, apoptotic, and necrotic PMN). Phagocytosis and OB were assessed by incubating PMN with fluorescent beads and by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation, respectively. The effects of anticoagulant type, storage time, and presence of glucose in the culture medium on PMN viability and function parameters were fitted in mixed linear regression models. The proportion of viable PMN at 0 h was similar for ACD and EDTA (92 ± 4.6% and 93 ± 4.6%, respectively) but it decreased to 78 ± 4.6% for ACD and 79 ± 4.6% for EDTA after 6 h of storage. The proportion of viable PMN was not different between ACD and EDTA at any time point. The proportion of PMN that engulfed beads (PC percentage) and the PC median fluorescence intensity (MFI) reached their highest value after 3 h of storage compared with the other time points. However, the anticoagulant type (ACD versus EDTA) and the presence of glucose in the culture medium did not influence these PC parameters. Oxidative burst MFI was higher in PMN incubated in glucose-supplemented culture medium versus no glucose. We demonstrated that technical factors interfere with the evaluation of PMN viability and functionality, which can potentially lead to bias in the findings of a research hypothesis. To conclude, the present study showed that the optimal timeframe for performing PMN function analyses is within 3 hours after blood sampling. Furthermore, the presence of 7.2 mM glucose in the culture medium, a common concentration in formulation of cell culture medium, increases the <i>in vitro</i> OB capacity, potentially masking any impairments in <i>in vivo</i> PMN dysfunctionality.","author":"Sanjana Malledevarahalli Chandrappa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6c777538f47ab64380e57188a1957693033c5bd5796d0483b0d6e4c3d689ccce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
