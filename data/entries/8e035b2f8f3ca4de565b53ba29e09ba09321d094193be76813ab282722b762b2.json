{"title":"Surface Charging Analysis of Ariel Spacecraft in L2-Relevant Space Plasma Environment and GEO Early Transfer Orbit","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0472/v1","date":1728296747000,"content":"Ariel (Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey) is the ESA Cosmic Vision M4 mission, selected in March 2018 and officially adopted in November 2020 whose launch is sched-uled by 2029. It aims at characterizing the atmospheres of hundreds of exoplanets orbiting nearby stars by low-resolution primary and secondary transit spectroscopy. The Ariel spacecraft's opera-tional orbit is baselined as a large amplitude, eclipse-free halo orbit around the second Lagrangian (L2) point, a virtual point located at about 1.5 million km from the Earth in anti-Sun direction, as it offers the possibility of long uninterrupted observations in a fairly stable radiative and ther-mo-mechanical environment. A direct escape injection with a single passage through the Van Allen radiation belts is foreseen. During both the injection trajectory and the final orbit around L2, Ariel will be immersed in and interact with Sun radiation and the plasma environment. These interac-tions usually result in the accumulation of net electrostatic charge on the external surfaces of the spacecraft, leading to a potentially hazardous configuration for the nominal operation and sur-vivability of the Ariel platform and its payload, as it may induce harmful electrostatic discharges (ESDs). \nThis work presents the latest results collected from surface charging analyses conducted using the SPIS tool of the European SPINE community along the GEO insertion orbit segment and operational orbit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e035b2f8f3ca4de565b53ba29e09ba09321d094193be76813ab282722b762b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
