{"title":"Carotid Plaques and Hypertension on the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and All-Cause Mortality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0273/v1","date":1712282222000,"content":"Background: Both hypertension and carotid atherosclerosis are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Understanding their combined impact could enhance risk assessment and management strategies.\nHypothesis: We hypothesized that the synergistic effects of hypertension and carotid plaques would increase the risk of both cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.\nMethods: A follow-up study was conducted at the Preventive Cardiology department of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros klinikos between 2012 and 2021. The study recruited participants aged 40-60 who did not have overt CVD and were part of the Lithuanian High Cardiovascular Risk primary preventive program. The study collected demographic and clinical data, including an ultrasound assessment of carotid plaque. The participants were monitored for 4-10 years for CVD events and all-cause mortality.\nResults: Among 6,138 participants, 954 (16%) experienced cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. The presence of carotid plaque on both sides was significantly associated with CVD events, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality. However, the combination of hypertension and carotid plaque did not significantly increase the risk for CVD events, stroke, or all-cause mortality. \nConclusion: The combination of hypertension and carotid plaque did not significantly increase the risk of CVD events or all-cause mortality. CV events depend on the spread of the atherosclerosis process in the carotid vessels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd19330fbb869df778bb78df35907824906810c810f2881d3f338c450d557145","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
