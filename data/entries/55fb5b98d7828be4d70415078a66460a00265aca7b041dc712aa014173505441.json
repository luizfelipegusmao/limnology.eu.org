In annual plants like Arabidopsis, an initial vegetative phase swiftly switches to a later reproductive phase, leading to bolting, or the growth of a flower stalk. Bolting is accompanied by leaf senescence as the plant focuses on setting seed. This reproductive transition requires large-scale transcriptional reprogramming that remains poorly understood but has significant implications for yield and nutrient quality in crops (<a href=\"#koae240-B2\">Hav√© et al. 2017</a>). Through single-plant-omics, <strong>Ethan Redmond and colleagues (<a href=\"#koae240-B3\">Redmond et al. 2024</a>)</strong> explore how gene expression changes during bolting, simplifying an immensely complex, shifting transcriptional landscape into orderly events.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"55fb5b98d7828be4d70415078a66460a00265aca7b041dc712aa014173505441","category":"Environment"}
