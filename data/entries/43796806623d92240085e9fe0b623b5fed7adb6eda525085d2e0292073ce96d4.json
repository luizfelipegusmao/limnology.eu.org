{"title":"Modulatory Roles of AHR, FFAR2, FXR, and TGR5 Gene Expression in MAFLD and COVID-19 Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0815/v1","date":1715581765000,"content":"Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a risk factor for severe COVID-19. This study explores the potential influence of gut hormone receptor and immune response gene expression on COVID-19 outcomes in MAFLD patients. Methods: We investigated gene expression levels of AHR, FFAR2, FXR, and TGR5 in patients with MAFLD and COVID-19 compared to controls. We examined associations between gene expression and clinical outcomes. Results: COVID-19 patients displayed altered AHR expression, potentially impacting immune response and recovery. Downregulated AHR in MAFLD patients correlated with increased coagulation parameters. Elevated FFAR2 expression in MAFLD linked to specific immune cell populations and hospital stay duration. Significantly lower FXR expression was observed in both MAFLD and severe COVID-19. Conclusion: Our findings suggest potential modulatory roles for AHR, FFAR2, and FXR in COVID-19 and MAFLD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43796806623d92240085e9fe0b623b5fed7adb6eda525085d2e0292073ce96d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
