{"title":"The Efficacy of Food Bioactive Compounds in The Treatment of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0208/v1","date":1727879640000,"content":"Background: Food Bioactive Substances (FBS), extra-nutritional constituents found in foods are promising strategies in the treatment of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). Existing clinical studies showed contradictory results regarding their therapeutic effect. This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of food-bioactive substances in patients with NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).  Methods: Six controlled databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest, CINAHL and Cochrane) were searched, yielding 10969 articles. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, while screening, quality assessment and data extraction of search results were conducted using Covidence.   Results: Thirty-two studies were included in the systematic review, while 8 RCTs with 540 patients with NAFLD were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis underscores the effects of the three most studied FBS (silymarin, curcumin and resveratrol) on key cardiovascular and metabolic markers, including BMI, waist circumference, AST, ALT, LDL, HDL, cholesterol and triglycerides of these patients. Overall, FBS showed a statistically significant reduction in BMI (SMD = -0.28; 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.10, p &lt; 0.01), a slight reduction in LDL (SMD = -0.22; p = 0.02), HOMA-IR (SMD = -0.26, 95% CI = -0.51 to -0.02; p = 0.036), total cholesterol level SMD = -0.15 (95% CI: -0.40 to -0.10; I2 = 13%; p = 0.33), especially with silymarin showing the greatest statistically significant reduction in HOMA-IR (SMD = -0.16); p = 0.01), Total Cholesterol (SMD = -0.45, p &lt;0.01), AST (SMD = -0.23, p &lt;0.01)  Conclusion: Silymarin appeared to be the most promising intervention, particularly for lowering BMI, LDL, cholesterol and triglycerides, but the high variability between studies limits the generalizability of these results","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b29484411ede93ae0236fef412d0979abaa440e140d0695b63998cdd8a210f5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
