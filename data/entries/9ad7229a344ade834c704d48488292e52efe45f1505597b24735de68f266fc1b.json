{"title":"A window on remarkable cryptic diversity of the Merodon planifacies subgroup (Diptera: Syrphidae) in the Afrotropical Region","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae091/7816044?rss=1","date":1728432000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The genus <span>Merodon</span> Meigen (Diptera: Syrphidae) is one of the most species-rich hoverfly genera distributed across the Palaearctic and Afrotropical regions. In the Palaearctic, the genus <span>Merodon</span> boasts 195 described species, while its Afrotropical region pales in comparison, with a mere 17 species documented thus far. As a result of 8 years of fieldwork conducted in the Republic of South Africa, in this paper, we present the description of 11 new species for science with a description of immature stages for 2 species, which increases the diversity of this genus in the Afrotropical region by remarkable 39%. These revelations are based on integrating morphology, molecular analysis (<span>COI</span> gene and <span>28S</span> rRNA) and geometric morphometry. All described species belong to the <span>Merodon planifacies</span> subgroup, the <span>Merodon desuturinus</span> lineage and, within that, to the Afrotropical <span>Merodon melanocerus</span> group. Additionally, we provide an illustrated key to 15 species belonging to the subgroup, a detailed discussion on relevant taxonomic characters, a morphological diagnosis, a distribution map and clarification of the association between <span>M. capi</span> complex and host plants from the genus <span>Merwilla</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"9ad7229a344ade834c704d48488292e52efe45f1505597b24735de68f266fc1b","category":"Environment"}
