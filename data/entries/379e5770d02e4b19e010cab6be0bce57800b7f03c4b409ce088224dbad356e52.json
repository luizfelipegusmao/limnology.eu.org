{"title":"The SK4 channel allosteric blocker, BA6b9, reduces atrial fibrillation substrate in rats with reduced ejection fraction","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae192/7670683?rss=1","date":1715472000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is strongly associated with several comorbidities including heart failure (HF). AF in general, and specifically in the context of HF, is progressive in nature and associated with poor clinical outcomes. Current therapies for AF are limited in number and efficacy and do not target the underlying causes of atrial remodeling such as inflammation or fibrosis. We previously identified the calcium-activated SK4 K<sup>+</sup> channels, which are preferentially expressed in the atria relative to the ventricles in both rat and human hearts, as attractive druggable target for AF treatment. Here, we examined the ability of BA6b9, a novel allosteric inhibitor of SK4 channels that targets the specific calmodulin-PIP2 binding domain, to alter AF susceptibility and atrial remodeling in a systolic HF rat postmyocardial infarction (post-MI) model. Daily BA6b9 injection (20 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks starting 1-week post-MI prolonged the atrial effective refractory period, reduced AF induction and duration, and dramatically prevented atrial structural remodeling. In the post-MI left atrium (LA), pronounced upregulation of the SK4 K<sup>+</sup> channel was observed, with corresponding increases in collagen deposition, α-SMA levels, and NLRP3 inflammasome expression. Strikingly, BA6b9 treatment reversed these changes while also significantly reducing the lateralization of the atrial connexin Cx43 in the LA of post-MI rats. Our findings indicate that the blockade of SK4 K<sup>+</sup> channels using BA6b9 not only favors rhythm control but also remarkably reduces atrial structural remodeling, a property that is highly desirable for novel AF therapies, particularly in patients with comorbid HF.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"379e5770d02e4b19e010cab6be0bce57800b7f03c4b409ce088224dbad356e52","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
