The first example is to examine the influence of inhomogeneity and disorder on the fascinating ferroic orders in Sc-doped LuFeO<sub>3</sub>. We show how individual dopants or substitutional atoms interact with host lattices (Fig.1), enabling us to manipulate, control, and improve the functionality of materials due to the intimate coupling among various degrees of freedom in multiferroics. Atomic variations in polar displacement of intriguing topological vortex domains stabilized by Sc substitution are directly correlated with Sc atom-mediated local chemical and electronic fluctuations and verified by DFT calculations. This study holds potential for correlating dopant-regulated local structures with global properties, offering insights into engineering emergent functionalities of numerous doped functional materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.1073-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1cea42a69d9e341927154f99cc57ee8348f3230bbffccc8b298d71e358a52cbf","category":"Environment"}
