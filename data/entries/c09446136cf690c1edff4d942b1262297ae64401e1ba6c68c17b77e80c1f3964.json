{"title":"E-Waste Management in Serbia, Focusing on the Possibility of Applying Automated Separation Using Robots","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0870/v1","date":1718257574000,"content":"To encourage proper waste management from electrical and electronic devices (e-waste), it is necessary to invest heavily in the development of recycling technologies. One way to improve the process is to automate separating the shredded parts of e-waste using a robot. This paper's literature review, utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, showcases potential robotic technologies for e-waste separation. However, the intricate design of these devices can pose significant challenges in their implementation. Various legal, organizational, and sociological obstacles have left Serbia's e-waste management practice underdeveloped, resulting in an unsatisfactory recycling rate. In this paper we examined the possibility of using robots on the precise example of recycling refrigerators in a recycling center in Eastern Serbia, concluding that such a solution would have multiple positive effects, both on the employees and the working environment, on the operations of the recycling center itself, and on increasing the e-waste recycling rate in the country.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c09446136cf690c1edff4d942b1262297ae64401e1ba6c68c17b77e80c1f3964","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
