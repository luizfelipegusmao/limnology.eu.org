{"title":"The Shift from Aerobic to Anaerobic/Strength Training: A Paradigm Change in Preventing Frailty, Morbidity, and Mortality in Older Adults","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0684/v1","date":1725875783000,"content":"Frailty syndrome, a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in older adults, has traditionally been addressed through aerobic exercises. However, recent research has highlighted the importance of anaerobic and strength training activities in mitigating frailty. This article explores the shift from aerobic to anaerobic/strength training exercises, emphasizing the benefits of the latter in improving muscle strength, balance, and overall physical function. The discussion includes the physiological mechanisms underlying this shift, the evidence supporting strength training, and practical recommendations for implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50e5a9c2c46017d36b1e751105c12c61c0124e130563a9d2982bec9035ababc0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
