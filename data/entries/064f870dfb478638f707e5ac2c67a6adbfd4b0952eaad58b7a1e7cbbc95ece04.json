{"title":"Biology in its Element: Using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (EDX-STEM) to Probe Bacterial Ultrastructure","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.972/7720250?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Understanding biological processes begins with the precise identification and localization of biomolecules. Electron microscopy (EM) provides high spatial resolution information of native structures in cells and tissues. However, accurate interpretation of the complex milieu of biological structures and molecules is often impeded by the grayscale nature of EM images, making determination of the cellular constituents without prior knowledge of the characteristic structure or localization difficult. As electron microscopy moves from single protein imaging to whole cellular specimens or large volumes of tissue [<a href=\"#ozae044.972-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.972-B2\">2</a>], there is an acute need for parallel techniques which can provide another dimension to the grayscale contrast in EM. Methods such as energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and electron energy loss (EELS) spectroscopies are applied routinely in the materials sciences to achieve sub-nanometer resolutions and provide elemental contrast to EM images [<a href=\"#ozae044.972-B3\">3</a>]. However, the use of electron spectroscopy in the life sciences remains relatively rare [<a href=\"#ozae044.972-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.972-B5\">5</a>]. We aim to develop and apply EDX methods to probe elemental distributions within biological specimens across different sample types.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"064f870dfb478638f707e5ac2c67a6adbfd4b0952eaad58b7a1e7cbbc95ece04","category":"Environment"}
