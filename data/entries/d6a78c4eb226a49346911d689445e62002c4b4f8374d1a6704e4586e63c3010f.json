{"title":"EPMA of Low-Z Elements: A Closer Look at Mass Attenuation Coefficient Accuracy of Soft X-rays","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.086/7719446?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) has gained renewed interest in recent years for the measurement and analysis of elements using soft X-rays, generally defined as X-rays with energies below 1 keV, due to advancements in X-ray spectrometers. Soft X-rays enable the analysis of the lighter elements of the periodic table, such as beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine, which often play critical roles in defining the properties of many advanced materials and geological samples. Soft X-rays originate from electron transitions involving the valence electrons, making them sensitive probes of the chemical bonding state. However, this sensitivity also poses challenges for accurate elemental quantification using soft X-rays.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d6a78c4eb226a49346911d689445e62002c4b4f8374d1a6704e4586e63c3010f","category":"Environment"}
