{"title":"GLK transcription factors accompany ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 to orchestrate light-induced seedling development in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2400/7511326?rss=1","date":1704412800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Light-induced de-etiolation is an important aspect of seedling photomorphogenesis. GOLDEN2 LIKE (GLK) transcriptional regulators are involved in chloroplast development, but to what extent they participate in photomorphogenesis is not clear. Here, we show that ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) binds to <span>GLK</span> promoters to activate their expression, and also interacts with GLK proteins in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). The chlorophyll content in the de-etiolating Arabidopsis seedlings of the <span>hy5 glk2</span> double mutants was lower than that in the <span>hy5</span> single mutant. GLKs inhibited hypocotyl elongation, and the phenotype could superimpose on the <span>hy5</span> phenotype. Correspondingly, GLK2 regulated the expression of photosynthesis and cell elongation genes partially independent of HY5. Before exposure to light, DE-ETIOLATED 1 (DET1) affected accumulation of GLK proteins. The enhanced etioplast development and photosystem gene expression observed in the <span>det1</span> mutant were attenuated in the <span>det1 glk2</span> double mutant. Our study reveals that GLKs act downstream of HY5, or additive to HY5, and are likely quantitatively adjusted by DET1, to orchestrate multiple developmental traits during the light-induced skotomorphogenesis-to-photomorphogenesis transition in Arabidopsis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"a5097e495634daff8427e0995fc5ae08eb4dc9574a19cd3b884c743d538b2f97","category":"Environment"}
