{"title":"Choose your own TALE: Two novel cell death-inducers identified by engineered effectors","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2493/7658366?rss=1","date":1714003200000,"content":"<span>Genome editing has broken into the mainstream: a Nobel prize, huge potential in medicine and agriculture, ethical debates, obsolete regulations, famous controversies.… From a mechanistic point of view, genome editing techniques are just clever ways to utilize natural cellular processes to modify genomic sequences in a targeted manner. For instance, the famous CRISPR-Cas9 is based on the ability of certain bacteria to recognize and degrade viral DNA. Before CRISPR-Cas9 became “a thing,” scientists had developed another genome editing technique using bacterial transcription activator-like effector proteins (TALEs) from <span>Xanthomonas</span>. These bacteria translocate TALEs directly into the plant nucleus, where they bind specific sequences of the plant DNA and induce the expression of downstream genes (<a href=\"#kiae228-B4\">Perez-Quintero and Szurek 2019</a>). This recognition of the DNA is achieved by the modular structure of TALEs, whose central domain contains tandem repeats, each one binding a single nucleotide. The recognition specificity comes from the amino acid composition of 2 key residues in the tandem repeats, which determine the nucleotide each repeat will bind to (<a href=\"#kiae228-B1\">Boch et al. 2009</a>). Different <span>Xanthomonas</span> species have evolved different TALEs to activate the expression of a wide variety of susceptibility genes to the bacterial benefit (<a href=\"#kiae228-B7\">Zhang et al. 2022</a>). In turn, plants have also evolved mechanisms to coopt the TALEs transcriptional activation to induce the expression of so-called executor genes that cause a protective form of cell death that prevents the pathogen proliferation (<a href=\"#kiae228-B3\">Nowack et al. 2022</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"7d073f6b2847333c045ce53c3d66c90e98e26ffa78b92a9f712e5ed9e7d33162","category":"Environment"}
