Isochlorogenic acid A (ICAA), a phenolic acid present in tea, fruits, vegetables, coffee, plant-based food products, and various medicinal plants, exerts multiple effects, including anti-oxidant, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic functions. Thus, the purpose of our study was to determine if ICAA could prevent Pb-induced hepatotoxicity in ICR mice. An evaluation was performed on oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis, and related signaling. The results indicate that ICAA attenuates Pb-induced abnormal liver function. ICAA reduced liver fibrosis, inflammation and oxidative stress caused by Pb. ICAA abated Pb-induced fibrosis and decreased inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). ICAA abrogated reductions in activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Masson staining revealed that ICAA reduced collagen fiber deposition in Pb-induced fibrotic livers. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses showed ICAA increased phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) expression. ICAA also reduced the expression of collagen I, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), phosphorylated c-jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), p-p38, phosphorylated signal transducer and phosphorylated activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3), transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), and p-Smad2/3 in livers of mice. Overall, ICAA ameliorates Pb-induced hepatitis and fibrosis by inhibiting the AMPK/MAPKs/NF-κB and STAT3/TGF-β1/Smad2/3 pathways.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"9b927950ce90c585d982610c22ba75ad50f98e3dca29502e2e1f0cf75046c6c1","category":"Environment"}
