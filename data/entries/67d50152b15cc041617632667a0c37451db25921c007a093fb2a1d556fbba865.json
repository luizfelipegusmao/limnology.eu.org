{"title":"Comparison efficacy and safety of acupuncture and moxibustion therapies in breast cancer-related lymphedema: A systematic review and network meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303513","date":1715695200000,"content":"<p>by Yawen Xu, Jiangxuan Yu, Rui Shen, Xueqi Shan, Wenlu Zhou, Junjie Wang</p>\r\nObjective <p>Although several acupuncture and moxibustion therapies have been tested in managing breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL), there is little consensus regarding the best options for treating this condition. This systematic review and network meta-analysis compared the efficacy of various acupuncture and/or moxibustion therapies for BCRL.</p> Methods <p>Seven databases and two clinical registration centers were searched from their inception to December 1<sup>st</sup>, 2023. The Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias assessment tool evaluated the quality of included RCTs. A pairwise meta-analysis was performed in STATA 16.0, while a network meta-analysis was performed in R 4.2.2.</p> Results <p>18 studies were included in this analysis. Our results showed that acupuncture and moxibustion methods had great advantages in improving BCRL of patients with breast cancer. In particular, needle-warming moxibustion (NWM) could be the optimal acupuncture and moxibustion method for improving clinical effectiveness and reducing the degree of swelling of affected limbs.</p> Conclusion <p>Our findings suggest that NWM has great potential in treating BCRL. It may reduce arm circumference, lower swelling levels, and improve clinical effectiveness. Nevertheless, more multi-center, high-quality, and large sample RCTs will be needed in the future.</p>","author":"Yawen Xu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"67d50152b15cc041617632667a0c37451db25921c007a093fb2a1d556fbba865","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
