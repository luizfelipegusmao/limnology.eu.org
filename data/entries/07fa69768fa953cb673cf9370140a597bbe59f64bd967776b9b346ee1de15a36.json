We successfully reconstructed a 750 μm (W) × 143 μm (H) × 310 μm (D) volume at a resolution of 200 nm/pix from 1550 SEM backscattered electron images of a Li-ion battery cathode sheet. The PFIB-SEM system was found to be capable of acquiring and reconstructing larger volume 3D datasets than X-ray computed tomography, and with higher resolution and contrast.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"07fa69768fa953cb673cf9370140a597bbe59f64bd967776b9b346ee1de15a36","category":"Environment"}
