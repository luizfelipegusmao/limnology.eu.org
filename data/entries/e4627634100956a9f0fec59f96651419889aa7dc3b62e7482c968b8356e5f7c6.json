{"title":"Spray dried protein concentrates from white button and oyster mushrooms produced by ultrasound‐assisted alkaline extraction and isoelectric precipitation","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13940?af=R","date":1728116980000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In the present study, the optimization of ultrasound-assisted alkaline extraction (UAAE) and isoelectric precipitation (IEP) was applied to white button (WBM) and oyster (OYM) mushroom flours to produce functional spray dried mushroom protein concentrates. Solid-to-liquid ratio (5–15% w/v), ultrasound power (0–900 W) and type of acid [HCl or acetic acid (AcOH)] were evaluated for their effect on the extraction and protein yields from mushroom flours submitted to UAAE-IEP protein extraction.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Prioritized conditions with maximized protein yield (5% w/v, 900 W, AcOH, for WBM; 5% w/v, 900 W, HCl for OYM) were used to produce spray dried protein concentrates from white button (WBM-PC) and oyster (OYM-PC) mushrooms with high solids recovery (62.3–65.8%). WBM-PC and OYM-PC had high protein content (5.19–5.81 g kg<sup>−1</sup>), in addition to remarkable foaming capacity (82.5–235.0%) and foam stability (7.0–162.5%), as well as antioxidant phenolics. Highly pH-dependent behavior was observed for solubility (&gt; 90%, at pH 10) and emulsifying properties (emulsification activity index: &gt; 50 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>, emulsion stability index: &gt; 65%, at pH 10). UAAE-IEP followed by spray drying increased surface hydrophobicity and free sulfhydryl groups by up to 196.5% and 117.5%, respectively, which improved oil holding capacity (359.9–421.0%) and least gelation concentration (6.0–8.0%) of spray dried mushroom protein concentrates.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Overall, the present study showed that optimized UAAE-IEP coupled with spray drying is an efficient strategy to produce novel mushroom protein concentrates with enhanced functional attributes for multiple food applications. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Fábio Gonçalves Macêdo de Medeiros, \nSeung Woon You, \nRoberta Targino Hoskin, \nMarvin Moncada","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"e4627634100956a9f0fec59f96651419889aa7dc3b62e7482c968b8356e5f7c6","category":"Environment"}
