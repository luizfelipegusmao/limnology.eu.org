{"title":"Decomposition rates appear stable despite elevated shrimp abundances following hurricanes in montane streams, Puerto Rico","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05458-2","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Leaf litter decomposition is a key ecosystem process in headwater streams, influenced by physical fragmentation, microbial degradation and feeding activity by stream biota. In some tropical streams, feeding by freshwater shrimps can exert strong top-down control on leaf litter decomposition, however, variation in shrimp macroconsumer effects across small spatial scales or among years is not well-known. We ran 50-day macroconsumer exclusion experiments to measure shrimp effects on leaf decomposition in two adjacent headwater streams in Puerto Rico, in 2017 (immediately prior to two Category 4 and 5 hurricanes) and again in 2018 and 2019, to assess shrimp effects in the context of post-hurricane conditions that included reduced canopy cover and higher shrimp (<em>Atya</em> and <em>Xiphocaris</em>) counts. Leaf decomposition was faster when shrimp had access to leaf packs, but only in the study stream with larger pools, which also had higher overall shrimp counts. However, increased shrimp abundances following the hurricanes did not result in faster decomposition, potentially because shrimp diets shifted toward algae post-hurricanes when canopies were more open. We conclude that shrimp effects on leaf litter breakdown may vary between adjacent streams that differ in habitat conditions and that increasing local shrimp abundances may fail to accelerate decomposition.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"ac26f0d3e608503c97db658d6435cf691b66cc45634e6b02e485620a193f7618","category":"Environment"}
