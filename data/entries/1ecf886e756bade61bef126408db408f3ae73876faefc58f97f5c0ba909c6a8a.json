Photoperiod and temperature are key external signals that determine flowering time; both are cyclical and periodic, and they are closely related. In this review, we describe photoperiod-sensitive genes that simultaneously respond to temperature signals in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>). We introduce the mechanisms by which photoperiod and temperature synergistically regulate heading date and regional adaptation in rice. We also discuss the prospects for designing different combinations of heading date genes and other cold tolerance or thermo-tolerance genes to help rice better adapt to changes in light and temperature via molecular breeding to enhance yield in the future.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"1ecf886e756bade61bef126408db408f3ae73876faefc58f97f5c0ba909c6a8a","category":"Environment"}
