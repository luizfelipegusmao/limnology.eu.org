{"title":"Partial Discharge Source Classification in Power Transformers: A Systematic Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1426/v1","date":1718940749000,"content":"Electric Transformers make up some of the most critical components of a power system. Their reliable operation is critical for an efficient power grid as well as economic viability for the transformer operators and owners. Power transformers, like other High Voltage (HV) electrical equipment experience aging and insulation degradation due to chemical, mechanical and electrical forces during their operation. Partial Dischargers (PD) are localized electrical discharges that develop within insulation systems of HV electrical equipment such as transformers. In transformers, PD occurs in different forms and various locations and insulation both internal and external of the transformer. PD originates as small pulses but tends to increase in size and intensity which can result in complete insulation failure. Monitoring partial discharges has proven to provide valuable information on the state of the insulation systems of the power transformer, allowing transformer operators to make calculated decisions for the maintenance and life of plant plans. This systematic literature review aims to systematically examine the use of machine learning techniques in classifying PD in transformers to present a complete indicator to allow for future research in the field. The systematic review surveyed a total of 81 research literature published from 2010 to 2023 that fulfilled a specific methodology which was developed as part of this study. The results revealed that supervised learning has been the most widely used Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm utilized, primarily in the form of Support Vector Machine (SVM). Regarding PD, the survey revealed that most researchers tend to use numerous types of PD and compare them to one another. Furthermore, the use of artificial PD defect models to simulate the occurrence of PD is widely used versus the use of actual power transformers. Most of the literature tends to not specify the physical characteristics of PD, such as the magnitude of PD, PD inception voltage and PD extinction voltage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b49e9fba2abbc0f4a7824c1ef83e84ddef148f86677d342680abfb4fc47fd6dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
