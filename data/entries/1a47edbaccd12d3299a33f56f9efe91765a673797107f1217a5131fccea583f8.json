{"title":"Risk assessment of deep-sea floating offshore wind power projects based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set considering trust relationship among experts","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10661-024-12582-6","date":1712016000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The development of deep-sea floating offshore wind power (FOWP) is the key to fully utilizing water resources to enhance wind resources in the years ahead, and then the project is still in its initial stage, and identifying risks is a crucial step before promoting a significant undertaking. This paper proposes a framework for identifying risks in deep-sea FOWP projects. First, this paper identifies 16 risk criteria and divides them into 5 groups to establish a criteria system. Second, hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) and triangular fuzzy number (TFN) are utilized to gather and describe the criterion data to ensure the robustness and completeness of the criterion data. Third, extending the method for removal effects of criteria (MEREC) to the HFLTS environment through the conversion of TFNs, under the influence of subjective preference and objective fairness, a weighting method combining analytic network process (ANP) and MEREC is utilized to calculate criteria weights, and the trust relationship and consistency between experts are used to calculate the expert weights to avoid the subjective weighting given by experts arbitrariness. Fourth, the study’s findings indicated that the overall risk level of the deep-sea FOWP projects is “medium.” Fifth, sensitivity and comparative analyses were conducted to test the reliability of the assessment outcomes. lastly, this research proposes risk management measures for the deep-sea FOWP project’s establishment from economic, policy, technology, environment, and management aspects.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"1a47edbaccd12d3299a33f56f9efe91765a673797107f1217a5131fccea583f8","category":"Environment"}
