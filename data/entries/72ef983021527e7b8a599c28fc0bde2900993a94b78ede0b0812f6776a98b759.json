{"title":"Probabilistic Power and Energy Balance Risk Scheduling Method Based on Distributed Robust Optimization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2269/v1","date":1725268422000,"content":"The volatility and uncertainty associated with the high proportion of wind and PV output in the new power system significantly impact power and energy balance, making it challenging to accurately assess the risks related to renewable energy abandonment and supply guarante. Therefore, a probabilistic power and energy balance risk analysis method based on distributed robust optimization is proposed. Firstly, the affine factor and the flexible ramp reserve capacity of thermal power are combined to establish a probabilistic index, which serves to characterize the risk associated with power and energy balance. Drawing upon the principles of conditional value at risk theory, the risk indexes of load shedding power and curtailment power under a certain confidence probability are proposed. Secondly, the probability distribution fuzzy sets of uncertain variables are constructed using the distributionally robust method to measure the Wasserstein distance between different probability distributions. Finally, aiming at minimizing the operation cost of thermal power, the risk cost of power abandonment and the risk cost of load shedding, a distributed robust optimal scheduling model based on flexible ramp reserve of thermal power is established.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72ef983021527e7b8a599c28fc0bde2900993a94b78ede0b0812f6776a98b759","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
