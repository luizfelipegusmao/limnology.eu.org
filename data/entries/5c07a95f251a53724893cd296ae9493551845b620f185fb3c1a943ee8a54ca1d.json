{"title":"Clinical efficacy and applicability of natural products in the treatment and prevention of radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis: A systematic review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303988","date":1716472800000,"content":"<p>by Wen Zhang, Lu Fan, Yifang Xie, Tenghui Gao, Jieping Zeng</p>\r\n\r\nThe aim of this systematic review was to describe the efficacy and acceptability of natural products in the management of oral mucositis caused by radiation. From the day it started to August 7, 2023, a thorough search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was carried out among seven databases: the Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, OVID, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and the CINAHL database. Only English-language articles were identified during the search. Using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, version 2, two researchers screened the articles, collected information on study characteristics, and appraised risks of bias. The data were analyzed and descriptively presented with a narrative synthesis methodology involving the Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis (SWiM) reporting element applied in detail. The PROSPERO registration number of this study is CRD42023476932. Thirty-six clinical trials were included in the study; the included studies included a variety of 20 types of natural products. Honey and Curcuma longa were the most commonly assessed natural products. A total of 2,400 participants reported taking part in therapy with natural products for oral mucositis. Natural products demonstrated substantial efficacy in terms of influencing intensity, incidence, pain score, quality of life, and symptoms such as xerostomia and dysphagia. Except for manuka honey, most natural products were well accepted. Regarding the clinical trials’ risk of bias, 2 clinical trials (5.56%) had a high risk of bias, 17 studies (47.2%) had a low risk of bias, and 17 studies (47.2%) were rated with “some concern.” Natural remedies work well as alternate treatments for managing oral mucositis caused by radiation therapy. However, additional clinical trials are still needed. The safety of these conventional medications as well as their effectiveness and safety when used in combination with other conventional or naturopathic therapies should be fully examined.","author":"Wen Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5c07a95f251a53724893cd296ae9493551845b620f185fb3c1a943ee8a54ca1d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
