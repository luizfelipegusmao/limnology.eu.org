{"title":"Prominin-1 Knockdown Causes RPE Degeneration in a Mouse Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0669/v1","date":1728532349000,"content":"There are currently no effective treatments for retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell loss in atrophic AMD (aAMD). However, our research on Prom1, a known structural protein in photoreceptors (PRs), has revealed its distinct role in RPE and offers promising insights. While pathogenic Prom1 mutations have been linked to macular diseases with RPE atrophy, the broader physiological impact of dysfunctional Prom1 in RPE loss is unclear. We have shown that Prom1 plays a crucial role in regulating autophagy and cellular homeostasis in human and mouse RPE (mRPE) cells in vitro. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of its in vivo expression and function in mRPE remains to be elucidated. To characterize Prom1 expression in RPE in situ, we used RNAscope assays and immunogold electron microscopy. Our use of chromogenic and fluorescent RNAscope assays in albino and C57BL/6J mice retinal sections has revealed Prom1 mRNA expression in perinuclear regions in mRPE in situ. Immunogold imaging showed Prom1 expression in RPE mitochondria. To confirm Prom1 expression in RPE, we interrogated human RPE single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets using an online resource, Spectacle. Our analysis showed Prom1 expression in human RPE. To investigate Prom1's function in RPE homeostasis, we performed RPE-specific Prom1-knockdown (KD) using subretinal injections of AAV2/1.CMV.saCas9.U6.Prom1gRNA in male and female mice. Our data show that RPE-specific Prom1-KD in vivo resulted in abnormal RPE morphology, sub-retinal fluid accumulation, and secondary PR loss. These changes were associated with patchy RPE cell death and reduced a-wave amplitude, indicating retinal degeneration. Our findings underscore the central role of Prom1 in cell-autonomous mRPE homeostasis. The implications of Prom1-KD in causing aAMD-like RPE defects and retinal degeneration in a mouse model are significant and could lead to novel treatments for aAMD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d152cd02aea45461324ff19d49e4a3e8e2b174d8825ad1e60e1795a20f0e7713","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
