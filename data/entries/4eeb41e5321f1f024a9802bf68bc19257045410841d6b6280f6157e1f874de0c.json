{"title":"Extrusion modification of prolamins from distiller's grains to facilitate the construction of biopolymer films","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13391?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Distiller's grains (DGs), which are rich in natural ingredients such as prolamins, are often used as low-value feed or discarded directly, resulting in great environmental pollution and resource waste. Prolamins from DGs (PDGs) were found to be a potential material for the construction of biopolymer films due to their good film-forming properties. In this study, extrusion processing was conducted to modify the physicochemical and structural properties of PDGs to facilitate the construction of biopolymer films with superior characteristics.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Results indicated that extrusion led to improved solubility (17.91% to 39.95%) and increased disulfide bonds (1.46 to 6.13 μmol g<sup>−1</sup>) in PDGs. The total and sulfur amino acid contents of extruded PDGs were increased by 13.26% and 38.83%, respectively. New aggregation patterns were formed after extrusion according to the results of scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Extrusion resulted in reduced surface hydrophobicity of PDGs (10 972 to 3632), sufficient evidence for which could be also found from structure analyses of PDGs. Finally, PDGs extruded at 110 °C were found to facilitate the forming of biopolymer films with superior mechanical properties, water resistance and thermal stability.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>Physicochemical and structural properties of PDGs were effectively modified by extrusion processing, and extrusion modification of PDGs could be a great way to facilitate the construction of biopolymer films with superior characteristics. It could provide more possibilities to extend the applications of DGs to alleviate the problems of environmental pollution and resource waste. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yao Liu, \nRuoyun Yuan, \nLijun Jiang, \nMingming Qi, \nHongjun Li, \nShanfeng Chen, \nChengye Ma, \nChenjie Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"4eeb41e5321f1f024a9802bf68bc19257045410841d6b6280f6157e1f874de0c","category":"Environment"}
