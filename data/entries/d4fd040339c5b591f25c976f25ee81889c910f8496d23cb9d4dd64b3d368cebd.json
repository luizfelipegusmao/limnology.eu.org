{"title":"Persistent hypertension among postpartum women with comorbid HIV and preeclampsia in Zambia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309915","date":1725458400000,"content":"<p>by Moses Mukosha, Abigail Hatcher, Mwansa Ketty Lubeya, Innocent Maposa, Benjamin H. Chi, Wilbroad Mutale</p>\r\nBackground <p>Persistent hypertension is common after preeclampsia and is causally tied to later cardiovascular risks. This study examined whether being HIV-infected and on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with persistent postpartum hypertension among women diagnosed with preeclampsia.</p> Methods <p>We conducted a six-month prospective cohort study at Kanyama and Women and Newborn hospitals from January 01, 2022, to June 30, 2023, among 190 women diagnosed with preeclampsia (59 HIV-positive, 131 HIV-negative). Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected at delivery, six weeks, three months and six months after giving birth. Persistent hypertension was diagnosed if a participant presented with elevated blood pressure ≥140mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90mmHg and/or taking medication for hypertension at the study visit. We used a generalized estimating equation to describe the relationship between treated HIV and persistent hypertension six months following delivery.</p> Results <p>We retained 136 participants (71.6%) to six months postpartum, at a median age of 30 years. Overall, persistent hypertension at six weeks, three months, and six months postpartum was common (37.4%, 17.1% and 16.9%, respectively). Six-week postpartum prevalence was higher in the HIV group than HIV-negative group (54.6% vs 28.8%, p&lt;0.001), with no measurable difference at three months (24.3% vs 13.2%, p = 0.145) or six months (18.2% vs 16.3%, p = 0.787). Multivariable analysis demonstrates higher odds (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.09–2.60) of persistent hypertension among the HIV+treatment group than HIV-negative counterparts after accounting for age, body mass index and time since delivery.</p> Conclusion <p>We demonstrate an elevated risk of persistent hypertension among postpartum women with comorbid preeclampsia and treated HIV. Peripartum patients in HIV-endemic settings may benefit from timely detection of hypertension and treatment interventions to improve health outcomes.</p>","author":"Moses Mukosha","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d4fd040339c5b591f25c976f25ee81889c910f8496d23cb9d4dd64b3d368cebd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
