{"title":"Effect of partial substitution of complex phosphates with sodium bicarbonate on aggregation, conformation and gel properties of beef‐pork‐chicken complex myofibrillar proteins","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13559?af=R","date":1714134908000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Complex phosphates (CP) can improve the physicochemical properties and gelation properties of myofibrillar fibrous protein (MP) in mixed meat products, but excessive intake of phosphates over a long period of time is harmful to health. This study investigated the effects of partial or complete substitution of CP with sodium bicarbonate (SB) on the physicochemical properties and gel properties of beef-pork-chicken mixed myofibrillar protein (BPC-MP), to evaluate the feasibility of this method in reducing the amount of phosphate in mixed meat products.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Under the optimal substitution conditions, the turbidity of BPC-MP was reduced by 37.8%, the net negative potential was increased by 28.9%, and the modulus of elasticity (G') was increased. The tertiary structure indexes of protein (including fluorescence intensity, surface hydrophobicity and active thiol content) were significantly changed, while the α-helix and β-turn angle contents in the secondary structure of protein were significantly increased. In addition, the water retention ability and strength of gel were also improved, which were increased by 20.7% and 42.6%, respectively. The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the SB substitution group had a more compact and ordered microstructure.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The results showed that partial substitution of CP with SB reduced the amount of phosphate added to BPC-MP and had a positive effect on the physicochemical and gel properties of BPC-MP.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
