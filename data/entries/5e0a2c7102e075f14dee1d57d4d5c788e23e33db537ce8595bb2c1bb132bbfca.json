{"title":"Can we rely on drought‐ending “miracles” in the Colorado River Basin?","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.13204?af=R","date":1713242393000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Unexpected and large spring precipitation events in the Colorado River Basin (CRB) that significantly alleviated an otherwise severe water shortage have been observed for over a century, such as the “Miracle May” of 2015. Although these events are often termed as “drought-busting” or “miracle events” by water managers and the media, they have not been extensively researched or characterized. In this collaborative study with water managers across the CRB, we propose a definition for these hard-to-predict, ultra-high precipitation events occurring during the late-snow or snowmelt season. This characterization provides a framework for quantifying the frequency and intensity of extreme dry-to-wet springtime transitions. Despite limitations of climate model simulations due to uncertainties and the inhomogeneous qualities, our findings suggest that such transitions may become less frequent and less intense in a warming climate. In view of the potentially wetter but less-snowy climate in the basin, the need for future research to more quantitatively assess these “miracle events” is emphasized.</p>","author":"Binod Pokharel, \nKripa Akila Jagannathan, \nS.‐Y.
