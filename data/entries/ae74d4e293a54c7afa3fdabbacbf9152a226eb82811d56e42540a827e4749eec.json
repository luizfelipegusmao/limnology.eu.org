{"title":"Aw, snap! How reversible protein lipidation helps plants deal with sudden temperature dives","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/7/2461/7644966?rss=1","date":1712880000000,"content":"<span>Coming from a country of evergreen vegetation, I am fascinated by the daily changes occurring when spring finally arrives here in Germany after a leafless winter. Each year, I notice that after a few warm days in early spring, the flowers start blooming and green shoots erupt from the earth. Inevitably, though, the cold returns, and the tender new growth is exposed to frosts and freezing temperatures. Yet the plants live on. How do plants achieve such resilience to abrupt temperature plummets? Despite being an active area of research, many of the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating cold stress responses in plants remain unknown.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"ae74d4e293a54c7afa3fdabbacbf9152a226eb82811d56e42540a827e4749eec","category":"Environment"}
