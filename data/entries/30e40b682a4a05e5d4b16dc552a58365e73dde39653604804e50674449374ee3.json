{"title":"SC-AOF: A Sliding Camera and Asymmetric Optical Flow-Based Blending Method for Image Stitching","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1791/v1","date":1714285341000,"content":"Parallax processing and structure preservation has long been important and challenging tasks in image stitching. In this paper, an image stitching method based on sliding camera to eliminate perspective deformation and asymmetric optical flow to solve parallax is proposed. By maintaining the viewpoint of two input images in the mosaic non-overlapping area and creating a virtual camera by interpolation in the overlapping area, the viewpoint is gradually transformed from one to another image view-point so as to complete the smooth transition of the two image viewpoints and reduce perspective deformation. Two coarsely aligned warped images are generated with the help of a global projection plane. After that, the optical flow propagation and gradient descent method are used to quickly calculate the bidirectional asymmetric optical flow between the two warped images, and the optical flow-based method is used to further align the two warped images to reduce parallax. In the image blending, the softmax function and registration error are used to adjust the width of the blending area, further eliminating ghosting and reduce parallax. Finally, the comparative experiments show that our method can effectively eliminate perspective deformation, reduce misalignment, and save running time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30e40b682a4a05e5d4b16dc552a58365e73dde39653604804e50674449374ee3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
