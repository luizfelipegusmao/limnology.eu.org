Even though the diffraction peaks, which represent the average lattice, indicate perfect periodicity, locally the lattice is distorted. Also, elements are not fully randomly distributed, but locally they show chemical preferences, resulting in the compositional (chemical) short-range order (CSRO). These local variations have major effects on the properties of the HEAs, including the mechanical properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9c7748e8eb325ecdad4146a437e08eb10e4af75e0111f7e5a866b3bd243a6404","category":"Environment"}
