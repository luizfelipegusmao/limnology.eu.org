The shapes of the density and hazard rate functions manifest desirable shapes, making the MKTL distribution suitable for modeling data with different characteristics at the unit interval. Twelve different estimation methods are utilized to estimate the distribution parameters, and Monte Carlo simulation experiments are executed to assess the performance of the methods. The simulation results suggest that the maximum likelihood method is the superior method. The usefulness of the new distribution is illustrated by utilizing three data sets, and its performance is juxtaposed with that of other competing models. The findings affirm the superiority of the MKTL distribution over the other candidate models. Applying the developed quantile regression model using the new distribution disclosed that it offers a competitive fit over other existing regression models.","author":"Safar M.
