However, along the coast of the Mexican Central Pacific (MCP), the population affiliation of humpback whales is uncertain. Some studies have concluded that the MCP whales are part of S-MX/CEA, while others have suggested that the MCP may represent an overlap zone between the two wintering aggregations. In this study, data from 354 biopsy samples were collected over a 12-year period, to provide insight from genetic information into the affiliation of MCP whales to and the boundaries between the wintering aggregations. Using mitochondrial control region sequences, we found that the majority (73%) of MCP whales are part of MX, but that the boundary between the two wintering aggregations may shift latitudinally depending on environmental conditions. The high haplotypic (<i>h</i> ± <i>SD</i> = 0.859 ± 0.0138) and nucleotide diversity (π ± <i>SD</i> = 0.0145 ± 0.0075) of the MCP whales are also consistent with our sample, including animals from both wintering aggregations. More research is needed to better describe the ranges of the MX and S-MX/CEA wintering aggregations to ensure their successful conservation and management.</p>","author":"Myriam Llamas‐González, \nChristian D.
