{"title":"The response of Midknight Valencia oranges to ethephon degreening varies in the turning and regreening stages","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13781?af=R","date":1722339255000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Late-ripening citrus plays an important role in the stability of the global citrus industry. However, the regreening phenomenon in Valencia oranges impacts the peel color and commercial value. Ethylene degreening is an effective technique to improve the color of citrus fruits, but this effect may be delayed in regreened oranges. To better clarify this phenomenon, plastid morphology, pigment and phytohormone content in ethephon-degreened Midknight Valencia oranges harvested in different stages were evaluated.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Results showed that in fruits harvested at the turning stage, ethephon degreening treatment induced a chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition, and chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid accumulation were accelerated. Conversely, in fruits harvested at the regreening stage, the changes in plastid morphology were minimal, with delayed changes in chlorophyll and carotenoids. Genes related to ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathways supported these responses. Variations in endogenous auxin, jasmonic acid, abscisic acid and gibberellins could partially explain this phenomenon.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The response of Midknight Valencia oranges to ethephon degreening was delayed in the regreening stage, possibly due to the dynamic variations in endogenous phytohormones.
