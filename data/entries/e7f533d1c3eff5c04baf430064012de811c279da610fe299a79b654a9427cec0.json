{"title":"The relationship between modifiable lifestyle behaviours and self-reported health in children and adolescents in the United Kingdom","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303575","date":1715868000000,"content":"<p>by Jason Moran, Gavin Sandercock, Brandon S. Shaw, Paul Freeman, Catherine Kerr, Ina Shaw</p>\r\n\r\nObesity, along with its associated health issues, is closely tied to lifestyle habits. While certain elements affecting childhood health, such as genetics and ethnicity, are beyond individuals’ control, there exists modifiable lifestyle behaviours that can facilitate healthier living. This study employed multiple regression analysis to investigate the relationship between specific modifiable lifestyle behaviours and self-reported health. The independent variables considered included days of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), fruit and vegetable consumption, breakfast frequency, school night sleep duration, and non-school night sleep duration. These variables were chosen for their practical modifiability within participants’ daily lives. The analysis revealed a highly significant overall model (F(13,11363) = 191.117, p &lt; .001), explaining 17.9% of the variance in self-reported health. Notably, higher MVPA levels were associated with improved self-reported health (B = 0.136 to 0.730, p &lt; .001). Additionally, regular breakfast consumption and increased fruit and vegetable intake exhibited positive associations with self-reported health (B = 0.113 to 0.377, p &lt; .001), while girls reported lower self-reported health (B = -0.079, p &lt; .001). School night sleep duration was positively linked to self-reported health (B = 0.071, p &lt; .001). Furthermore, a dose-response relationship between MVPA, dietary habits, and health was identified. These findings hold substantial potential for public health campaigns to promote healthy behaviours and prevent chronic diseases in young individuals. It is imperative to emphasise that all the variables considered in this study are readily modifiable aspects of individuals’ lives, offering a promising avenue for personal health and well-being enhancement.","author":"Jason Moran","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e7f533d1c3eff5c04baf430064012de811c279da610fe299a79b654a9427cec0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
