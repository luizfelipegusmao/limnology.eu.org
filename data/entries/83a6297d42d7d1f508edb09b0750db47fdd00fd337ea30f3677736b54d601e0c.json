However, to ensure sustainable fisheries, both biological aspects of resource protection and fishing operation efficiency must be considered. This study aimed to determine the ideal mesh size for trap fishing of marbled flounder (<i>Pseudopleuronectes yokohamae</i>) in Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea, by using biological and economic factors for sustainable fisheries management. We sampled fish caught in traps of varying mesh sizes (35, 50, 65, 80, and 100 mm) and developed two models based on fish maturity, bycatch ratio, and CPUE. Model 1 used a maturity criterion of 17.8 cm, and Model 2 used the legal minimum length limit of 20 cm. Net selectivity curves indicated that the optimal mesh size ranged 50–65 mm based only on a minimum mature body length of 17.8 cm. In contrast, the optimal mesh size based on both biological and economic factors ranged 57.5–90 mm. Our findings could guide policymakers in enhancing marble flounder population management strategies through policy adjustments in mesh size and gear restrictions.</p>","author":"Myungsung Koo, \nInyeong Kwon","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"83a6297d42d7d1f508edb09b0750db47fdd00fd337ea30f3677736b54d601e0c","category":"Environment"}
