{"title":"Exploring Inelastic Differential Phase Contrast Imaging for Inner-shell Ionization","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.905/7720155?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Structure determination of condensed matter samples using differential phase contrast (DPC) or center-of-mass (CoM) imaging, where variations in the CoM of the diffraction pattern map the (projected) electric field of the sample at atomic scales, has been studied extensively and well understood quantitatively [<a href=\"#ozae044.905-B1\">1-3</a>] for elastic scattering within the phase-object approximation. One approach to obtaining CoM images is 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D STEM), in which 2D diffraction patterns are acquired on a fast readout pixel detector at each probe position in a 2D raster scan. Placing the pixel detector behind an energy filter allows for the formation of a diffraction pattern using electrons of a particular energy loss, as depicted in Fig. 1A, and thus an inelastic counterpart of 4D STEM. Haas and Koch obtained inelastic CoM images at energy losses corresponding to inner-shell ionization and showed that they resemble elastic CoM images [<a href=\"#ozae044.905-B4\">4</a>]. Here, we explore this novel imaging mode using simulation to understand the contrast observed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5afa3b207d3fbbf08fca5921ebd79174361196010f068434a97a87c03b5d9729","category":"Environment"}
