{"title":"Telomere Length as a Biomarker of Smoking-Induced Cellular Damage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0545/v1","date":1710086138000,"content":"Smoking is a pervasive global health concern associated with a myriad of diseases, but its impact on cellular aging, particularly in relation to telomeres, is increasingly recognized. Telomeres, protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, play a crucial role in maintaining genomic integrity. This review critically examines the existing evidence on the association between smoking and telomere atrophy, exploring the molecular mechanisms involved and the implications for accelerated aging and heightened disease risk. The comprehensive analysis encompasses both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, elucidating potential gender and age disparities. Insights into the molecular pathways linking smoking to telomere shortening are discussed, along with the broader implications for public health. The review concludes by outlining potential interventions and suggesting future research directions in this critical area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75c69d02b41aabce05879d0369ba8a3d3cd9453eba6efc608b88326959c0267c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
