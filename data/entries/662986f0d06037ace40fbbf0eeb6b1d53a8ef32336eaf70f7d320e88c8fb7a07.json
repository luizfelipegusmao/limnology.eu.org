{"title":"A Survey on Neuromorphic Architectures for Running Artificial Intelligence Algorithms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0130/v1","date":1719849318000,"content":"Neuromorphic computing, a brain inspired non-Von Neumann computing system, addresses the challenges posed by the Mooreâ€™s law memory wall phenomenon. It has the capability to increasingly enhance performance while maintaining power efficiency. Neuromorphic chip architecture requirements vary depending on the application and optimizing it for large-scale applications remains to be a challenge. Neuromorphic chips are programmed using spiking neural networks which provide them with important properties such as parallelism, asynchronism, and on-device learning. Widely used spiking neuron models include the Hodgkin-Huxley Model, Izhikevich model, integrate-and-fire model and spike response model. Hardware implementation platforms of the chip follow three approaches: analog, digital, or a combination of both. Each platform can be implemented using various memory topologies which interconnects with the learning mechanism. Current neuromorphic computing systems typically use the unsupervised learning spike timing-dependent plasticity algorithms. However, algorithms such as voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity have the potential to enhance performance. This review summarizes the potential neuromorphic chip architecture specifications and highlights which applications they are suitable for.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"662986f0d06037ace40fbbf0eeb6b1d53a8ef32336eaf70f7d320e88c8fb7a07","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
