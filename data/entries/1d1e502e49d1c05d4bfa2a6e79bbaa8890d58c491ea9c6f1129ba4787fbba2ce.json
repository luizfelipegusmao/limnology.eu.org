{"title":"Therapeutic Opportunities in Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0069/v1","date":1717409598000,"content":"Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a heterogeneous group of T-cell lymphomas characterised by high relapse rates and no curative treatments unless the allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The main complication in the management of this kind of malignancy is the variability that characterises the genetic and clinical features among the CTCL subtypes. JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and NF-kB are those signalling pathways that are found altered in CTCL and that are responsible for promoting both T-cell malignancy and the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. Thus, targeting key players of these pathways can be an advantageous therapeutic option for CTCL. In this review, we aim to summarise the different approaches that precisely inhibit the kinases of each cited signalling. JAK inhibitors seem to be the most promising kinase inhibitors for CTCL. However, adverse events have been reported especially in patients with immunosuppression or an underlying autoimmune disease. More studies are needed, especially clinical trials, to investigate the benefits of these drugs for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d1e502e49d1c05d4bfa2a6e79bbaa8890d58c491ea9c6f1129ba4787fbba2ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
