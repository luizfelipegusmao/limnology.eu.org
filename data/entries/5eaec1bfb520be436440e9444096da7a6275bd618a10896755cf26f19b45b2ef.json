{"title":"Structural Decomposition of the Passivity-Based Control System of Wind-Solar Power Generating and Hybrid Battery-Supercapacitor Energy Storage Complex","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0021/v1","date":1727936189000,"content":"Wind-solar power generating and hybrid battery-supercapacitor energy storage complex is used for autonomous power supply of consumers in remote areas. This work uses passivity-based control (PBC) for this complex in accordance with the accepted energy management strategy (EMS). Structural and parametric synthesis of the overall PBC system was carried out that was accompanied by a significant amount of research. In order to simplify this synthesis, a structural decomposition of the overall dynamic system of the object, which was described by a system of differential equations of the seventh order, into three subsystems was applied. These subsystems are a wind turbine, a PV plant and a hybrid battery-supercapacitor system. For each of the subsystems, it is quite simple to synthesize the control influence formers, which locally perform the tasks set by the EMS. The results obtained by computer simulation of the overall and decomposed systems demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in simplifying synthesis and debugging procedures of complex multiphysical systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5eaec1bfb520be436440e9444096da7a6275bd618a10896755cf26f19b45b2ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
