{"title":"Photodynamic Diagnosis and Therapy in Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1397/v1","date":1713775922000,"content":"Bladder cancer (BC) possesses distinct molecular profiles that influence progression depending on its biological nature and delivered treatment intensity. Muscle-invasive BC (MIBC) and non-MIBC (NMIBC) demonstrate great intrinsic heterogeneity regarding different prognoses, survival, progression, and treatment outcomes. Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is the standard of care in treating NMIBC and serves both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, despite the prevalent recurrence and progression among many patients. In particular, flat urothelial car-cinoma in situ and urothelial carcinoma with lamina propria invasion are the major precursors of MIBC. A new‐generation photosensitizer, 5‐Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), demonstrates high tumor specificity by illuminating the tumor lesion with a specific wavelength of light to produce fluorescence, and has been studied for photodynamic diagnosis to detect precise tumor areas by TURBT. Additionally, it has been applied for treatment by producing its cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, as well as screening for urological carcinomas by excreting porphyrin in the blood and urine. Moreover, 5-ALA may contribute to screening before and after TURBT in NMIBC. Here, we summarize the updated evidence and ongoing research on photodynamic technology for NMIBC, providing insight into the potential for improving patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ea7eb2d7edbc59bc4d50728ed1e701c00cb62879245527fc80fbbc52a85a741","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
