However, the global patterns and drivers of relative contributions of these N cycling processes to soil or sediment nitrate reduction remain unknown, limiting our understanding of the global N balance and management. Here, we compiled a global dataset of 1570 observations from a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We found that denitrification contributed up to 66.1% of total nitrate reduction globally, being significantly greater in estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Anammox and DNRA could account for 12.7% and 21.2% of total nitrate reduction, respectively. The contribution of denitrification to nitrate reduction increased with longitude, while the contribution of anammox and DNRA decreased. The local environmental factors controlling the relative contributions of the three N cycling processes to nitrate reduction included the concentrations of soil organic carbon, ammonium, nitrate, and ferrous iron. Our results underline the dominant role of denitrification over anammox and DNRA in ecosystem nitrate transformation, which is crucial to improving the current global soil N cycle model and achieving sustainable N management.</p>","author":"Danli Deng, \nGang He, \nBangjing Ding, \nWenzhi Liu, \nZhengjian Yang, \nLin Ma","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"1309d9d311f006a3f5c48513dccd651c3abeaa8200fca72e429b235997b2add7","category":"Environment"}
