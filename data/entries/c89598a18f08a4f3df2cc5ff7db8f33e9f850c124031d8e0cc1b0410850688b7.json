{"title":"Implementation of the Dry Maturation Method and the Sous-Vide Cooking Technique in Bone-In Beef for the Creation of Gastronomic Products","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1581/v1","date":1719221983000,"content":"The science behind the curing process and the sous-vide cooking technique has advanced significantly in recent years. Variables such as temperature, time, and microbial growth, among others, have a substantial impact on the preparation and acceptance of culinary creations. This study focused on evaluating the dry aging method and the sous-vide cooking technique applied to various cuts of bone-in beef (Rack, Tomahawk, New York, and Rib Eye) subjected to different aging periods (28, 32, 42, and 45 days) under controlled temperature and storage conditions. The resulting samples underwent microbiological analysis after the curing method and the sous-vide cooking process, and they were also used in different culinary preparations to measure their degree of acceptability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c89598a18f08a4f3df2cc5ff7db8f33e9f850c124031d8e0cc1b0410850688b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
