{"title":"Pivotal Role of Artificial Intelligence in Cardiovascular Health: Highlights from the Late Breaking Trials at the AHA Scientific Sessions 2023","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1471/v2","date":1711445037000,"content":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality. Traditional approaches to diagnosing and treating CVDs often involve interpretation, which can lead to errors. The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning aids the management of CVDs. AI examines amounts of data and identifies patterns offering solutions for disease detection, risk prediction, and patient care. The American Heart Association's 2023 Scientific Sessions (AHA23) showcased studies that highlight AIs potential to revolutionize cardiac healthcare. This article presents a review of these cutting-edge studies exploring how AI is applied in health, the outcomes of these applications, and their implications for clinical practice. The insights gained from this review will contribute to the discussion on AI's role in healthcare and its capacity to enhance outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38b75c118b4f1aa9ed81e684d021fbe86ac90f6e56e008875b5958e5fd75ddb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
