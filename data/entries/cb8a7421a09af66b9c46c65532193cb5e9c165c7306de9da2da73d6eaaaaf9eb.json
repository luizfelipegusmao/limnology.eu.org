{"title":"It is child’s play: Caregiver and playworker perspectives on a community park-based unstructured play program","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311293","date":1727704800000,"content":"<p>by Gavin R.

Doyle-Baker</p>\r\n\r\nUnstructured play is characterized as play that is child initiated and determined, allowing children the freedom and flexibility to engage in activities, including taking risks, without adult intervention. However, playworkers and caregivers are important mediators of children’s unstructured play. Studies have investigated playworker and caregiver perspectives regarding play, yet few have done so within the context of community based unstructured play interventions. Our qualitative study explored knowledge, attitudes and perspectives regarding play among playworkers (“play ambassadors”) and caregivers exposed to a community based unstructured play intervention implemented in Calgary, Canada. The intervention aimed to encourage unstructured and risky play in local parks via loose parts. Between August and October 2020, ten caregivers and four play ambassadors completed individual semi-structured interviews. Using thematic analysis, we identified four overarching themes. <i>The importance of play</i> (theme 1) reflected play ambassador and caregiver perspectives about how unstructured and risky play promoted health and development and offered opportunities for enjoyment, exploration, and social interaction. <i>Perceptions of the play environment</i> (theme 2) reflected play ambassador and caregiver experiences of the play hubs including the role of loose parts in shaping play. <i>Challenges and triumphs in promoting play</i> (theme 3) reflected play ambassador experiences in facilitating play as well as interactions between caregivers and play ambassadors. <i>Play hub impacts on the community</i> (theme 4) reflected play ambassador and caregiver perspectives on the role of the play hubs in facilitating social interactions and community engagement. Play Ambassadors and caregivers shared common beliefs about the benefits of unstructured and risky play and about the play hubs affects on facilitating social interactions. Community based unstructured play interventions may support play and promote a sense of community.","author":"Gavin R.
