{"title":"ADHD Neuroanatomy and Brain Wave Characteristics: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1975/v1","date":1724841540000,"content":"Abstract: This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the anatomical structure of the human brain, highlighting its key components and their functional significance. The brain is the central organ of the nervous system, responsible for controlling and coordinating various bodily functions. The article begins with an introduction to the brain's gross anatomy, including the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and diencephalon. It then delves into the detailed microstructure of the brain, discussing neurons, glial cells, and the complex network of neural connections. The review also explores the functional organization of the brain, emphasizing the roles of different regions such as the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. It discusses the importance of the limbic system in emotional processing and the basal ganglia in motor control. Additionally, the article covers the brain's vascular system and the blood-brain barrier, which are crucial for maintaining the brain's homeostasis. Recent advancements in neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have significantly enhanced our understanding of brain anatomy and function. These techniques have enabled researchers to map brain activity in real-time, providing insights into cognitive processes and neurological disorders. The article concludes by discussing the implications of understanding brain anatomy for clinical practice, including the diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions. It also highlights areas for future research, emphasizing the need for further exploration of the brain's structural and functional complexity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"01a120bdd3785c856d80649fdab2671b30513dd1f82e06698a2f3303d2420e44","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
