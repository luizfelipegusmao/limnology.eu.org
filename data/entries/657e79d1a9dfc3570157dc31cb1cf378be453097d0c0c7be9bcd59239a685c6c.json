{"title":"Cardiovascular health of women 10 to 20 years after placenta-related pregnancy diseases considering the possible effect of pentaerythrityl tetranitrate treatment during pregnancy on long-term maternal cardiovascular health (PAVA study)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309177","date":1729000800000,"content":"<p>by Charlotte Lößner, Anna Multhaup, Laura Bäz, Thomas Lehmann, Yvonne Heimann, Ekkehard Schleußner, Marcus Franz, Tanja Groten</p>\r\nBackground <p>Women developing preeclampsia (PE) or fetal growth restriction (FGR) during pregnancy are at higher risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) later in life. We aimed to analyse cardiovascular health of women 10–20 years after affected pregnancies in comparison to women after uneventful pregnancies. In addition, we assessed a potential long-term effect of the NO-donor pentaerythrityl tetranitrate (PETN).</p> Methods <p>Women 10–20 years after severe PE, including women receiving PETN during pregnancy and matched controls were recruited and assessed for baseline clinical data and cardiovascular function by transthoracic echocardiography, VICORDER and USCOM. SPSS was used for statistical analysis.</p> Results <p>53 participants after PE/FGR (13 with former PETN intake) and 51 controls were recruited for follow-up at an average of 14 years after index pregnancies. Compared to controls, women after PE/FGR had a significantly higher incidence of arterial hypertension (13.7% vs. 41.5%, p&lt;0.001), and were more likely to be hypertensive (41.2% vs. 67.30%, p = 0.008). There were no differences in cardiovascular function observed. Affected women with PETN intake during pregnancy showed lower mean values for right atrial area and ventricle in comparison to controls and also to affected women without former medication.</p> Conclusions <p>In conclusion, our study results confirm that the risk of CVD is increased in women after PE/FGR compared to women after uneventful pregnancies. Contrary to our expectations, no major cardiovascular changes were observed in our cohort 10–20 years post pregnancy. The observed differences found in right heart dimensions were within reference ranges, and should be interpreted with caution.</p>","author":"Charlotte Lößner","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"657e79d1a9dfc3570157dc31cb1cf378be453097d0c0c7be9bcd59239a685c6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
