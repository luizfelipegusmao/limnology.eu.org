{"title":"Land suitability analysis in monocentric post-socialist city: Case of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308762","date":1723730400000,"content":"<p>by Galmandakh Boldbaatar, Gantulga Gombodorj, Dorligjav Donorov, Robert Andriambololonaharisoamalala, Myagmarjav Indra, Myagmartseren Purevtseren</p>\r\n\r\nUrban expansion has been rapidly increasing and is projected to be tripled in 2030 in worldwide. The impact of urbanization has adverse effects on the environment and economic development. Residential lands consist of almost one-third of the urban area and heavily affect the city’s inhabitants. The capital of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, has been significantly expanded, particularly in the urban periphery where poor living conditions and a lack of essential urban services were identified. The paper aims to conduct a suitability analysis of residential areas in Ulaanbaatar city based on three main categories (livability, affordability, and accessibility) of fifteen criteria using the fuzzy logic. Through the study, we have identified some potential suitable residential areas for further development, such as apartment residential area located in the southern part of the city and four low-rise ger areas were distributed along major transport corridors. Moreover, the results indicated that the spatial structure of the whole town might be in transition to a polycentric pattern. However, a concentric ring pattern in the ‘city’s periphery displayed a concerning uncontrolled ger area expansion, which may increase low living conditions in the area. This study recommends better urban sprawl control policies and more property market investment in the ger area to ensure sustainable development goals in Ulaanbaatar.","author":"Galmandakh Boldbaatar","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"57cc65aebee6adf9146160e972fe2eb7e798a8f0fb967ded11fe46cd3f7c2c1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
