{"title":"Digital Cloud Defense: Fortifying Your Data Against Cyber Threats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0353/v1","date":1725441840000,"content":"This paper addresses the growing concerns surrounding cloud computing security and highlights key strategies for ensuring the privacy and protection of data in information-critical industries. Cloud computing has revolutionized the field of information technology, providing convenience and efficiency in data processing. However, it has also brought to light significant challenges in terms of data security and privacy. Given the rise in cyber threats and the potential risks associated with storing sensitive information on cloud servers, critical industries such as healthcare and banking have been hesitant to adopt cloud computing as a trusted solution for their data needs. This work examines the specific security concerns that these industries face and proposes measures to mitigate them. Further, the paper explores the barriers that hinder the adoption of cloud computing in critical industries and offers solutions to address these concerns.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d71ecffb5ad3482bde06a95a184eb9a1ff9d6c3b790785cb2900b60b1e6a5be7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
