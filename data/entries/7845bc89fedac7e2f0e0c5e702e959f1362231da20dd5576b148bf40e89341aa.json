{"title":"512 Divergence of the sow vaginal microbiome based on fertility status","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/145/7757200?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The need for alternative biomarkers of reproductive potential in the pork industry is apparent as the current selection approach for sow fertility is not keeping up with the improvement of other production-related traits. To date, the vaginal microbiome has been overlooked as a source of potential biomarkers of sow fertility status. We aimed to elucidate a possible divergence of the vaginal microbiome between sows of differing fertility status and identify possible microbial biomarkers that classify the fertility potential of a sow. Microbial DNA was extracted from vaginal microbiome samples originating from highly reproductive sows (HRP, n = 41) with the number of piglets born alive â‰¥ 13 or infertile sows (INF, n = 22), that failed to become pregnant after two rounds of consecutive artificial insemination. Our 16S rRNA sequencing results revealed significant (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) beta diversity divergence at the family and genus taxonomic levels between HR<span>P</span> and INF vaginal communities. INF vaginal communities displayed significantly greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) alpha diversity at both the family and genus levels and had a significantly (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) greater number of unique OTUs identified at the genus level. The composition of the vaginal microbiome diverges between HRP and INF sows, with INF sows experiencing a disruption of their communities via the colonization of opportunistic pathogens reducing the abundance of normal microbiota seen in HRP. The genera <span>Streptococcus</span>, <span>Lachnospiraceae</span> XPB1014 group, <span>Staphylococcus</span> and <span>Treponema</span> were selected to test as potential biomarkers due to their univariate significance, contribution to partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and selection in a recursive feature elimination model (RFE). The resultant support-vector machine model was diagnostic (achieving an ROC-AUC = 0.86), supporting the selected biomarkers as diagnostic markers for sow fertility status. Overall, there was an apparent shift from a normal vaginal microbiota in HRP sows to a dysbiotic vaginal microbiota in INF sows dominated by potentially pathogenic, more anaerobic and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing microbiota that may play damaging and pro-inflammatory roles in the vaginal canal. <span>Lactobacillus</span>, known to be the dominant genus in a majority of healthy human vaginal microbiomes, was not the dominating genus in either INF or HRP vaginal microbiomes, suggesting the uniqueness of pig vaginal microbiomes. This also emphasizes the need for pig-specific vaginal microbiome research. Investigations regarding the application of the potential vaginal microbial biomarkers identified in this study to a large, novel population of sow and gilt vaginal microbiome samples to test their on-farm accuracy are underway. In addition, the mechanistic and physiologic role of SCFAs and the bacteria that produce them in the sow vaginal microbiome should be further investigated to understand how they may influence or be a product of fertility status.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"7845bc89fedac7e2f0e0c5e702e959f1362231da20dd5576b148bf40e89341aa","category":"Environment"}
