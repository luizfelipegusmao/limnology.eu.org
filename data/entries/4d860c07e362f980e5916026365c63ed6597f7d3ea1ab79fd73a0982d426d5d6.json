{"title":"Research on coupling coordination between construction industry innovation and region economic development in China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308127","date":1722866400000,"content":"<p>by Yong Xiang, Yonghua Chen, Ailing Wan, Yangyang Su, Renkai Xiong</p>\r\n\r\nIn numerous developing nations, challenges such as insufficient investment in innovation and limited capabilities for conversion impede the growth of the construction sector, thus affecting the overall economic well-being of these regions. This paper focuses on construction industry innovation (CII) and its correlation with region economic development (RED), providing valuable insights to overcome these challenges and promote sustainable economic advancement. This study references existing literature to devise an evaluation indicator system dedicated for CII and RED. It then proceeds with an empirical analysis of the integration and synergy between CII and the economic development across 31 Chinese provinces from 2012 to 2021. Furthermore, this paper employs ArcGIS and Geoda software to meticulously dissect the spatial distribution characteristics underlying this coordination. The main conclusions are succinctly summarized as follows: CII in China is intricately connected to RED, exhibiting a strong connection that diminishes from south to north. Nonetheless, the coordination level between these factors remains relatively low, with notable regional disparities, particularly from southeast to northwest. The primary obstacles to effective coordination are related to innovation input, output, and economic scale. Additionally, spatial correlation analysis demonstrates pronounced regional clustering, showing stability despite slight fluctuations over the study period. This research underscores the concept of coupling coordination between CII and RED, underpinned by scientific analytical methods. The outcomes provide a definitive guide for advancing the transformation and enhancement of the construction industry while promoting RED.","author":"Yong Xiang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4d860c07e362f980e5916026365c63ed6597f7d3ea1ab79fd73a0982d426d5d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
