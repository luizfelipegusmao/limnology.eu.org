{"title":"Age-Variant Configurations of Emotional Episodic Memory Evaluated by Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Network Graph Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2030/v1","date":1719567897000,"content":"Considering that emotional events diversify as one ages, this study formulates the Salient Episodic Memory Aggregation Hypothesis, which claims that aging induces homogenization of episodic memory and consequently increases the salience of emotional episodes. To test this hypothesis, the study focused on sadness episodic memory and conducted a web-based survey and a combined analysis consisting of natural language processing, machine learning, and network graph analysis. A sample of 2,954 adults aged between their 20s and over 70s participated in this study. They were asked to describe a sad event they had experienced and assess the psychological properties of the recalled episodes. After isolating and lemmatizing episodic words using natural language processing, vocabulary frequency was counted for each generation, and network graph analysis based on machine learning was performed to compare the structures of sadness episodes between generations. As a result, there were mainly two types of episodic words for which frequencies either declined or increased with age. The network structures of episodic words for the older generations possessed higher proximity (shortest path length) to higher concentrations of episodic words. These findings support the current hypothesis, indicating that the nature of sadness episodes differ between generations, and that older people have more aggregated episodic memory structures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"446fed3c0cdf779d30437638a405696aad25a2349e698f401d91c63e32d30f9a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
