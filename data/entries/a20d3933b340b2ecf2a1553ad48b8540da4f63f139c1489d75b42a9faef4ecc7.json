{"title":"Integrating Multimodal Generative AI and Blockchain for Enhancing Generative Design in the Early Phase of Architectural Design Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1437/v1","date":1721213909000,"content":"AI advances integrate generative design tools in architecture, providing architects with sophisticated design options. It enables the creation of intricate, high-performing projects by exploring diverse design possibilities with AI and algorithms. Generative AI and generative design empower architects to create better-performing, sustainable, and efficient design solutions and explore diverse design possibilities. This paper leverages multimodal generative AI to enhance design creativity by combining textual and visual inputs. Blockchain technology converts design metadata into NFTs, ensuring secure, authentic, and traceable data storage. The framework addresses data ownership, legal adherence, and client-architect collaboration and is entirely scalable for digital design authentication. This research exemplifies the pragmatic fusion of Generative AI and blockchain technology applied in architectural design for more transparent, secure, and effective results. This study provides a strategy that uses generative AI technologies to achieve an efficient and creative workflow in the early stages of architectural design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a20d3933b340b2ecf2a1553ad48b8540da4f63f139c1489d75b42a9faef4ecc7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
