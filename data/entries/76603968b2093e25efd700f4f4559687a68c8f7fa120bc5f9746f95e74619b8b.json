{"title":"Use of Microalgae-Derived Astaxanthin to Improve Cytoprotective Capacity in the Ileum of Heat-Induced Oxidative Stressed Broilers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2032/v1","date":1717067632000,"content":"The gastrointestinal tract has a pivotal role in nutrient absorption, immune function, and overall homeostasis. The ileum segment of the small intestine plays respective roles in nutrient breakdown and absorption. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of heat-induced oxidative stress and the potential mitigating effects of an astaxanthin antioxidant treatment on the ileum of broilers. By comparing the growth performance and gene expression profiles among three groups- thermal neutral, heat stress and heat stress with astaxanthin, under two temperature conditions of 21-22°C and 32-35°C, this research aims to elucidate the role of astaxanthin in supporting homeostasis and cellular protection in the ileum. Results showed both treatments under heat stress experienced reduced growth performance, while the group treated with astaxanthin showed a slightly lesser decline. Results further showed the astaxanthin treatment group significantly upregulated in the cytoprotective gene expression for HSF2, SOD2, GPX3, and TXN, as well as the upregulation of epithelial integrity genes, LOX, CLDN1 and MUC2. In conclusion, our experimental findings demonstrate upregulation of cytoprotective and epithelial integrity genes suggests astaxanthin may effectively enhance the cellular response to heat stress to mitigate oxidative damage, and contribute to cytoprotective capacity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76603968b2093e25efd700f4f4559687a68c8f7fa120bc5f9746f95e74619b8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
