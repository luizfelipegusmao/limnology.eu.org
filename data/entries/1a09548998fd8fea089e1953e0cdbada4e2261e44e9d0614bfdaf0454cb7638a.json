{"title":"The Ginkgo biloba microRNA160–ERF4 module participates in terpene trilactone biosynthesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1446/7618150?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Terpene trilactones (TTLs) are important secondary metabolites in ginkgo (<span>Ginkgo biloba</span>); however, their biosynthesis gene regulatory network remains unclear. Here, we isolated a <span>G. biloba</span> ethylene response factor 4 (GbERF4) involved in TTL synthesis. Overexpression of <span>GbERF4</span> in tobacco (<span>Nicotiana tabacum</span>) significantly increased terpenoid content and upregulated the expression of key enzyme genes (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase [<span>HMGR</span>], 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase [<span>HMGS</span>], 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase [<span>DXR</span>], 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase [<span>DXS</span>], acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase [<span>AACT</span>], and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase [<span>GGPPS</span>]) in the terpenoid pathway in tobacco, suggesting that GbERF4 functions in regulating the synthesis of terpenoids. The expression pattern analysis and previous microRNA (miRNA) sequencing showed that gb-miR160 negatively regulates the biosynthesis of TTLs. Transgenic experiments showed that overexpression of gb-miR160 could significantly inhibit the accumulation of terpenoids in tobacco. Targeted inhibition and dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed that gb-miR160 targets and negatively regulates <span>GbERF4</span>. Transient overexpression of <span>GbERF4</span> increased TTL content in <span>G. biloba</span>, and further transcriptome analysis revealed that <span>DXS</span>, <span>HMGS</span>, <span>CYP</span>s, and transcription factor genes were upregulated. In addition, yeast 1-hybrid and dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that GbERF4 could bind to the promoters of the <span>HMGS1</span>, <span>AACT1</span>, <span>DXS1</span>, levopimaradiene synthase (<span>LPS2</span>), and <span>GGPPS2</span> genes in the TTL biosynthesis pathway and activate their expression. In summary, this study investigated the molecular mechanism of the gb-miR160–GbERF4 regulatory module in regulating the biosynthesis of TTLs. It provides information for enriching the understanding of the regulatory network of TTL biosynthesis and offers important gene resources for the genetic improvement of <span>G. biloba</span> with high contents of TTLs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"1a09548998fd8fea089e1953e0cdbada4e2261e44e9d0614bfdaf0454cb7638a","category":"Environment"}
