{"title":"Colonization of the Colon by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Its Multidrug-Resistant Strains Is Well Marked in Preterm Neonates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1511/v1","date":1713859474000,"content":"Carbapenems-resistant enterobacteria are considered multidrug-resistant, making the control of their nosocomial infections a major challenge in healthcare settings. It is important to know the incubation site and source of the spread of these strains, especially in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Colonization of the colon of preterm neonates per se by multidrug-resistant bacterial strains could be the source of dissemination of these multidrug-resistant strains and their site of incubation. In this study, colonization of the colon of preterm neonates with enterobacteria and their multidrug-resistant strains was investigated. The presence of enterobacteria in the stool of preterm neonates was investigated on EMB (eosin-methylene blue) agar, followed by morphological and biochemical characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences. Antibiotic susceptibility of all isolated strains was tested using VITEK 2 technology. All cases examined at two weeks of age and older showed bacterial colonization of the colon. Klebsiella pneumoniae colonized the colon in 56.2% of the preterm neonates and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae was found in 6.3%, corresponding to 62.5% in total. The colonizing Klebsiella pneumoniae was multidrug-resistant in 2 of 9 cases. One strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae was resistant to carbapenems and another showed intermediate resistance to these antibiotics. These Klebsiella pneumoniae strains showed resistance to most of the other antibiotics tested. Some cases contained more than one genus, with Escherichia coli found in 50% of cases in preterm neonates. In contrast to Klebsiella pneumoniae, none of the E. coli strains colonizing the colon of preterm neonates in this study showed resistance to carbapenems. The results of this study suggest that Klebsiella pneumoniae and its carbapenems multidrug-resistant strains are well marked in preterm neonates colonizing their colon, which is the incubation site and source of such multidrug-resistant bacterial strains in NICU. This study highlights the importance of careful management of preterm neonates in the NICU and possible contamination with multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae incubated in their colon. Further studies would be of interest to avoid the possibility of fecal-oral transmission and infection by these multidrug-resistant bacteria and their treatment in the colon, where their incubation site is located.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da6291d01ed3cb37a79008a219837b23295e6c3a69ba253d516e584f935453a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
