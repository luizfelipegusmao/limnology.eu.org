{"title":"Synergetic effects and inhibition mechanisms of the polysaccharide‐selenium nanoparticle complex in human hepatocarcinoma cell proliferation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13335?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Active components from natural fungal products have shown promising potential as anti-tumor therapeutic agents. In the search for anti-tumor agents, research to overcome the drawbacks of high molecular weight and low bioavailability of pure polysaccharides, polysaccharide-conjugated selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) has attracted much attention.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A novel polysaccharide-selenium nanoparticle complex was produced, in which SeNPs were decorated with polysaccharide obtained from fermented mycelia broth of <i>Lactarius deliciosus</i> (FLDP). Transmission electron microscope, dynamic light scattering, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were utilized to characterize the FLDP-SeNPs; and human hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2) was used to assess growth inhibition efficacy. The FLDP-SeNPs that were prepared had a spherical shape with the smallest mean diameter of 32 nm. The FLDP-SeNPs showed satisfactory dispersibility and stability after combination, demonstrating that a reliable consolidated structure had formed. The results revealed that FLDP-SeNPs had notable growth inhibition effects on HepG2 cells. They reduced the membrane potential of mitochondria significantly, increased the generation of reactive oxygen species, enhanced levels of both Caspase-3 and Caspase-9, and led to the nucleus in a wrinkled form.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The FLDP-SeNPs could exert a synergetic toxicity reduction and inhibition enhancement effect on HepG2 cells by inducing early apoptosis, through mitochondria-mediated cytochrome C-Caspases and reactive oxygen species-induced DNA damage pathways. These results indicate that FLDP-SeNP treatment of HepG2 cells induced early apoptosis with synergetic efficacy, showing that FLDP-SeNPs can be useful as natural anti-tumor agents. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Qingxi Wu, \nXiaohui Wang, \nSiwei Hao, \nYingchao Wu, \nWenna Zhang, \nLei Chen, \nChao Yan, \nYongming Lu, \nYan Chen, \nZhifeng Ding","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"f12d9f6f3e102e5580a4afcfed42ce0d8640ba7481c0d2402f12e8083581e3cd","category":"Environment"}
