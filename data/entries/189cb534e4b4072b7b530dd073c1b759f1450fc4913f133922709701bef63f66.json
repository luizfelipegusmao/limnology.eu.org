{"title":"A Multimode Detection Platform for Biothiols Using BODIPY Dye-Conjugated Gold Nanoparticles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1989/v1","date":1719535522000,"content":"This study explores the synthesis and application of BODIPY-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for the sensitive detection of biothiols via an indicator displacement assay coupled with Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) techniques, alongside their efficacy for in vitro cancer cell imaging. Moreover, the assay allowed a visible colorimetric detection of biothiols under normal and ultraviolet light conditions. The BODIPY (boron-dipyrromethene) fluorophores were strategically conjugated to the surface of gold nanoparticles, forming a robust nanohybrid that leverages the plasmonic properties of AuNPs for enhanced spectroscopic sensitivity. The detection mechanism exploits the displacement of the BODIPY indicator upon interaction with biothiols, triggering a measurable change in fluorescence and SERS signals. This dual-mode sensing approach provides high selectivity and sensitivity for biothiol detection, with detection limits reaching nanomolar concentrations using fluorescence and femtomolar concentration for cysteine using SERS. Furthermore, the BODIPY-AuNP complexes demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and photostability, facilitating their use in fluorescence imaging of biothiol distribution within cellular environments and highlighting their potential for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in biomedical research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"189cb534e4b4072b7b530dd073c1b759f1450fc4913f133922709701bef63f66","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
