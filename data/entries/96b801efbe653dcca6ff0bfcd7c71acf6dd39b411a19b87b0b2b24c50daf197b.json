Liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) enables real-time observation of such dynamics at nanometer scales. Thus, there has been a lot of interest recently in developing LPTEM as a single-particle method. However, the collected trajectories from LPTEM movies are typically short, and as such identifying their underlying mechanism and quantifying their diffusion characteristics (e.g., anomaly exponent, diffusion coefficient) of motion using canonical statistical tests become challenging. Addressing this challenge has led to the development of supervised deep-learning algorithms to identify the underlying mechanism of motion. [<a href=\"#ozae044.1022-B1\">1-3</a>]. The state-of-the-art algorithms are capable of identifying ideal stochastic models that are best matched to the experimental data by classifying the trajectories into discrete classes such as Brownian, Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM), and Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW). Yet, the majority of real experimental trajectories are a mixture of different anomalous diffusion types and different levels of anomaly (e.g., sub-diffusivity) [<a href=\"#ozae044.1022-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1022-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1022-B5\">5</a>]. In such cases, we aim to understand not only the classes present but the contribution from each class as they contain information about the physics of the environment at different regimes of length and time scales.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"96b801efbe653dcca6ff0bfcd7c71acf6dd39b411a19b87b0b2b24c50daf197b","category":"Environment"}
