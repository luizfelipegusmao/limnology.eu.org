{"title":"Phubbing in Students: New Evidence for a Spanish Short Form of the Phubbing Scale (PS-6)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1405/v1","date":1729166807000,"content":"Phubbing - the act of snubbing someone by concentrating on a smartphone - is claimed to be an increasing, even normative, behaviour receiving more research attention. However, evidence about the adequacy of instruments that allow screening for phubbing is limited. Thus, the main purpose of the present study was to analyze the psychometric properties of the Phubbing scale in a sample of adolescents and young adults, and present a reliable and valid short form. The final sample included a total of 1351 adolescent students (54.25% males), aged between 12 and 21. A two-dimensional model of a short version of the PS with 6 items (PS-6) displayed appropriate goodness of-fit indices. Strong measurement invariance for the two-dimensional model across gender and educational level was confirmed. McDonaldâ€™s Omega coefficients for the Communication, the Obsession, and the Total score of the PS-6 were 0.617, 0.669, and 0.701, respectively. The PS-6 was positively associated with several indicators of psychological difficulties and negatively associated with psychological well-being and self-esteem. The present study contributes valuable information about the psy-chometric adequacy of the PS-6, a short instrument that allows screening for Phubbing in adoles-cents and young adults.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"caf99284e7c837ff094bda78746ea9922a3fccbc5c5906c35d9fdd20144269a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
