{"title":"Computation of The Mann-Whitney Effect under Parametric Survival Copula Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1554/v1","date":1711442461000,"content":"The Mann-Whitney effect is a measure for comparing survival distributions between two groups.\nThe Mann-Whitney effect is interpreted as the probability that a randomly selected subject in a\ngroup survives longer than a randomly selected subject in the other group. Under the independence\nassumption of two groups, the Mann-Whitney effect can be expressed as the traditional integral\nformula of survival functions. However, when the survival times in two groups are not independent\neach other, the traditional expression of the Mann-Whitney effect has to be modified. In this article,\nwe propose a copula-based approach to compute the Mann-Witney effect with parametric survival\nmodels under dependence of two groups, which may arise in the potential outcome framework. In\naddition, we develop a Shiny web app that can implement the proposed method via simple commands\n(https://nkosuke.shinyapps.io/shiny_survival/). Through a simulation study, we show\nthe correctness of the proposed calculator. We apply the proposed methods to two real datasets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46c45a4cda491906350827a09d091dd8870245608e8e3ee5198bc144ba8446c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
