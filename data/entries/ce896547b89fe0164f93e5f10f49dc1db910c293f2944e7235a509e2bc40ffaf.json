{"title":"Physical Treatments and Therapies for Androgenetic Alopecia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0093/v1","date":1717464707000,"content":"Androgenetic alopecia, the most common cause of hair loss affecting both men and women, is typically treated using pharmaceutical options such as minoxidil and finasteride. While these medications work for many individuals, they are not suitable options for all. To date, the only non-pharmaceutical option that the United States Food and Drug Administration has cleared as a treatment for androgenetic alopecia is low-level laser therapy (LLLT). Various clinical trials utilizing LLLT devices of various types are available. However, a myriad of other physical treatments for this form of hair loss are reported in the literature. This review evaluated the effectiveness of microneedling, pulsed-electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy, low-level laser therapy (LLLT), fractional laser therapy, and non-ablative laser therapy for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia (AGA). It also explores the potential of multimodal treatments combining these physical therapies. LLLT has the majority of evidence in the literature as a physical therapy for androgenetic alopecia. However, other physical treatments, such as non-ablative laser treatments, and multimodal approaches, such as PEMF-LLLT, seem to have the potential to be equally or more promising and merit further exploration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce896547b89fe0164f93e5f10f49dc1db910c293f2944e7235a509e2bc40ffaf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
