{"title":"The Pillars of the Societal Bioharmonism. A Conceptualist Contribution to the Evolution of the Contemporary Society","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1724/v1","date":1727142769000,"content":"This work refers to sustainability (SDG - Sustainable Development Goals) highlighting the idea of ​​harmony of life along the lines of the biological model at various levels and of nature alike, thus defining the concept of bioharmonism. The purpose of this paradigm is to find a way of transition in the contemporary societal change, connecting the natural sciences, more precisely the life sciences, with the social sciences, more concretely along the lines of holistic approaches to the evolution of human society. The objective of this point of view is related to sustainability, resilience and planetary health, which indicates the need to analyse planetary bioharmony and transpose the model to the structure and functionality of human society through the complex, unitary and coherent approach of the bioharmonization process. The study analyses the issue, through: the definition and role of societal bioharmonism, then the argument related to the transition to another world using the proposed path, based on specific notions, principles and laws, and finally, the description of some lines of application of the pillars of bioharmonism. A series of solutions are highlighted that can contribute conceptually to the evolution of contemporary society, to the convergence of anthroposystems with ecosystems by interconnecting the aspects of the biological revolution with those specific to the information age. The solutions aim at societal bioharmonization supported by its specific pillars, which through integration and emergence lead to a dynamic balance. The state of equilibrium, sustainability can be highlighted at a systemic level by the directions of action in which the bioharmonization complementarities that indicate the Environment and biodiversity in the economic equation, the Citizen in the social equation and Science in the political equation will be taken into account.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"08b611129ecec6accaaffa35b58ccdce2d0938267c01e6d7966e1dd50a8163bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
