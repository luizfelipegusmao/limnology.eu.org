{"title":"Dendrimer Platforms for Targeted Doxorubicin Delivery â€“ Physicochemical Properties in Context to Biological Responses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1710/v1","date":1719303547000,"content":"The unique structure of G4.0 PAMAM dendrimers allows the drug to be enclosed in internal spaces or immobilized on the surface. In the conducted research, the conditions for the formation of the active G4.0 PAMAM complex with doxorubicin (DOX) were optimized. The physicochemical properties of the system were monitored using DLS, CD, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The QCM-D method was chosen to determine the preferential conditions for the complex formation. The highest binding efficiency of the drug to the cationic dendrimer was observed under basic conditions when the DOX molecule was deprotonated. The decrease in the zeta potential of the complex confirms that DOX immobilizes through electrostatic interaction with the carrier's surface amine groups. The binding constants were determined from the fluorescence quenching of the DOX molecule in the presence of G4.0 PAMAM. The two-fold way of binding doxorubicin in the structure of dendrimers was visible in the ITC isotherm. Fluorescence spectra and release curves identified reversible binding of DOX to the nanocarrier. Among the selected cancer cells, the most promising anticancer activity of G4.0-DOX was observed in A375 malignant melanoma cells. Moreover, the preferred intracellular location of the complexes concerning the free drug was found, which is important from a therapeutic point of view.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f03f6af3674d95c856ce07b7fc18e54d5c0dd630cbdd0fa05853e5d7708d0387","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
