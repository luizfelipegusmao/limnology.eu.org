{"title":"Learning A-Share Stock Recommendation From Stock Graph and Historical Price Simultaneously","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0269/v1","date":1727993425000,"content":"The Chinese stock market, marked by rapid growth and significant volatility, presents unique challenges for investors and analysts. A-share stocks, traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, are crucial to Chinaâ€™s financial system and offer opportunities for both domestic and international investors. Accurate stock recommendation tools are vital for informed decision-making, especially given the ongoing regulatory changes and economic reforms in China. Current stock recommendation methods often fall short, as they typically fail to capture the complex inter-company relationships and rely heavily on financial reports, neglecting the potential of unlabeled data and historical price trends. In response, we propose a novel approach that combines graph-based structures with historical price data to develop self-learned stock embeddings for A-share recommendations. Our method leverages self-supervised learning, bypassing the need for human-generated labels and autonomously uncovering latent relationships and patterns within the data. This dual-input strategy enhances the understanding of market dynamics, leading to more accurate stock predictions. Our contributions include a novel framework for label-free stock recommendations with modeling stock connections and pricing information, and empirical evidence demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of our approach in the volatile Chinese stock market.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bcd2501ec194caf2bca00053d8735429e0fc64ee9de3ce8859cd4e6d8d2677ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
