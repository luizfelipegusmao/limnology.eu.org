{"title":"The Level of Nutritional Awareness; Body Mass Index; Mental Health; Fitness Components among Undergraduate University Students","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0376/v1","date":1728287313000,"content":"This study investigated the relationship between mental health, physical activity, and weight among Saudi female university students. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess participants' risky behaviors, psychological health, and health-related habits. Results revealed that a significant number of students had unhealthy eating habits, low levels of physical activity, and were overweight. While there was a slight trend towards lower physical activity and higher weight among individuals with higher depressive symptoms, these relationships were not statistically significant. The study concludes that factors beyond mental health, such as cultural norms and social support, likely play a more significant role in influencing physical activity levels and weight among Saudi university students. Further research is needed to identify these factors and develop targeted interventions to promote healthier lifestyles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b12489cf6166821025e081ca41b02cfdb9fbe79e26519602f6213c61d3efec3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
