{"title":"Synthesis of Substituted 1,2-Dihydroisoquinolines by Palladium-Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization&ndash;Coupling of Trisubstituted Allenamides With Arylboronic Acids","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0488/v1","date":1717748807000,"content":"1,2-Dihydroisoquinolines are important compounds due to their biological and medicinal activities, and numerous approaches to their synthesis have been reported. In this study, a palladium-catalyzed cascade cyclization-coupling of trisubstituted allenamides containing a bromoaryl moiety with arylboronic acids is described. The reaction proceeds via intramolecular cyclization, followed by transmetallation with the arylboronic acid of the resulting allylpalladium intermediate. A variety of substituted 1,2-dihydroisoquinolines were concisely obtained using this methodology because the allenamides, as reaction substrates, were prepared from readily available propargylamines in one step.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b2b5ee59ebefdb31905e80723b77e52afaaa73ede44d78c461ce4e36565b77b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
