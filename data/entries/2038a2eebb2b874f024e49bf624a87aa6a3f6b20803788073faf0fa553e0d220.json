{"title":"Impact of Building Orientation on Energy Performance of Residential Buildings in Various Cities Across Afghanistan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0986/v1","date":1728956647000,"content":"Building or solar orientation, a key architectural design parameter, significantly influences energy consumption in buildings. Optimizing building orientation to harness passive solar benefits is a fundamental and cost-effective measure in designing energy-efficient buildings. The optimal orientation, however, varies with the geographical location, climatic conditions, and building type. Notably, Afghanistanâ€™s building sector lack tailored energy efficiency regulations. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of building orientation on the energy performance of residential buildings across nine cities in Afghanistan, each characterized by distinct climatic conditions and geographic locations, employing BEoptTM energy simulation software. The findings reveal diverse optimal orientations, dividing the country into three distinct climatic zones: subarctic, continental, and hot arid, offering potential energy savings ranging from 25.6% to 48.9% compared to the least efficient orientations. These insights are crucial for formulating standardized building regulations in Afghanistan, emphasizing location-specific design approaches. This research also has implications for urban planning decisions that promote sustainable built environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2038a2eebb2b874f024e49bf624a87aa6a3f6b20803788073faf0fa553e0d220","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
