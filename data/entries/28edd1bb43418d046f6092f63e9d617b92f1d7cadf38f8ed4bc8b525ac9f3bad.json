{"title":"GIBBERELLIN PERCEPTION SENSOR 2 reveals genesis and role of cellular GA dynamics in light-regulated hypocotyl growth","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4426/7718130?rss=1","date":1721692800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The phytohormone gibberellic acid (GA) is critical for environmentally sensitive plant development including germination, skotomorphogenesis, and flowering. The FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer biosensor GIBBERELLIN PERCEPTION SENSOR1, which permits single-cell GA measurements in vivo, has been used to observe a GA gradient correlated with cell length in dark-grown, but not light-grown, hypocotyls. We sought to understand how light signaling integrates into cellular GA regulation. Here, we show how the E3 ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS1 (COP1) and transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) play central roles in directing cellular GA distribution in skoto- and photomorphogenic hypocotyls, respectively. We demonstrate that the expression pattern of the GA biosynthetic enzyme gene <span>GA20ox1</span> is the key determinant of the GA gradient in dark-grown hypocotyls and is a target of COP1 signaling. We engineered a second generation GPS2 biosensor with improved orthogonality and reversibility. GPS2 revealed a previously undetectable cellular pattern of GA depletion during the transition to growth in the light. This GA depletion partly explains the resetting of hypocotyl growth dynamics during photomorphogenesis. Achieving cell-level resolution has revealed how GA distributions link environmental conditions with morphology and morphological plasticity. The GPS2 biosensor is an ideal tool for GA studies in many conditions, organs, and plant species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"28edd1bb43418d046f6092f63e9d617b92f1d7cadf38f8ed4bc8b525ac9f3bad","category":"Environment"}
