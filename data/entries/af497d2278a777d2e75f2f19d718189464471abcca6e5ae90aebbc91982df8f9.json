{"title":"Prognostic Significance of Serum Uric Acid and Exercise Capacity in Older Adults Hospitalized for Worsening Cardiovascular Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0111/v1","date":1711976454000,"content":"Elevated serum uric acid (sUA) is associated with risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Here, we examined the prognostic significance of sUA and exercise capacity in 411 Japanese adults (age, â‰¥65; mean, 81 years) hospitalized for worsening CVD. Mean sUA was significantly higher in the 23% of patients on an sUA-lowering agent than in those not. When the patients were stratified by sUA into three groups (7.0 mg/dL), the high sUA group had significantly worse peak VO2 and composite endpoint (rehospitalization due to worsening CVD and all-cause mortality) compared with low and moderate sUA groups (P &lt; 0.001). When the patients were stratified by sUA into five groups (sUA 10.0 mg/dL), the incidence of the composite endpoint was significantly higher in the highest sUA group compared with that in the reference group, but only in women. Univariate Cox regression analysis, but not a multivariate analysis, indicated that sUA was significantly associated with the composite endpoint. Although sUA and exercise capacity may have some degree of prognostic significance in older patients with CVD, this significance may differ between men and women.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"af497d2278a777d2e75f2f19d718189464471abcca6e5ae90aebbc91982df8f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
