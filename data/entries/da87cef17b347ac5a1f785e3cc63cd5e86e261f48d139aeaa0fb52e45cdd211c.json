In recent years, advances in technology, particularly in the fields of genomics and animal tracking, have enabled significant progress in our understanding of this phenomenon. In this review, we provide an overview of the latest advancements in the genetics of bird migration, with a particular focus on genomics, and examine various factors that contribute to the evolution of this behavior, including climate change. Integration of research from the fields of genomics, ecology, and evolution can enhance our comprehension of the complex mechanisms involved in bird migration and inform conservation efforts in a rapidly changing world.</p></div>","author":"Zhongru Gu, Andrew Dixon and Xiangjiang Zhan","siteTitle":"Annual Reviews: Annual Review of Animal Biosciences: Table of Contents","siteHash":"88ae807e8b2cfc417a41d31c2599db29fa2c783b0d3a8de2765d823f4bd5cf41","entryHash":"da87cef17b347ac5a1f785e3cc63cd5e86e261f48d139aeaa0fb52e45cdd211c","category":"Environment"}
