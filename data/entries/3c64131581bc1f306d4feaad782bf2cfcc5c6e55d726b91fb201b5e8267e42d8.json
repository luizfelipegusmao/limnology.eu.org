{"title":"Characteristics of Umami Taste of Soy Sauce Using Electronic Tongue, Amino Acid Analyzer, and MALDI-TOF MS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0951/v1","date":1718281400000,"content":"The objective of this study was to investigate the umami characteristics of soy sauce using electronic tongue evaluation and amino acid composition and Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis. The soy sauce peptides were isolated from soy sauce using XAD-16 macroporous resin combined with ethanol solution. Results showed that the soy sauce peptide fraction eluted by 60% ethanol (SS-60%) exhibited a prominent umami taste and the umami scores were highly positively correlated with the amino acid nitrogen contents of soy sauces. The umami scores of SS-60% were significantly positively correlated with the contents of free amino acids. Especially, Phe showed the highest positive correlation with the umami scores. In addition, five characteristic ion peaks with m/z at 499, 561, 643, 649, and 855 were identified in the peptide mass fingerprinting. Therefore, this study provides new insights into the umami characteristics for the flavor evaluation and reality identification of soy sauce.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c64131581bc1f306d4feaad782bf2cfcc5c6e55d726b91fb201b5e8267e42d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
