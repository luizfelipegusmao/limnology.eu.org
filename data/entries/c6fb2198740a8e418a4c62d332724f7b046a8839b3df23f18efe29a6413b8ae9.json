{"title":"Exploring Supplier Relationship Dynamics: Insights From Italian Restaurant Managers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0641/v1","date":1720522148000,"content":"This qualitative study explores the dynamics of supplier relationships among Italian restaurant managers, aiming to uncover the strategic practices and challenges in supplier relationship management (SRM) within the culinary industry. Through semi-structured interviews with a diverse sample of restaurant managers across Italy, the study examines how trust, communication, adaptive sourcing strategies, and innovation influence supplier interactions and operational outcomes. Findings reveal that trust-building is foundational to establishing reliable supplier partnerships, crucial for ensuring consistent delivery of high-quality ingredients essential for culinary excellence. Effective communication channels and negotiation techniques are pivotal in clarifying expectations, resolving conflicts, and fostering collaborative relationships with suppliers. Adaptive sourcing strategies, including diversification of supplier bases and local sourcing initiatives, enable managers to navigate market dynamics and meet consumer demands effectively. Innovation emerges as a catalyst for differentiation and sustainability in supplier relationships, with managers engaging in collaborative product development and embracing sustainability initiatives to align with consumer preferences and corporate values. Despite facing challenges such as pricing pressures, supply chain logistics complexities, and regulatory compliance, proactive management strategies and operational agility enable managers to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities in supplier management. Theoretical implications enrich understanding of SRM dynamics in the culinary sector, while practical implications suggest strategies for optimizing supplier relationships, enhancing operational efficiency, and sustaining competitive advantage. Future research could explore technological advancements, consumer trends, and longitudinal impacts of SRM practices on business performance within the restaurant industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6fb2198740a8e418a4c62d332724f7b046a8839b3df23f18efe29a6413b8ae9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
