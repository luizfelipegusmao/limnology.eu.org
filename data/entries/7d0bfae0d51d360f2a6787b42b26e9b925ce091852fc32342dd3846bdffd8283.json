{"title":"Prevalence, Clinical Characteristics and Treatment of Patients with Resistant Hypertension: A Single-Center Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1848/v1","date":1721750490000,"content":"Background: Resistant hypertension (HTN) is associated with high risk of cardiovascular complications. Our study aimed to assess prevalence, characteristics and treatment of patients with resistant HTN; Methods: We screened 4340 consecutive cardiovascular patients and identified 3762 with HTN. Of them 128 fulfilled criteria for resistant HTN and were included in our study. We matched these patients to 128 hypertensive patients with controlled HTN; Results: Resistant HTN patients were 3.4% of all hypertensives. Most of these patients (67.2%) were at high or very high cardiovascular risk compared to controlled HTN patients (40.6%), p&amp;lt;0001. Resistant HTN patients had more frequently concomitant chronic kidney disease (CKD) (60.9%), overweight/obesity (52.3%), dyslipidemias (35.2%), smoking (27.3%) and diabetes (21.9%) compared to controlled HTN patients (37.5%, 29.7%, 28.1%, 14.1% and 7.8% respectively), p&amp;lt;0.001. Regression analysis showed strongest association of resistant HTN with CKD (OR 6.64), stage III HTN (OR 3.07) and obesity/overweight (OR 2.60). In contrast, single-pill combinations (SPCs) were associated with lower likelihood of uncontrolled HTN (OR 0.58); Conclusions: Resistant HTN represented a small proportion of all hypertensives in our study, but it was characterized by high/very high cardiovascular risk. Optimized therapy including increased usage of SPCs could improve blood pressure control and long-term prognosis of these patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d0bfae0d51d360f2a6787b42b26e9b925ce091852fc32342dd3846bdffd8283","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
