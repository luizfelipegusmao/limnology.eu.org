{"title":"Resveratrol: A Review on the Biological Activity and Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2000/v1","date":1714471012000,"content":"Resveratrol (RSV), a naturally occurring phytoalexin, is the most important stilbenoid synthesized by plants, as a defense mechanism, in response to microbial aggression, toxins or ultraviolet radiation. RSV came to the attention of researchers both as a potential chemopreventive agent and a possible explanation for the low incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in French people with a high-fat diet. RSV is mainly administered as a food supplement, its properties being evaluated in vitro or in vivo, on various experimental models. RSV modulates signaling pathways that limit the spread of tumor cells, protects nerve cells from damage, is useful in the prevention of diabetes, and generally acts as an anti-aging natural compound. It was highlighted that RSV could ameliorate the consequences of an unhealthy lifestyle caused by an exaggerated caloric intake. This paper reviews the evidence supporting the beneficial effect of RSV for various pathological conditions, e.g., neoplastic diseases, neurodegeneration, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, CVDs, immune diseases, bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. The study also focused on the chromatographic analysis of trans-RSV (tRSV) in Romanian wine samples, providing a comprehensive overview of tRSV content across different types of wine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"650cc967d7f9ea66d9246d7af733f5b2dadcb8b6eb96299b21070f043ce0067d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
