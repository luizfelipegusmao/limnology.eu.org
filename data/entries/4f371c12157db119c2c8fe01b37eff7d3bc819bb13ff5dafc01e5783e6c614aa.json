{"title":"Ghost Gear in the Gulf of Gabès (Tunisia): An Urgent Need for a Conservation Code of Conduct","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2113/v1","date":1721961930000,"content":"The management of ghost gear - abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing gear- is a critical issue of marine conservation in Tunisia. This code of conduct proposed outlines a comprehensive framework aimed at mitigating the negative impacts of ghost gear on marine ecosystems and fisheries. The guiding principles of this code encompass sustainability, responsibility, collaboration, transparency, and innovation. Key guidelines outlined in the code include promoting responsible fishing practices, marking and tracking gear, incentivizing the retrieval and proper disposal of gear, and raising awareness through education. The code emphasizes regulatory compliance while encouraging active community involvement and cooperation among all stakeholders. The code supports the allocation of financial and technical resources to develop innovative solutions. Its implementation involves the involvement of stakeholders, execution of pilot projects, capacity building, and continuous monitoring and evaluation. The adoption of such code of conduct would contribute significantly to reduce the prevalence of ghost gear, protect marine life, and foster sustainable fishing practices. This collaborative and proactive approach is essential for the long-term health and sustainability of Tunisia’s marine environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f371c12157db119c2c8fe01b37eff7d3bc819bb13ff5dafc01e5783e6c614aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
