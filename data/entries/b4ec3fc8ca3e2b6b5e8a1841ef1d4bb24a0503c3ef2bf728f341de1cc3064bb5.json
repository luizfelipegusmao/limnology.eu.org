{"title":"Minimization of Bandwidth for Required End-to-End Latency Implementing IRS in a 6G Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0297/v1","date":1720000626000,"content":"The goal of the investigation is to increase coverage, which is ensure better transmission around IoT services using IRS within a two-tier 6G system comprising of one micro cell tier running beneath a macro cellular tier. As a result, the study tested and compared the reliability of traditional connectivity with IRS-enhanced connectivity in terms of upstream end-to-end latency using computer-based measuring methods. The study concluded that the implementation of IRS greatly improves coverage, which means transmission effectiveness, for 6G services.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4ec3fc8ca3e2b6b5e8a1841ef1d4bb24a0503c3ef2bf728f341de1cc3064bb5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
