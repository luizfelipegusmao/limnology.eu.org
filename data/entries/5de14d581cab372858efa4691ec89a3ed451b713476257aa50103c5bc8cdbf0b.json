{"title":"Identification of Carbon-Short Fibers by Image Segmentation Technologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0160/v1","date":1727863623000,"content":"Computer vision technology for automatic recognition and geometric characterization of carbon fibers was proposed in this paper. A two-stage pipeline was used, in the first stage the fundamental neural network model of segmentation SAM(Segment Anything Model) was used, in the second stage the segmentation results were improved by using a trained neural network model DeepLabv3+. Both manually labeled carbon fiber images and generated synthetic images were used for training. It is shown that additional use of synthetic data in training of neural network models improves the quality of segmentation by IoU and Pix Acc metrics from 0.943 and 0.949 to 0.953 and 0.959, i.e. by 1% on average. The total processing time averaged 0.95 seconds for a single fiber image. Based on the segmentation results, an automatic calculation of geometric characteristics and statistics that can be used to evaluate material properties was realized.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5de14d581cab372858efa4691ec89a3ed451b713476257aa50103c5bc8cdbf0b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
