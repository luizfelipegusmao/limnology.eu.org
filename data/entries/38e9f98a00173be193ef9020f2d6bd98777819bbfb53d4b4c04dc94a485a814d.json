In three dimensions (3D), grains meet at surfaces termed <span>grain boundaries</span> (GBs) and lines termed <span>triple junctions</span> (TJs), which are non-equilibrium defects. The structures of such defects impact the material performance of polycrystals, e.g., corrosion and cracking. Annealing provides sufficient thermal energy to activate the motion of GBs and promote grain growth, reducing the total area of GBs and thereby reducing the total system energy. There exist two distinct modes of grain growth: <span>normal grain growth</span> (NGG) and <span>abnormal grain growth</span> (AGG) [<a href=\"#ozae044.222-B1\">1</a>]. In NGG, the dominant driving force for GB motion is capillarity. In AGG, a few grains experience a growth advantage – not originating from capillarity – and grow more quickly than the ensemble average. Types of growth advantages include intergranular differences in stored strain energy [<a href=\"#ozae044.222-B2\">2</a>] and nonuniform second-phase pinning-particle distributions [<a href=\"#ozae044.222-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"38e9f98a00173be193ef9020f2d6bd98777819bbfb53d4b4c04dc94a485a814d","category":"Environment"}
