Using CGN New Energy's Guangxi branch as a case study, and adopting the grounded theory method, this research systematically analyzes the influencing factors and action paths of the service-oriented transformation on the satisfaction of employee performance evaluation systems through in-depth interviews and questionnaires. The study finds that the service-oriented transformation significantly enhances employees' sense of professional achievement and skill levels but also increases work pressure and psychological burden. Optimizing the performance evaluation system and improving its fairness and transparency are key to enhancing employee satisfaction. The research results provide a scientific basis for the management practices of new energy enterprises and hold significant reference value for relevant policy-making.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cead1560905d9de6aa975c4c18ad10db21c73878d63bdafec82abd61f808baf8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
