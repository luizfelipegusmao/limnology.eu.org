{"title":"Compact, Ultra-Wideband Butler Matrix Beamformers for the Advanced 5G Band FR3 â€“ Part I","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0510/v1","date":1718004324000,"content":"Butler matrix networks are well established as beam forming networks for phased antenna arrays. The challenge we address in this work is to cover the entire, (advanced 5G or 6G), FR3 band (7-24 GHz) with a single network, while retaining low losses and minimal size. The employed multilayer topology is also well established, however, the matching between the utilized hybrid couplers and the phase shifters constitutes a major challenge for such a wideband operation. This is achieved herein employing meander lines with appropriate curvature and introducing two distinct design methods for the Butler Matrix. The first method focuses on designing individual components separately, followed by their integration into the overall Butler Matrix structure. This approach is demonstrated through the design, prototyping, measurements and validation of an 8x8 Butler Matrix beamformer, which operates across the 6-16 GHz band (FR3 Low). The second method introduces a wideband matching technique, which simplifies the implementation process by designing the Butler Matrix as a single, unified structure. This technique is applied to both 4x4 and 8x8 Butler Matrices, which are implemented and simulated for the low FR3 band. Both design methods result in wideband operation, compact size, and meet the desired performance criteria.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37e29d06276d03200140850d4f076187c2de18a17815c2a463eb0a0e692db8e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
