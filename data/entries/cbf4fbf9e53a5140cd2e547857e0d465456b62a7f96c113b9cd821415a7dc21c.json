{"title":"A Delphi‐study to identify drivers of future angling participation in five Nordic countries","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12735?af=R","date":1724330059000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Delphi method was used to gather assessments from 93 experts about drivers of future angling participation by locals and tourist anglers in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. The main drivers of future angling participation related to habitat and fish populations, and access to and information about fishing. For Norway and Finland, the predicted future decline in local angler numbers was consistent with a life-cycle model of recreational fisheries, while the anticipated increase for the three other countries contradicted the model. For tourist anglers, growth was expected for both domestic and foreign tourists. Long-term and societal drivers, such as urbanization, sociocultural changes, and climate change were not seen as strong drivers, and may be considered out of reach by managers, but should be included with information and conservation drivers in angler recruitment and retention strategies.</p>","author":"Stian Stensland, \nChristian Skov, \nSveinn Agnarsson, \nPatrik Rönnbäck, \nTeppo Vehanen, \nMalgorzata Blicharska, \nJon Olaf Olaussen, \nAnders Kagervall, \nGustav Hellström, \nSamuel Blyth, \nCasper Gundelund, \nØystein Aas","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"cbf4fbf9e53a5140cd2e547857e0d465456b62a7f96c113b9cd821415a7dc21c","category":"Environment"}
