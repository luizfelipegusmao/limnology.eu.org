{"title":"Optical Stereometric Analysis of Milled and Not-Milled Copings for Removable Overdentures on an Experimental Partially Edentulous Mandible","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2301/v1","date":1727600698000,"content":"Statement of problem: The stereo-optical method can be used for assessment of strains and deformations of different fixed or removable prosthodontic constructions.\nMaterial and methods: The study used two master casts of a lower jaw with bilateral terminal edentulous seats. Their topography was identical, with missing lower molars, the left lower second premolar, and the right canine and incisors, indicating a partially edentulous lower jaw according to Eichner's B3 (and C2) classification (i.e. Kennedy class 1). The control cast had conventional oval copings for overdenture. The experimental cast was almost the same as the control, with the exception of the surfaces simulating three specific milled copings covering the remaining tooth substance. Controlled loading was measured using a gnathodynamometer. Loading stages were at 400, 800, and 1000 N. Measurements of strain and displacement were provided by the Digital Image Correlation Method and the associated software. ‘Wilcoxon Lambda’ two sample tests based on the simple linear rank statistics were used in the analysis of differences in the displacement and deformation between the control rounded and experimental milled copings under loading\nnumerical values.\nResults: It was found that smaller values of deformations are measured on milled copings when compared to the controls.\nThere were statistically significant differences in displacement between the control rounded and experimental milled copings (Pr &gt; |Z| = 0.001) as well as in deformations (Pr &gt; |Z| = 0.0298). \nConclusions: Experimental milled copings are less susceptible to deformation compared to the control conventional oval copings. These findings may have clinical significance in improvements of primary and secondary retention of overdentures on milled copings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b89cd9a54f47cf11761ec2e91134fcec1c9229a58b44b84b199ce5b09bafead2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
