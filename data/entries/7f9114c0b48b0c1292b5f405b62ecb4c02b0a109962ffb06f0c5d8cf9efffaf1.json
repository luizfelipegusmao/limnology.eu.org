The egg veils were characterized as translucent sheet-shape with parallel opaque creases spaced approximately 2â€‰cm apart. The egg veils were found to be composed of pentagonal or hexagonal chambers with rounded corners arranged in one layer, and each chamber enveloped one to three embryos. Cryopreservation is recommended to prevent structural changes in the egg veil rather than ethanol solution and neutral buffered formalin solution.</p>","author":"Tomoya Ishikawa, \nMitsuhiro Nakaya, \nYuta Eno, \nTetsuya Takatsu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"7f9114c0b48b0c1292b5f405b62ecb4c02b0a109962ffb06f0c5d8cf9efffaf1","category":"Environment"}
