{"title":"Improvement of the Chemical Quality of Brazilian Sugar Cane Spirits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0793/v1","date":1723455736000,"content":"The objective of this study was to determine the chemical composition of sugarcane spirits and commercial cachaças, comparing them with the limits established by national legislation and with studies conducted in previous periods. Previous studies have shown that 50% of the samples of this distillate were above the contaminant limits allowed by national legislation, which was one of the main factors responsible for the low volume of exports. Volatile compounds and contaminants established by current Brazilian legislation were evaluated in 531 samples of commercial sugarcane brandy and cachaça. Among the samples analyzed, approximately 90% met the Brazilian standards of identity and quality. These results suggest that Brazilian producers have faced fewer difficulties related to the use of Good Manufacturing Practices, ensuring good quality during the production process and standardization of these beverages compared to previous studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"898e07a2b90d74bdf6a41186f8272e365d14f0197adef179af5883bbdc791ab8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
