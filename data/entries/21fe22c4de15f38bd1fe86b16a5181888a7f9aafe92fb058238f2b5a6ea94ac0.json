{"title":"Near Field Propagation of Flat-Top Gaussian Beam: Analysis in ‎Weak Atmospheric Turbulence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1528/v1","date":1713888461000,"content":"Optical communications are described and analyzed by shaped beams; we challenge the ‎effects of parameters that impact the profile of a Flat Top Gaussian (FTG) beam. When ‎the laser beam propagates throughout the atmosphere, it can be influenced by different ‎optical phenomena including scattering, absorption, and turbulence due to changes in the ‎scintillation index and the forms of intensity that are displayed in the source and receiver ‎planes. In this project, the FTG laser beam that propagates through a weak turbulent ‎region is numerically investigated using open-source software. This simulation will be ‎performed according to a mathematical model based on the split-step beam propagation ‎method. Intensity distributions at the source plane and the received average intensity in ‎atmospheric turbulence are calculated, and additional contour is in the transducer plane. ‎The scintillation index, structure constant, source size, and other parameters, are applied ‎in the Rytov method to quantify the weak turbulent model. Moreover, these parameters ‎are analyzed in near-field propagation. Also, the effects of the beam’s scintillation and ‎beam wander are determined. All results simulated are discussed and compared with the ‎TEM00 Gaussian beam. Finally, these results are compared to measurements in the ‎experimental part of the work.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"21fe22c4de15f38bd1fe86b16a5181888a7f9aafe92fb058238f2b5a6ea94ac0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
