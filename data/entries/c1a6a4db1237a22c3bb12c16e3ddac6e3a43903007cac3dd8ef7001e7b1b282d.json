{"title":"Dual-Band Antenna With Pattern and Polarization Diversity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0470/v1","date":1720140609000,"content":"In this letter, we propose a pattern-diversity antenna with different radiation patterns at two different frequency bands (f1 and f2) (f1: broadside radiation pattern, f2: conical radiation pattern). The proposed structure consists of a central circular antenna and two annular ring antennas; each of the three antennas has individual ports. Two of the ports exhibit orthogonal broadside radiation patterns; the other two ports exhibit orthogonal conical radiation patterns. Thus, they have polarization diversity characteristics. To improve isolation between ports, the inner part of the annular ring antennas is shorted via array, and the outermost port is positioned orthogonal to the other ports. Using this configuration, the isolation between ports was measured as -26.7 dB and -30.1 dB at the two frequency bands, respectively. Experimental results based on the fabricated prototype show that the proposed antenna achieves -10 dB bandwidths of 240 MHz (5.71~5.95 GHz) and 210 MHz (7.69~7.9 GHz) at f1 and f2, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c1a6a4db1237a22c3bb12c16e3ddac6e3a43903007cac3dd8ef7001e7b1b282d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
