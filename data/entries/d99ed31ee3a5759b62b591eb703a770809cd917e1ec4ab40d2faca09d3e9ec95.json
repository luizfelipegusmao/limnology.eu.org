{"title":"Ecosystem Services Trade-Offs in Peri-Urban Landscapes: Drivers, Governance Obstacles and Improvements","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0658/v1","date":1718099316000,"content":"Trade-offs in ecosystem services (ES) manifest when the enhancement of one service leads to the diminishing of another. These trade-offs pose a notable challenge, impacting the sustainability of particular socio-ecological systems peri-urban landscapes (PULs). This issue arises from the dynamic processes associated with peri-urbanization, posing threats to natural ecosystems and their services in peri-urban areas. Additionally, the escalating demand for ecosystem services in PULs contributes to these trade-offs. Policy making and planning concerning ecosystem ES trade-offs in PULs should prioritize the promotion of a balance between conflicting services and foster synergies among them. However, it is noteworthy that ES trade-offs in PULs are not given high priority on policy and planning agendas. Knowledge regarding policy development and planning for ES trade-offs in PULs often remains concealed within specific country and regional case studies. Consequently, this research seeks to characterize the ES trade-offs in the selected PUL case studies, with the objective of identifying potential commonalities among them. Furthermore, the study aims to identify: (i) the factors driving ES trade-offs, (ii) challenges pertaining to how policy-making and planning address ES trade-offs in PULs, and (iii) recommendations for enhancing governance practices to better manage peri-urban ES trade-offs. We designed a semi-quantitative survey and collected information about 23 different case studies, located across the world. Answers from this survey were analyzed with the help of Principal Component Analysis approach. The results showed that the most common trade-off occurred between “cultural and provisioning” and “regulating and provisioning” ES. It was found that urban development is the basic driver behind emerging of the examined trade-offs. To tackle this issue at the governance level, the study recommends establishing mechanisms to facilitate collaboration among stakeholders. This should be accompanied by robust dissemination efforts and the promotion of awareness among actors regarding the fundamental concepts of ES and PULs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d99ed31ee3a5759b62b591eb703a770809cd917e1ec4ab40d2faca09d3e9ec95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
