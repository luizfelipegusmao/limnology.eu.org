{"title":"Geographical variations, prevalence, and molecular dynamics of fastidious phloem-limited pathogens infecting sugar beet across Central Europe","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306136","date":1719928800000,"content":"<p>by Bojan Duduk, Jelena Stepanović, Jana Fránová, Agnieszka Zwolińska, Emil Rekanović, Miloš Stepanović, Nina Vučković, Nataša Duduk, Ivana Vico</p>\r\n\r\nIn Europe, two fastidious phloem-limited pathogens, ’<i>Candidatus</i> Phytoplasma solani’ (16SrXII-A) and ’<i>Candidatus</i> Arsenophonus phytopathogenicus’, are associated with rubbery taproot disease (RTD) and syndrome basses richesses (SBR) of sugar beet, respectively. Both diseases can significantly reduce yield, especially when accompanied by root rot fungi. This study investigates the presence, geographic distribution and genetic traits of fastidious pathogens and the accompanying fungus, <i>Macrophomina phaseolina</i>, found on sugar beet across four geographically separated plains spanning seven countries in Central Europe. The survey revealed variable incidences of symptoms linked to these fastidious pathogens in the Pannonian and Wallachian Plains, sporadic occurrence in the North European Plain, and no symptomatic sugar beet in the Bohemian Plain. Molecular analyses unveiled the occurrence of both ’<i>Ca</i>. P. solani’ and ’<i>Ca</i>. A. phytopathogenicus’ throughout Central Europe, with a predominance of the phytoplasma. These fastidious pathogens were detected in all six countries surveyed within the Pannonian and Wallachian Plains, with only a limited presence of various phytoplasmas was found in the North European Plain, while no fastidious pathogens were detected in Bohemia, aligning with observed symptoms. While 16S rDNA sequences of ’<i>Ca</i>. P. solani’ remained highly conserved, multi-locus characterization of two more variable loci (<i>tuf</i> and <i>stamp</i>) unveiled distinct variability patterns across the plains. Notably, the surprising lack of variability of <i>tuf</i> and <i>stamp</i> loci within Central Europe, particularly the Pannonian Plain, contrasted their high variability in Eastern and Western Europe, corresponding to epidemic and sporadic occurrence, respectively. The current study provides valuable insights into the genetic dynamics of ’<i>Ca</i>. P. solani’ in Central Europe, and novel findings of the presence of ’<i>Ca</i>. A. phytopathogenicus’ in five countries (Slovakia, Czech Republic, Austria, Serbia, and Romania) and <i>M</i>. <i>phaseolina</i> in sugar beet in Slovakia. These findings emphasize the need for further investigation of vector–pathogen(s)–plant host interactions and ecological drivers of disease outbreaks.","author":"Bojan Duduk","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ee4e48fa039b8fb4539a823427d61e701464fc19402d3cb81e9b60bc4184a7e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
