{"title":"A Review of Photonic Real-Time Signal Processing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1737/v1","date":1727088962000,"content":"The simultaneous progress of integrated op- tical frequency comb (OFC) and radio frequency (RF) photonic signal processing technique have promoted the rapid development of real-time signal processing. Integrated optical frequency comb offer multiple wave- lengths as a powerful source for RF photonic sig- nal transversal filter. Here, we review development of real-time signal processing system consisting of inte- grated OFC and RF photonic signal transversal filter in chronological order, and focus on the applications of this system such as differentiator, integrator, Hilbert transformer, and image processor. We also discuss and present our outlook on more parallel functions and fur- ther integration of real-time signal processing system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15fab39664e5bdf85434badbbd88feed38a5923c5246daa6215130f5c21de238","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
