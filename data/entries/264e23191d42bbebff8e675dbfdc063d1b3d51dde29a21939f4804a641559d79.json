{"title":"On the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, Innateness Hypothesis and Semiotics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2043/v1","date":1724833462000,"content":"This article considers a different application of similar methods that have been used to reject the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis and expounds the idea as a member of the cumulative proof against the theory.  Rather than to explicitly include models of generative grammars, this model instead does not violate the ideas of Optimality Theory â€“ and therein it preserves such qualities as freedom of analysis while retaining the idea of the pertinent constraints. However, it is suggestive of momentary disagreements with the Innateness Hypothesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"264e23191d42bbebff8e675dbfdc063d1b3d51dde29a21939f4804a641559d79","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
