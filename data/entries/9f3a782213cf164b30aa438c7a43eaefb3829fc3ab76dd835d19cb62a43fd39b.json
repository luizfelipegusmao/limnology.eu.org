{"title":"The Role of Transcrust Magma and Fluid-Conducting Faults in the Formation of Mineral Deposits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1148/v1","date":1726482112000,"content":"The article considers the role of transcrustal magma- and fluid-conducting faults in the formation of mineral deposits, shows the importance of a deep source of heat and hydrothermal solutions in the genesis and history of the formation of these deposits. As a result of the impact on the lithosphere of mantle jets rising along transcrustal faults, intense block-and-clump deformations and tectonic movements are generated; rift systems and volcanic-plutonic belts spatially combined with them are formed; intrusive bodies are introduced. At ore deposits, these processes cause epithermal ore formation as a consequence of the impact of mantle jets rising along transcrustal faults on the lithosphere. At hydrocarbon fields, they play an extremely important role in conduction and convective heat and mass transfer to the area of hydrocarbon generation, determine the relationship between the processes of lithogenesis and tectogenesis, and activate the generation of hydrocarbons from oil and gas mother formations. Detection of transcrustal magma- and fluid-supporting faults was carried out by MMZ and MTZ in combination with other geological and geophysical data. Practical examples are given for mineral deposits under which subvertical transcrustal columns of increased permeability traced to considerable depths have been found. The nature of these unique structures is related to faults of pre-Paleozoic time of emplacement, which determined the fragmentation of the subcrystalline structure of the Earth and later developed inherited in the conditions of development of volumetric fluid dynamics. The residual forms of functioning of fluid-conducting thermohydrocolumns are granitoid batholiths and other magmatic bodies. Experimental modelling of deep processes allowed to reveal the quantum character of interactions of crystal structures of minerals with \"inert\" gases under elevated T-P conditions. The role of helium, nitrogen and hydrogen in changing the physical properties of rocks in connection with their intrastructural diffusion has been clarified. As a result of low-energy impact, stress fields are formed in the solid rock skeleton, the structure and texture of rocks are rearranged, and general porosity develops. With increasing pressure, energy interactions intensify, deformations, phase transitions and chemical bonds occur in an unstable geological environment, which increases with increasing gas saturation, pressure, and temperature. The process of heat and mass transfer along transcrustal magma- and fluid-supplying faults to the Earth's surface occurs in stages with energy release, which can manifest itself in the form of explosions on the day surface, in coal and ore mines, in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f3a782213cf164b30aa438c7a43eaefb3829fc3ab76dd835d19cb62a43fd39b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
