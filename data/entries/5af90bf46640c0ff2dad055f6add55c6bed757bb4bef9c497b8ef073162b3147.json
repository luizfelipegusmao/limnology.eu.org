{"title":"Viability of Spider Silk Proteins in Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1774/v1","date":1724684690000,"content":"Spider silks, renowned for their exceptional mechanical and biocompatible properties, offer significant potential as scaffolds in tissue engineering. This paper explores the feasibility of using spidroins, the primary proteins in spider silk, to develop scaffolds that closely mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) essential for tissue regeneration. Spidroins (spider silk proteins) are particularly valuable due to their unique strength, elasticity, and biocompatibility, which support cellular growth and differentiation. The paper examines current methods for producing recombinant spider silk, including using unicellular hosts like E. coli and multicellular systems like transgenic plants and silkworms. It also examines current scaffolds that utilize spidroins and their shortcomings, such as immunogenicity and protein production, which must be urgently addressed for more practical and effective widespread biomedical applications. In addition, it stresses the need for further research to solve these challenges and fully realize the potential of spider silk in biomedical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5af90bf46640c0ff2dad055f6add55c6bed757bb4bef9c497b8ef073162b3147","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
