{"title":"A study on smart home use intention of elderly consumers based on technology acceptance models","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300574","date":1711548000000,"content":"<p>by Chengmin Zhou, Yawen Qian, Jake Kaner</p>\r\nPurpose <p>Smart home devices have great potential to improve the quality of life and independence of older people, positively impacting their health, safety, and comfort. However, Chinese research in this field is still in its early stages. Therefore, more comprehensive and in-depth studies are needed to comprehend the various aspects influencing the acceptance and use of smart homes by older users.</p> Patients and methods <p>This study adopted the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and included perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, usage intention, intergenerational technology support, perceived value, and perceived risk as extension variables to delve deeper into the behavioral intentions of older users in smart home services. The study used a convenience sampling method to randomly distribute 236 questionnaires among older adults over the age of 60 in the school’s community and neighboring urban communities who have experience in smart home use and who can complete human-computer interactions either independently or with the help of others, mainly focusing on the four sections: user characteristics, family situation, experience of use, and usage intention. The study used structural equation modeling (SEM) and factor analysis to analyze the completion of questionnaires. Finally, we conducted a validation analysis of the rationality and scientificity of the model and derived the six dimensions of the model of the influencing factors on the use of smart home products by the elderly and the weight sizes of their corresponding 13 influencing factors.</p> Results <p>The results show that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have a positive effect on users’ intention to use smart homes. Perceived ease of use has a positive effect on the perceived usefulness of smart homes. In addition, intergenerational technology support, perceived value, and perceived risk impact users’ perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the smart home.</p> Conclusion <p>This research aims to describe the factors influencing older users’ willingness to use smart homes. The findings are not only significant for the elderly in China but also of broad value to other regions and countries facing similar demographic challenges. The development of smart homes not only involves the elderly but is also closely related to all segments of society. The government should increase policy support and guide more social forces to participate in the development of the smart home industry. Service providers and designers should fully understand the demand situation and user experience of target users to develop easy-to-use smart home solutions. At the same time, smart homes, as intelligent products for the elderly, need to focus not only on the basic needs of the elderly such as material life and home safety, but also on the spiritual needs of elderly users. Children or caregivers should always pay attention to the psychological state of the elderly and actively guide them to use smart homes to help them realize their self-worth. We look forward to more research focusing on this area in the future and further exploring the specific issues and solutions involved.</p>","author":"Chengmin Zhou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a7c4c2e0fe1755677961b533d91e988a906f0bd3393c22a0fa10d7a0e5d935ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
