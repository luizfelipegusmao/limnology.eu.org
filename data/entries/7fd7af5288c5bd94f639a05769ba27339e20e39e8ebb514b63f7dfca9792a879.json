{"title":"Feasibility of using colorimetric devices for whole and ground coffee roasting degrees prediction","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13376?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Coffee roasting is one of the crucial steps in obtaining a high-quality product as it forms the product's color and flavor characteristics. Roast control is made by visual inspection or traditional instruments such as the Agtron spectrophotometer, which can have high implementation costs. Therefore, the present study evaluated colorimetric approaches (a bench colorimeter, smartphone digital images, and a colorimetric sensor) to predict the Agtron roasting degrees of whole and ground coffee. Two calibration approaches were assessed, that is, multiple linear regression and least-squares support vector machine. For that, 70 samples of whole and ground roasted coffees comprising the Agtron roasting range were prepared.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that all three colorimetric acquisition types were efficient for the model building, but the bench colorimeter and the smartphone digital images generally performed with good determination coefficients and low errors as measured by external validation. For the whole bean coffee, the best model presented a determination coefficient (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup>) of 0.99 and a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 1.91%, while <i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> of 0.99 and RMSE of 0.87% was obtained for ground coffee, both using the colorimeter.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The obtained models presented good prediction capability, as assessed by external validation and randomization tests. The obtained findings point to an alternative for coffee roasting monitoring that can lead to higher digitalization and local control of the process, even for smaller producers, due to its lower costs. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Fabiana de Carvalho Pires, \nYhan da Silva Mutz, \nThaís Cristina Lima de Carvalho, \nNatasha Dantas Lorenzo, \nRosemary Gualberto Fonseca Alvarenga Pereira, \nRoney Alves da Rocha, \nCleiton Antônio Nunes","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"7fd7af5288c5bd94f639a05769ba27339e20e39e8ebb514b63f7dfca9792a879","category":"Environment"}
