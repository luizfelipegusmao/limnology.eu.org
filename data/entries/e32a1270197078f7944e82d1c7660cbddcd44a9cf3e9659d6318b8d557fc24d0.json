{"title":"Reengineering Pediatric Services with Results-Based Financing: Evidence from Northern Uganda","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1665/v1","date":1719224490000,"content":"Results-Based Financing (RBF) in pediatrics, in regions with scarce resources like Northern Uganda, provides an innovative approach to enhancing healthcare delivery. RBF aligns financial incentives with desired health outcomes, boosting service quality, efficiency, and effectiveness by tying compensation to achieving specific, measurable health targets.\nLacor and Kalongo hospitals, before the introduction of RBF, faced numerous challenges, including limited resources, staffing shortages, and inconsistent quality of care. RBF adoption requires critical health outcomes to target, such as lowering child mortality rates, enhancing vaccination coverage, and increasing the frequency of timely prenatal care visits.\nThe empirical application of RBF in pediatric services at Lacor and Kalongo Hospital from 2018 to 2024 shows improved healthcare quality and outcomes. Healthcare systems can identify ways to implement RBF models better, ensuring that financial incentives effectively contribute to attaining superior health outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e32a1270197078f7944e82d1c7660cbddcd44a9cf3e9659d6318b8d557fc24d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
