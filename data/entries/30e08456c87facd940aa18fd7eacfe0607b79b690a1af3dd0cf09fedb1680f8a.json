{"title":"Spatial-Temporal Evolution on Trade-Offs and Synergy of Suburban Rural Landscape Production-Living-Ecological Functions: A Case Study of Jiashan in the Yangtze River Delta Eco-Green Integrated Development Demonstration Zone, China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2047/v1","date":1721904793000,"content":"The economic development of the Yangtze River Delta region is in a stage of rapid growth. As a unique intersection of urban and rural functions, contradictions are prominent. The production, life, and ecological functions of suburban rural landscapes are forming a new trade-off and synergistic relationship. The planning policy of the Yangtze River Delta from 2021 to 2035 aims to achieve the coordinated development of ecology, economy, and people's lives in the suburban areas of the Yangtze River Delta. To evaluate the current status of the “production-living-ecological” functions of suburban rural areas in the Yangtze River Delta region and provide data support for future planning decisions in the Yangtze River Delta region, this study selected the suburban rural landscape of Jiashan as the research object and used temporal rank correlation analysis and spatial bivariate autocorrelation analysis to explore the evolution characteristics of the suburban rural landscape of Jiashan from 2000 to 2020. The results show that (1) the linear increase of the production function and life function of Jiashan rural areas has led to a decline in ecological functions, especially a decline in life functions. (2) There is a trade-off and synergistic relationship between the different functions of the suburban rural landscape of Jiashan, showing a temporal change pattern dominated by trade-offs. (3) The multifunctional trade-off and synergistic relationship of the suburban rural landscape in Jiashan County exhibited obvious spatial pattern variability, which was manifested as the evolution from street-centered areas to compatibility-trade-trade-off and from town-centered areas to compatibility-synergy-trade-off. The relevant policies for the construction of ecological green comprehensive demonstration areas affect the economic, social, and ecological development of the Yangtze River Delta region, resulting in substantial differences in the types and trends of the spatiotemporal evolution of the functional trade-off and synergistic relationship of suburban rural landscape. Targeted measures should be taken according to local conditions to guide the coordinated development of landscape functions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30e08456c87facd940aa18fd7eacfe0607b79b690a1af3dd0cf09fedb1680f8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
