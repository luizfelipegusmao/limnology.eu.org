{"title":"Death-associated protein kinase 3 modulates migration and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae401/7755709?rss=1","date":1726099200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Sixteen patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were analyzed using a mass spectrometry (MS)-based kinase inhibitor pull-down assay (KIPA), leading to the observation that death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3) is significantly and specifically overexpressed in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models. Validation studies confirmed enrichment of DAPK3 protein, in both TNBC cell lines and tumors, independent of mRNA levels. Genomic knockout of <span>DAPK3</span> in TNBC cell lines inhibited in vitro migration and invasion, along with down-regulation of an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature, which was confirmed in vivo. The kinase and leucine-zipper domains within DAPK3 were shown by a mutational analysis to be essential for functionality. Notably, DAPK3 was found to inhibit the levels of desmoplakin (DSP), a crucial component of the desmosome complex, thereby explaining the observed migration and invasion effects. Further exploration with immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry (IP–MS) identified that leucine-zipper protein 1 (LUZP1) is a preferential binding partner of DAPK3. LUZP1 engages in a leucine-zipper domain–mediated interaction that protects DAPK3 from proteasomal degradation. Thus, the DAPK3/LUZP1 heterodimer emerges as a newly discovered regulator of EMT/desmosome components that promote TNBC cell migration.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"05d7bff679e59068412f88ac257a254fd4ce0dd8dd5140fa5418f219e36e6345","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
