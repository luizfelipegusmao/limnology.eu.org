{"title":"Possible Mechanisms and Strategies for Immune Therapy Resistance in Gastric Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1478/v1","date":1726739399000,"content":"Gastric cancer has become one of the most common cancers in the world.Immunotherapy, especially immune point inhibitors targeting programmed cell death 1 or its ligand PD-L1, has been successfully applied in the clinical treatment of GC. However, only a small number of cancer patients experience persistent clinical responses during immunotherapy. In this review, we discussed the current status of immunotherapy for colorectal cancer, elucidated the mechanisms mediating immunotherapy resistance, predicted biomarkers for immunotherapy resistance, and strategies for improving immunotherapy efficacy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1186c45748fa0cb9a4d9a7fcc838bde0221fa4e04d4cedbeaf925c1c33a4813","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
