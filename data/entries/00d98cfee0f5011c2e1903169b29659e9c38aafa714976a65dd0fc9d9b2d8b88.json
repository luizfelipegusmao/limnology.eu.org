{"title":"Efficacy and Tolerability of Radiosurgery in Treating Benign Meningioma: A Dose Comparison Study from a Single-Center Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1090/v1","date":1713357646000,"content":"This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the impact of radiation dose on the outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for benign meningiomas and determine an optimal dosing strategy for balancing tumor control and treatment-related toxicity. Clinical data of 147 patients with 164 lesions treated between 2014 and 2022 were reviewed. Primary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), local control rate (LCR), and radiation-induced toxicity, with secondary outcomes focusing on LCR and radiation-induced peritumoral edema (PTE) in two dose groups (â‰¥14 Gy and &amp;lt;14 Gy). Results revealed a median follow-up duration of 47 months, with 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year PFS rates of 99.3%, 96.7%, and 93.8% respectively, and an overall LCR of 95.1%. Radiation-induced toxicity was observed in 24.5% of patients, primarily presenting mild symptoms. Notably, no significant difference in LCR was found between the two dose groups (P = 0.628), while Group 2 (&amp;lt;14 Gy) exhibited significantly lower PTE (P = 0.039). The study concludes that SRS with a radiation dose &amp;lt;14 Gy demonstrates comparable tumor control with reduced toxicity, advocating for consideration of such dosing to achieve a balance between therapeutic efficacy and safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00d98cfee0f5011c2e1903169b29659e9c38aafa714976a65dd0fc9d9b2d8b88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
