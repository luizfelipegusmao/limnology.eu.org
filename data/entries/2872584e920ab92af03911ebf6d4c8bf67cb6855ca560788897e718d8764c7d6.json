{"title":"Plant iron status regulates ammonium-use efficiency through protein N-glycosylation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1712/7613806?rss=1","date":1708732800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Improving nitrogen-use efficiency is an important path toward enhancing crop yield and alleviating the environmental impacts of fertilizer use. Ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) is the energetically preferred inorganic N source for plants. The interaction of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> with other nutrients is a chief determinant of ammonium-use efficiency (AUE) and of the tipping point toward ammonium toxicity, but these interactions have remained ill-defined. Here, we report that iron (Fe) accumulation is a critical factor determining AUE and have identified a substance that can enhance AUE by manipulating Fe availability. Fe accumulation under NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> nutrition induces NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> efflux in the root system, reducing both growth and AUE in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). Low external availability of Fe and a low plant Fe status substantially enhance protein N-glycosylation through a Vitamin C1-independent pathway, thereby reducing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> efflux to increase AUE during the vegetative stage in <span>Arabidopsis</span> under elevated NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> supply. We confirm the validity of the iron–ammonium interaction in the important crop species lettuce (<span>Lactuca sativa</span>). We further show that dolomite can act as an effective substrate to subdue Fe accumulation under NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> nutrition by reducing the expression of <span>Low Phosphate Root 2</span> and acidification of the rhizosphere. Our findings present a strategy to improve AUE and reveal the underlying molecular–physiological mechanism.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"2872584e920ab92af03911ebf6d4c8bf67cb6855ca560788897e718d8764c7d6","category":"Environment"}
