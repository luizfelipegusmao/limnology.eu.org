{"title":"Assessment of the Quality of Soil and Environmental Impact for Netrokona Sadar in Mymensingh Using Satellite Imaging and Soil Mapping with GIS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1357/v1","date":1729230599000,"content":"Netrokona is a district of the Mymensingh division in northern Bangladesh. In this study, we analyze the soil profile in Netrokona Sadar using digital soil mapping and land formation using the satellite image technique. This study also analyzes the soil profile using remote sensing data of 4 different points in selected area. The main focus of the study is analyzing the soil profile for the structural compatibility and environmental impact for that. After analyzing the soil we found that the soil of that area is mainly clay loam and clayey loam and the soil contains low coarse fragement which is 5.6-8% but we need al least 15-30% coarse fragement in the soil. The soil of this area needs good management to improve its drainage and bearing capacity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ceab5fc5afa14615217f607145c64415248265927c46b825c3e42084126795aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
