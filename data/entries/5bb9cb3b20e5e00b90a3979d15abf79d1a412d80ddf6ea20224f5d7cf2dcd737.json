{"title":"Study protocol: Examining sexual and reproductive health literacy in Mexican American young women using a positive deviance approach","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303974","date":1716472800000,"content":"<p>by Lindsay M.

Yet, some individuals in these groups demonstrate higher health literacy and better health outcomes. These exceptional cases exemplify ‘positive deviance’ because they have found ways to be successful where others have not. Identifying the methods, practices, and resources that these individuals have used to gain health literacy and healthcare access may have generalized application to improve health literacy, access to care, and health outcomes. Using the Integrated Model of Health Literacy, the main objectives of this study are to (1) identify facilitators, barriers, and strategies to gain sexual and reproductive health literacy and healthcare access and (2) to explore each of the core domains of health literacy as they relate to successful access of sexual and reproductive healthcare services among individuals identified as positive deviants. For the purposes of this mixed methods community engaged study, positive deviants are defined as Mexican American young women aged 18–29 years old living in Rural Western New York who have accessed sexual and reproductive healthcare within the past year. A community advisory committee will be formed to provide community-engaged guidance and support for the recruitment of participants. Positive deviants will participate in a survey and semi-structured interview. Data collection and analysis will be simultaneous and iterative. Results will provide evidence of positive deviant methods, practices, and strategies to gain health literacy and access to sexual and reproductive healthcare. Findings may reveal characteristics and patterns in the relationship of health literacy and healthcare access that can inform interventions to improve health literacy and make healthcare more accessible for this demographic group and context.","author":"Lindsay M.
