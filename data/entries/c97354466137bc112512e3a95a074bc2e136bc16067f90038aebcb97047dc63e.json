{"title":"The Intertwined Epidemics: Comorbidity of Substance Abuse and Psychiatric Disorders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0183/v1","date":1727871317000,"content":"Substance abuse and psychiatric disorders are two prevalent and interrelated public health concerns that often coexist, leading to complex clinical scenarios. This comorbidity poses significant challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and understanding the causal relationships between the two conditions. Frequently, one disorder is neglected in favor of the other, and misconceptions abound regarding which condition precipitates the other. This article explores the common comorbidity of substance abuse and psychiatric disorders, delving into the prevalence, diagnostic challenges, treatment implications, and the bidirectional nature of causality. By examining current research and clinical practice, we aim to shed light on the misconceptions and emphasize the need for integrated approaches to effectively address both conditions concurrently.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c97354466137bc112512e3a95a074bc2e136bc16067f90038aebcb97047dc63e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
