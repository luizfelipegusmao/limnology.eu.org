{"title":"Impact of Comorbidities and the Duration of Mechanical Venti-Lation on Outcomes of Surgical Patients with Isolated Candida Species in the Intensive Care Unit: A Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1342/v1","date":1713519897000,"content":"Abstract: Comorbidities of patients may be related to the duration of mechanical ventilation, survival, and Candida isolation during intensive care unit (ICU) stay. To examine the frequency of Candida isolation and significant comorbidities in the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in Osijek University Hospital, Croatia, the data from the electronic database from May 2016 to June 30, 2023, were analyzed. In a cross-sectional study examining 15,790 microbiological samples, different strains of Candida were observed in 581 samples from 236 patients. The control group was 160 consecutive patients from March-May 2019, and 161 in the same months of 2020 (pre- and post-COVID-19). Comorbidities, duration of mechanical ventilation and survival were compared. Patients with isolated Candida were more often non-elective, had significantly more heart, kidney, liver diseases and sepsis (P&lt;0.001). The duration of mechanical ventilation was 9.2 [2.2-9.24], 96 [24-146], 160 [19.5-343] and 224 [73.5-510] hours in controls, and patients with Candida albicans, non-albicans, and in patients with ³2 Candidas isolated. The mortality was significantly higher and reached 42% in patients with Candida isolated, while in the control group, it was 19% (P&lt;0.001). In a multivariate analysis adjusted for patient’s age, SAPS II score, days of ICU, and type of admission, only sepsis was independent predictor of mortality (OR = 2.27).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"357791eb4e09f259ecdcb402c38cf0088a993856acc1909d231163e4df20f689","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
