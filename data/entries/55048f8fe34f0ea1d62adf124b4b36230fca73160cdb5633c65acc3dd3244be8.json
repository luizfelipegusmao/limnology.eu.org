{"title":"CircIQCH Contributes to the Progression of Breast Cancer by Elevating NFIB Through Decoying miR‐139‐5p","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24358?af=R","date":1718607600000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are implicated in the progression of breast cancer (BC). However, the explorations on circRNA IQ motif containing H (circIQCH) in BC progression remain limited. Functional experiments were conducted using in vitro and murine xenograft model assays, respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay detected the associations among circIQCH, miR-139-5p, and nuclear factor IB (NFIB). CircIQCH was upregulated in BC, and the silencing of circIQCH repressed BC cell growth, metastasis, and autophagy, arrested cell cycle, promoted cell apoptosis in vitro, and blocked tumor growth in vivo. CircIQCH positively modulated NFIB expression by sponging miR-139-5p. Moreover, the deletion of miR-139-5p abated the action of circIQCH deficiency on BC cell malignant behaviors. Overexpression of miR-139-5p repressed the malignant characteristics of BC cells, while these impacts were abolished by elevating NFIB. Collectively, CircIQCH functioned as an oncogene in BC through upregulating NFIB expression by sponging miR-139-5p.</p>","author":"Yi Shang, \nXiaolong Li, \nQianqian Du, \nYang Zhao, \nYing Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"55048f8fe34f0ea1d62adf124b4b36230fca73160cdb5633c65acc3dd3244be8","category":"Environment"}
