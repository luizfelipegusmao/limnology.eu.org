{"title":"First evidence of prickly shark, Echinorhinus cookei Pietschmann 1928, aggregation on seamounts in the eastern Pacific, Panama","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15720?af=R","date":1719289824000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In May 2022, twelve prickly sharks, <i>Echinorhinus cookei</i> Pietschmann 1928, were sighted at 151–350 m depth in the Cordillera de Coiba seamounts, Pacific Panama. This discovery expands our knowledge of the distribution and habitat use of this rare deep-sea species. It underscores the potential significance of the Cordillera de Coiba seamounts, an offshore marine protected area, as a critical habitat for <i>E. cookei</i>, a species threatened by commercial fishing. Although unverified reports exist on its presence in the tropical eastern Pacific, this publication represents the first documented record of live specimens of <i>E. cookei</i> in Panama.</p>","author":"Hector M.
