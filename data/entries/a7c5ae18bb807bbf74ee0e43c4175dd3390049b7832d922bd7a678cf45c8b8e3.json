{"title":"Improving the Prognostic and Predictive Value of CTC Enumeration: Is Longitudinal Monitoring the Answer?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0768/v1","date":1726018852000,"content":"CTC numbers in the blood of cancer patients can indicate the progression and invasiveness of tumors and their prognostic and predictive value has been repeatedly demonstrated. However, the standard baseline CTC count at the beginning of treatment, while informative, is not completely reliable and may not adequately reflect the state of the disease. The growing number of studies indicate that long-term monitoring of CTC numbers in the same patient provides more comprehensive prognostic data and should be incorporated into clinical practice, as a factor that contributes to therapeutic decisions. This Review describes the current status of CTC enumeration as a prognostic and predictive factor, highlights the shortcomings of current solutions and advocates for longitudinal CTC analysis as a more effective method of the evaluation of developing disease, treatment efficacy, and long term-monitoring of the minimal residual disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7c5ae18bb807bbf74ee0e43c4175dd3390049b7832d922bd7a678cf45c8b8e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
