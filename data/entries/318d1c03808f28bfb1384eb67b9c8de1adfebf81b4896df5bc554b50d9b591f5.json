{"title":"Effects of N levels on land productivity and N2O emissions in maize–soybean relay intercropping","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13709?af=R","date":1720529374000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Relay intercropping of maize and soybean can improve land productivity. However, the mechanism behind N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in this practice remains unclear. A two-factor randomized block field trial was conducted to reveal the mechanism of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in a full additive maize–soybean relay intercropping. Factor A was three cropping systems – that is, monoculture maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.), monoculture soybean (<i>Glycine max</i> L. Merr.) and maize–soybean relay intercropping. Factor B was different N supply, containing no N, reduced N and conventional N. Differences in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, soil properties, rhizosphere bacterial communities and yield advantage were evaluated.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The land equivalent ratio was 1.55–2.44, and the cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emission (CEN2O$$ \\mathrm{C}{\\mathrm{E}}_{{\\mathrm{N}}_2\\mathrm{O}} $$) was notably lower by 60.2% in intercropping than in monoculture, respectively. Reduced N declined CEN2O$$ \\mathrm{C}{\\mathrm{E}}_{{\\mathrm{N}}_2\\mathrm{O}} $$ without penalty on the yield advantages. The relay intercropping shifted soil properties – for example, soil organic matter, total N, NH4+$$ {\\mathrm{NH}}_4^{+} $$ and protease activity – and improved the soil microorganism community – for example, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. Intercropping reduced CEN2O$$ \\mathrm{C}{\\mathrm{E}}_{{\\mathrm{N}}_2\\mathrm{O}} $$ by directly suppressing <i>nirS</i>- and <i>amoA</i>-regulated N<sub>2</sub>O generation during soil N cycling, or <i>nirS-</i> and <i>amoA</i>-mediated soil properties shifted to reduce CEN2O$$ \\mathrm{C}{\\mathrm{E}}_{{\\mathrm{N}}_2\\mathrm{O}} $$ indirectly. Reduced N directly reduced CEN2O$$ \\mathrm{C}{\\mathrm{E}}_{{\\mathrm{N}}_2\\mathrm{O}} $$ by decreasing soil N content and reducing soil microorganism activities to alleviate N<sub>2</sub>O produced in soil N cycling.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Conducting a full additive maize–soybean relay intercropping with reduced nitrogen supply provides a way to alleviate N<sub>2</sub>O emissions without the penalty on the yield advantage by changing rhizosphere bacterial communities and soil N cycling. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Zhidan Fu, \nPing Chen, \nYuze Li, \nKai Luo, \nPing Lin, \nYiling Li, \nHuan Yang, \nXiaoting Yuan, \nXinyue Peng, \nLida Yang, \nTian Pu, \nYushan Wu, \nXiaochun Wang, \nWenyu Yang, \nTaiwen Yong","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"318d1c03808f28bfb1384eb67b9c8de1adfebf81b4896df5bc554b50d9b591f5","category":"Environment"}
