{"title":"Effectiveness of Diachasmimorpha longicaudata in Killing Ceratitis capitata Larvae Infesting Commercial Fruits in Dryland Agroecosystems of Western Argentina","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1702/v1","date":1727142605000,"content":"Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (medfly) strongly affects Argentinean fruit production and export. Augmentative biological control using the exotic parasitoid Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) is currently applied. The ability to find and parasitize medfly larvae on a wide diversity of fruit host species is a key issue to be analyzed. This research assessed the effect of the physical features of fruit on the preference of foraging D. longicaudata females and the influence of varying release density on parasitoid performance as a pest mortality factor in three fruit species. Trials were performed inside field cages under semi-arid environmental conditions in Argentina's central–western fruit-growing region. Sweet orange, peach, and fig were tested. Fruits were inoculated with third-instar larvae of the Vienna-8 temperature-sensitive lethal medfly strain. Naïve, 5-d-old mated D. longicaudata females were released in cages at 20, 40, 80 and 160 parasitoid densities. The highest levels of medfly mortality and parasitoid emergence were recorded in fig and peach, although D. longicaudata also induced mortality in orange, a fruit with few physical features favorable to parasitism. The medfly mortality in all fruit host species significantly increased with increased parasitoid females released into field cages. Diachsmimorpha longicaudata has high potential as a medfly biocontrol agent.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"47ee0f0770b1c8c1468f6133aaec21906eedadac7152759abb07c97dd13b12da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
