{"title":"What is going on inside of phytochrome B photobodies?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2065/7632794?rss=1","date":1710979200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants exhibit an enormous phenotypic plasticity to adjust to changing environmental conditions. For this purpose, they have evolved mechanisms to detect and measure biotic and abiotic factors in their surroundings. Phytochrome B exhibits a dual function, since it serves as a photoreceptor for red and far-red light as well as a thermosensor. In 1999, it was first reported that phytochromes not only translocate into the nucleus but also form subnuclear foci upon irradiation by red light. It took more than 10 years until these phytochrome speckles received their name; these foci were coined photobodies to describe unique phytochrome-containing subnuclear domains that are regulated by light. Since their initial discovery, there has been much speculation about the significance and function of photobodies. Their presumed roles range from pure experimental artifacts to waste deposits or signaling hubs. In this review, we summarize the newest findings about the meaning of phyB photobodies for light and temperature signaling. Recent studies have established that phyB photobodies are formed by liquid-liquid phase separation via multivalent interactions and that they provide diverse functions as biochemical hotspots to regulate gene expression on multiple levels.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"0d208c8fed6bd0c52022711d0ab16ecf2802e68a8b236c00e97bcc3883c275fc","category":"Environment"}
