{"title":"Sensitivity Analysis and Filtering of Machinable Parts Using Density-Based Topology Optimization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0887/v1","date":1718247332000,"content":"Topology optimization has become a very popular design tool when an optimum design with a concrete objective and subjected to several restrictions is searched. However, the resultant shape of the optimization process isn’t usually easy to manufacture with a typical manufacturing method as machining, being necessary an interpretation and validation of the result; besides, some parameters can be chosen, and the final shape is directly dependent on them. In this paper, a sensitivity analysis of the main parameters involved in 3D topology optimization, the penalization and the filter radius, is carried out for the concrete case of the density-based method, analyzing how manufacturable the results are for 3 axis machining. Also, a new filter and method is proposed for obtaining highly manufacturable and low interpretable parts. The main aim of the study is to help designers to choose the more appropriate parameters and showing what they must have into account for obtaining the desired optimized shapes. Note that the density-based topology optimization method has been chosen due to its popularity in commercial packages, so the conclusions may have direct applications in designers’ work. Finally, the results of the study are verified through different cases for checking the validity of the conclusions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6253442d384f3eb9356e11582aeb12a7621e0541e2574cab7b79059f6f883d3a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
