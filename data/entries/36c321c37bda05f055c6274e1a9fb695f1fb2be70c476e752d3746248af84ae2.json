Plastidial proteins predominantly originate in the nucleus and must traverse membrane-bound multiprotein translocons to access these organelles. This import process is meticulously regulated by chloroplast-targeting peptides (cTPs). Whereas many cTPs have been employed to guide recombinantly expressed functional proteins to chloroplasts, there is a critical need for more efficient cTPs. Here, we performed a comprehensive exploration and comparative assessment of an advanced suite of cTPs exhibiting superior targeting capabilities. We employed a multifaceted approach encompassing computational prediction, in planta expression, fluorescence tracking, and in vitro chloroplast import studies to identify and analyze 88 cTPs associated with <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutants with phenotypes linked to chloroplast function. These polypeptides exhibited distinct abilities to transport green fluorescent protein (GFP) to various compartments within leaf cells, particularly chloroplasts. A highly efficient cTP derived from <i>Arabidopsis</i> plastid ribosomal protein L35 (At2g24090) displayed remarkable effectiveness in chloroplast localization. This cTP facilitated the activities of chloroplast-targeted RNA-processing proteins and metabolic enzymes within plastids. This cTP could serve as an ideal transit peptide for precisely targeting biomolecules to plastids, leading to advancements in plastid engineering.","author":"Chonprakun Thagun","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"36c321c37bda05f055c6274e1a9fb695f1fb2be70c476e752d3746248af84ae2","category":"Environment"}
