For the first time â€“ the tertiary acetamide 2, precursor of 1, was synthesized by using commercially available starting materials. The structure of 1 was unquestionably confirmed by 1H-, 13C-, 2D-NMR-, IR- spectroscopy and mass-spectrometry. Its optical properties were also studied.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"afa78e6df595249473bfba1538fb85a69e22f4b64fb4f6d1555d996c69076982","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
