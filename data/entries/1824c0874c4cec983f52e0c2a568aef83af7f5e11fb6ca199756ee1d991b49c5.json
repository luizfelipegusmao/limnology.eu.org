{"title":"Agricultural Decision-Making Concerning Crop Selection Using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in Trakya Region of TÃ¼rkiye","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0776/v1","date":1720526527000,"content":"The Thrace region in Turkey is an important region where production suitable for irrigated agriculture such as sugar beet, paddy, sunflower and corn is widely carried out. Producers in the region have to decide on the product they will produce every year. A large number of factors that can affect decision-making in agricultural production can affect the outcome of the farmers. Therefore, it is necessary to have a decision-making process that can facilitate access to information and decision-making. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a valuable decision-making methodology that can be applied not only in agricultural production but also in many other areas. \nThis study evaluates four products with the AHP method according to the criteria by surveying 271 producers in the area. The aim is to determine the most suitable products for planting in these areas. We found that rice is the product that provides the highest profit. The AHP model used in this study primarily serves to determine the importance levels of various criteria and demonstrates its effectiveness as a decision-making tool in product selection when the correct criteria are applied","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1824c0874c4cec983f52e0c2a568aef83af7f5e11fb6ca199756ee1d991b49c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
