{"title":"Comprehensive analyses and experimental verification of NETs and an EMT gene signature for prognostic prediction, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24082?af=R","date":1709898124000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is an aggressive malignancy with high mortality and poor prognosis. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) significantly influence on the progression of various cancers. However, the underlying relevance of NETs- and EMT-associated genes on the outcomes of patients with PAAD remains to be elucidated. Transcriptome RNA sequencing data, together with clinical information and single-cell sequencing data of PAAD were collected from public databases. In the TCGA-PAAD cohort, ssGSEA was used to calculate NET and EMT scores. WGCNA was used to determine the key gene modules. A risk model with eight NET- and EMT-related genes (NERGs) was established using LASSO and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Patients in the reduced risk (RR) group showed better prognostic values compared with those in the elevated risk (ER) group. The prognostic model exhibited reliable and robust prediction when validated using an external database. The distributions of risk genes were explored in a single-cell sequencing data set. Immune infiltration, immune cycle, and immune checkpoints were compared between the RR and ER groups. Moreover, potential chemotherapeutic drugs were examined. DCBLD2 was identified as a key gene in PAAD cell lines by qRT-PCR, and was highly expressed in PAAD tissues. GSEA demonstrated that DCBLD2 induced the EMT. Transwell assays and western blotting showed that cell invasion and EMT induction were significantly reduced after DCBLD2 knockdown. Collectively, we constructed a prognosis model based on a NET and EMT gene signature, providing a valuable perspective for the prognostic evaluation and management of PAAD patient.</p>","author":"Jing Zhang, \nChaochen Wang, \nYaqun Yu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"0ee3fc76bad47f62246d84f0d95094c9f2d3d758bda1fee2c46470d46753cfa4","category":"Environment"}
