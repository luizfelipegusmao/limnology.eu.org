{"title":"The Role of Ecology on Urban Landscape: The Case of Antalya-Muratpaşa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1587/v1","date":1716538372000,"content":"Urban ecology is a factor that significantly affects the urban landscape. Proper management and sustainable planning of ecosystems in cities can help urban landscapes to increase biodiversity and contribute to the efficient use of natural resources. In this framework, the integration of green spaces and ecosystem services can improve the quality of urban landscapes by increasing the health and resilience of urban ecosystems. This paper, which examines the effects of ecological factors on urban landscape in Antalya-Muratpaşa, presents a detailed analysis using various data sets. Within the scope of the research, the number of vehicles, carbon emissions by years, the ratio of green areas to population, CORINE data and land surface temperatures were analyzed. In addition, the change in land use from 1990 to 2018 and the land surface temperature forecast for 2040 and 2041 shed light on the evolutionary processes in the city. In an effort to understand the ecological status of Antalya-Muratpaşa, the paper highlights the potential impacts on the sustainability of the urban landscape. In particular, predicting the possible impacts of future land use on the urban landscape with population growth offers a strategic approach in planning processes. This study can be an important resource for urban planners, researchers and local governments because the data in the Antalya-Muratpaşa case provides a comprehensive overview that can guide those who want to consider sustainability and environmental factors in urban landscape planning. In line with this perspective, it is recommended to encourage green roof and green facade practices, rainwater harvesting, gray water recycling, etc. in new constructions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68819b121c6222b134eeb9875d3f23627843c053f39e9c56c3dc48a6006d728e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
