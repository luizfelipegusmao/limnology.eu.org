{"title":"Arabidopsis FIBRILLIN6 influences carotenoid biosynthesis by directly promoting phytoene synthase activity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1662/7422808?rss=1","date":1700006400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Carotenoids are health-promoting plastidial isoprenoids with essential functions in plants as photoprotectants and photosynthetic pigments in chloroplasts. They also accumulate in specialized plastids named chromoplasts, providing color to non-photosynthetic tissues such as flower petals and ripe fruit. Carotenoid accumulation in chromoplasts requires specialized structures and proteins such as fibrillins (FBNs). The FBN family includes structural components of carotenoid sequestering structures in chromoplasts and members with metabolic roles in chloroplasts and other plastid types. However, the association of FBNs with carotenoids in plastids other than chromoplasts has remained unexplored. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) FBN6 interacts with phytoene synthase (PSY), the first enzyme of the carotenoid pathway. FBN6, but not FBN4 (a FBN that does not interact with PSY), enhances the activity of plant PSY (but not of the bacterial PSY crtB) in <span>Escherichia coli</span> cells. Overexpression of FBN6 in <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> leaves results in a higher production of phytoene, the product of PSY activity, whereas loss of FBN6 activity in Arabidopsis mutants dramatically reduces the production of carotenoids during seedling de-etiolation and after exposure to high light. Our work hence demonstrates that FBNs promote not only the accumulation of carotenoids in chromoplasts but also their biosynthesis in chloroplasts.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"40365d1ae649ece6b7aea6d94bcb36121e6f218bab37ac6722dd24f99945d73b","category":"Environment"}
