{"title":"Role of pea protein isolate in modulating pea starch digestibility: insights from physicochemical and microstructural analysis","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13468?af=R","date":1720851246000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Understanding the interactions between protein and starch is crucial in revealing the mechanisms by which protein influences starch digestibility. The present study investigated the impact of different contents of pea protein isolate (PPI) on the physicochemical properties and digestibility of pea starch (PS).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results demonstrated that as the content of PPI increased from 0% to 12%, and the digestion of PS decreased by 12.3%. Rheological analysis indicated that PPI primarily interacted with molecular chains of PS through hydrogen bonds. Increasing the content of PPI resulted in a 30.6% decrease in the hardness of the composite gels, accompanied by a 10% reduction in the short-ordered structure of PS. This hindered the formation of molecular aggregation and resulted in a loose and disordered gel network structure. The microstructure confirmed that the attachment of PPI to PS served as a physical barrier, impeding starch digestibility.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>In summary, the primary mechanism by which PPI inhibited PS digestion involved steric hindrance exerted by PPI and its interaction with PS via hydrogen bonds. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the interaction mechanisms between PS and PPI and offer insights for the optimal utilization of pea resources.
