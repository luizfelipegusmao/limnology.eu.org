The characterization, the simulated <i>in vitro</i> digestion, and the antioxidant activity of these phytol nanoliposomes from the different processes have been studied.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Based on the results of dynamic light scattering (DLS) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC–MS) analysis, P-NL-ZF prepared through the combination of magnetic stirring and HPH exhibited superior encapsulation efficiency at 76.19% and demonstrated exceptional physicochemical stability under a series of conditions, including storage, pH, and ionic in comparison to single method. It was further confirmed that P-NL-ZF by magnetic stirring and HPH displayed a uniform distribution and regular shape through transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed that electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding were the primary driving forces for the formation of composite nanoliposomes. Additionally, an <i>in vitro</i> digestion study revealed that multilayer composite nanoliposomes displayed significant and favorable slow-release properties (58.21%) under gastrointestinal conditions compared with traditional nanoliposomes (82.36%) and free phytol (89.73%). The assessments of chemical and cell-based antioxidant activities demonstrated that the coating of zein/fucoidan on phytol nanoliposomes resulted in enhanced effectiveness in scavenging activity of ABTS free radical and hydroxyl radical and mitigating oxidative damage to HepG2 cells.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Based on our studies, the promising delivery carrier of zein/fucoidan-coated nanoliposomes is contributed to the encapsulation of hydrophobic natural products and enhancement of their biological activity. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yadan Chen, \nYanbin Wang, \nLiang He, \nLiling Wang, \nJianchen Zhao, \nZhenya Yang, \nQin Li, \nRui Shi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"b31d2c315a9eaa6d9593af616c77a608d3ea311007a5bba66904abe78c542f76","category":"Environment"}
