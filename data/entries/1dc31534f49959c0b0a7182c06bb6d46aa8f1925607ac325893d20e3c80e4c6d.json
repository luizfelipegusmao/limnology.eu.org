{"title":"Beyond Distracted Eating: Cognitive Distraction Downregulates Odor Pleasantness and Interacts With Weight Status","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2147/v1","date":1721991779000,"content":"Considering the widespread issue of distracted eating, our study explores how cognitive dis-traction influences the sensory perception of food-related odors among individuals with varying weight statuses. We used the Tetris game to mimic the dynamic nature of real-life cognitive dis-traction. Participants, categorized into a lean and an overweight/obese group based on their body mass index (BMI), rated odor intensity and pleasantness under low and high distraction condi-tions. Respiratory movements were monitored to ensure accurate assessment of sensory percep-tion. No significant effects of distraction on odor intensity ratings were established. However, our findings reveal a significant reduction in odor pleasantness under high cognitive load, more pronounced in lean participants compared to those with overweight. Moreover, we observe an interaction between sex/gender and cognitive distraction effects in odor pleasantness perception. The differential effects of distraction across weight status groups and sex/gender are discussed in the context of hedonic motivations and compensatory mechanisms at play. This study sheds light into the mechanisms of distracted eating from the sensory perspective, that can pave the way for more personalized and effective strategies for promoting healthier eating habits in a world dominated by distractions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1dc31534f49959c0b0a7182c06bb6d46aa8f1925607ac325893d20e3c80e4c6d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
