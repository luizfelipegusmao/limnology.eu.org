{"title":"Sustainability of Automated Manufacturing Systems with Resources by Means of Their Deadlock Prevention","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2131/v1","date":1721963748000,"content":"This paper is devoted to Petri net (PN) based models of Automated Manufacturing Systems (AMS) with resources in order to prevent deadlocks in them. The sustainability can be seen as the process of deadlock-freeness leading to correct and fluent production, because AMS with deadlocks work neither correctly nor fluently, need reconstruction and cause downtime in production. A class S3PR (Systems of Simple Sequential Processes with Resources) of such PN models is well known as to the deadlock prevention point of view. Here, Extended S3PR (ES3PR) will be explored as to modelling and deadlock prevention. While in case of S3PR Ordinary Petri Nets (OPN) were used for these aims, here, for ES3PR Generalized Petri Nets (GPN) are used. The reason for such a procedure is a possible presence of multiplex directed arcs in the structure of PN models of AMS. The significant alternation is that while in former case the elementary and dependent siphons were sufficient for the supervisor synthesis, here, in later case, the GPN and their siphons have to satisfy the max-cs property.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"96c075f55f6b480286f066ef0977349ad8f27b8766a8dd0d067fa856dedb228c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
