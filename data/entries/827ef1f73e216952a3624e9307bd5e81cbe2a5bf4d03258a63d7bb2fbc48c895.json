Known ocean conservation measures do not show the desired fast results counteracting deoxygenation. The new infrastructure related to the coastal production of renewable energies linked to the production of green hydrogen can provide new possibilities of artificial ocean reoxygenation to mitigate coastal hypoxia, but has to be treated urgently and seriously from different scientific, engineering and socio-economic angles.</p>\n<br />","author":"Patricia Handmann, \nDouglas Wallace","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"827ef1f73e216952a3624e9307bd5e81cbe2a5bf4d03258a63d7bb2fbc48c895","category":"Environment"}
