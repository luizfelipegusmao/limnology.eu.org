{"title":"Profiling Circular RNA Expression Across 11 Tissues in the Marine Gastropod Rapana venosa","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/4118218?af=R","date":1728306242000,"content":"<p>The carnivorous marine gastropod, <i>Rapana venosa</i>, also known as the veined rapa whelk, has recently gained considerable attention due to its dual significance as both a valuable commercial seafood resource and a biological invader with widespread ecological implications. Significant efforts have been made to investigate the molecular pathways governing the specific adaptations in <i>R. venosa</i>. However, the regulatory mechanisms of these pathways remain largely unclear. Circular RNA (circRNA), a newly-recognized class of non-coding molecules, plays crucial roles in post-transcriptional regulation, impacting various fundamental bioprocesses including development, cell cycle, immunity and disease pathogenesis. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive genome wide profiling of circRNAs across 11 tissues of <i>R. venosa</i>. We identified a total of 1214 circRNA genes across tissues, with 640 regarded as high-confidence candidates. circRNAs displayed overall low expression levels, diverse isoform types and dynamic expression patterns across various tissues. Our comparative analyses revealed a few circRNA genes with a great diversity of isoforms and abundant expression in the salivary gland, suggesting potential roles in the feeding process of <i>R. venosa</i>. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated the potential involvement of commonly expressed circRNAs in fundamental cellular processes, including cell division, amide biosynthesis and cellular response to hormone stimuli. Our study describes a preliminary examination of circRNAs across various tissues of <i>R. venosa</i>, offering a foundation for future research into the molecular mechanisms that influence the biology, ecology and behaviour of marine gastropods.</p>","author":"Mingwei Hong, \nZixia Huang, \nChristyn Bailey","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"27e7078ce8ff972bdd3e39fc2b30dd5a158fb69bc7632a5e78c0508530d3fa2a","category":"Environment"}
