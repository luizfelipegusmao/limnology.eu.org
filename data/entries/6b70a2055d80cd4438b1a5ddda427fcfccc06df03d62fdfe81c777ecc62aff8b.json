{"title":"Evaluation of Physiological and Biochemical Reactions of Pleurotus ostreatus Cultivated in Varied Juncao Grass Substrates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0151/v1","date":1719901237000,"content":"Background:  Pleurotus ostreutus is one of the worldâ€™s most commonly consumed mushrooms. Cultivation of mushrooms using wood resources usually results in environmental issues of deforestation. Juncao grass Pennisetum sp, Arundo Donax, and Methodology: Miscanthus are the culture mediums used in this research which offered a composting system most particularly for a simple formulation, cheap and feasible for small farms in cultivating oyster mushrooms. \nResults: The present study assessed the different junco grass as a substrate for growing Pleurotus ostreatus given the enzyme activities, growth, and yields. In addition, on the other hand, Lignin peroxidase (LiP) was the most active enzyme in each culture material among the other enzyme activities expressed differently between substrate and growing stages. Fruiting bodies harvested on giant grass,Arundo donax,and miscanthus,substrate weighed 159.2g/bag,132g/bag, and 65.1g/bag on average respectively. The biological efficiency of pleurotus cultivated in three different substrates was 75.2%, 63.4%, and 28.7%, respectively. Lignin peroxidase (LiP) was the most active enzyme followed by Laccase in each substrate. At the same time, other enzyme activities were differently expressed between substrate and different developmental stages. Nutrient analysis revealed significant variations, with differences in polysaccharides, proteins, and amino acids among substrates as well as the presence of heavy metals as arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium content in all samples was within safe limits.\n Conclusion: Findings from this study will serve as a solid foundation for future studies aimed at characterizing different substrate responses on enzyme activity. This research provides a sustainable footprint for subsequent research promoting eco-friendly mushroom production. The obtained results indicate that Arundo donax should be a good substrate in place of giant grass, using miscanthus is not productive based on the results obtained in this research the juncao grasses offer a sustainable approach that reduces reliance on wood-based substrates and enhances environmental sustainability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b70a2055d80cd4438b1a5ddda427fcfccc06df03d62fdfe81c777ecc62aff8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
