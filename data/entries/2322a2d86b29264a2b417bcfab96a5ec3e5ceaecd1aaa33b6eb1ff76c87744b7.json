{"title":"Discussion on a Non-traditional Antigravity theoryAnd the Realization Path Is Envisaged","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0608/v1","date":1712653536000,"content":"The paper proposes a viewpoint that a mass point moving in a horizontal circle on the Earth's surface can generate a radial centrifugal force in the center of the earth, Thus, an unconventional anti-gravity approach is realized. Through the theoretical analysis of the difference in the distribution of the Earth's gravitational acceleration, And the centrifugal force of a mass point moving in a horizontal circle on the Earth's surface was analyzed, The establishment of the argument is demonstrated. At the same time, it puts forward two possible basic principles and makes theoretical analysis and demonstration. In this paper, four schemes are proposed to realize anti-gravity ascent by using the geocentric radial centrifugal force of a mass point moving in a horizontal circle , and the basic analysis is made. On the premise of not fully considering the practical technical ability, it is theoretically proved that three of them have realistic operability and development potential. In theory, this paper opens up a different way of anti-gravity for human beings, which will bring new ideas and prospects for human beings to get rid of the bondage of gravity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2322a2d86b29264a2b417bcfab96a5ec3e5ceaecd1aaa33b6eb1ff76c87744b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
