{"title":"The &lsquo;Torpedo&rsquo; as a Passive Water Sampler for the Detection of Avian Influenza Viruses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0415/v1","date":1728280304000,"content":"A novel utilization of passive samplers has emerged as a promising method for rapidly assessing the presence of Avian Influenza Virus (AIV), particularly H5N1, which is known for its shedding from infected birds. The passive torpedo sampler procedure for identifying presence of AIV, a carryover from the successful technology used to monitor COVID concentrations in wastewater, is demonstrated in application for detection of AIV. While the potential benefits of the application of this technology are significant, challenges remain that must be addressed to maximize its effectiveness. H5N1 poses a substantial risk due to its ability to survive in the environment for extended periods, with infected birds excreting the virus in feces and saliva for up to ten days. By leveraging this advanced sampling technique, the opportunity exists to enhance surveillance efforts and better understand the dynamics of this virus in avian populations. The torpedo approach for detection of AIV viruses has the potential to increase the surveillance coverage, is less expensive than current procedures, and provides the opportunity for improved accessibility and spatial coverage of areas near chicken barns.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7297ce29830f8442ee4d18c66482010a9448ff6fa86108f761981a8dc99625e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
