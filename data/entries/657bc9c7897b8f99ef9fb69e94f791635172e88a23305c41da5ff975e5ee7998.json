{"title":"Exploring the causal relationship between antihypertensive drugs and glioblastoma by combining drug target Mendelian randomization study, eQTL colocalization, and single‐cell RNA sequencing","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24210?af=R","date":1715774307000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Recent reports indicate a potential oncogenic role of antihypertensive drugs in common cancers. However, it remains uncertain whether this phenomenon influences the risk of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). This study aimed to assess the potential causal effects of blood pressure (BP) and antihypertensive drugs on GBM. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and GBM in Europeans were downloaded. To represent the effects of antihypertensive drugs, we utilized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with SBP/DBP adjacent to the coding regions of different antihypertensive drugs as instrumental variables to model five antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, β-receptor blockers (BBs), and thiazide diuretics. Positive control studies were performed using GWAS data in chronic heart failure. The primary method for causality estimation was the inverse-variance-weighted method. Mendelian randomization analysis showed that BBs with the β1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) as a therapeutic target could significantly reduce the risk of GBM by mediating DBP (OR = 0.431, 95% CI: 0.267–0.697, <i>p</i> &lt; .001) and that they could also significantly reduce the risk of GBM by mediating SBP (OR = 0.595, 95% CI: 0.422–0.837, <i>p</i> = .003). Sensitivity analysis and colocalization analysis reinforced the robustness of these findings. Finally, the low expression of the ADRB1 gene in malignant gliomas was found by GBM data from TCGA and single-cell RNA sequencing, which most likely contributed to the poor prognosis of GBM patients. In summary, our study provides preliminary evidence of some causal relationship between ADRB1-targeted BBs and glioblastoma development. However, more studies are needed to validate these findings and further reveal the complex relationship between BP and GBM.</p>","author":"Songyun Zhao, \nYi Xie, \nXu Ding, \nChuanhua Zheng, \nJiaxing Chen, \nNing Zhao, \nYi Ji, \nQi Wang, \nYuankun Liu, \nChao Cheng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"657bc9c7897b8f99ef9fb69e94f791635172e88a23305c41da5ff975e5ee7998","category":"Environment"}
