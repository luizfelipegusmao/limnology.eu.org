{"title":"Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus) Essential Oil at Optimized Dietary Levels Prompted Growth, Immunity, and Resistance to Enteric Red‐Mouth Disease in the Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/3273850?af=R","date":1712041200000,"content":"<p>Fingerlings of the rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i> (<i>n</i> = 300, 10.63 ± 0.6 g), were fed tarragon (<i>Artemisia dracunculus</i>) essential oil (TGO) for 2 months to examine its effects on growth properties, immunity, and resistance to <i>Yersinia ruckeri</i> infection. The treatments were control or TG1, TG2 (fed 0.5% TGO), TG3 (1% TGO), and TG4 (2% TGO). According to the results, an improvement was observed in growth parameters in all TGO-treated groups compared to the control (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The digestive enzyme activities (protease and lipase) were significantly elevated in response to dietary TGO (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The immune system of the fish was enhanced by TGO, as it stimulated the immune parameters in serum (lysozyme, myeloperoxidase (MPO), alternative complement (ACH<sub>50</sub>), Ig) and mucus (lysozyme, protease, ACH<sub>50</sub>, Ig) (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The treatments, TG3 and TG4, showed more immune performance in response to TGO (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The fish in TG2 treatment had a higher levels of serum total protein than other groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The concentration of triglycerides (TRIG) and cholesterol (CHOL) in serum significantly decreased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) in response to TGO, as the lowest levels were observed in the treatment, TG3. The antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)) of serum elevated in TGO-treated fish, with the maximum values for the TG4 group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). TGO reduced (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels in serum. After bacterial challenge, the TGO-treated fish showed lower mortality compared to the control, where the lowest mortality was observed in TG4 (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, TGO improved growth, immunity, and survival after bacterial challenge in the rainbow trout, with more performance in fish fed 1%–2% TGO.</p>","author":"Saeed Hajirezaee, \nMohammad Hossein Khanjani, \nSaman Ahani, \nZahra Ghiasvand, \nRitesh Shantilal Tandel","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"a7f6e618c2fc9f408f0dcf9e8bb8d8663f6778aa102f55efeed3737c5dcd37d9","category":"Environment"}
