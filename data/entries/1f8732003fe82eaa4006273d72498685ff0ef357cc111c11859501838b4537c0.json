{"title":"Microcirculation: Current Perspective in Diagnostics, Imaging and Clinical Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0370/v1","date":1728265263000,"content":"This review discusses the pivotal role of microcirculation in maintaining tissue oxygenation and waste removal and highlights its significance in various pathological conditions. It delves into the cellular mechanisms underlying hemodynamic coherence elucidating the roles of endothelium, glycocalyx, and erythrocytes in sustaining microcirculatory integrity. Furthermore, the review gives comprehensive information about microcirculatory changes observed in cardiac surgery, sepsis, shock and COVID-19 disease. Through comprehensive exploration, the review underscores the intricate relationship between microcirculation, disease states, and clinical outcomes, emphasizing the importance of understanding and monitoring microvascular dynamics in critical care settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f8732003fe82eaa4006273d72498685ff0ef357cc111c11859501838b4537c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
