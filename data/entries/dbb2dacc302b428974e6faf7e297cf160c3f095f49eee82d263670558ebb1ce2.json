{"title":"Utilization of Central Composite Design for the Production of Hydrogel Blends for 3D Printing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2313/v1","date":1727600838000,"content":"Central composite design (CCD) is a methodology that utilizes experimental conditions based on the combination of variable points to be studied. This study aimed to select a hydrogel from the combinations provided by CCD for 3D bioprinting applications. Three biopolymers were chosen: sodium alginate (SA), gelatin (GEL), and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), and their maximum and minimum concentrations were defined. After CCD provided the suggested combinations, the hydrogels were mixed and analyzed for their swelling degree (SD) in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM), and printability was assessed in 2D and 3D assays. The hydrogel with the concentrations of 7.5%, 7.5%, and 2.5% for SA, GEL, and CMC, respectively, was chosen for presenting the highest SD in both fluids and good printability parameters in manual and 3D printer-based extrusion. This study demonstrated the potential utilization of Design of Experiments (DoE) methodologies to assist the development of hydrogels for 3D bioprinting purposes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbb2dacc302b428974e6faf7e297cf160c3f095f49eee82d263670558ebb1ce2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
