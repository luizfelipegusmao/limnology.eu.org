{"title":"Effects of Fermentation Time on Physicochemical Properties of Finger Millet Flour Batter","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1695/v1","date":1727068322000,"content":"In the World one of the main issues with public health is the lack of fermented cereal grain. One of the solutions is understanding the physicochemical properties of millet grains is optimizing their processing and fermentation. This study examines the effects of fermentation time on the physicochemical properties of finger millet flour batter, using four varieties: Axum, Meba, Padet, and Quncho Teff. Batters were fermented for 24, 48, and 72 hours at room temperature. The pH decreased from 5.8 to 4.5, while titratable acidity (TA%) increased from 0.5% to 1.2%. Viscosity decreased significantly from 420 cP to 190 cP over 72 hr. The number of eyes (NOE) increased from 170 to 240 eyes per 2x2 cmÂ², indicating enhanced porosity. Sensory attributes (SAI%) improved, reflecting better acceptability. These results confirm that fermentation time significantly influences the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of finger millet flour batter, enhanced quality for finger millet-based food products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"039b42f8ebc30aa22e9813809c4d4c43bda75682535e457c1067fadc9fd7a49e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
