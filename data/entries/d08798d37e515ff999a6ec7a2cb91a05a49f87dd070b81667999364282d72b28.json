{"title":"Predicting Treatment Outcomes in Patients with Drug-resistant Tuberculosis and HIV Co-infection Using a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1747/v1","date":1727089986000,"content":"Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) and HIV-coinfection present a conundrum to public health globally, and the achievement of the global END TB strategy in 2035. A descriptive, retrospective review of medical records of patients diagnosed with DR-TB who received treatment was conducted. Student’s t-test was performed to assess differences between two means and ANOVA between groups. Either the Chi-square test with and without trend or Fischer’s exact test was used to test the degree of association of categorical variables. Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of DR-TB treatment outcomes. Also, a decision tree classifier, which is a supervised machine learning algorithm was used. Python version 3.8. and R version 4.1.1 software were used for data analysis. A p-value of 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to determine statistical significance. A total of 456 DR-TB patients were included in the study with more male patients (n = 256, 56.1%) than female patients (n = 200, 43.9%). The overall treatment success rate was 61.4%. There was a significant decrease in the % of patients cured during the Covid-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. Our findings showed that machine learning can be used to predict TB patients' treatment outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d08798d37e515ff999a6ec7a2cb91a05a49f87dd070b81667999364282d72b28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
