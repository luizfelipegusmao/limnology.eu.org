{"title":"How to Partition a Quantum Observable","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2052/v1","date":1717131137000,"content":"We present a partition of quantum observables in an open quantum system which is inherited from the division of the underlying Hilbert space or configuration space. It is shown that this partition leads to the definition of an inhomogeneous continuity equation for generic, non-local observables. This formalism is employed to describe the local evolution of the von Neumann entropy of a system of independent quantum particles out of equilibrium. Crucially, we find that all local fluctuations in the entropy are governed by an entropy current operator, implying that the production of entanglement entropy is not measured by this partitioned entropy. For systems linearly perturbed from equilibrium, it is shown that this entropy current is equivalent to a heat current, provided that the system-reservoir coupling is partitioned symmetrically. Finally, we show that any other partition of the coupling leads directly to a divergence of the von Neumann entropy. Thus, we conclude that Hilbert-space partitioning is the only partition of the von Neumann entropy which is consistent with the Laws of Thermodynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a0b35cb721c46e0f357939c1573a404b4fc97d86c6bc0adbe2b00c259b1e35d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
