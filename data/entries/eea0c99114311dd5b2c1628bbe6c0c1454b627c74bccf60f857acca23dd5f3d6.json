In this study, we describe a unique woody plant growth-form induced by large mammalian herbivores and discuss that this growth-form could have evolved as a strategy for escaping the browser zone in herbivore driven ecosystems.\n\nWe analysed responses of key architectural and morphological attributes (branching and thorn density, tree dimensions, presence of flowers and fruits) of three Eurasian spiny tree species (<i>Malus sylvestris</i>, <i>Prunus cerasifera</i> and <i>Pyrus communis</i>) to different levels of browsing by large herbivores in the temperate Białowieża Forest, Poland.\n\nUnder high browsing pressure, studied trees displayed two distinct forms of the crown: a bottom sterile part developing into a densely branched structure with high density of thorns (‘cage-form’), and an upper reproductive part that escaped from herbivore control (‘escaped-form’). The size of cage-form influenced the feeding behaviour of red deer (<i>Cervus elaphus</i>) by increasing the time deer spend foraging and increasing the bite rate. The height at which cages started to escape and their diameter matched with foraging reach of red deer.\n\n<i>Synthesis</i>. We argue that the frequency and cage dimensions of this woody growth-form in the landscape could inform on the type and intensity of recent herbivory. Moreover, its distinctive inducibility suggests that this growth-form did not emerge recently under anthropogenic pressure but could be the legacy of ancient herbivory effects. Observational evidence suggests that this growth-form emerged in several herbivore-driven systems around the globe and may be used to identify the dominant herbivores that control vegetation structure in these ecosystems.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/07/12/oh-deer-you-are-the-gardener-how-deer-shape-tree-growth-and-what-can-we-learn-from-that/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Marcin Churski, \nDries P.
