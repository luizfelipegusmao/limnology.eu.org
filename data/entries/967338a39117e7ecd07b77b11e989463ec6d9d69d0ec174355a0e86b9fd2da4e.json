{"title":"Valorization of Proteinaceous Animal Waste to Amino Acids Reduces Environmental Pollution While Catalyzing Plant Functions in Sustainable Agriculture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1689/v1","date":1719279972000,"content":"Global wastes accumulate at an accelerating rate especially food and slaughterhouse waste constituting a major proportion owing to inefficient management. The high protein concentration of fish waste and keratinaceous byproducts is hazardous, harbouring pathogens, and emitting toxins. Transforming proteinaceous waste into amino acids (AAs) reduces waste bulk and offers a smarter nutrient approach for agriculture. However, this resource remains underutilized triggering eco-system pollution, diseases spreading, and climate change. Currently, small quantities of proteinaceous waste are valorized as animal feed, fertilizer, and in medical, and biotechnological sectors, which cannot solve bulk waste accumulation further, natural AA sources in agriculture are less recognized meanwhile researchers focus on synthetic AAs. Introducing various plant-nutrient formulas enriching fish AA with keratinaceous waste hydrolysate has not been broadly discussed. With this novel approach, using proteinaceous waste resources in agriculture would solve environmental pollution while minimizing land degradation by synthetic fertilizer. In this review, we illustrate the potential and benefits of valorizing proteinaceous waste in bulk through bioconversion. More importantly, we spotlight the biocompatibility of natural AAs and propose an enrichment, to use the ultimate product as catalysts for crops. Consequently, this approach reduces hazardous waste while paving a paradigm change in agriculture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"967338a39117e7ecd07b77b11e989463ec6d9d69d0ec174355a0e86b9fd2da4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
