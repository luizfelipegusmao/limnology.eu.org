{"title":"Finding common development paths in voluntary national reviews reporting on sustainable development goals using aspect-based sentiment analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307886","date":1723644000000,"content":"<p>by Christoph Funk, Elena Tönjes, Ramona Teuber, Lutz Breuer</p>\r\n\r\nVoluntary National Reviews (VNRs) provide a platform for participating countries to share their experiences, failures, and successes in achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The objective of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the narrative elements, particularly the sentiment, in VNRs in order to more effectively assess and support global SDG progress. A total of 232 VNRs from 166 countries are analyzed using Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) to extract each country’s sentiment toward the 17 SDGs. The sentiment scores are then compared to the corresponding official UN SDG scores, and countries are grouped by their sentiment toward all 17 SDGs to identify potential common development pathways. The analysis uncovers a notable positive correlation between the reported sentiment and official SDG scores for SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), and a negative correlation for SDG 5 (gender equality). Conversely, this relationship is not significant for the majority of SDGs, suggesting that VNR narratives may not directly reflect actual progress. A t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) approach indicates a consistent sentiment score among developed countries. In contrast, there are greater differences in reporting sentiment among Emerging Markets, Frontier Markets, and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), where there is greater dispersion (especially among LDCs) and sentiment in reporting on SDG progress that appears to have changed from one reporting year to another. These findings highlight the need to interpret VNRs in the context of each country’s unique situation and challenges specific to each country.","author":"Christoph Funk","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"26c6082ca3ba46e556e29a1544343b6379eb3fb8574cd17180cbf9efde6a0fe0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
