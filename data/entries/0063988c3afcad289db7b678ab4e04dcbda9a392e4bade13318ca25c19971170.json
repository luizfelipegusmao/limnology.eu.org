{"title":"Noninvasive Estimation of Intracavitary Cardiac Pressures Using Speckle Tracking Echocardiography in Advanced Heart Failure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0869/v1","date":1718229051000,"content":"Health care is currently showing a fall in heart failure (HF) prevalence and incidence particularly in developed countries, but with only a subset receiving appropriate therapy to protect the heart against maladaptive processes such as fibrosis and hypertrophy. Appropriate markers of advanced HF are still needed, which should help choosing the most suitable therapy and avoid major compliance problems. Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) is a good choice, being a non-invasive imaging technique and is able to assess cardiac deformation in a variety of conditions. Several multicenter studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated its clinical applications and accuracy in early and late stages of HF, as well as its association with both left ventricular (LV) filling pressures and myocardial oxygen consumption, the two are important parameters in the evaluation of HF patients. Also, STE assists in assessing right ventricular free-wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) which is a solid predictor of right ventricle failure (RVF) following LV assist device (LVAD) implantation. Despite its limitations, STE plays an essential role in the clinical evaluation of patients with HF, early and advanced, in explaining symptoms and signs and also as an accurate prognosticator. The aim of this review is to examine the advantages of STE in early evaluation of myocardial dysfunction and their correlation with right heart catheterization (RHC) parameters, which should have a significant clinical relevance in the management of HF patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0063988c3afcad289db7b678ab4e04dcbda9a392e4bade13318ca25c19971170","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
