Gut microbiota contributes to the biotransformation of GCK, while the effect of gut microbiota on the pharmacokinetics of GCK <i>in vivo</i> remains unclear. To illustrate the role of gut microbiota in GCK metabolism <i>in vivo</i>, a systematic investigation of the pharmacokinetics of GCK in specific pathogen free (SPF) and pseudo-germ-free (pseudo-GF) rats were conducted. Pseudo-GF rats were treated with non-absorbable antibiotics. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCâ€“MS/MS) was validated for the quantification of GCK in rat plasma. Compared with SPF rats, the plasma concentration of GCK significantly increased after the gut microbiota depleted. The results showed that GCK absorption slowed down, T<sub>max</sub> delayed by 3.5 h, AUC<sub>0-11</sub> increased by 1.3 times, CL<sub>z/F</sub> decreased by 0.6 times in pseudo-GF rats, and C<sub>max</sub> was 1.6 times higher than that of normal rats. The data indicated that gut microbiota played an important role in the pharmacokinetics of GCK <i>in vivo</i>.","author":"Ming-Si Deng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"26e4ecf65511b05a6b0affa951342e0a2905bfc03d388643fd3a47bf5fa18466","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
