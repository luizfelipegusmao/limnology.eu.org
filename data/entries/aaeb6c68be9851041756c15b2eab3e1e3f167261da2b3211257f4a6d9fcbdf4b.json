{"title":"Isolation and Molecular Detection of Pigeon Pox Virus in a Pigeon with Both Cutaneous and Diphtheritic Forms of Pigeon Pox in Ghana","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0734/v1","date":1718123596000,"content":"Unlike fowl pox, pigeon pox virus (PPV) has not been described in Ghana. This is the first report of the disease and virus in Ghana based on gross necropsy, histopathological analysis and molecular techniques. This index case was presented as the occurrence of both cutaneous (dry) and diphtheritic (wet) forms of the pigeon pox disease in a 5-month-old female pigeon. Although the observation of Bollinger bodies during histology is confirmatory of pox viruses, the amplification of the p4b gene using polymerase chain reaction and its visualisation by gel electrophoresis confirmed the presence of an avian pox virus. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the isolates from this case showed 100% relatedness to the reference PPV isolate FeP2. Thus, confirming the presence of PPV. The discovery of this virus in the Ghana raises the need for surveillance of both wild and domestic avian populations in preparation for any future outbreak, protection of the production birds and decision on the need for other pox viruses in the country.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aaeb6c68be9851041756c15b2eab3e1e3f167261da2b3211257f4a6d9fcbdf4b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
