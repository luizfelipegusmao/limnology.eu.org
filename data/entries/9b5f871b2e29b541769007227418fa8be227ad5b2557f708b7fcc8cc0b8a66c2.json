Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is an endocrine factor of the FGF family primarily produced by osteocytes and osteoblasts, involves an essential effect in pathogenesis of RA. IL-1β is a vital proinflammatory factor in the development of RA. However, the role of FGF23 on IL-1β synthesis in RA has not been fully explored. Our analysis of database revealed higher levels of FGF23 and IL-1β in RA samples compared with healthy controls. High-throughput screening demonstrated that IL-1β is a potential candidate factor after FGF23 treatment in RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). FGF23 concentration dependently promotes IL-1β synthesis in RASFs. FGF23 enhances IL-1β expression by activating the PI3K, Akt, and NF-κB pathways. Our findings support the notion that FGF23 is a promising target in the remedy of RA.</p>","author":"Sung‐Lin Hu, \nLouis Anoop Thadevoos, \nTrung‐Loc Ho, \nYen‐You Lin, \nHsien‐Te Chen, \nChien‐Chung Huang, \nChen‐Ming Su, \nChih‐Hsin Tang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"9b5f871b2e29b541769007227418fa8be227ad5b2557f708b7fcc8cc0b8a66c2","category":"Environment"}
