{"title":"Leu promotes C2C12 cell differentiation by regulating the GSK3β/β‐catenin signaling pathway through facilitating the interaction between SESN2 and RPN2","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13496?af=R","date":1713968661000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Leucine (Leu) is an essential amino acid that facilitates skeletal muscle satellite cell differentiation, yet its mechanism remains underexplored. Sestrin2 (SESN2) serves as a Leu sensor, binding directly to Leu, while ribophorin II (RPN2) acts as a signaling factor in multiple pathways. This study aimed to elucidate Leu's impact on mouse C2C12 cell differentiation and skeletal muscle injury repair by modulating RPN2 expression through SESN2, offering a theoretical foundation for clinical skeletal muscle injury prevention and treatment.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Leu addition promoted C2C12 cell differentiation compared to the control, enhancing early differentiation via myogenic determinant (MYOD) up-regulation. Sequencing revealed SESN2 binding to and interacting with RPN2. RPN2 overexpression up-regulated MYOD, myogenin and myosin heavy chain 2, concurrently decreased p-GSK3<i>β</i> and increased nuclear <i>β</i>-catenin. Conversely, RPN2 knockdown yielded opposite results. Combining RPN2 knockdown with Leu rescued increased p-GSK3<i>β</i> and decreased nuclear <i>β</i>-catenin compared to Leu absence. Hematoxylin and eosin staining results showed that Leu addition accelerated mouse muscle damage repair, up-regulating Pax7, MYOD and RPN2 in the cytoplasm, and nuclear <i>β</i>-catenin, confirming that the role of Leu in muscle injury repair was consistent with the results for C2C12 cells.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Leu, bound with SESN2, up-regulated RPN2 expression, activated the GSK3<i>β</i>/<i>β</i>-catenin pathway, enhanced C2C12 differentiation and expedited skeletal muscle damage repair. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yifan Liu, \nJinping Li, \nCong Ding, \nHuili Tong, \nYunqin Yan, \nShuang Li, \nShufeng Li, \nYunkao Cao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"1e6b5edb3585ad077ded84697d09bcbddd585bfa26ca8c638660e70cb6c0cff2","category":"Environment"}
