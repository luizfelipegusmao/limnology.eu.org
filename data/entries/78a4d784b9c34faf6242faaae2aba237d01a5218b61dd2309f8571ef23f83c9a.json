{"title":"Formulating Time&rsquo;s Hyperdimensionality across Disciplines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1443/v1","date":1713853680000,"content":"Time, traditionally viewed as a linear, non-dynamic parameter, is re-envisioned in this study as a Hyperdimensional concept. This paper conducts a cross-disciplinary examination, critically analysing the conceptualization of time in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and cosmology to propose a ground breaking reconceptualisation that extends beyond conventional frameworks. In classical mechanics, time is perceived as an absolute, continuously progressing backdrop, largely independent of events. Quantum mechanics treats time as a static parameter that does not influence quantum states but provides a framework for their evolution. In cosmology, time is considered a dimension that emerges from the Big Bang and serves as a measure for the universe's expansion, yet it does not interact with the structural dynamics of the cosmos. Challenging the transformative insights of Einstein’s relativity, which merges time with spatial dimensions under extreme conditions, we advocate for a perspective that views time as a Hyperdimensional and universal constant. This perspective posits that time, despite its unique and intrinsic properties, does not dynamically interact with or alter physical phenomena. Instead, it underpins our understanding of phenomena across different scales—from the minutiae of quantum states to the macroscopic dynamics of cosmology—without direct causation or change. A critical examination of time dilation and relativistic assumptions reveals significant discrepancies in traditional interpretations, particularly in how they are applied across different physical contexts. Our findings challenge the uniform applicability of time dilation, suggesting that observed phenomena often attributed to relativistic effects might better be explained through non-relativistic mechanisms such as phase shifts or changes in wavelength rather than temporal dilation. By synthesizing insights from various scientific domains, we advocate for a unified theory that recognizes time as a fundamental, universal dimension that is conceptual and non-interactive. Our goal is to bridge existing gaps between diverse scientific interpretations and promote a more integrated, profound understanding of time's autonomous and intrinsic nature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78a4d784b9c34faf6242faaae2aba237d01a5218b61dd2309f8571ef23f83c9a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
