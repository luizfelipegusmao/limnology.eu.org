{"title":"Biological Control Strategies for Termite Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1842/v1","date":1711703923000,"content":"Abstract Termites are eusocial arthropod decomposers that increase crop productivity and soil fertility. Because of the various benefits they possess, they are being exploited by humans. Termite infestations cause significant damage to structures and ecosystems. There are various physical and chemical methods for termite removal and control, but the use of chemical insecticides has a detrimental effect on human health and the environment, so efforts are directed towards the development of biological approaches to reduce their presence. Various effective and dependable biological approaches focused on using bacteria, fungi, and viruses have been explored, but termites continue to pose a major global threat. Recent advancements in molecular biology may provide a better solution for termites control. This review summarizes various biological methods to reduce the presence of termites in a sustainable manner.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"48fa9aa08a2efe62635375fecaf0ee044271af76c241a3769c78479824b773f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
