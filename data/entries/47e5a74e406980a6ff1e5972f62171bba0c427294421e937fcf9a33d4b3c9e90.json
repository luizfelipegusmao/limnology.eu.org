{"title":"A Review on Reinforcement Learning in Production Scheduling: An Inferential Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0335/v1","date":1715072948000,"content":"In this study, a comprehensive review on production scheduling based on reinforcement learning (RL) techniques using bibliometric analysis has been carried out. The aim of this work is, among other things, to point out the growing interest in this domain and to outline the influence of RL as a type of machine learning on production scheduling. To achieve this, the paper explores production scheduling using RL by investigating the descriptive metadata of all pertinent publications contained in the Web of Science database. The study focuses on a wide spectrum of publications spanning the years between 1998 and 2023. The findings and recommendations of this study can serve as new insights for future research endeavors in the realm of production scheduling using RL techniques.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"47e5a74e406980a6ff1e5972f62171bba0c427294421e937fcf9a33d4b3c9e90","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
