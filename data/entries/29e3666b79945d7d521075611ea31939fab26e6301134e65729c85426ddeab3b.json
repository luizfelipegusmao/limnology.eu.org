Methods: The evaluation of the eating habits and lifestyle of the Romanian population in the post-pandemic period was carried out based on a cross-sectional observational study with the help of a questionnaire. Results: 4704 valid answers were registered (3136 female and 1568 male respondents). Among the respondents, most of them belong to the young population, 2892 between the ages of 18 and 40, i.e., 61.5%. Most male respondents are overweight (1400) and obese (780). Most respondents indicated a tendency to consume 1-2 meals per day irregularly (p=0.6167). Only 974 respondents adopted a healthy diet, and 578 a healthy lifestyle. Conclusion: The present study reports low adherence to a healthy diet (20.7%) and healthy lifestyle (12.28%), especially among the young population (&amp;lt; 30 years). In the current context, it reports a reduced tendency to consume vegetables and fruits among the population, below the daily average recommended by the nutrition guidelines, a tendency towards sedentary behavior, and even deficient hydration of some of the respondents; these negative aspects can create a long term a series of nutritional and psycho-emotional imbalances. Our results evidence that complex surveys among the population are regularly required to investigate nutritional or lifestyle deficiencies; moreover, it could be helpful in further educational measures in nutrition, food, and environmental safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"29e3666b79945d7d521075611ea31939fab26e6301134e65729c85426ddeab3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
