{"title":"Thermostable &alpha;-Amylases and Laccases: Paving the Way for Sustainable Industrial Applications.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1488/v1","date":1713866293000,"content":"The growing demand in industrial and biotechnological settings for more efficient enzymes with enhanced biochemical features, particularly thermostability and thermotolerance, necessitates a timely response. Renowned for their versatility, thermostable enzymes, offer significant promise across a range of applications, including agricultural, medicinal, and biotechnological domains. This comprehensive review summarizes the structural attributes, catalytic mechanisms, and the relationships between structure and function of two major classes of thermostable enzymes: α-amylases and laccases. These enzymes serve as valuable models for understanding the structural basis of protein thermostability. Commercial significance of these enzymes and researchers' interest in further optimization and innovation, this article can greatly contribute to ongoing research on thermostable enzymes and aiding industries in optimizing production processes. It also give insights to the exploration of suitable strategies and factors for enhancing thermostability, resulting in heightened multipronged stability and notable enhancements in the enzymes’ industrial applicability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3dce1858422478734e320d20155a26e60a59dd1bc51f69a08bbbfb3df675fa3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
