The results indicate that the adaptation actions implemented through the C6 project did contribute to sustainable development, to a greater extent, in the social aspect, followed by environmental aspects and later by economic ones; therefore, it can be concluded that one way to achieve sustainable development can be through the implementation of adaptation actions to face climate change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33b5c8a8094595a75643f74677df2ce9fab40e1fc095df1e7db4e4c11169a3b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
