Among 417 febrile patients, 47% were PCR-positive for dengue. Serotyping revealed DENV-1 (12.8%), DENV-2 (46.4%), DENV-3 (37.2%), and DENV-4 (3.6%). Sequencing identified two genotypically distinct variants of DENV-3 and two genotypically distinct variants of DENV-1, while DENV-2 showed a single genotype cluster. Notably, the study found concurrent circulation of two DENV-3 and two DENV-1 genotypes, along with DENV-2, during the pandemic in the area. This data suggests the presence of multiple dengue strains, including several DENV-1 and DENV-3 variants, without major epidemic outbreaks reported in the Western Province. Continuous monitoring and research are essential to understand the dynamics of these dengue strains in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","author":"Harshi Abeygoonawardena","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"d5a56f0f888c2bc8872e57fa50448590419c993e41251d42972516d8511484f4","category":"Environment"}
