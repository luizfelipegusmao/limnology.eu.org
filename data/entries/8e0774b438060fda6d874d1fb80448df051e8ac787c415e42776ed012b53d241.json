{"title":"Navigating the AI Employment Landscape: Strategies for Workforce Readiness and Inclusive Growth in Malaysia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2014/v1","date":1714482542000,"content":"The dynamic landscape of AI adoption and its impact on employment in Malaysia demands a multifaceted approach to navigate the challenges and harness the opportunities presented. While the government's commitment to fostering AI adoption through initiatives like the National AI Framework and the Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint is commendable, it is imperative to address concerns regarding job displacement and ensure inclusive growth. This study identifies the pressing research problem of workforce readiness for the AI-driven future, emphasizing the need to explore strategies for reskilling and upskilling affected workers. By employing critical lenses such as Marxist, feminist, and postcolonial perspectives, scholars highlight the power dynamics and societal implications inherent in AI deployment, guiding the development of policies and interventions that prioritize workers' interests and address social inequalities. Moving forward, a comprehensive approach combining policy interventions, educational reforms, and inclusive strategies is essential to maximize the benefits of AI adoption while mitigating its potential risks. Longitudinal studies, interdisciplinary research, and comparative analyses will further advance our understanding and inform evidence-based policymaking in this evolving field. Ultimately, by prioritizing workforce preparedness, social equity, and sustainable development, Malaysia can position itself as a leader in the AI-driven global economy, fostering a resilient, inclusive, and prosperous society for all.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e0774b438060fda6d874d1fb80448df051e8ac787c415e42776ed012b53d241","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
