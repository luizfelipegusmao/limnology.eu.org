{"title":"Application of Aquifer Delineation and Hydrogeophysical Techniques in Estimating Groundwater Recharge to Enhance Water Allocation in Groundwater-Dependent Areas, Northern Cape, South Africa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1619/v1","date":1716537700000,"content":"The aquifer delineation using a hydrogeophysical survey was carried out in De Aar, a small town in the eastern part of the Karoo supergroup, Northern Cape, South Africa. In this re-gion, the current approach for estimating recharge, water allocation plans, and water monitoring does not consider the existence of different types of aquifers. Instead, it assumes there is one aquifer system and therefore the area might have one value of recharge. This study aimed to delineate aquifers into unconfined and confined aquifers for estimating recharge and demonstrate the use of geophysics techniques in delineating aquifer systems. Six VES stations and seven profile lines were measured using a Wenner array configuration and ground magnetotelluric method, respectively. VES data was processed using IPI2win software while electric potential difference curve was in-terpreted together with lithological data. Four significant layers of low (0.9-8.1 Ωm), moderate (22.4-125 Ωm), and high 68-177 Ωm) resistivity values were delineated suggestive of the different lithological formations. The subsurface profile mapping using ground magentotelluric methods did not suggest groundwater accumulations below 50 m, instead supported shallow groundwater potentials boreholes. These results have provided a double layer aquifer system thereby suggesting that recharge estimation need to be carried out in two different aquifer systems to enhance water allocation plans, and water monitoring in groundwater-dependent areas similar to prevailing conditions in the current study area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6537bd5a3bb9cac77755649c15ed8501b3223e55cc0c9eea08e5f123f7d6b831","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
