{"title":"Translational activation by a synthetic PPR protein elucidates control of psbA translation in Arabidopsis chloroplasts","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4168/7642946?rss=1","date":1712620800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Translation initiation on chloroplast <span>psbA</span> mRNA in plants scales with light intensity, providing its gene product, D1, as needed to replace photodamaged D1 in Photosystem II. The <span>psbA</span> translational activator HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE 173 (HCF173) has been hypothesized to mediate this regulation. HCF173 belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily, associates with the <span>psbA</span> 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR), and has been hypothesized to enhance translation by binding an RNA segment that would otherwise pair with and mask the ribosome binding region. To test these hypotheses, we examined whether a synthetic pentatricopeptide repeat (sPPR) protein can substitute for HCF173 when bound to the HCF173 binding site. We show that an sPPR designed to bind HCF173's footprint in the <span>psbA</span> 5′-UTR bound the intended site in vivo and partially substituted for HCF173 to activate <span>psbA</span> translation. However, sPPR-activated translation did not respond to light. These results imply that HCF173 activates translation, at least in part, by sequestering the RNA it binds to maintain an accessible ribosome binding region, and that HCF173 is also required to regulate <span>psbA</span> translation in response to light. Translational activation can be added to the functions that can be programmed with sPPR proteins for synthetic biology applications in chloroplasts.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"a6693e1d27f111129c91c07c6ae12f4686ba29319a389782a007bdb4a4622270","category":"Environment"}
