A key tool for molecular studies of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) is a ‘minigenome’ or ‘minireplicon’ assay, in which viral RdRps are reconstituted in cells in the absence of full virus infection. Typically, plasmids expressing the viral polymerase protein(s) and other co-factors are co-transfected along with a plasmid expressing an RNA encoding a fluorescent or luminescent reporter gene flanked by viral untranslated regions containing cis-acting elements required for viral RdRp recognition. This reconstitutes the viral transcription/replication machinery and allows viral RdRp activity to be measured as a correlate of reporter protein signal. Here we report the first development of a plasmid-based minigenome assay for species A rotavirus, using a firefly luciferase reporter gene.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc48b3e72b3999df343427459d546709fe3bd5dd3e70a7244e47094cb2e47801","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
