{"title":"The Socio-Political Implications of Deepfakes in Developing Countries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1654/v1","date":1727074008000,"content":"Highly realistic media created through Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, commonly known as deepfakes, presents a serious risk to political stability and the integrity of information. We are entering an era where images and videos, which were once considered reliable evidence, are now being altered to spread false information and incite unrest. This threat is especially heightened in developing nations, where misinformation and manipulation of public sentiment could lead to the collapse of the fragile democracies. This study delves deep into the increased vulnerability of these regions to deepfakes due to slower technological advancement and widespread lack of awareness. This study provides a detailed analysis and sets the stage for future investigations, proposing a combined approach to counteract the consequences of deepfakes. This includes combining technical methods for detection of deepfakes with public awareness campaigns and legal frameworks. Reducing the harmful effects of deepfakes requires cooperation among a diverse group of experts","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7fdc80d0c60bb9128a4a280bbd853de26950744214f5f783826c780e5b294af0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
