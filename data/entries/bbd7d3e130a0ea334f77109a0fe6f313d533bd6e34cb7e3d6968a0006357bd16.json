{"title":"Optimizing Recovery in Patients with Dual Impairments: Proprioception and Balance Enhancement through Combined Vestibular and Knee Rehabilitation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0476/v1","date":1725595109000,"content":"This study investigates the efficacy of an integrated rehabilitation program that combines vestibular and knee-focused therapies to improve proprioceptive function, balance, and motor control in patients suffering from both Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) and knee joint conditions. The study involved 59 participants diagnosed with both vestibular dysfunction and knee impairments, who were enrolled in a comprehensive rehabilitation program. Vestibular interventions included specific maneuvers such as the Epley maneuver and Brandt-Daroff exercises, aimed at repositioning otoliths and reducing vertigo symptoms, while balance retraining exercises were implemented to enhance stability and prevent falls. Additionally, TECAR therapy was used for its deep tissue heating and regenerative benefits, and specific proprioceptive exercises targeting the knee joint were conducted to improve joint position sense and reduce the risk of falls. The intervention resulted in significant improvements in proprioceptive accuracy, as evidenced by enhanced joint position sense measurements and increased scores on the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI). These findings suggest that the dual-targeted rehabilitation approach not only addresses the individual impairments associated with vestibular dysfunction and knee pathology but also effectively improves overall functional outcomes by tackling the complex interplay between these conditions. The study further highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in rehabilitation, where addressing vestibular and musculoskeletal dysfunctions simultaneously can lead to better patient outcomes. The integrated rehabilitation strategy presented in this study offers a comprehensive approach to managing complex clinical cases, ultimately contributing to improved quality of life and functional independence in patients affected by concurrent vestibular and knee joint issues.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bbd7d3e130a0ea334f77109a0fe6f313d533bd6e34cb7e3d6968a0006357bd16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
