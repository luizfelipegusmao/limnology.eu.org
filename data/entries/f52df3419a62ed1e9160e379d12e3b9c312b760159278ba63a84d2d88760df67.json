{"title":"Comprehensive Review of Eutrophication in Freshwater Ecosystems: Causes, Effects, Assessment, and Management Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0704/v1","date":1725966012000,"content":"This review examines eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems, a widespread environmental issue stemming from excessive nutrient input, largely due to human activities. The study explores the origins, consequences, evaluation techniques, and control methods for eutrophication. Primary causes include agricultural discharge, urban development, and climate shifts. The effects are far-reaching, impacting biodiversity, water quality, and socio-economic factors. The assessment utilizes a combination of chemical, physical, and biological markers, with cutting-edge technologies like remote sensing improving monitoring efforts. Mitigation strategies are diverse, incorporating preventative actions (such as nutrient limitation and land management), corrective measures (including bio-manipulation and chemical applications), and regulatory initiatives (like water quality guidelines and nutrient exchange schemes). While case studies demonstrate successful interventions, they also reveal ongoing challenges, particularly ecosystem unpredictability and climate change influences. The research highlights the promise of emerging technologies, notably machine learning, in enhancing management practices. Knowledge gaps persist, especially regarding eutrophication-biodiversity dynamics in tropical environments and the socio-economic ramifications of interventions. The study emphasizes the importance of flexible, comprehensive approaches that blend scientific insights with practical solutions and strong policy structures to tackle this intricate environmental challenge in an era of climate change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f52df3419a62ed1e9160e379d12e3b9c312b760159278ba63a84d2d88760df67","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
