{"title":"Grouping Behaviour and Anti-Predator Responses in the Helmeted Guineafowl Numida meleagris","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0966/v1","date":1720750363000,"content":"Abstract: Little is known about landbird group dynamics in response to predation. Here, we describe the interactions between the Helmeted Guineafowl (Numida meleagris) and its predators regarding the survival advantages grouping behaviour may provide. Livestream webcam observations were conducted in Madikwe Game Reserve (South Africa) from August 2020 to December 2021. Emphasis was placed on predatorâ€“prey interaction and its effect on group size and structure in a spatial framework. Although Black-Backed Jackals (Lupulella mesomelas) are not adept at hunting birds, they might negatively impact guineafowl by curtailing their feeding time during winter with constant harassment. We found that these canids often approach larger and denser groups in the morning and late evenings. Surprisingly, guineafowl most often responded by standing nearby. On the contrary, a higher predator-induced response was associated with the presence of predatory birds, arguably as part of an evolutionary stable prey-predator system. This line of thought is also supported by the lack of a precise defensive mechanism elicited by jackal attacks, unlike those of aerial predators. Nevertheless, we contend that grouping in Helmeted Guineafowl is a defensive strategy to respond to predator attacks while individuals engage in daily activities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31d2b99d462031c8d5e4638337ff75fa7d8fed240db6f031db9273e819465f1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
