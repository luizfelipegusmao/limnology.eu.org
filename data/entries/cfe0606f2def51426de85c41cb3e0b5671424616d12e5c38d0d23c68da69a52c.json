{"title":"Renovation Wave for Europe: Low-Carbon Design in Refurbishment of Social Housing in Southern Italy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1801/v1","date":1711704320000,"content":"Public housing stock, called Social Housing, in Italy developed between the 1950s and the 1980s. As of today, the first residential developments are almost nearing their end-of-life age, in need of urgent and intensive renovation. The European Commission, with the Renovation Wave, has set a goal of doubling the rate of building renovation over the next 10 years, reducing emissions, improving energy performance, and promoting decarburization. Renovation interventions, including structural, functional, energy, plant upgrading, etc., are to be preferred over integral demolition and reconstruction interventions, which have significant repercussions in terms of managerial and social discomfort. The case studies examined concern renovation interventions aimed at energy efficiency, functional adaptation of housing as well as facade restyling. The design variants analyzed were evaluated in terms of CO2e emissions, according to LCI (Life Cycle Inventory) and EPD (Environmental Product Declaration) approaches. This approach has a twofold purpose: to propose design guidelines, with low CO2e emissions, through hypotheses of variants to the case studies, and to propose, to the Economic Operators, economically advantageous bidding scenarios, in the procurement process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cfe0606f2def51426de85c41cb3e0b5671424616d12e5c38d0d23c68da69a52c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
