{"title":"Evaluating Risk Factors of Self-Harm and Effectiveness of Brief Psychological Intervention During Acute Presentation: Methodology of EXPAAND Project","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1834/v1","date":1714292435000,"content":"Background: Self-harm (SH) refers to self-injury or intentional self-poisoning with varying degrees of suicidal intent and is a major public health issue for children and adolescents (C&amp;A) worldwide. Given significant gaps exist in our understanding of the associated psychopathology in C&amp;A, this paper outlines the protocol for a prospective clinical study examining risk factors of SH and additional candidate parameters (not routinely assessed) during an acute SH episode. Methods: The EXPAAND (EXploring Psychiatric and Attentional risk-factors in Adolescents Needing intervention for Deliberate self-harm) is a randomised control trial to assess additional novel candidate risk factors for SH in C&amp;A and to evaluate the effectiveness of SH-targeted brief psychological intervention (Therapeutic Assessment (TA)), within a real-world acute clinical setting, as we include neurodiversity and gender diversity in this study. EXPAAND is conducted in 4 phases: (i) recruitment &amp; randomisation; (ii) extended assessment; (iii) randomised intervention; and (iv) follow-up observational period to ascertain clinical outcomes for comparison. Expected Results: We envisage that by diagnosing and treating attentional disorders when detected will mitigate potential confounding effects of these conditions. We also expect that SH-focused TA will be effective in reducing subsequent SH and in improving engagement in follow-up and subsequent treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac6f10e4c33443cfcd372a21ef751cfa47aeb94d08b804bdd1dc1eb3929a822e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
