{"title":"Psychometric Properties of the Knowledge of Hydration among Students of Óbuda University, Hungary","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1210/v1","date":1716181256000,"content":"The quantity, makeup, and distribution of bodily fluids have a significant impact on the cognitive and physiological health of individuals. The knowledge of an individual on the recommended daily Total Water Intake (TWI) by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) influences the practice of Adequate Water Intake (AWI). To sufficiently measure the knowledge of hydration, it is expedient to develop and validate a scale to adequately measure knowledge of the recommended daily Total Water Intake (TWI). Hence, this study aims to develop an 11-items scale to measure the Knowledge of hydration (KH-11) and evaluate its psychometric properties among foreign student at Óbuda University, Hungary. The novelty of this study is the development of an 11-item scale to measure the knowledge of hydration among students at Óbuda University, Hungary.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2039d339fb549462df266137f3134816056ab52eb462354bc97c10fd88bdee52","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
