{"title":"Design guidelines for movement-assistive clothing based on a comprehensive understanding of older adults’ needs and preferences","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299434","date":1710943200000,"content":"<p>by Jiwon Chung, Wujun Tang, Jeong Eun Yoon, Suhyun Ha, Ju Young Kang, Sumin Helen Koo</p>\r\n\r\nThis study aimed to explore the needs and wants of older adults in the context of movement-assistive clothing (MSC), with a focus on muscle strength and posture correction. A survey was conducted to understand the needs and wants of older adults, considering aspects of functions and designs, and to evaluate the comfort, safety, ease of use, usefulness, and intention of users to purchase and use products. A total of 408 individuals aged &gt; 65 years participated in the study. The data were analyzed using descriptive analyses, such as mean, standard deviation, percentages, Cronbach’s alpha, chi-square test, independent <i>t</i>-test, analysis of variance, and regression using IBM SPSS 27.0. Exploratory Factor Analysis was also conducted to test the hypotheses. Open-ended questions were extracted using major themes after color-coding. Based on the results, design recommendations were derived, including the development of pants and innerwear with casual, minimalist styles, featuring achromatic colors, and utilizing stretchy, breathable fabrics. Comfort, safety, ease of use, and usefulness emerged as critical factors influencing the purchase and use of MSC by older adults. This study aimed to establish design guidelines by understanding the needs and wants of older adults and considering the aspects of movement-assistive clothing to relieve musculoskeletal issues. Accordingly, these findings are expected to aid in the creation of wearable suits using flexible fabric artificial muscles for active musculoskeletal correction in older adults.","author":"Jiwon Chung","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c965912491d7e0777764c6bd2e5e4dcc84e09eb8f8fc824b37bfdd90d67d39f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
