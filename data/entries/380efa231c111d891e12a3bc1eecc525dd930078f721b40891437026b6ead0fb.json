{"title":"Evaluation of CO2/H2O Co-adsorption Models for the Anion Exchange Resin Lewatit Vpoc 1065 under Direct Air Capture Conditions Using a Novel Lab Setup","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0435/v1","date":1715174236000,"content":"This study aimed to develop a laboratory-scale direct air capture unit for evaluating and comparing amine-based adsorbents under temperature vacuum swing adsorption conditions. The experimental campaign conducted with the direct air capture unit allowed for the determination of equilibrium loading, CO2 uptake capacity, and other main performance parameters of the investigated adsorbent Lewatit VP OC 1065Â®. The investigations also helped to understand the co-adsorption of both CO2 and H2O on the tested material, which is crucial for improving temperature vacuum swing adsorption processes. This was achieved by obtaining pure component isotherms for CO2 and H2O as well as three different co-adsorption isotherm models from literature. It was found that the weighted average dual-site Toth model emerged as the most accurate and reliable model for simulating this co-adsorption behavior. Its predictions closely align with experimental data, particularly in capturing the adsorption equilibrium at various temperatures. It was also observed that this lab-scale unit offers advantages over thermogravimetric analysis when conducting adsorption experiments on the chosen amine. The final aim of this study is to provide a pathway to develop devices for testing and developing efficient and cost-effective adsorbents for direct air capture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"380efa231c111d891e12a3bc1eecc525dd930078f721b40891437026b6ead0fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
