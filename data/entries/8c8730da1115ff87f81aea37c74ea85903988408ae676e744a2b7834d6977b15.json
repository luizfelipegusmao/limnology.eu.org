{"title":"Microglial Replacement and COURIER or SPIT for Neuronal Gene Editing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1620/v4","date":1729776836000,"content":"Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors can be used for gene delivery. AAV.CAP-Mac was recently developed; it can cross the blood-brain barrier and transduce cells throughout the CNS. However, some brain regions were not transduced in adult rhesus monkeys. Additionally, AAV vectors can only package 5 kb of DNA. Also, AAV vectors may be genotoxic and cytotoxic, especially at high doses. Finally, AAV vectors are very expensive to produce at sufficiently high titers for treatment. Off-the-shelf cell-based delivery systems wherein the cells can infiltrate the target tissue and be hyper-motile would be ideal. Also, mRNA-based gene editing would be a transient treatment, and thus be much safer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c8730da1115ff87f81aea37c74ea85903988408ae676e744a2b7834d6977b15","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
