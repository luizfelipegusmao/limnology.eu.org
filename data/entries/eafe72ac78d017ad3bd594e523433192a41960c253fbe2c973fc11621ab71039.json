Eighty participants divided equally into four groups; (i) people with obesity and schizophrenia; (ii) people with obesity and bipolar disorder; (iii) people with obesity without mental disease or sleep disorders, and (iv) people without obesity, mental disease or sleep disorders. Over two consecutive days, participants engage in repeated self-sampling of hair follicle and saliva; concurrently, data is collected on diet, body temperature, light exposure, sleep parameters, and physical activity by accelerometry. Hair follicles are analyzed for circadian gene expression, saliva samples for cortisol and melatonin concentrations. Circadian rhythms are investigated by cosinor analysis. The study employs a participant-tailored sampling schedule to minimize disruptions to daily routine and enhance ecological validity. The methodology aims to provide a comprehensive insight into the factors contributing to circadian disruptions in people with obesity, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, potentially informing strategies for future management and mitigation.\r\nTrial registration: (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05413486).","author":"Mikkel EI Kolind","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"eafe72ac78d017ad3bd594e523433192a41960c253fbe2c973fc11621ab71039","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
