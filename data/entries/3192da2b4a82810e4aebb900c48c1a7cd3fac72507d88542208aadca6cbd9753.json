{"title":"Short‐finned pilot whales in the South China Sea: Insights into regional distribution, movement pattern, and habitat characteristics","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.13052?af=R","date":1704967856000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Little scientific knowledge is available for short-finned pilot whales in the South China Sea (SCS). Here, we integrated historical records, ship-based observation, and satellite-tagging data to investigate ecological and behavioral characteristics of pilot whales in the SCS. Historical records since the 1990s showed the widespread spatial occurrence of pilot whales along the coastal SCS, suggesting that the species may inhabit this region. During our dedicated ship-based surveys (2019–2022) in the SCS, 19 groups of pilot whales were encountered in Xisha-Zhongsha waters, which supported the hypothesis inferred from historical data. We believe that Xisha-Zhongsha waters are important habitats for pilot whales, demonstrated by the large group size (<i>M</i> = 44.7 ± 42.4 <i>SD</i> individuals), the high proportion of recorded maternal groups (17/19), mixed-species associations, and deep-water habitat characteristics. During field surveys, we conducted satellite-tagging experiments on two adult pilot whales, with tracking periods of 35 and 13 days, respectively. Satellite-tracking data provided evidence of possible residency of the tagged whales, as both displayed overlapping ranges and nondirectional movement. This research provides preliminary baseline data on occurrence, distribution, movement, habitat use, and likely residency of pilot whales in the SCS, which can facilitate future research and conservation effort.</p>","author":"Mingming Liu, \nWenzhi Lin, \nMingli Lin, \nLijun Dong, \nSonghai Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Marine Mammal Science: Table of Contents","siteHash":"41f2ab2fb7823483a860925793cfe03661521bf60a4c6416d33f6b2a3c4db49f","entryHash":"3192da2b4a82810e4aebb900c48c1a7cd3fac72507d88542208aadca6cbd9753","category":"Environment"}
