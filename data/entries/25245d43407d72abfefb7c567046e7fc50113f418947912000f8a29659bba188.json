{"title":"Assessing the Multiplier Effect of National Parks: A Case Study of Buiratau State National Nature Park in Kazakhstan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1704/v1","date":1727086762000,"content":"This article examines the complex interactions of the multiplier effect within the realm of tourism, with a specific emphasis on national parks. The main objective is to evaluate the multiplier effect within national parks, specifically focusing on Buiratau State National Nature Park in Kazakh-stan as a case study. The multiplier effect is a fundamental principle in the field of economic analysis. Economic multiplier effect is the term used to describe the occurrence when an initial infusion of spending in a certain industry leads to subsequent rounds of extra and sustainable economic activity. In the context of national parks, this phenomenon arises when visitor expendi-tures result in several favorable consequences, including increased employment, infrastructure advancement, and general economic expansion. The article seeks to measure the multiplier effect of tourism activities in Buiratau State National Nature Park through a thorough assessment. This entails examining several variables and datasets pertaining to visitor expenditure and its influ-ence. The study contributes to the existing literature by examining a recently constructed national park in a developing country. It compares the findings of this park with well-established national parks in other areas, emphasizing the distinct problems and opportunities it presents. Further-more, the research presents a methodological framework for evaluating the multiplier effect of national parks, which may be utilized in comparable contexts. This research ultimately enhances our comprehension of the economic implications of national parks and emphasizes their function as drivers for local and regional growth.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25245d43407d72abfefb7c567046e7fc50113f418947912000f8a29659bba188","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
