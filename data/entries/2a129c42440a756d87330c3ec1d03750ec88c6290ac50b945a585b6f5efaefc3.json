{"title":"PSX-5 Repeatability of overreach, term and acuteness in Peruvian Paso horse","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/451/7757676?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Peruvian Paso Horse is considered one of the best saddle horses worldwide due to the gait that makes this horse perform one of the smoothest walks. The overreach, term, and acuteness are the most characteristic movements in the gait, making them the most desirable attributes in its breeding and reproduction. Repeatability of overreach, term, and acuteness in Peruvian Paso horses (PPH) have not been determined to date. It is important to estimate this parameter for application in PPH breeding, therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the repeatability of overreach, term, and acuteness of PPHs. The study included records of 137 stallions and mares. All measurements were recorded in MP4 video format with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 megapixels and at 60 frames per second. All traits were measured three times (once per stride), and each trait was analyzed. KINOVEA software version 0.9.5 was used to analyze the measurements. A multivariate repeated measures animal model with sex effect was used to estimate the variance components for each trait using WOMBAT software. Repeatability was high in all traits (&gt; 0.78; Table 1). The low standard error values close to 0.02 indicate high precision in all traits (0.904, 0.855, and 0.903 for overreach, term, and acuteness, respectively), being defined as the variance of the mean of “n” measurements as a percentage of the variance of one measurement, indicating that this parameter has little effect on the temporal environment of the three traits. These results demonstrate that previous training can influence the regularity of the gait, in agreement with the present study, in which only adult animals that have already had previous training were evaluated. Furthermore, our results corroborate that traits with high repeatability require few measurements (3 in this study) to obtain greater precision, and an increase in the number of measurements may be irrelevant for parameter estimation. In a breeding plan, this high precision may be due to an increase in the additive genetic variance, indicating that two or more measurements have greater heritability than a single measurement, allowing a better breeding value estimate to be obtained. Considering the high repeatability values found, this parameter can be used as an indicator of how effective the selection process can be, considering its relationship with heritability, as repeatability values are higher than heritability, due to the inclusion of permanent environmental variance (within-individual variance) in its estimation. High values also indicate that individuals tend to have consistent performance, and therefore, obtaining several measures for evaluation may be impractical. It can be concluded that overreach, term, and acuteness have high repeatability values, which allows these traits to respond better in a selection process and performance evaluation for subsequent competitions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"2a129c42440a756d87330c3ec1d03750ec88c6290ac50b945a585b6f5efaefc3","category":"Environment"}
