Nevertheless, contemporary research endeavors are concentrating on discovering efficient methods for utilizing the potential of this discarded resource.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this study, we employed a sequential extraction method using chemical chelating agents to extract and isolate four distinct cell wall polysaccharides, designated as CWTPS-1 through CWTPS-4, from the tea dregs of Liubao brick tea. A comprehensive investigation into their physicochemical, structural, and hypoglycemic properties was conducted. The analysis of chemical composition and physicochemical characteristics revealed that all four CWTPSs were characterized as acidic polysaccharides, albeit with varying chemical compositions and physicochemical attributes. Specifically, the xyloglucan fractions, CWTPS-3 and CWTPS-4, were found to be rich in glucose and xylose, displaying a more uniform molecular weight distribution, greater structural stability, and a more irregular surface compared to the others. Moreover, they exhibited a higher diversity of monosaccharide residues. Importantly, our research unveiled that all four CWTPSs exhibited the capacity to modulate key glucose-regulated and antioxidant enzyme activities within HepG2 cells via the IRS-1-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, thereby ameliorating cellular insulin resistance. Furthermore, our correlation analysis highlighted significant associations between monosaccharide composition and neutral sugar content with the observed hypoglycemic activity of CWTPSs.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>This study highlights the potential of utilizing tea dregs as a valuable resource, making a significant contribution to the advancement of the tea industry. Furthermore, CWTPS-4 exhibits promising prospects for further development as a functional food ingredient or additive.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
