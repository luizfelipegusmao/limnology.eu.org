A significant proportion of urban public land is narrow linear road verges, though their small size and harsh environmental conditions (e.g. high soil temperatures) may limit their ability to support plants and animals.\n\nWe worked with a municipal government in a highly urbanised area to test whether conversion of standard road verges (e.g. lawn) to predominantly native understorey plants (forbs, grasses and shrubs) selected for their abilities to tolerate harsh growing conditions and provide habitat increased the abundance and richness of bees, butterflies and birds. We used a before-after-control-impact experiment and characterised temporal dynamics of biodiversity responses 1 year prior to planting and 4 years post-planting. We also tested whether traits known to influence species responses to urbanisation (body size and feeding specialisation) mediated responses to road verge plantings.\n\nBee species richness and abundance increased at experimental plantings in the first post-planting year and remained stable thereafter despite fluctuations at control sites. Butterfly abundance but not richness increased, and there was no evidence of bird responses to plantings.\n\nLarger bee species, which are known to be most negatively impacted by urbanisation, benefited more from the road verge plantings, while there was no effect of feeding specialisation. Bird and butterfly traits did not mediate responses to plantings.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>. Road verges comprise a significant proportion of urban green spaces, and our results suggest that despite their small sizes and harsh environmental conditions they can provide habitat for bees and to a lesser extent butterflies. We demonstrated that habitat value can be rapidly enhanced by converting standard road verges to native understorey plants and that these benefits may be greatest for the bee species most negatively impacted by urbanisation. Modifications such as additional plant species or wider verges may be required for urban road verges to provide habitat for a greater range of taxa including birds and butterflies.\n</p>","author":"Julian Brown, \nCaragh G.
