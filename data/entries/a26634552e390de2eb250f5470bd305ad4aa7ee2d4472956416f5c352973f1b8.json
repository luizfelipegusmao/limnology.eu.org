{"title":"AI-driven Diagnostic Processes and Comprehensive Multimodal Models in Pain Medicine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1668/v1","date":1724405380000,"content":"Pain diagnosis remains a challenging task due to its subjective nature, the variability in pain expression among individuals, and the difficult assessment of the underlying biopsychosocial factors. In this complex scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) can offer the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, predict treatment outcomes, and personalize pain management strategies. This review aims at dissecting the current literature on computer-aided diagnosis methods. It also discusses how AI-driven diagnostic methods can be integrated into multimodal models that combine various data sources, such as facial expression analysis, neuroimaging, and physiological signals, with advanced AI techniques. Despite the significant advancements in AI technology, its widespread adoption in clinical settings faces crucial challenges. Ethical considerations related to patient privacy, biases, and lack of reliability and generalizability are the main issues. Furthermore, there is a need for high-quality real-word validation as well as the development of standardized protocols and policy rules to guide the implementation of these technologies in diverse clinical settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a26634552e390de2eb250f5470bd305ad4aa7ee2d4472956416f5c352973f1b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
