In this review we present data covering over 170 000 participants at age ranging from 2 to 14 years focusing on human cell changes rather than using animal models found in previous studies. The male/female ratio was 4:1. Data collection occurred in many countries covering ethnically diversified subjects. Moreover, we aimed to show how the progress in genetic techniques influences the explanation of medical White Papers in ASD area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7724cdc7b2861a57af711acc597ffca752412d4fbe8abf177235da878be12255","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
