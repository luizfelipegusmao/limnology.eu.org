{"title":"The Architecture of Aging: How Ageing Drives Disease (Blueprint Theory)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.1387/v4","date":1728953562000,"content":"Age-related diseases place an intense and growing stress on healthcare systems. Numerous theories of ageing exist. Yet prediction, prevention and treatment limitations of age-related disease persist because we lack a complete aetiological understanding of their origins. Here we propose a new theory that aims to provide a blueprint-type understanding of ageing and disease aetiology, working across multiple scientific disciplines. Supported by specific examples, we demonstrate that the primary driver of much of age-related diseases is the futile triggering of specific biological pathways in a pathological manner, which we term pathophysiological pathways or patho-pathways. Patho-pathways induce pathological cell, tissue and system changes in the form of dysactivity (out of context activity that is at the wrong time and/or place), which is characteristic of age related disease. As part of patho-pathways, all wild-type (normal) genes have the potential to contribute to age-related diseases (though specific risk varies and can be formularised). In a domino-style effect, one patho-pathway typically triggers others, resulting in complex, but traceable, cascades. Utility, in terms of changing clinical and scientific practice, is derived from mapping these cascades to create Blueprint Maps that allow identification of biomarkers and therapeutic targets far upstream in the causal chain of events. Finally, our theory provides testable hypotheses concerning predictions of links between otherwise seemingly disparate diseases as well as new interventions to reduce ageing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f7782bd44522cb7943600f279e2dfe2836aef58eb4454b0010cc630549323f46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
