{"title":"Role of Humic Substances in the (Bio)degradation of Synthetic Polymers under Environmental Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1026/v1","date":1726149112000,"content":": Information on the detection of the presence and potential for degradation of synthetic polymers (SPs) under various environmental conditions is of increasing interest and concern to a wide range of specialists. At this stage, there is a need to understand the relationship between the main par-ticipants in the processes of (bio)degradation of SPs in various ecosystems (reservoirs with fresh and sea water, soils, etc.), namely the polymers themselves, the cells of microorganisms (MOs) partici-pating in their degradation, and humic substances (HSs), which constitute a macrocomponent of natural non-living organic matter of aquatic and soil ecosystems, formed and transformed in the processes of mineralization of bioorganic substances in environmental conditions. Analysis of the main mechanisms of their influence on each other and the effects produced that accelerate or inhibit polymer degradation can create the basis for scientifically based approaches to the most effective solution to the problem of degradation of SPs, including in the form of microplastics. This review is aimed at comparing various aspects of interactions of SPs, MOs and HSs in laboratory experiments (in vitro) and environmental investigations (in situ) aimed at the biodegradation of polymers, as well as pollutants (antibiotics and pesticides) that they absorb. Comparative calculations of deg-radation velocity of different SPs in different environments are presented. A special place in the analysis is given to the elemental chemical composition of HSs, which are most successfully in-volved in the biodegradation of SPs. In addition, the role of photooxidation and photoaging of polymers under the influence of the ultraviolet spectrum of solar radiation under environmental conditions on the (bio)degradation of SPs in the presence of HSs is discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e5b6c93722b709a9619c25c35e2650bcfd7e1f2ccd1495c18aac5e86e19cb5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
