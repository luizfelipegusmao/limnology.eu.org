{"title":"Implementation and Evaluation of an evidence-based group antenatal care program in two Nigerian states: Design and baseline data collection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1344/v1","date":1726642365000,"content":"Northern Nigeria has had historically low antenatal care (ANC) utilization rates with poor health outcomes. Group antenatal care (gANC) improves ANC behavior and pregnancy outcomes. The gANC has been adopted in Kaduna and Kano states, Nigeria. This paper presents baseline findings from the evaluation of the implementation of the gANC program to support scaling in real-world setting. Baseline data were collected from a cohort of 1,269 and 1,200 pregnant women enrolled in gANC at health facilities in Kaduna and Kano states respectively from March to April 2024. Analyses of socio-demographic and pregnancy behavior data were done. Participants were mostly between ages 19-31 years, married or living with a partner, with over 50% having their own businesses. Over 62% and 34% had completed secondary or higher-level education with 60% and 80% living in urban areas in Kaduna and Kano States, respectively. In Kano State, &amp;gt;60% of the women had their last delivery at home with 41.6% not assisted by a skilled birth attendant. In Kaduna, &amp;gt;63% delivered in the hospital and &amp;gt;50% had skilled attendance during labor. Almost half had not used contraceptives previously. Subsequent longitudinal data will examine the impact of gANC utilization on perinatal outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b3ba5837a6531a577afb9d507259c0f13346fdc9a39b7213485c7c824bdf8d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
