{"title":"Global Assessment of Mesoscale Eddies with TOEddies; Comparison between Multi-Datasets and Colocation with In-Situ Measurements","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0651/v1","date":1728451042000,"content":"The present study investigates the general characteristics of mesoscale eddies in the Global Ocean, as identified and tracked by the TOEddies algorithm (Laxenaire et al., 2018) implemented on a global scale. Applied to satellite observations (AVISO/DUACS) of Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT), TOEddies provides daily information on eddy dynamical characteristics (e.g., size and intensity) over a 30-year period (1993-2023) and identifies complex eddy-eddy interactions that lead to eddy splitting and merging. By capturing the multiple merging and splitting events that a single eddy can undergo, TOEddies generates a complex network of eddies that challenges the conventional view of a single trajectory associated with a single eddy. Furthermore, it offers an original assessment of interconnected eddy trajectories. A statistical description of the average characteristics of the eddies and their spatial distributions (generation, disappearance and merging/dividing is first provided. A comparative analysis of existing global eddy datasets is then presented. Among the years of observations, several coherent, long-lived mesoscale eddies with lifetimes exceeding 1.5 years stand out. However, we find that only a small fraction of these eddies is comparable between datasets, while their dynamic properties can differ substantially. Furthermore, the detection of eddies from altimetry is combined with 23 years of Argo profile co-localised measurements (2000-2023), allowing us to further investigate their contribution to the global subsurface ocean.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"001a54620ed91f7e31320dd1c8548ee63089202fb3ee3f98b92b1863a5023400","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
