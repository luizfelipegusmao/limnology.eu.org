{"title":"Is bitterling (Rhodeus amarus (Bloch, 1782)) threatened by the invasive unionid species Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834)?","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10530-024-03381-8","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The reproductive strategy of the European bitterling (<em>Rhodeus amarus</em>) involves an obligatory parasitic relationship with freshwater mussels from the family Unionidae. This study sets out to assess the possible threat that the invasive unionid species <em>Sinanodonta woodiana</em> poses to bitterling. The objective was accomplished by analysing the bitterling's reproductive preferences for <em>S. woodiana</em> and four native species of unionid mussels (<em>Anodonta anatina</em>, <em>Unio crassus</em>, <em>U. pictorum</em> and <em>U. tumidus</em>). We performed three experiments in a sand bottom tank. Experiments A and B lasted 20 for days and experiment C lasted 10Â days. The highest numbers of eggs and embryos of bitterling in the experiment A were found in <em>A. anatina.</em> On the other hand, <em>U. tumidus</em> had the greatest number of embryos in the most developed embryonic stage (stage VI), followed by <em>U. crassus</em>, <em>U. pictorum</em> and lastly <em>A. anatina</em>, whereas <em>U. crassus</em> had the largest densities of eggs and embryos per unit gill area in cm<sup>2</sup>. As hypothesized, <em>S. woodiana</em> did not contain a single egg or embryo which was also confirmed in the experiments B and C. Results of the experiment C had shown that the first few days bitterlings laid eggs in <em>Unio</em> spp. and only after that in <em>A. anatina.</em> Furthermore, it is evident that bitterlings favour mussels without glochidia. In conclusion, European bitterling will be threatened if an invasive species <em>S. woodiana</em> outcompetes the native unionid species.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"6b2da10a1958160d605ab30632759ff4ae68998635893fb4a5beffc4f96368d1","category":"Environment"}
