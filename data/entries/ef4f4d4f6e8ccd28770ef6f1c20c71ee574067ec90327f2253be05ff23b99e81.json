{"title":"Phytochemistry and Evaluation of the Anti-inflammatory Activity of the Hydroethanolic Extract of Virola elongata (Benth.) Warb. Stem Bark","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0265/v1","date":1725509576000,"content":"Background: Previous studies of the hydroethanolic extract of Virola elongata inner stem bark (HEVe) have demonstrated its antioxidant, gastroprotective, and antiulcer properties, but have not evaluate its anti-inflammatory potential. Methods: HEVe was obtained by maceration and phytochemicallly analyzed. Its systemic anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by its effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced peritonitis in mice. HEVe gel (HEgVe) was employed to evaluate topical anti-inflammatory activity by measuring the ear edema resulted from croton oil-induced dermatitis in mice. Cell viability assay was conducted to determine non-cytotoxic concentrations of HEVe. RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated by LPS to determinate cytokine and nitric oxide production.Results: Phytochemical analysis of HEVe revealed the presence of phenolic acids, neolignans, flavonoids, and monomeric catechins. Oral treatment of acute peritonitis with HEVe reduced total leukocytes, neutrophils, TNF-α and IL-1β, and elevated IL-10 levels. The application of HEgVe reduced local edema. The HEVe on RAW 264.7 cells exhibited no cytotoxicity and cells with HEVe reduced TNF-α, IL-1β, and NO levels, and increased IL-13 levels. Conclusions: HEVe demonstrated systemic and topical multitarget anti-inflammatory activity, which is likely due to the combined effects of secondary metabolites. HEVe emerges as a promising herbal remedy for inflammation with minimal cytotoxicity, emphasizing its potential therapeutic significance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef4f4d4f6e8ccd28770ef6f1c20c71ee574067ec90327f2253be05ff23b99e81","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
