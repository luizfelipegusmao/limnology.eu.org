{"title":"Dirac Fermion of a Monopole Pair (MP) Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202210.0172/v9","date":1714978361000,"content":"The electron of spin âˆ’1/2 is a Dirac fermion of a complex four-component spinor field. Though it is effectively addressed by relativistic quantum field theory, an intuitive form of the fermion still remains lacking and it is often described by the so-called Dirac belt trick. In this novel undertaking, the electron is examined within the boundary posed by a recently proposed MP model of a hydrogen atom into 4D space-time. Its transformation to Dirac fermion appears consistent with Dirac belt trick, quantum mechanics and Lie group with gravity considered to be a classical force for an irreducible spinor field. These outcomes are compatible with Dirac field theory and its associated features like wave function collapse, quantized Hamiltonian, non-relativistic wave function, Weyl spinor, Lorentz transformation and Feynman diagrams. The model though speculative, it could become important towards defining the fundamental state of matter subject to further examinations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e5664d68d60cc8c03251310066400208240a0482a2ba771963410835d924e2ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
