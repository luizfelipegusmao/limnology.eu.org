Apple provides various measures in macOS that make <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668710/how-secure-mac.html\">Macs more secure</a>, but if you want to ensure that the connection between your Mac and the internet is protected, rather than the computer itself, you need a VPN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a VPN essentially makes you invisible on the web–your data is encrypted, your IP address is hidden, and you can even make it look like you are surfing from another country. This latter reason is the key motive many people using a VPN have: they want to access services that are locked to a particular region, such as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671432/how-to-watch-us-netflix-in-the-uk-on-ipad-iphone-or-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">accessing U.S. Netflix from the U.K</a> or <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/738917/how-to-watch-hbo-max-in-the-uk.html\">HBO Max from the U.K</a>., or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671973/how-to-watch-bbc-iplayer-abroad-on-iphone-ipad-or-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">BBC iPlayer from the U.S.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While accessing locked content is a bit of a gray area, due to licensing agreements, we don’t blame anyone who is desperate to watch the latest season of their favorite program when it airs in the U.S. rather than waiting for it to come to their country. Paying to watch a streaming service that’s not available in your country has to be less morally wrong than actual <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/746134/how-to-watch-our-flag-means-death-in-the-uk.html\">piracy</a>! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for a VPN to protect your privacy and security online, and to grant you a way to access content as if you are in a different country, we are here to help. There are a lot of VPN providers vying for your business, which can make finding the best one to suit your needs difficult. To help you sort out the right provider for you, we’ve committed to extensive research and testing of VPN services that cater to Mac owners in our guide to the top VPN services for Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><p>PROMOTION</p><p><strong>Surfshark VPN: 82% off + 2 free months!</strong></p></div><div><div><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-4.png\" loading=\"lazy\" /></div><p>\n</p><p>Unlock premium features and unbeatable security. Surfshark VPN offers 3200+ servers in 100 countries, AES-256 encryption, and 24/7 support.

Do Mac users even need a VPN? Since Apple introduced iOS 15 and macOS Monterey in 2021 the company has offered a handy private relay service. iCloud Private Relay acts a bit like a VPN because it encrypts your web-browsing traffic and sends it through a relay to hide your location, IP, and any information about what you were browsing. iCloud Private Relay solves part of the problem that Mac users have used VPNs for in the past–it means that companies cannot build a clear picture of you on the web, thereby protecting your privacy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>iCloud Private Relay has some disadvantages: it only works when you are using Safari, you have to be a subscriber to iCloud, and you can’t use it to pretend to be surfing from another country in order to access content that is locked to a particular region. Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348965/icloud-plus-private-relay-safari-vpn-encryption-privacy.html\" target=\"_blank\">iCloud+ Private Relay explained</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a subscriber to iCloud, and only use Safari, then iCloud Private Relay will provide you with some anonymity when you are surfing the web. You may therefore be thinking that this means you don’t need a VPN to hide your location and identity. However, iCloud Private Relay does not allow you to choose an IP address or a region, and you won’t be able to make it look like you’re coming from another location. So you can’t watch geographically locked Netflix content, for example. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Issues with VPNs on Mac </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One feature of VPNs is the ability to use Split Tunnelling to choose which apps go via a VPN and which don’t. However recent versions of macOS and the M-series Macs generally do not support this feature. Only <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://hide.me/en/&amp;xcust=1-1-231047-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Hide.me</a> (reviewed below) supports Split Tunnelling on new versions of macOS and the M-series Macs. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best VPN for Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our current favorite service is <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=115&amp;aff_id=1351&amp;source=macworldcouk&amp;aff_sub=1-1-231047-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Surfshark</a>, which is a well-priced all-rounder, we also love <a href=\"https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=580&amp;aff_id=980&amp;url_id=12136&amp;aff_sub=1-1-231047-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">NordVPN</a>. But below you will find the top VPN services for Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Most features:  <a href=\"https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=580&amp;aff_id=980&amp;url_id=12136&amp;aff_sub=1-1-231047-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">NordVPN</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Best all-rounder: <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=115&amp;aff_id=1351&amp;source=macworldcouk&amp;aff_sub=1-1-231047-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Surfshark</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Most servers:  <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8807236-14087873?sid=1-1-231047-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Private Internet Access</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Best premium:  <a href=\"https://go.expressvpn.com/c/321564/1462856/16063?subId1=1-1-231047-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.expressvpn.com/offer/coupon?offer=3monthsfree\">ExpressVPN</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Most countries:  <a href=\"https://billing.purevpn.com/aff.php?aff=25344\" target=\"_blank\">PureVPN</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these will cost less than $5/£5 per month, with some less than $3/£3. However, once your first year is over the price often jumps, so it’s worth setting a reminder to shop around 11 months after you subscribe so you can search for a better deal, alternatively, you could cancel and sign up with another email address. There are also a number of free VPNs available, but beware that some severely restrict which servers (and therefore countries) you can connect to and the amount of data you can download through those servers. You may be able to save money if you take a look at our round-up of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673709/vpn-deals-for-mac.html\">VPN deals</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also important to read the terms and conditions before using a free VPN, as in rare cases they sell your data to third parties to offset the cost of you using it without paying. It’s a bigger problem on iPhones and Android where unscrupulous companies try to cash in on the VPN ‘gold rush’ and offer up poorly put together apps. Stick with our recommendations and you’ll be safe from these, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>VPN apps very easy to install and use but for a step-by-step guide, read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668852/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-a-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">how to set up a VPN on a Mac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these VPNs will also work on your iPhone and iPad as well, but you might want to check out our separate guides to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668754/best-vpn-for-iphone.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPNs for iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668862/best-ipad-vpn.html\">best VPNs for iPad</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best VPNs for Mac 2023: Reviewed &amp; Ranked</h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

It’s one of the easiest VPNs to use and has an up-to-date independent audit. It also has specialty servers for specific purposes. There are cheaper options, with unlimited connections and more in-depth VPN features, but NordVPN is our top choice right now because it stands out in so many areas, from speed and privacy to unblocking and ease of use. </p>\n\n<p>There are more than 5,300 servers (none of which are virtual) available across 60 countries, which sounds great. You probably only care about the servers where you want to unblock content, but the more servers the better as it means you have a better chance of finding one that’s not overloaded. You won’t have to figure out which one to choose thanks to the handy ‘Quick connect’ feature that picks the server best suited to your needs.</p>\n\n<p>Connections are fast and reliable, and NordVPN unblocks popular streaming services around the world including Netflix, HBO Max, and BBC iPlayer. You can connect up to six devices simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p>Nord has added support for the faster <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/news/vpn/what-is-wireguard-3788133/\" target=\"_blank\">WireGuard protocol</a> in NordLynx, making it one of the fastest VPN services out there. However, it’s only available on the ‘IKE’ version of the app, which only offers a permanently enabled kill switch. To have more control, you’ll need to download the ‘OpenVPN’ version, albeit with slightly slower speeds.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5,300 servers</li>\n\n<li>6 simultaneous connections</li>\n\n<li>24/7 tech support</li>\n\n<li>Kill Switch</li>\n\n<li>Works with Netflix &amp; other streaming services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nord frequently has deals on offer that save money on the usual monthly price if you take advantage of the <a href=\"https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=580&amp;aff_id=980&amp;url_id=12136&amp;aff_sub=1-1-231047-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">two-year plan</a>.

It’s missing the specialty servers offered by rivals such as <a href=\"https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=580&amp;aff_id=980&amp;url_id=12136&amp;aff_sub=1-1-231047-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">NordVPN</a>, who shares the same parent company, though. </p>\n\n<p>Connection speeds are very impressive, and that’s thanks to the use of the WireGuard protocol. You really won’t notice any slowdown in your internet speed when Surfshark is running, so long as you have WireGuard selected and aren’t using servers the other side of the globe. </p>\n\n<p>The company has upgraded all its servers so they run entirely in RAM, just like NordVPN and ExpressVPN. Running servers on RAM is better for privacy as data isn’t written to a hard drive. It’s also a member of the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112722&amp;xcust=41-3802333-11-3800004&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Freview%2Fsurfshark-mac-3802333%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvpntrust.net%2F\" target=\"_blank\">VPN Trust Initiative</a>, while two-factor authentication (2FA) is a feature few VPN services offer. Being run from the Netherlands also means this is a privacy-friendly option.</p>\n\n<p>The other reason to consider Surfshark is because it undercuts almost all of its rivals on price, yet doesn’t place any limit on the number of devices you can use simultaneously.

Since 2019 it’s been owned by the same people as CyberGhost and Express VPN. </p>\n\n<p>It has an incredible 33,665 servers across 73 countries–that’s far higher than almost any consumer VPN service. Many of the servers are in the U.S. but you’ll find all the most popular locations. There are also virtual servers, so for example you can choose a virtual server in India, while an actual server in India would have to log user data. </p>\n\n<p>Earlier in 2023 PIA removed its 10-device limit on subscriptions, meaning that there’s now no limit on the number of devices you can connect. </p>\n\n<p>Speeds are excellent, thanks to the WireGuard protocol. PIA also benefits from a kill switch, a feature that is sometimes left out of Mac VPN services. </p>\n\n<p>Split tunneling, a feature that allows you to choose which apps are routed outside the VPN tunnel, is available. This is one of the few VPNS that offers this feature for macOS. </p>\n\n<p>It allows you to access international versions of Netflix, as well as BBC iPlayer while outside the U.K. </p>\n\n<p>The service doesn’t log any of your details or activity, so even though it is based in the U.S., there’s no data to hand over should the authorities order PIA to do so. It now has had a reassuring Deloitte audit, which should make its U.S. location a non-issue.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>33,000+ servers (RAM only)</li>\n\n<li>Unlimited connections</li>\n\n<li>24/7 customer service</li>\n\n<li>Kill switch enabled by default</li>\n\n<li>Split Tunneling </li>\n</ul>\n<p>PIA for macOS offers a large number of features that are the same as the Windows version, including a kill switch, advanced split tunneling, an ad- and malware blocker, multi-hop, and support for OpenVPN and WireGuard protocols. It’s so often the case that the macOS version of a VPN has fewer features than the Windows version. </p>\n\n<p>However, it’s not perfect. PIA doesn’t support IPv6 connections, which will be frustrating for some, but not a deal-breaker for the great majority of VPN users. </p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, PIA is a solid VPN service at an affordable price.

Everything you’d expect from a modern VPN is here, including an effective kill switch, and impressive device support. There was split tunneling for app-by-app protection, but, as with most VPNs, that hasn’t worked since macOS Big Sur. It is extremely easy to set up, with quick access via the menu bar one of the highlights.</p>\n\n<p>ExpressVPN has often led the way when it comes to security, but other providers are quickly catching up. It’s no longer the only one with RAM-based servers, while solid device and tech support are the norm whichever service you use.

It starts with a free tier with very limited features, is easy to understand, offers a collection of interesting features and great speeds.  </p>\n\n<p>The free tier has restrictions on the number of servers you can choose, and the speeds on offer though. You just get a choice of three countries (U.S., Netherlands and Japan) and speeds aren’t as good as the paid-for version. The free version may be enough if you just want an extra layer of privacy, for which iCloud Private Relay may be sufficient. If you want more than that, say to unblock Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, BBC iPlayer and others, you will need to pay for it. </p>\n\n<p>Those who pay for ProtonVPN get access to excellent speeds and can also use ‘Secure Core servers’ which route a connection through multiple servers improving privacy.  As well as the standard options for connecting to the fastest server and a random server, you can create your own. </p>\n\n<p>ProtonVPN is based in Switzerland, which has favorable privacy laws. Swiss law doesn’t require the saving of any logs, and won’t force ProtonVPN to spy on any specific users. The results of an independent audit by Securitum have been <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://protonvpn.com/blog/no-logs-audit/&amp;xcust=1-1-231047-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">published online</a>. ProtonVPN uses its own DNS servers to increase privacy. Proton’s also offers anonymous email addresses for signing up privately. </p>\n\n<p>Other extras include NetShield with DNS filtering to offer protection from malware-infested websites, ads and trackers. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>1900+ servers in 65+ countries</li>\n\n<li>Use 10 devices at the same time</li>\n\n<li>Includes NetShield malware and tracker blocker</li>\n\n<li>Internet kill switch</li>\n\n<li>One of the fastest VPN we’ve tested on macOS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ProtonVPN is an excellent service with fast speeds, the right privacy promises, a good amount of features including support for streaming services, and fair pricing. It’s well worth a look. Alongside the free tier are Plus (just the VPN) and Unlimited (a bundle that adds email, calendar and 500GB of cloud storage.)</p>\n\n<p>If you aren’t a power user requiring a VPN for privacy and security, there are plenty of VPNs that will do what you need for less though. The high price is a big disadvantage here and the free version is too limited to be useful. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/345937/protonvpn-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProtonVPN review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8.

To get around that you could configure a compatible router with Hidden24 and connect all your devices to that router. </p>\n\n<p>In our tests Hidden24 reliably unblocked Netflix, iPlayer and other streaming services which are available in the seven countries it supports. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>7 servers in 7 countries </li>\n\n<li>1 simultaneous connection</li>\n\n<li>Unblocked Netflix, iPlayer and more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s a good cheap option if your priority is privacy over other features. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n<h2>How we tested VPNs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For each VPN service we review, we conduct tests at three different times of the day: morning, afternoon, and evening, using \n<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/speedtest-by-ookla/id1153157709&amp;xcust=1-1-231047-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Ookla Speedtest</a>. We start by measuring the speed of our unprotected internet connection before testing the upload/download speeds of the VPN service. These tests are conducted to servers located in North America, the UK, Europe, Oceana, and Asia over an ethernet connection with a service provision of 100Mbps.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/03/speedtest-mac-100751307-medium.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" alt=\"speedtest mac\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Ookla Speedtest</p></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>To test upload and download speeds, we close down all background internet processes on the Mac, using TripMode. The only traffic on the system able to upload or download any data is Ookla. We use this setup to ensure that the numbers that Ookla produced were not stymied by anything else that the computer may have been doing at the time. The speeds Ookla captured were then averaged, providing us with a final numeric score.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then use those scores to calculate a percentage of difference in speeds, which is what you’ll see in our reviews. Since internet speeds change constantly based on server load, how fast your connection is, and a gazillion other factors, we feel this provides a better picture of what you can expect from a service, on the whole, than merely quoting the exact upload/download speeds we encountered during testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speed isn’t the only quantifiable metric that we look at. The number of countries that a VPN offers servers in, total number of servers worldwide, and how much it’ll cost you to connect to those servers on a monthly or annual basis are also taken into consideration when recommending a VPN service to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, we conduct hours of research into the VPN providers to find out who owns them, where they’re based, what they do with subscriber information, and whether the provider has a track record of questionable business practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s a VPN?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>VPN stands for \n<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network&amp;xcust=1-1-231047-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">virtual private network</a>. If you’re not using a VPN, when your computer connects to the internet, it does so through the local gateway provided by your \n<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider&amp;xcust=1-1-231047-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">internet service provider</a> (ISP). Doing this allows you to connect to all of the online services you use everyday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, connecting this way also allows an ISP to know your physical location based on where you access the internet—be it at home, at work, in a cafe, or at a public Wi-Fi hotspot. This information is often sold to marketers and other parties interested in getting to know more about you and your browsing habits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Worse still, if you connect to the internet through an access point with weak security, such as at an airport, mall, or local library, hackers connected to the same network could intercept personal information like your social media passwords or banking credentials through what’s called a \n<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack&amp;xcust=1-1-231047-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">man-in-the-middle attack</a>. A VPN service can help prevent all of that.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/03/vpn-client-100751313-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" alt=\"vpn client\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>A good VPN should allow for server connections around the globe.</p></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>A VPN creates an \n<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption&amp;xcust=1-1-231047-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">encrypted</a> digital tunnel between your computer and the server of the VPN service you choose to use. Once this tunnel has been established, your web searches, the sites you access, and the information you submit online will be hidden from prying eyes. This means that your ISP can’t log or sell your information and hackers using the same network as you will find it difficult to initiate an attack on you. Almost no one will have any idea of what information you’re accessing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What a VPN can’t do</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A VPN can’t protect you from viruses, malware, or ransomware attacks if you choose to download an infected file, or a visit site designed to inject your computer with malignant code. It won’t keep spoofed sites from stealing your personal information, if you happen to visit one. So, you’ll want to \n<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://ssd.eff.org/en&amp;xcust=1-1-231047-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">bone up on online security best practices</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should know that while using a VPN will allow you to anonymously engage in peer-to-peer file-sharing/torrenting, some service providers may cancel your VPN subscription or turn over your information to the authorities if they catch you trading copyrighted material with others.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to look for in a VPN</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A clear privacy policy.</strong> A good VPN should offer an easy-to-understand privacy policy that outlines what, if any, information the company collects from its users. It’s important that this policy details what they do with this information. Some VPN providers, especially those that offer their services for free, sell their user information to advertisers and other interested parties, just like an ISP does. Choose a provider that offers a level of privacy that suits you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Know where the provider is based.</strong> Many countries have no laws demanding that VPN providers maintain logs of their users’ activity. This makes maintaining your privacy more assurable than it would be if you use a VPN located in a country that requires that user-activity records be maintained. Some companies, in an effort to make their network of servers look bigger or more varied than it actually is, \n<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://restoreprivacy.com/vpn-server-locations/&amp;xcust=1-1-231047-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">spoof the locations of their servers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The more servers, the merrier.</strong> Choosing a VPN provider with a ton of servers around the world is important for a couple of reasons. First, having a multitude of servers to choose from means that you won’t be forced to connect to an overpopulated server where the data flows like mud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, having a wealth of servers to choose from both at home and internationally means more opportunities for spoofing your location, allowing you to hide where you are or access region-locked content with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Multiple payment options.</strong> It’s a vicious circle. Paying for a VPN with a credit card online before you have access to a VPN could allow your financial information to fall into the wrong hands. Look for providers that offer alternative payment options such as PayPal, Bitcoin, AliPay, or via the Mac App Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>An easy-to-use interface.</strong> It takes a lot of digital wizardry to connect to a VPN. Some people want to see how their VPN operates, behind the scenes. Using an open source VPN client like \n<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.tunnelblick.net&amp;xcust=1-1-231047-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Tunnelblick</a> is great for this. Most folks, however, just want their VPN to work with minimal frustration. Look for a VPN service that offers a Mac client with an easy-to-use interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Protection for all of your devices.</strong> A good VPN service will offer licenses for multiple devices to protect your loved ones’ computers as well as your personal smartphone and tablet. To this end, before investing in a VPN subscription, make sure that it provides software clients for all of the devices you own.</p>\n\nPersonal Software, Security Software and Services, VPN</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1daec7957e545f110f78e9625b05a0823a915f66f6a471d8035a577aa9da0d80","category":"Apple"}
