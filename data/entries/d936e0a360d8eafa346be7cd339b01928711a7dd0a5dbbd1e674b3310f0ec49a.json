{"title":"Exploiting Axisymmetry to Optimize CFD Simulations -Heave Motion and Wave Radiation of a Spherical Buoy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0095/v1","date":1725269766000,"content":"In ocean engineering, accurate and efficient numerical simulations are crucial. Leveraging axisymmetry vastly enhances the efficiency of a simulation, reducing a three-dimensional scenario to a two-dimensional simulation. Exploiting axisymmetry enables a significant reduction in computational demand while maintaining simulation fidelity. In this paper, axisymmetry is leveraged to perform a large ensemble of simulations, in order to evaluate and maximise the accuracy and efficiency of a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. In particular, the free decay motion and wave radiation from a heaving semi-submerged sphere are simulated, using the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) solver, interFOAM, in the opensource finite volume CFD software OpenFOAM. Validated against highly accurate experimental data, extensive parametric studies are conducted, previously limited by computational constraints, which facilitate the refinement of simulation setups. More than 50 iterations of the same heaving sphere simulation are performed, informing efficient trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy across various simulation parameters and mesh configurations. Ultimately, by employing axisymmetry, this research contributes to the development of more accurate and efficient numerical modeling in ocean engineering.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d936e0a360d8eafa346be7cd339b01928711a7dd0a5dbbd1e674b3310f0ec49a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
