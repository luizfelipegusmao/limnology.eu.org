Zooplankton species engage in dispersal through time (i.e., egg bank) and space (i.e., vectors) by means of resting eggs. However, dispersal to patches does not equate to successful colonization, as there is a clear distinction between dispersal rates and successful colonization. We performed a field mesocosm experiment assessing dispersal and colonization success of zooplankton from resting eggs or transport via directional wind/airborne and biotic vectors in the vicinity of three ponds. By using active vs. sterile pond sediments and mesh-covered vs. open mesocosms, we disentangled the two mechanisms of dispersal, i.e., from the egg bank vs. space. We found that for both rotifers and cladocerans, sediment type, mesh cover and duration of the experiment influenced species richness and species composition. The relative contribution of resting stages to dispersal and colonization success was substantial for both rotifers and cladocerans. However, wind/airborne dispersal was relatively weak for cladocerans when compared to rotifers, whereas biotic vectors contributed to dispersal success especially for cladocerans. Our study demonstrates that dispersal and colonization success of zooplankton species strongly depends on the dispersal mode and that different dispersal vectors can generate distinct community composition.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"e49b778856a78b740e2f0a597b32edc31a7443e01c8dd5abf76a24e3991c5a65","category":"Environment"}
