{"title":"PSV-17 Glycerol monolaurate improves litter performance and modifies milk composition when fed to lactating sows","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/314/7664794?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Glycerol monolaurate (GML) has proven antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, and additionally has been shown to increase milk immunoglobulins and improve gut health. However, limited information is available on how feeding GML to the sow prior and during lactation can influence the performance of the nursing pig. The objective of this study was to determine if feeding GML to sows would help maintain body condition, increase lauric acid in milk and improve litter performance. A total of 50 sows were randomly assigned to either a control feed or to a control feed with 1.5 kgs/mT of GML (LipoVital GL-90) 3 to 5 dbefore farrowing. Sow and litter performance was measured until weaning at 25 d. On d 1, piglets were cross-fostered within treatment and weighed. Creep feed was offered. Milk samples were taken from 5 randomly selected sows per treatment on d 3 and 25. Glycerol monolaurate had no effect on number of pigs born alive, born dead, stillborn, or number weaned (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.20). No treatment differences (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.20) were observed for sow feed intake, loss of backfat thickness or body weight losses during the study. Control piglets tended to consume more creep feed than GML piglets (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.15). Starting body weight was less for GML piglets (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). Despite the decreased starting body weight, weaning weight was not different between treatments (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.20). Using starting body weight as a covariate, total body weight gain tended to be greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.08) for GML piglets than the control piglets (5.01 kgs vs 4.89 kg, respectively). Glycerol monolaurate-fed pigs in the bottom quartile of starting body weights (&lt; 1.3 kgs) numerically out gained their control counterparts (4.67 kgs vs 4.12 kgs). Milk from GML sows had 57% more lauric acid on d 3 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) and 124% more lauric acid at weaning compared with control sows (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, GML maintained sow body condition, increased the content of lauric acid in milk and improved piglet body weight gain, especially in lighter body weight piglets. The results from this study demonstrate the application of GML in commercial sow herds will be beneficial to both sow and litter.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"7879b0f908fbb8138aec555a4caba1d8d7c559ae252735f8b9bf01cd2b38da41","category":"Environment"}
