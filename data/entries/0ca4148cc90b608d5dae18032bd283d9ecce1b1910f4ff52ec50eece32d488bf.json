A total of 300 Nile tilapia fingerlings (14.64 ± 0.09 g) were subjected to five dietary treatments, with DFP added to a basal diet at doses of 0, 20, 40, 80, and 160 g kg<sup>−1</sup> DFP. Growth and immunological responses were assessed after 4 and 8 weeks of feeding, and the transcriptional level of immune and antioxidant-related genes was measured after 8 weeks. Fish fed diets containing DFP exhibited significantly greater weight gain, faster growth, and enhanced levels of key indicators of immunity than control fish (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). A diet containing 40 g DFP kg<sup>−1</sup> produced the best result in terms of growth, enhanced immune response indicators in skin mucus and blood serum, and the upregulation of <i>IL-1</i>, <i>IL-8</i>, <i>LBP</i>, <i>GPx</i>, <i>GST-α</i>, and <i>GSR</i> expression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Based on the quadratic regression analysis, the optimum concentration of DFP was 80 g kg<sup>−1</sup>. These findings collectively suggest that powdered DFP may serve as a promising feed supplement for Nile tilapia raised in biofloc systems.</p>","author":"Chinh Le Xuan, \nVu Linh Nguyen, \nSupreya Wannavijit, \nPiyatida Outama, \nNuttapon Khongdee, \nNantaporn Sutthi, \nViet Vuong Nguyen, \nSeyed Hossein Hoseinifar, \nPrapansak Srisapoome, \nHien Van Doan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"0ca4148cc90b608d5dae18032bd283d9ecce1b1910f4ff52ec50eece32d488bf","category":"Environment"}
