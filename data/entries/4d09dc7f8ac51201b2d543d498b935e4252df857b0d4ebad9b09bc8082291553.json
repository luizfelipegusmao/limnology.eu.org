{"title":"The OptoReg system: a simple and inexpensive solution for regulating water oxygen","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae024/7668628?rss=1","date":1715385600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This paper describes an optocoupler-based regulation apparatus for saturation manipulation of oxygen in water (OptoReg). This system enables control of solenoid valves for oxygen and nitrogen gases using a FireSting-O<sub>2</sub> meter, an optocoupler box and an electronic switch box. The hardware components connect to a computer through Universal Serial Bus (USB) cables. The control software is free and has a graphical user interface, making it easy to use. With the OptoReg system, any lab with a computer running Microsoft Windows operating system and a 4-channel FireSting-O<sub>2</sub> meter can easily and cheaply set up four independently controlled systems for regulating water oxygen levels. Here, we describe how to assemble and run the OptoReg system and present a data set demonstrating the high precision and stability of the OptoReg system during static acclimation experiments and dynamic warming trials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"4d09dc7f8ac51201b2d543d498b935e4252df857b0d4ebad9b09bc8082291553","category":"Environment"}
