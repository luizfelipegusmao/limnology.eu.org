{"title":"Incorporation of trace metals in Hanford waste boehmite mineral phases and dissolution rate impacts","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14505?af=R","date":1729492164000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Data from radioactive Hanford tank waste samples was analyzed to assess whether trace metals present were incorporated into the bulk boehmite matrix or were simply intermingled with the bulk material and subsequent impacts to the boehmite dissolution rate. Results suggest that chromium is primarily blended into the bulk boehmite, with a small fraction present on the surface of the solids. However, increasing the level of chromium incorporation 30-fold decreased the dissolution rate of boehmite by only 8%, suggesting incorporation of chromium into these samples had a minimal impact on the dissolution rate. Iron was also found to be incorporated in the boehmite solids. Silicon appears to be simply intermingled and not blended into the boehmite crystals.</p>","author":"Amy M. Westesen, \nGregg J.
