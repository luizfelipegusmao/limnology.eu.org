{"title":"Enhancing Precision: Unveiling Individualized Treatment Effects with Advanced Computational Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1875/v1","date":1714379658000,"content":"In areas like commercial and policy decisions—it's important to know how different treatments affect things and how well they work. However, treatments affect things on average—but now—with fancy computer methods and big sets of data, interest lies in figuring out how treatments might work differently for different people. For instance, let's say instead of just looking at what works for most people, researchers want to know which treatment is best for each person. This would help doctors to decide the right treatment for each patient. This idea isn't just for healthcare—it can help in other areas too, like deciding how to govern employees or making government policies. There are some ways people have been trying to do this already, but they struggle when there are lots of different factors to consider. New computer methods, though, are good at handling lots of factors, but they need a ton of data to work well. Therefore, this study looks at three computer methods that are—Virtual Twin Random Forest (VTRF), Causal Forest (CF), and Causal Net (CN) using real-world data about encouraging people to do manual labour. One problem this study is trying to solve is something called the \"winner's curse\", where a treatment might seem better than it really is because of how it's predicted by the computer. We are also testing some ideas to see if we can fix this problem and make the predictions more accurate.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9c4beee152708b6c780fde26c23a13f0b225a38d09f9628792b918a65afab1ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
