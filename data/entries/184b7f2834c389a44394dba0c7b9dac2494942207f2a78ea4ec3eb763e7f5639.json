{"title":"CBD-X Extracts in Asthma Management: Reducing Th2-Driven Cytokine Secretion and Neutrophil/Eosonophil Activity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0963/v1","date":1726112121000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways affecting over 10% of the global population. It is characterized by airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, driven predominantly by type 2 helper T cells (Th2) and type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in a subset of patients. However, a significant portion of asthmatic individuals present with \"type 2-low\" asthma, often refractory to standard inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy. Therefore, developing innovative therapeutic strategies has become essential. Recent studies have highlighted cannabidiol (CBD) as a promising anti-inflammatory agent capable of modulating immune responses. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of a high-CBD extract (CBD-X) in asthma; Methods: We evaluated the effects of CBD-X on cells involved in asthma pathogenesis using primary human Th2 cells, neutrophils and asthma mouse model; Results: Our findings indicate that CBD-X extract inhibits Th2 differentiation and reduces the secretion of IL-5 and IL-13, which are crucial cytokines in asthma. Additionally, CBD-X significantly reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-6 in neutrophils and impairs their migration, a critical step in airway inflammation. In a murine asthma model, CBD-X administration led to marked downregulation of IgE and pro-asthmatic cytokines, along with reduced leukocyte, eosinophil, and neutrophil infiltration in lung tissues; Conclusions: These results suggest that CBD-X extract could offer a novel, complementary approach to managing both type 2-high and type 2-low asthma by targeting key inflammatory pathways and modulating immune cell behavior.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"184b7f2834c389a44394dba0c7b9dac2494942207f2a78ea4ec3eb763e7f5639","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
