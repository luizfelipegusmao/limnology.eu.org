{"title":"Aiming for Equity: Addressing COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy among American Indian/Alaska Native Populations through Educational Interventions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1221/v1","date":1718702453000,"content":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing healthcare disparities among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations, rooted in historical traumas and systemic marginalization. Methods: This study conducted at a single Indian Health Service (IHS) clinic in central Michigan examines the effectiveness of educational interventions in enhancing COVID-19 knowledge and attitudes among AI/AN populations. Utilizing a pre/post prospective study design, participants received either a video or infographic educational intervention, followed by a survey assessing COVID-19 knowledge and attitudes. Results: The results indicate significant improvements in knowledge and attitudes post-intervention, with both modalities proving effective. However, specific factors such as gender, political affiliation, and place of residence influenced COVID-19 attitudes and knowledge, emphasizing the importance of tailored interventions. Conclusions: Despite limitations, this study highlights the critical role of educational interventions in addressing vaccine hesitancy and promoting health equity within AI/AN communities. Moving forward, comprehensive strategies involving increased Indian Health Service funding, culturally relevant interventions, and policy advocacy are crucial in mitigating healthcare disparities and promoting health equity within AI/AN communities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c7d33620c313b16a011f9eba37b22c7f34883ddfdce14e0ad26618a90105bebe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
