{"title":"Assessment of quality of antenatal care services and associated factors in Malawi: Insights from a nationwide household survey","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305294","date":1718200800000,"content":"<p>by Chrispin Mandiwa, Bernadetta Namondwe</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Provision of quality antenatal care (ANC) to pregnant women is essential for reducing maternal and newborn mortality. ANC provides an opportunity for early identification of conditions that increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, there is limited evidence regarding the quality of ANC received by women in Malawi. This study aimed to assess the quality of ANC and associated factors in Malawi.</p> Materials and methods <p>National representative data from the 2019–2020 Malawi Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey was used for this cross–sectional study. A total of 6,287 weighted sample of women aged 15 to 49 years who had a live birth and received ANC at least once within two years preceding the survey were included in the analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to estimate the magnitude of quality ANC and multivariable logistic regression was computed to identify associated factors.</p> Results <p>Of the 6,287 women, only 12.6% (95% CI: 11.4–13.9) received quality ANC. The likelihood of receiving quality ANC was significantly higher among women who had four to seven ANC contacts (AOR = 2.10; 95% CI: 1.79–2.49), made at least eight ANC contacts (AOR  =  3.40; 95% CI: 1.90–6.09) and started ANC within the first trimester (AOR  =  1.30; 95% CI: 1.10–1.53). On the other hand, women who had only primary education (AOR = 0.62; 95% CI:0.48–0.82) and had five or more births (AOR  =  0.56; 95% CI: 0.40–0.78) were less likely to receive quality ANC.</p> Conclusion <p>The findings reveal that quality of ANC in Malawi is low. These findings suggest the need for targeted interventions aimed at improving access to and utilization of ANC services among women with lower education and higher parity. Strengthening efforts to promote early ANC initiation and increasing the number of ANC contacts could significantly enhance the quality of ANC received by women in Malawi.</p>","author":"Chrispin Mandiwa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1fd7fc21357c829eac3f07b110c06ed7bfd36f275cae7adbe98e6e7fab2b68e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
