Moreover, these matrixes functionalized with nanomaterials improve the mechanical properties of polymers, particularly, the addition of photocatalyst allows the remotion of many pollutants due to the adsorptive and photocatalytic capacities of the films. Heterogeneous photocatalysts such as titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) has wide photocatalytic properties to reach high remotion yields, however, to directly use these nanomaterials in water, generates its agglomeration and end disposed in water which generates pollution [<a href=\"#ozae044.640-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.640-B4\">4</a>]. Therefore, in this research, the fabrication of gellan gum (GG) films reinforced with CaCO<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> supported on the film to remove organic dyes in water was performed, also, the morphology and structure of the films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results demonstrate that the composite film GG-CaCO<sub>3</sub>-TiO<sub>2</sub> maintains good photocatalytic performance and it was successfully mechanically reinforced.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9fbb23d338a2f993111c78204a17bce3b8e202e9259dacbdf7ac92549ee9d535","category":"Environment"}
