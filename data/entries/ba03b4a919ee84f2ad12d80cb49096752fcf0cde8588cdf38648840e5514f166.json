{"title":"Sex-Biased Associations of Circulating Ferroptosis Inhibitors with Reduced Lipid Peroxidation and Better Neurocognitive Performance in People with HIV","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1759/v1","date":1724451761000,"content":"Ferroptosis is implicated in viral neuropathogenesis and may underlie HIV-associated neu-rocognitive impairment (NCI). Emerging data also suggest differences in brain iron transport by sex. We hypothesized that circulating ferritins that inhibit ferroptosis associate with neurocogni-tive function and NCI in people with HIV (PWH) in a sex-biased manner. Serum ferritin heavy-chain-1 (Fth-1), ferritin light-chain (Ftl), and urinary F2-isoprostanes (uF2-isoPs, specific li-pid peroxidation marker) were quantified in 324 PWH (including 61 women) with serial global (NPZ-4) and domain-specific neurocognitive testing. Biomarker associations with neurocognitive test scores and NCI were evaluated by multivariable regression; correlations with uF2-isoPs were also assessed. Higher Ftl and Fth-1 associated with less NCI in all PWH (adjusted odds ratios 0.53, 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) 0.36-0.79 and 0.66, 95% CI 0.45-0.97, respectively). In women, higher Ftl and Fth-1 associated with better NPZ-4 (Ftl: adjusted beta (β)=0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.29; Ftl-by-sex βinteraction=0.32, p=0.047) and domain-specific neurocognitive test scores. Effects on neurocognitive performance persisted for up to 5 years. Levels of both ferritins correlated in-versely with uF2-isoPs in women (Ftl: rho=-0.47, p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba03b4a919ee84f2ad12d80cb49096752fcf0cde8588cdf38648840e5514f166","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
