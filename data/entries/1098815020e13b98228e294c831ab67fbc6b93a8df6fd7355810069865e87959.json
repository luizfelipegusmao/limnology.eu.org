{"title":"The Impact of Data Packet Loss on Neural Decoding","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1901/v1","date":1727169342000,"content":"Background: In the field of brain-computer interfaces, neural decoding plays a crucial role in translating neural signals into meaningful physical actions. These signals are transmitted to processors for decoding via wired or wireless channels, often encountering data loss, commonly referred to as \"packet loss.\" Despite its importance, the impact of different types and degrees of packet loss on neural decoding has yet to be comprehensively studied. Understanding this impact is critical for advancing neural signal processing and data filtering. \nMethods: This paper addresses this gap by constructing four distinct packet loss models, simulating congestion packet loss, distributed packet loss, and burst packet loss scenarios. Using macaque superior arm-movement decoding experiments, we evaluate the effects of these packet loss types on decoding performance. \nResults: Our findings reveal that continuous burst packet loss significantly degrades decoding performance at the same packet loss probability, and decoding parameters that are sensitive to data continuity are more heavily impacted by packet loss.  \nConclusions: This study provides an analysis of the relationship between packet loss and neural decoding results, offering valuable insights for future strategies aimed at preventing and handling packet loss in neural signal acquisition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1098815020e13b98228e294c831ab67fbc6b93a8df6fd7355810069865e87959","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
