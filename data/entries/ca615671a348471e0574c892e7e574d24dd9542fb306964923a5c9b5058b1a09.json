{"title":"Are Wildfires Coming Closer to Our Doors? Analysis in Spain and California 2007-2015","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0665/v1","date":1712712761000,"content":"Wildfires present a significant risk to societies globally due to population growth, con- centrated activities, climate change, and extreme environmental conditions. To establish effective fire suppression and management policies, it is crucial to determine whether the distance between ignition points and urban areas is increasing or decreasing. This study analyses 101,597 fires in Spain and California between 2007 and 2015, using the Mann-Kendall test to determine trends. The study analyses the location and cause of fires to determine their distance from human constructions over time at two spatial scales. The findings suggest that wildfires are not moving away from buildings and, in some areas, are moving significantly closer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca615671a348471e0574c892e7e574d24dd9542fb306964923a5c9b5058b1a09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
