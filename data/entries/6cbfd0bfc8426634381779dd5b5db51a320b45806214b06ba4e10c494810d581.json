Rivers are important conduits and retention sites for AP, and time series data on the movement of these particles in lotic ecosystems are needed to assess the role of rivers in the global AP cycle. Much research assessing AP pollution extrapolates stream loads based on single time point measurements, but lotic ecosystems are highly variable over time (e.g., seasonality and storm events). The accuracy of models describing AP dynamics in rivers is constrained by the limited studies that examine how frequent changes in discharge drive particle retention and transport. This study addressed this knowledge gap by using automated, high-resolution sampling to track AP concentrations and fluxes during multiple storm events in an urban river (Milwaukee River) and comparing these measurements to commonly monitored water quality metrics. AP concentrations and fluxes varied significantly across four storm events, highlighting the temporal variability of AP dynamics. When data from the sampling periods were pooled, there were increases in particle concentration and flux during the early phases of the storms, suggesting that floods may flush AP into the river and/or resuspend particles from the benthic zone. AP flux was closely linked to river discharge, suggesting large loads of AP are delivered downstream during storms. Unexpectedly, AP concentrations were not correlated with other simultaneously measured water quality metrics, including total suspended solids, fecal coliforms, chloride, nitrate, and sulfate, indicating that these metrics cannot be used to estimate AP. These data will contribute to more accurate models of particle dynamics in rivers and global plastic export to oceans.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nAnthropogenic particle (AP) concentrations and fluxes in an urban river varied across four storm events.\nAP concentrations and fluxes were the highest during the early phases of the storms.\nStorms increased AP transport downstream compared with baseflow.\nAP concentrations did not correlate with other water quality metrics during storms.\n</p>","author":"Elizabeth M.
