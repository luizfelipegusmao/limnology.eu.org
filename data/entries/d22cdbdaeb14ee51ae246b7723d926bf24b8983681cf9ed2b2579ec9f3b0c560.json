{"title":"Development of Sound Power of Onshore Wind Turbines including Its Spectral Distribution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1773/v1","date":1714143399000,"content":"The sound power LW of wind turbines (WTs) over the past decades has developed in relation to their electric power P as LW ‚àù logP. The spectral distribution of the sound did not change significantly over time. This applies to the average performance of wind turbines, with differences between individual WT types. Because of the expected growth of onshore wind energy, a greater number of people will be living close to wind farms. This sustains the need for sound reduction. Sound reduction measures, such as serrations, reduced tip speed and low noise modes, may counteract the development of higher sound power from ever bigger WTs. To investigate this, the sound production of WT types over the last decades is analysed in relation to their size and electric power and the application of sound reduction measures. The analysis includes the broad band A-weighted and low frequency sound power levels as well as more detailed spectral distributions. Results show that the sound power level of wind turbines above 3 MW on average increases less with size than smaller turbines did. This is due to a lower blade tip speed and the use of sound reducing serrations. The spectral content of wind turbine sound, including the lower frequencies, has not changed significantly.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d22cdbdaeb14ee51ae246b7723d926bf24b8983681cf9ed2b2579ec9f3b0c560","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
