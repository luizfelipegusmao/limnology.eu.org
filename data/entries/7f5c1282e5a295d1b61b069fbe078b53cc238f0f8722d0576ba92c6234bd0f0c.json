{"title":"Clinical Polymorphism of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania aethiopica: Association with Nutritional Status in Affected Patients, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. A Retrospective Study in Remote Areas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0967/v1","date":1723552330000,"content":"Background: The different disease forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) are influenced by parasite and host factors. Malnutrition impairs immunity. It has been found to disrupt immune protection by favoring the production of anti-inflammatory prostaglandins over pro-inflammatory cytokines. In Ethiopia, data on CL patients' nutritional status remains scarce. This study aims to assess clinical polymorphism and its association with the nutritional status of the patient. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted from June to July 2024, and patient’s data was analyzed from those treated for CL. Nutritional status was assessed through MUAC, Z-score, and BMI. Results: A total of 217 CL patient’s statuses were nutritionally defined and 22% of them were found malnourished. Most of the CL problems concentrate on age","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f5c1282e5a295d1b61b069fbe078b53cc238f0f8722d0576ba92c6234bd0f0c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
