{"title":"Intracavitary Applications for CEUS in PTCD","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1448/v1","date":1716375055000,"content":"Background: Intracavitary contrast-enhanced ultrasound is widely accepted as a highly informative, safe and easily reproducible technique for diagnosis, treatment and follow- up of different pathologies of the biliary tree. Methods: This article reports the combined conclusions of personal experience with pictorial examples and literature review of applications for CEUS in intracavitary biliary scenarios. Different methodologies, choices of equipment, indications for the procedure and expected complications were identified and described from the authorsâ€™ own experience as well as from a review of published studies with total of 208 patients for the period between 2009 and 2015. Results: Indications were biliary obstruction by various etiologies, including postoperative strictures, evaluation of the biliary tree of liver donors (n=12) and evaluation of localization of a drainage catheter. One of the studies found a statistically significant difference in the diagnostic accuracy of PTC and PUSC. Conclusion: Intracavitary CEUS brings all the positive features of US together with the virtues of contrast- enhanced imaging, proving comparable accuracy to the listed techniques for diagnostics of biliary tree diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd75fe4055dd4fcccf55d910ac7c125c9bc915f618857c40b519c6b6cfc982c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
