{"title":"Unsustainable: Colonial imprints upon the food and habitat conditions (environs) of &ldquo;Others&rdquo;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1018/v1","date":1723616463000,"content":"Sustainability is a concept which engages the weighted balance between economic, environmental and social domains for all life forms and man. Within the frame of sustainability, it is important to realize that coexistence is part of a single life equation. Damage to the environment, social spectrum, and economic sectors (through deviant practices) reap havoc upon all life forms. Sustainability insures the existence of all within the single equation of life. Unsustainable, colonial practices prevail upon the present and the future of life.Sustainability should advocate for healthy environs for all life forms (including, but not exclusive to humans) to sustain themselves. The neglect and/or omission of concern for this mandate will lead to the deuteriation and eventual expiration of any such life forms.  Life cannot be sustained in an imposed, artificial domain which is suited solely for mercantile purposes. History has taught us that the cost of dismissing the errors of the past and forging on results in error.    This article proposes to explore the impact of the exploitation of agricultural practices, food availability, deforestation, dislocation, and \"voluntary tourism\" upon \"Others\" stemming from colonial occupation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"634734e8ce8126dc917c50cf6f405ac4a29049c99fe0a7484b9647ab1d052d11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
