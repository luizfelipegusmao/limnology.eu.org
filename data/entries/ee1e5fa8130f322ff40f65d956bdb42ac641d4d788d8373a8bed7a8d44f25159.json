{"title":"The Benefits of Internet Usage and the Evolution of Language: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0162/v1","date":1719924546000,"content":"The development of language and communication patterns has been significantly impacted by the internet's quick advancement. The ability to instantly communicate globally and engage with people of different linguistic origins is one of the main advantages of using the internet. Internet use has significant positive effects on language growth, but it also brings with it drawbacks that need to be addressed. Online communication's casual atmosphere can occasionally cause grammar norms to deteriorate and non-standard language patterns to proliferate. With the information stated in this paper, the aim now is to collect literature on the benefits of internet usage and the evolution of language to provide substantive information in regard to this matter. In order to assist students in navigating the complexity of Internet communication, educational institutions should incorporate digital literacy into their curricula. This involves upholding strict requirements for traditional language proficiency while teaching students how to use digital technologies efficiently. The Internet should be used to support the revitalization and preservation of endangered languages. This can entail setting up community forums, digital archives, and online learning portals where language users can interact and exchange resources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee1e5fa8130f322ff40f65d956bdb42ac641d4d788d8373a8bed7a8d44f25159","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
