Understanding the underlying mechanism can potentially guide us to utilize interfacial enhancement and achieve record-high superconductivity transition temperature. Itâ€™s believed that the phonon modes at the interface play an important role in the enhancement. Indeed, previous angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies showed that the strong electron-phonon coupling at interface is likely to be responsible for the formation of unique replica bands [<a href=\"#ozae044.735-B2\">2</a>], while the recent high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy study suggests the Fuchs-Kliewer (F-K) phonons from the SrTiO<sub>3</sub> may be the key of the electron-phonon coupling [<a href=\"#ozae044.735-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"16accaf951e852058fab5f30a173b89dbb0ccb37921cae1c69149e4c92002f2b","category":"Environment"}
