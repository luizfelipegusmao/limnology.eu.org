{"title":"Influence of Moisture Content on Some Mechanical Properties of Maize","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1490/v1","date":1716441948000,"content":"The mechanical properties of the materials stored inside agricultural silos influence the loads generated inside them. The different silo calculation methodologies allow predicting these loads under static and dynamic conditions if the mechanical properties of the stored materials are known. It has been known for many years that these properties are highly dependent on the moisture content of the material. However, to date there are not many studies focused on its determination. The goal of this research is the determination of the angle of internal friction, apparent cohesion, dilatancy angle and apparent specific weight of maize subjected to different moisture contents. Direct shear and oedometer assay devices were used for this purpose. In addition, the maize samples used were moistened using a climatic chamber. Moisture contents applied to maize sample ranged from 9.3% to 17.4%. The results obtained for the angle of internal friction and apparent cohesion, as well as those obtained for the apparent specific weight, were similar to those reported in the literature. However, the values obtained for the dilatancy angle of maize as a function of moisture content could not be compared because nothing has been published so far. The values obtained for this parameter overlap with those published for this material under ambient conditions. In addition, no direct relationship between the values obtained for this parameter and the moisture content of the sample could be found. Finally, the apparent specific weight increased with increasing moisture content of the samples, which differed from that published in the literature. The values provided here can be used for the optimization of storage and handling structures for granular agricultural materials using numerical methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63a1d2c121fc9664b6a57dbe8a850b6bc304b8cdad1ee0bfe8c676428e6f72ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
