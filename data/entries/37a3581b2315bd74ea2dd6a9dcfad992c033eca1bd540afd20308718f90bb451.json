{"title":"Characteristic of Alternative Fuels and Their Impacts on Exhaust Emissions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1395/v1","date":1718853655000,"content":"The use of alternative fuels and electric vehicles is an opportunity to reducing exhaust emissions. We observe that the regulations on exhaust emissions from mobile sources are becoming gradually stricter on the all the world. As is widely known, using alternative fuels instead of conventional fuels helps lower vehicle emissions. The most popular alternative fuels are hydrogen, propane, biobutanol, methanol, dimethyl ether, etc. ItÂ is very important that more than a dozen alternative fuels are under development. The article contains a comparison of the operating costs of electric cars and cars with an internal combustion engine. This work shows also the characteristic of new alternative fuels and their impacts on exhaust emissions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37a3581b2315bd74ea2dd6a9dcfad992c033eca1bd540afd20308718f90bb451","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
