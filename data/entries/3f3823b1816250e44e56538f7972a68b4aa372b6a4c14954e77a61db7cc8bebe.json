{"title":"Short‐range molecular order is the driving factor for starch digestibility and texture of alginate‐encapsulated rice beads","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13635?af=R","date":1717593862000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Rice grain analogues with slow starch digestibility are commonly associated with an unsatisfactory texture, often leading to consumer dissatisfaction. Alginate encapsulation has been applied to reduce the digestibility of corn and potato starch. The fine molecular structures of rice starch can greatly determine its digestibility and texture. However, it remains unclear whether a combination of alginate encapsulation and varied starch molecular structures can be employed to create rice grain analogues that offer both slow starch digestibility and an appealing texture.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>For the first time, the present study constructed alginate-encapsulated rice beads (as a rice grain analogue). A wide range of starch digestion rates were found among alginate-encapsulated rice beads prepared with different rice varieties, and only certain rice varieties (e.g. Subei and Nanjing) were able to result in rice beads with slower starch digestibility than their parental rice kernels. More importantly, all rice beads showed a relatively softer texture compared to their parental rice kernels. Correlation analysis showed that starch digestion rate, hardness and stickiness were all positively correlated with the ratio of short-range amorphous regions in rice bead samples, as obtained from Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, but not with the relative crystallinity.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Collectively, these results suggest that rice beads with slower starch digestion rate and softer texture could be obtained by choosing rice varieties that develop more short-range ordered structure after cooking. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Senbin Cao, \nCheng Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"3f3823b1816250e44e56538f7972a68b4aa372b6a4c14954e77a61db7cc8bebe","category":"Environment"}
