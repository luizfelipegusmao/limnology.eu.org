{"title":"Consensus for Linear Time-Varying Multi-agent Systems via Event-Triggered Communication","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0331/v1","date":1719994160000,"content":"This paper represents the first investigation into the consensus problem of linear time-varying multi-agent systems utilizing an event-triggered communication scheme. First, a general event-triggered consensus control scheme is proposed for a general category of linear time-varying multi-agent systems. Under some suitable assumptions, it is demonstrated that all agentsâ€™ states will converge exponentially, with Zeno behaviour being ruled out. Second, the consensus problem in a network of linear time-varying multi-agent systems with a spanning tree is investigated using the proposed control strategy. It demonstrates that the consensus issue for the specified system can be reformulated as a stabilization problem for an error system through a time-varying linear transformation. Then, the event-triggered consensus problem is just a special instance of the general event-triggered consensus problem mentioned above. Finally, to illustrate the efficacy of the event-triggered method proposed in this study, simulation results are shown.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6d81190cb3ce0ddb5d7797ffd251a80ce20a716cd1effcb6eba7bc732acff56","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
