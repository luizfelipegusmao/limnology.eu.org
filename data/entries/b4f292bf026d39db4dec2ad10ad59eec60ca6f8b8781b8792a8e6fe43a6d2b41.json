{"title":"Exploring the Nuptial Bond Between Neuroprediction and AI in Criminal Justice: A Theoretical Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0409/v2","date":1716287282000,"content":"The prognostic abilities of artificial intelligence and neuroscience in forensics and the criminal justice system stand as a reformatory paradigm for understanding any criminal conduct. While the use of artificial intelligence has been labeled transformational data analytical capabilities, neural predictive approaches also enable an intricate understanding of culpability and criminal propensities. The literature on the complex nature of neuroprediction and artificial intelligence, its ethical deliberations and its usability in curving recidivism are analyzed. This theoretical review elucidates the complex interplay, nuptial relationships and convergence of these relationships in the quest for justice. The consequences of not protecting individual rights in the criminal justice system are surveyed using grounded theory. The degree of acceptability and dependability of AI-generated evidence in legal proceedings are also reviewed. All these topics are yet to be contemplated under one roof to offer an argumentative view. The author expects to prompt readers and new commers to embrace more sociolegal and technological research before incorporating such research in the Indian Judiciary. The review focuses on the question of whether to blame such technology inclusion wholly or rather to prioritize the acquisition of bias-free pretrained datasets and processing models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4f292bf026d39db4dec2ad10ad59eec60ca6f8b8781b8792a8e6fe43a6d2b41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
