{"title":"Efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in cervical cancer: Protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312004","date":1728568800000,"content":"<p>by Dary Medeiros Dantas, Amaxsell Thiago Barros de Souza, Juliana Dantas de Araújo Santos Camargo, Ana Paula Ferreira Costa, Ayane Cristine Alves Samento, Andrea Juliana Pereira de Santana Gomes, Eduardo Pereira de Azevedo, Kleyton Santos de Medeiros, Isis Kelly dos Santos, Ricardo Ney Cobucci</p>\r\nPurpose <p>This paper reports a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol that will be used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab, alone or combined with bevacizumab and other therapies, in adult women with cervical carcinoma from stage IB2 onwards.</p> Methods <p>The protocol follows PRISMA-P recommendations and was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024531233). The search will be conducted without restrictions on language and year of publication in the following databases: Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cancerlit, The World Health Organization (WHO), International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Grey literature will be searched using the following sources: Clinicaltrials.gov, Google Scholar and Opengrey. Manual search will be carried out for the reference lists of eligible studies. The studies will be selected independently by two reviewers and all completed or ongoing randomized clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab, used alone or combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, bevacizumab or surgery, in adult women diagnosed with cervical cancer, will be included. The data extraction will include population characteristics, type of treatment and main outcomes of studies. The methodological quality of the studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0. The certainty of the evidence will be rated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE).</p> Conclusions <p>The findings will be presented in narrative summary tables and a quantitative synthesis will be conducted using the ‘meta’ package of R software, version 4.3.1. This future systematic review may contribute with quality evidence for clinical decision-making on the use of pembrolizumab in women with cervical cancer.</p>","author":"Dary Medeiros Dantas","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d54930d0bd93f9549f810ded90c4bdf53520cc38ee18545d157749d3af337872","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
