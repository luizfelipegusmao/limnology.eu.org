{"title":"Innovative and Sustainable Temporary Structures to Guarantee Emergency Basic Healthcare in Italy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0672/v1","date":1715330357000,"content":"In general, during emergencies, healthcare is provided by tents and temporary structures that do not consider the environmental and social impact of the structure as a first term, in favor of swift response. The resultant construction intended as a temporary solution often persists long-term. This paper aims to analyze an alternative and innovative modular structure designed as a transitory solution in emergency and everyday life. In the first part of the paper, the conceptual framework, and the preliminary design for the new approach to basic non-conventional sanitary spaces are described, by investigating the benefits of a safe space as a generator space for care services and community. In the second part, the technological requirements of the system, its energy efficiency, and environmental impact are analyzed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46118df01828d9821ae9b0fb7d9eda8e063427f5b8bc17001b361ddc4a152dd1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
