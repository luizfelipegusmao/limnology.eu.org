{"title":"Growth Performance and Survival of African Catfish (Clarias gariepinus) Larvae Fed on Locally Formulated Feeds","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1102/v1","date":1721098075000,"content":"The lack of quality formulated feeds as supplements or replacements for live feeds has negatively impacted the growth performance and survival rates in the larvae of many fish species, notably African catfish (C. gariepinus). Successful larval rearing relies on the availability of suitable diets that are readily consumed, easily digested, and provide the essential nutrients necessary for optimal growth and health of the fish. This study evaluated the growth performance and survival rates of C. gariepinus larvae when fed locally formulated diets. The experiment was conducted using 12 basins, each with a capacity of 20 liters. Each basin was stocked with 60 larvae in four replicates, averaging 0.03 g in weight. The experimental diets were formulated to contain three different levels of crude protein: 40%, 45%, and 50%. The larvae were fed these diets at a rate of 10-20% of their body weight over 70 days. Initially, the larvae were fed artemia at the onset of feeding in hatchling basins immediately after yolk sac absorption for the first seven days. This was followed by a blend of artemia and formulated feeds for 14 days. After 28 days, the larvae were transitioned to be exclusively fed the formulated dry feeds. The results indicated that the larvae fed on diets containing 45% and 50% crude protein exhibited significantly better overall growth performance compared to those fed on a 40% crude protein diet. Specifically, the larvae that received the 45% and 50% crude protein diets showed higher final mean weight, increased daily weight gain, and improved survival rates, which ranged from 80% to 81.5%. Notably, there was no significant difference in growth performance and survival rates between the larvae fed on 45% and 50% crude protein diets, suggesting that a 45% crude protein-formulated diet is sufficient to achieve the best growth performance and survival rates for C. gariepinus larvae. This study supports the recommendation of feeding C. gariepinus larvae with a dry diet containing 45% crude protein starting from 14 days post-hatching to enhance their growth and survival rates. However, further research is recommended to explore the effects of this feeding regimen across different agroecological zones and aquaculture systems to validate and potentially refine these findings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc206407a89eaf31b19cf32aa7d5cc39578dcfb095e09668dc5ce09efb1587b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
