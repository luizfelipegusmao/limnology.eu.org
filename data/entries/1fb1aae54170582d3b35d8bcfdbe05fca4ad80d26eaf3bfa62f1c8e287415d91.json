{"title":"Formation of Vibration Fields for a Mechatronic Platform Driven by Dual Asynchronous Motors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1130/v1","date":1721022908000,"content":"This paper delves into the challenge of controlling the multiple synchronizations in mechatronic vibration machines featuring a duo of unbalanced rotors. Its primary aim is to not only attain specific rotation speeds but also to ensure the desired phase shift between these rotors. To tackle this issue, the paper employs a control law integrating cross-couplings. It conducts an analysis of the dynamics of a simplified linearized system, showcasing the robustness of the control system across varying plant parameters. Additionally, the paper outlines experimental findings from a multi-resonance vibrational laboratory setup. These findings effectively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlight its potential applications. Crucially, the paper provides experimental evidence illustrating the capability to control vibration fields on the operational platform, a vital aspect pertinent to vibration transportation and bulk material mixing processes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1fb1aae54170582d3b35d8bcfdbe05fca4ad80d26eaf3bfa62f1c8e287415d91","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
