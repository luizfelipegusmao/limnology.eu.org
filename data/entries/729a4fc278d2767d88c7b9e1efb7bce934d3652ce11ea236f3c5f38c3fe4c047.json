Due to its anthelmintic resistance, alternative antiparasitic treatments like plant-based anthelmintics are necessary to explore. <i>Artemisia cina</i> (Asteraceae) is a plant whose <i>n</i>-hexane extract and ethyl acetate extract exhibit anthelmintic activity against <i>H</i>. <i>contortus</i>, the <i>n</i>-hexane more active. To discover additional bioactive metabolites, a chemical analysis was performed on ethyl acetate extract, which presented an LC<sub>90</sub> of 3.30 mg/mL and allowed the isolation of 11-[(1<i>R</i>,5<i>S</i>,7<i>R</i>,8<i>R</i>,10<i>S</i>,)-1,8-dihydroxy-5,10-dimethyl-4-oxodecahydroazulen-7-yl] acrylic acid. This new sesquiterpene was identified through one and two-dimensional NMR. The compound was named cinic acid and displayed an LC<sub>50</sub> of 0.13 (0.11–0.14) mg/mL and LC<sub>90</sub> of 0.40 (0.37–0.44) mg/mL, which, compared with ethyl acetate extract larvicidal activity, was 256-fold more active at LC<sub>50</sub> and 15.71-fold at LC<sub>90</sub>. In this study, a new sesquiterpene with larvicidal activity against <i>H</i>. <i>contortus</i> L<sub>3</sub> infective larvae was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of <i>Artemisia cina</i>.","author":"Luis David Arango-De la Pava","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"729a4fc278d2767d88c7b9e1efb7bce934d3652ce11ea236f3c5f38c3fe4c047","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
