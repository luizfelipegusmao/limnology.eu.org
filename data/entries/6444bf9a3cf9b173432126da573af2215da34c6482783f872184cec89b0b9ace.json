{"title":"Experimental and Numerical Investigation of Steel Elements Degradation Due to Corrosion in Industrial Environment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1800/v1","date":1711704325000,"content":"Although various atmospheric corrosion simulation models have been developed that give good results, industrial environments are still challenging. This paper aims to investigate the effect industrial atmospheres in Bor on the mechanical properties of structural steel S235JR and to create a constitutive model and also laboratory experimental conditions that will give the best results as an accelerated corrosion test. Atmospheric corrosion tests lasted six months, using sites close to the Electrolytic Refining Plant and Sulphuric Acid Plant, as well as air quality monitoring stations at a remote location in the city of Bor. The laboratory experiments included a salt chamber test lasting 120 h and 240 h and immersing the specimen in the electrolyte from the Electrolytic Refining Plant for 30 days. The results were compared with the standard specimens stored in the laboratory. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) method was used to identify the composition of corrosion products. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was applied to analyze the fracture surfaces of the specimens. The use of the Complete Gurson Model (CGM) described the tensile characteristics of the corroded specimens. The study has shown that an enhanced acceleration model and conditions could be developed using numerical analysis of the test results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6444bf9a3cf9b173432126da573af2215da34c6482783f872184cec89b0b9ace","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
