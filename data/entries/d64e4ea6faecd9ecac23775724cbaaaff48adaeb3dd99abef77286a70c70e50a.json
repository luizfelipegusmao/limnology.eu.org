{"title":"A Bronze Lebes from the Coastal Cemetery of the Phaleron Delta, Greece: Excavation and Conservation of the Find","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1149/v1","date":1715938568000,"content":"The excavations carried out by the Ephorate of Antiquities of Piraeus and Islands at the cemetery in the Phaleron Delta, Attica (late 8th - 4th century B.C.), have uncovered in total 1961 burials of various types, among which the Burial 923 is of particular importance as it is the only case of secondary cremation inside a copper alloy lebes. The use of such a valuable bronze vessel, symbolizing prestige, social status and wealth, as a cinerary urn indicates the importance of this find for the interpretation of issues related to the use of the cemetery and the ritual customs of the period and makes imperative the need to preserve the object despite its significant erosion. In this paper, we will present issues related to the lifting and conservation of the bronze vessel, that was found buried within a coastal and sandy depositional environment. Also, the condition of the vessel was scientifically investigated using optical microscopy (OM), portable X-ray fluorescence (p-XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The results showed a completely mineralized bronze artefact with tin corrosion products in the core, which indicate decuprification of the copper alloy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d64e4ea6faecd9ecac23775724cbaaaff48adaeb3dd99abef77286a70c70e50a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
