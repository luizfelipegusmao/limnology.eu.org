{"title":"Reactivity and Heavy Metal Adsorption Behaviour of Graphene Oxide Nanoparticle From First Principle Investigations: Case of Pb and CD","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0576/v1","date":1715238926000,"content":"Graphene oxide (GO) is considered as one of the promising adsorbents for the removal of various heavy metal contaminants in aquatic environment, due to its beneficial structural, chemical and electronic properties. Using the density functional theory (DFT) approach, we investigate the reactivity of a model GO nanoparticule (C30H14O15) toward neutral and charged lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) atoms. We found the model metal-free GO to have a high chemical reactivity. To study the adsorption of the metal atoms on the GO nanoparticle, we have used a single and doubly-adsorbed neutral (Pb0 and Cd0) and charged (Pb2+, Cd2+) atoms. After identified possible adsorption sites on the GO, we found that a single charged metal ion binds more strongly than a neutral atom of the same type. To determine the possibility of multiple adsorptions of GO nanoparticle, two metal atoms of the same species are co-adsorbed on its surface. Our calculations reveals a site-dependent adsorption energy such that when two atoms of the same specie are adsorbed at sites Si and Sj , the binding energy per atom depends on the whether one of the two atoms is adsorbed firstly on the Si or Sj sites. It is also found that the binding energy per atom for two co-adsorbed atoms of the same specie is less than the binding energy of a singly-adsorbed atom which suggests that atoms may become less likely to be adsorbed on the GO nanoparticle when their concentrations increase. This applies to both neutral and charged atoms. We adduce the origin of this observation to be interplay between metal-metal interaction on the one hand and GO-metal on the other, with the former resulting in a less binding for the charged adsorbed metals in particular, due to repulsive interaction between two positively charged ions. The frontier molecular orbitals analysis and the calculated global reactivity descriptors of the respective GO- metal complexes revealed that all the GO-metal complexes have a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap (HLG) relative to that of pristine metal-free GO nanoparticle. This suggests that although the GO-metal complexes are stable, they are less stable compared to metal-free GO nanoparticles. The negative values of the chemical potentials obtained for all the GO-metal complexes further confirms their stability. Our work calculates parameters that will be crucial to rational design of GO nanoparticles for Pb abd Cd ions contaminants removal, and may find application in water purification for example.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e6ce58c5fb509b7b1d8ee1b6184995c0423dcab6f80e9d4f6a1eb8390c2e8a68","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
