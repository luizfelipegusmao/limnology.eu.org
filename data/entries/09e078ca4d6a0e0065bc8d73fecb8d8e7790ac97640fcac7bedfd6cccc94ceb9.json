{"title":"A Comprehensive Study of Meningioma Biomineralization: Morphological, Crystallographic, and Immunohistochemical Aspects","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/2/392/7632017?rss=1","date":1710806400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Biomineralization of brain tissues occurs both in normal and pathological conditions. Dura mater biomineralization is widespread and occurs in 1–72% of cases, depending on the patient's age and research method. The amount of biomineral deposits under the conditions of tumor growth in the meninges only increases, reaching 100% in the case of psammomatous meningiomas. Since calcifications are often found in the meninges, the problem of differential diagnosis with calcified meningiomas arises. A total of 30 samples of meningiomas with signs of biomineralization—dense structure, characteristic crunch, psammoma bodies (group I) and 30 samples of meningiomas without any signs of biomineralization were examined as controls (group II). To detect pathological biomineralization, the meningioma tissue was studied using the methods of macroscopic description, histology, histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry, scanning electron microscopy with microanalysis, and transmission electron microscopy. A significantly higher level of caspase3 and features of the expression of osteoblastic markers (a lower level of OPG expression and a higher level of the presence of RANKL in group I, the absence of fluctuations in the expression of SPARC) may indicate a dystrophic type of development of biomineral deposits in meningiomas.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"09e078ca4d6a0e0065bc8d73fecb8d8e7790ac97640fcac7bedfd6cccc94ceb9","category":"Environment"}
