{"title":"Hierarchical Temporal Semantic Tree Based Trajectory Privacy Protection Scheme over LBSNs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0727/v1","date":1728548559000,"content":"Most of the existing trajectory privacy protection methods provide a unified degree of privacy protection for data, and most of the methods mainly focus on the spatial and temporal dimensions of trajectory data, with little consideration of the semantic information of the location. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical temporal semantic tree-based personalized trajectory privacy protection (HTST-PTPP) scheme, which mainly constructs a hierarchical temporal semantic tree by considering semantic categories and residence time. Then, quantifies the privacy protection requirements of each location, divides the privacy level, and uses differential privacy technology to realize personalized trajectory privacy protection. Finally, experiments are carried out on two real data sets. The experimental results show that our HTST-PTPP scheme has good performance in data availability and privacy protection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e7b1de8fedac21a6d524d076cf7d66ad6a5e67410681058970e9a7c95f72ed6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
