{"title":"Development of Highly Photoactive Mixed Metal Oxide (MMO) Based on The Thermal Decomposition Of ZnAl-NO3-LDH","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0534/v1","date":1709905507000,"content":"The highly crystalline ZnAl Layered Double Hydroxides (ZnAl-NO3- LDHs) are utilized for the potential transformation into Mixed Metal oxides (MMO) through thermal decomposition and used further for the photodegradation of phenol to assess the influence of calcination on ZnAl LDHs with enhanced photoactivity. The structure, composition, and morphological evolution of ZnAl-LDHs to ZnO-based MMO nanocomposites, which are composed of ZnO and ZnAl2O4, after calcination at different temperatures (400-600 ºC), are all thoroughly examined in this work. The final ZnO and ZnAl2O4 base nanocomposites showed enhanced photocatalytic activity. The findings demonstrated that calcining ZnAl-LDHs from 400 to 600 °C increased the specific surface area and also enhanced the interlayer spacing of d003 while the transformation of LDHs into ZnO/ZnAl2O4 nanocomposite through calcining the ZnAl-LDH precursor at 600 °C showed significant photocatalytic properties, leading to complete mineralization of phenol under UV irradiation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2c819185f171e32ccffb83096af44fdad5fd800e62c6f00d76218a56129ac48","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
