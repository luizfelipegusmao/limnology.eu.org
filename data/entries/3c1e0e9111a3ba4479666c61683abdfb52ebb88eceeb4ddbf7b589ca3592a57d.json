We assessed the prevalence of toxoplasmosis and its associated risk factors in PLWH in the Asia-Pacific region using data from the TREAT Asia Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Observational Database (TAHOD) of the International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) Asia-Pacific.</p> Methods <p>This study included both retrospective and prospective cases of toxoplasmosis reported between 1997 and 2020. A matched case-control method was employed, where PLWH diagnosed with toxoplasmosis (cases) were each matched to two PLWH without a toxoplasmosis diagnosis (controls) from the same site. Sites without toxoplasmosis were excluded. Risk factors for toxoplasmosis were analyzed using conditional logistic regression.</p> Results <p>A total of 269/9576 (2.8%) PLWH were diagnosed with toxoplasmosis in 19 TAHOD sites. Of these, 227 (84%) were reported retrospectively and 42 (16%) were prospective diagnoses after cohort enrollment. At the time of toxoplasmosis diagnosis, the median age was 33 years (interquartile range 28–38), and 80% participants were male, 75% were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Excluding 63 out of 269 people without CD4 values, 192 (93.2%) had CD4 ≤200 cells/μL and 162 (78.6%) had CD4 ≤100 cells/μL. By employing 538 matched controls, we found that factors associated with toxoplasmosis included abstaining from ART (odds ratio [OR] 3.62, 95% CI 1.81–7.24), in comparison to receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, HIV exposure through injection drug use (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.15–4.47) as opposed to engaging in heterosexual intercourse and testing positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.41–7.21). Toxoplasmosis was less likely with increasing CD4 counts (51–100 cells/μL: OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.18–0.96; 101–200 cells/μL: OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.06–0.34; &gt;200 cells/μL: OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.01–0.06), when compared to CD4 ≤50 cells/μL. Moreover, the use of prophylactic cotrimoxazole was not associated with toxoplasmosis.</p> Conclusions <p>Symptomatic toxoplasmosis is rare but still occurs in PLWH in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in the context of delayed diagnosis, causing advanced HIV disease. Immune reconstitution through early diagnosis and ART administration remains a priority in Asian PLWH.</p>","author":"Ki Hyun Lee","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3c1e0e9111a3ba4479666c61683abdfb52ebb88eceeb4ddbf7b589ca3592a57d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
