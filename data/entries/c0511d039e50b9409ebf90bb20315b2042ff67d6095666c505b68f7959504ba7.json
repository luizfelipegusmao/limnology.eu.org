{"title":"DIVULSUPERBAC: A Service Learning Project to Raise Awareness of Antimicrobial Resistance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1376/v1","date":1718811415000,"content":"Divulsuperbac (DSB) is a Service Learning project targeted at the educational community. It started in 2019 and has engaged Biology degree students in a Microbiology-focused initiative in the Valencian Community (Spain), for four academic years. The DSB project comprises various outreach activities intending to raise awareness of the superbugs' threat to pre-university students. We created an exhibition that contained 14 infographics on the topic of antimicrobial resistance which was presented every week in high schools. The infographics were presented by university students, who explained the problem to the pre-university students and subsequently assessed their comprehension of the topic. The surveys conducted yielded satisfactory results, which motivated us to extend this project to other regions of the world.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c0511d039e50b9409ebf90bb20315b2042ff67d6095666c505b68f7959504ba7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
