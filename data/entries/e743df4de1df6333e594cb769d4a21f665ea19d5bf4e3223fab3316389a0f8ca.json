{"title":"ProAKAP4 as Indicator of Post-thaw Motility in Stallion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1408/v1","date":1711349662000,"content":"ProAKAP4, a precursor of AKAP4 (A-kinase anchor protein) found in the flagellum of mammalian and non-mammalian spermatozoa, serves as a structural protein with established correlations to motility parameters across diverse species. This study aimed to determine the proAKAP4 levels evolution in thawed stallion semen over a 3-hour period, examining its correlation with motility descriptors and mitochondrial membrane potential. Utilizing sixteen ejaculates from four French warmblood stallions, the study involved maintaining thawed samples at 37°C for 3 hours, conducting proAKAP4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA), and mitochondrial membrane potential by JC-1 probe and flow cytometry at 0, 1, and 3 hours post-thawing. The findings indicate significant positive correlations (p≤0.05) between proAKAP4 levels and sperm total or progressive motility at all time points analyzed. Spermatozoa velocity descriptors (VAP, VCL, VSL) and spermatozoa lateral head displacement (ALH) display positive correlations (p≤0.05) with ProAKAP4 at the 0-hour post-thawing. ProAKAP4 concentration exhibits no discernible difference between batches with or without cryoprotectant. Notably, proAKAP4 consumption remains insignificant within the initial hour after thawing but becomes significant (p≤0.05) between 1 and 3 hours post-thawing. In summary, proAKAP4 demonstrates positive correlations with total and progressive motility in stallion semen for up to 3 hours after thawing, albeit showing a noticeable decrease starting from the first hour post-thawing, indicating a progressive consumption as a result of spermatozoa motile activity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e743df4de1df6333e594cb769d4a21f665ea19d5bf4e3223fab3316389a0f8ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
