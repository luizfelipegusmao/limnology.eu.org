A non-invasive and flexible Graphene/MoS<sub>2</sub> heterostructure has been proposed for sensing hemoglobin concentration in blood samples. The findings reveal a notable shift in the wavelength-dependent refractive index and extinction coefficient, as well as significant changes in the absorption coefficient and reflectivity of the Graphene/MoS<sub>2</sub> heterostructure in response to different hemoglobin concentrations, specifically within an approximate range of 0.3 μm to 1 μm. Moreover, the spectral response of the heterostructure demonstrates that at a particular wavelength of approximately 600 nm, a maximum response is obtained. This wavelength can be considered optimal for detecting various levels of hemoglobin using this heterostructure. The anticipated outcome is a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles, ultimately resulting in the development of an exceptionally sensitive platform for detecting hemoglobin concentration.","author":"Manoj Kumar","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d9490ac5979df9efb38851141059876c52278d957d3a15e5b8090a38610fd31f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
