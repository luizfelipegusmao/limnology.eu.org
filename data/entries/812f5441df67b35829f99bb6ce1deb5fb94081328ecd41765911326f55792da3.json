{"title":"Hydrogels for Bone Tissue Regeneration with Chitosan-Based Biomaterials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1005/v1","date":1728956779000,"content":"Chitosan-based hydrogels are promising in bone tissue regeneration due to their biocompatibility, tunable properties, and ability to mimic the extracellular matrix. With high water content and porous structure, they can encapsulate bioactive agents for controlled release. Chitosan, derived from chitin in crustacean exoskeletons and fungi, possesses mechanical qualities ideal for biomedical applications. This study will evaluate recent advances in chitosan hydrogels for bone regeneration, focusing on their efficacy, mechanisms, and challenges in clinical settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"812f5441df67b35829f99bb6ce1deb5fb94081328ecd41765911326f55792da3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
