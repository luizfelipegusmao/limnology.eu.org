{"title":"Revolutionizing Eye Care: Exploring the Potential of Microneedle Drug Delivery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1255/v1","date":1718763308000,"content":"Microneedle technology is a novel platform technology that revolutionizes ocular drug delivery and addresses critical challenges in the treatment of ocular diseases. Routine treatment methods, such as eye drops and intravitreal injections, suffer from low bioavailability and poor patient compliance. So, novel advanced platform technologies are required to overcome these challenges. Microneedle is a minimally invasive and promising alternative technique that helps precisely control drug delivery to targeted tissues and organs. \n\nThis review investigates the potential impact of microneedle technology for eye care, underscoring recent advancements, underlying mechanisms, and emerging preclinical and clinical uses. Different types of microneedles, including solid, coated, dissolvable, and hollow, have demonstrated their potential and capability to bypass several barriers in the cornea and sclera. This ensures effective drug penetration and delivery. The current innovations in material science and fabrication methods have enhanced the safety and efficacy of microneedles, reducing discomfort and the chances of infections. These microneedle technologies offer sustained and controlled drug delivery, which could improve therapeutic outcomes for various disease conditions like age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic neuropathy, etc.\n\nIn the current review, recent preclinical and clinical studies emphasize microneedle-based ocular drug delivery's feasibility and potential benefits. These include improved pharmacokinetics, reduced dosing frequency, enhanced patient adherence, and, most importantly, microneedles offer versatile platforms for delivering a wide range of small and large molecules and gene therapies.  Despite the exciting progress, obstacles such as regulatory barriers, scalability, and long-term biocompatibility persist. It will be essential to tackle these challenges through interdisciplinary research and partnerships to integrate microneedle technology into standard clinical use effectively. Ultimately, microneedle drug delivery offers a revolutionary method that has the potential to significantly enhance the treatment and results of ocular diseases, marking the dawn of a new era in eye care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1588d5e8a0c89c49b49f2f57aab2fdd549a3a19f7dc90ee773bd93924a6e0b35","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
