The cloud may offer some protection, but there is no assurance that data owners can rely on it for refuge and privacy amenities. Therefore, it is essential to offer security and privacy protection. Increased customer satisfaction with security and privacy preservation is crucial since healthcare big data and its sources are stored in the cloud and contain increasingly private and sensitive information. However, maintaining privacy and security in an untrusted green cloud environment is difficult, thus the data owner should have complete data control. A new work SecPri-BGMPOP(security and privacy of Boost graph Convolutional Network -Pinpointing-Optimization Performance) is suggested that can offer a solution that involves several different steps in order to handle the numerous problems relating to security and protecting privacy. Initially Boost Graph Convolutional Network Clustering (BGCNC) algorithm, which reduces computational complexity in terms of time and memory measurements, is first applied to the input dataset to begin the clustering process. Second, enlarge by employing a piece of the magnifying bit string to generate a safe key, pinpointing based encryption avoids amplify leakage even if a rival or attacker decrypts the key or asymmetric encryption. Finally, to determine the accuracy of the method, an optimal key was created using a meta-heuristic algorithmic framework called Hybrid fragment horde bland lobo Optimization (HFHBLO). Our proposed method currently kept in a cloud environment, allowing analytics users to utilize it without risking their privacy or security.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e513964c751ba42fbe36bdc1affcc6ab7ef16e88ba38674328d24746837a41b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
