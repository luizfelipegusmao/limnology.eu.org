The most common type of STEM, high angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM, utilizes an annular detector to collect high-angle scattered electrons. The HAADF-STEM electron signal represents only a small fraction of the total electrons that hit the sample, making this an inefficient method. Since many materials undergo damage processes under the electron beam, imaging with the high doses necessitated by HAADF-STEM can lead to sample damage. While there exist methods by which the damage of the electron beam may be mitigated - either through cooling, lowering the beam-voltage, coating, etc. - many samples cannot be prepared in such a way or imaged using these methods. Additionally, in HAADF-STEM it is hard to form an image which includes both light and heavy atoms since the optimal detector angle to detect incoherently scattered electrons is different.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"190dc0999ccf9de0c116300cb77cb5fd15d390b61a52bb596eb8c023f7eb5a71","category":"Environment"}
