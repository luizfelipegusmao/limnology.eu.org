Taken together, our findings demonstrate engineering the skin microbiome to reduce attractive volatiles represents an innovative untapped strategy to reduce vector attraction, preventing bites, and pathogen transmission. These findings set the stage for new classes of long-lasting microbiome-based repellent products.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"027c6b496f0c9474211663382ede6a3897534675db21944e84f6d388edf60259","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
