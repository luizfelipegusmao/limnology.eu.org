{"title":"A Novel and Reliable Pixel Response Correction Method (DAC-Shifting) for Spectral Photon Counting CT Imaging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0132/v1","date":1717483990000,"content":"Spectral photon counting cone-beam CT imaging is challenged by individual pixel response behaviour, which leads to noisy projection images and subsequent image artefacts like rings. Existing methods to correct for this either use calibration measurements, like signal-to-thickness calibration (STC), or perform post-processing ring artefact correction of sinogram data or scan reconstructions, without taking the pixel response explicitly into account. Here we present a novel post-processing method (DAC-shifting), which explicitly measures the current pixel response using flat field images, and subsequently corrects the projection data. The DAC-shifting method was evaluated with a repeat series of spectral photon counting imaging (Medipix3) of a phantom with different density inserts, and in iodine K-edge imaging. The method was also compared against PMMA based STC. The DAC-shifting method was shown to be effective in correcting individual pixel response, and was robust against detector instability. On the contrary, STC correction showed varying results, which was almost as good as DAC-shifting when data was acquired just after STC calibration, but worse with larger time differences. In K-edge imaging, DAC-shifting provides a sharper attenuation peak, and more uniform CT values, which is expected to benefit iodine concentration quantification.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa4583f91ded7bf46132841b0f98cf9e3a1f518efaa7ee1f14f0bbb23d0bd1aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
