They employ a wide variety of strategies to adjust to hypoxia and many of these adaptations provide protection against cardiopulmonary diseases and pathologies. Mechanisms employed during hypoxic conditions include metabolic rate suppression, reprogramming of metabolic pathways, and mechanisms that defend against deleterious perturbations of cellular signaling pathways. These adaptations are both systemic as well as tissue specific, particularly the lungs, heart, and brain.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Ameliorating the deleterious impact of systemic or tissue-level hypoxia or ischemia is key to preventing or treating many human diseases and pathologies. Usefully, environmental hypoxia is also a common challenge in many natural habitats; animals that are native to such hypoxic niches often exhibit strategies that enable them to thrive with limited O<sub>2</sub> availability. Studying how such species have evolved to tolerate systemic hypoxia offers a promising avenue of discovery for novel strategies to mitigate the deleterious effects of hypoxia in human diseases and pathologies. Of particular interest are naked mole-rats, which are among the most hypoxia-tolerant mammals. Naked mole-rats that tolerate severe hypoxia in a laboratory setting are also protected against clinically relevant mimics of heart attack and stroke. The mechanisms that support this tolerance are currently being elucidated but results to date suggest that metabolic rate suppression, reprogramming of metabolic pathways, and mechanisms that defend against deleterious perturbations of cellular signaling pathways all provide layers of protection. Herein, we synthesize and discuss what is known regarding adaptations to hypoxia in the naked mole-rat cardiopulmonary system and brain, as these systems comprise both the primary means of delivering O<sub>2</sub> to tissues and the most hypoxia-sensitive organs in mammals.</p>","author":"Karen L.
