{"title":"The adaptor protein ECAP, the corepressor LEUNIG, and the transcription factor BEH3 interact and regulate microsporocyte generation in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/7/2531/7634541?rss=1","date":1711324800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Histospecification and morphogenesis of anthers during development in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) are well understood. However, the regulatory mechanism of microsporocyte generation at the pre-meiotic stage remains unclear, especially how archesporial cells are specified and differentiate into 2 cell lineages with distinct developmental fates. <span>SPOROCYTELESS</span> (<span>SPL</span>) is a key reproductive gene that is activated during early anther development and remains active. In this study, we demonstrated that the EAR motif-containing adaptor protein (ECAP) interacts with the Gro/Tup1 family corepressor LEUNIG (LUG) and the BES1/BZR1 HOMOLOG3 (BEH3) transcription factor to form a transcription activator complex, epigenetically regulating <span>SPL</span> transcription. SPL participates in microsporocyte generation by modulating the specification of archesporial cells and the archesporial cell–derived differentiation of somatic and reproductive cell layers. This study illustrates the regulation of <span>SPL</span> expression by the ECAP–LUG–BEH3 complex, which is essential for the generation of microsporocytes. Moreover, our findings identified ECAP as a key transcription regulator that can combine with different partners to regulate gene expression in distinct ways, thereby facilitating diverse processes in various aspects of plant development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"003510f90de9d0e91ff5ea73515cc0ed6df8f3d6faa033eb63d0766976e8b563","category":"Environment"}
