{"title":"Reducing the feed input per unit of plant area as a means to improve the efficiency of sea asparagus and Pacific white shrimp biofloc technology‐based aquaponics","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16122?af=R","date":1668758400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study aimed to evaluate different feeding rate ratios in a biofloc technology-based aquaponics system employing sea asparagus (<i>Sarcocornia ambigua</i>) and Pacific white shrimp (<i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i>) in an 83-day experiment. Two treatments were evaluated: 100 and 50 g feed m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>, which were achieved by doubling the plant production area from 0.4 m<sup>2</sup> to 0.8 m<sup>2</sup>. Shrimps (1.39 g ± 0.06 g) were reared under an initial density of 250 animals m<sup>−3</sup> in 800 L polyethylene tanks, while the plants were cultivated using nutrient film technique hydroponic benches which received water from the shrimp unit through a pumping system. The increase in plant production area allowed for a statistically significant increase in the plant final biomass in approximately 74% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), with the end result that plant productivity was not altered (<i>p</i> ≥ 0.05). Shrimp growth performance and the concentrations of nitrogen compounds and orthophosphate did not differ significantly between treatments (<i>p</i> ≥ 0.05). In conclusion, the reduction in the feeding rate ratio from 100 to 50 g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> did not impair plant productivity, which indicates that the efficiency of the system was improved, as a greater plant biomass was produced with the same amount of shrimp feed inputs.</p>","author":"Joaquim Soares, \nMateus Aranha Martins, \nLeonardo Castilho‐Barros, \nCarlos Manoel do Espírito Santo, \nFelipe do Nascimento Vieira, \nWalter Quadros Seiffert","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"134cbf7e890d1f60e886673121ab455714f68ddc1fdcf896c8e2ad3b17130292","category":"Environment"}
