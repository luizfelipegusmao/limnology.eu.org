{"title":"Therapy of Non-Diabetic Foot Infections after Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Surgery: The Duration Of Post-Debridement Antibiotic Treatment Does Not Alter Failure Risk","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2080/v1","date":1724904603000,"content":"Whereas there is an increasing number of scientific publications investigating the optimal anti-biotic treatment for diabetic foot infections, we are lacking corresponding data in the adult non-diabetic (postsurgical) foot infection population. We therefore established one of the largest single-center databases on this topic and retrospectively investigate failures of a combined sur-gical and antibiotic therapy for surgical site foot infections. Overall, 17.4% of the episodes expe-rienced any therapeutic failures; especially among the infected ankle prostheses. In contrast, neither the age, the biological sex, pathogens, the duration of post-debridement antibiotic treatment, the number of surgical debridement, or the use of negative-pressure wound care could alter the failure risk. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, the duration of postsur-gical antibiotic use was completely indifferent (as a continuous variable with odds ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval 0.96-1.03), or when stratified into inter-tertiary groups. Our results poten-tially enable shorter applications of systemic antibiotics in favor of a better stewardship in the non-diabetic adult population. Consecutive prospective-randomized trials are under way to identify eligible patient populations for a potentially shorter durations in surgical site infections after elective foot and ankle surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc81fb2f4374090189d31de8744884a35f6e9f8aec27fcf46fdfd603a9e14a9b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
