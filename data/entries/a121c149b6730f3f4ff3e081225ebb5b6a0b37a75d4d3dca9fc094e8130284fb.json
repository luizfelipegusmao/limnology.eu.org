{"title":"Pregnancy Planning and Genetic Testing: Exploring Advantages, and Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1531/v1","date":1721314130000,"content":"Abstract: Pregnancy planning and genetic testing (PPGT) has emerged as a tool in reproductive healthcare, offering parents-to-be insight in their risks of having a child with a genetic disorder. This paper reviews the advantages, drawbacks and challenges associated with PPGT, providing some practical guidance for health care professionals. Advantages include identification of genetic risks, a possibility to informed reproductive decision-making, and the potential to reduce the parents-to-be risk for an affected child. Challenges and drawbacks include provision of service, ethical considerations, genetic counselling complexities, and the need to increase public and professional awareness by comprehensive education and accessibility. Practical guidance involves considerations for selecting appropriate candidates, counselling strategies, and how to integrate PPGT into existing healthcare frameworks. By addressing these factors, PPGT can offer an increased reproductive informed choice for the individual and the couple reducing the burden of disease in the family.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a121c149b6730f3f4ff3e081225ebb5b6a0b37a75d4d3dca9fc094e8130284fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
