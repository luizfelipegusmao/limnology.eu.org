{"title":"Carbon and Mycorrhizal Fungi for Improving Sustainable Ecosystems and Mitigate Greenhouse Gases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2282/v1","date":1722240607000,"content":"while composting of organic wastes is increasingly adopted in sustainable agriculture, continued interest on biochar application, dark soils, and compost, showed morphological aspects and functionality of biochar as a challenge to solve the CO2 aspects related to climatic change, and carbon stability in sustainable soils, as Black carbon presents long chemical permanency due to incomplete combustion of biomass. The objective of this work was to study the characteristics of soil amendments and to review the state of the art of biochar, showing differences in composition and main microorganisms with relevant presence in the soils.  Arbuscular mycorrhizal spores (Scutellospora sp., Glomus like, Funneliformis geosporus, Glomus crenatum, and Acaulospora excavata, obtained from TPI soil samples are shown. New strategies are highlighted such as nutrient supplementation of compost, which can constitute the basis for improved compost-based biofertilizers in the future. Thus, the most important strategies for C sequestration are underlined to diminish substantial organic agro- and municipal wastes, increasingly disposed in the fields, landfills or either released by burning or discarding.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e1691da244160ecea23df0dc2f4578d3696cbc3459ec1d3a6d231b5eef276edf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
