{"title":"Influence of BOVAMINE DEFEND Plus on growth performance, carcass characteristics, estimated dry matter digestibility, rumen fermentation characteristics, and immune function in finishing beef steers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae045/7634646?rss=1","date":1711324800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>One hundred and eighty crossbred beef steers (406.0 ± 2.2 kg) were used to determine the impact of a novel direct-fed microbial (DFM) on growth performance, carcass characteristics, rumen fermentation characteristics, and immune response in finishing beef cattle. Steers were blocked by body weight (BW) and randomly assigned, within block, to 1 of 2 treatments (3 replicates/treatment: 30 steers/replicate). Treatments included: (1) no DFM (control) and (2) DFM supplementation at 50 mg ∙ animal<sup>−1</sup> ∙ d<sup>−1</sup> (BOVAMINE DEFEND Plus). All steers were fed a high-concentrate finishing diet and individual feed intake was recorded daily via the GrowSafe system. BWs were collected every 28 d. On day 55, 10 steers per pen were injected with ovalbumin (OVA). Jugular blood samples were collected from each steer on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 post injection. On day 112, the same steers were injected again with OVA and intramuscularly with a pig red blood cell solution. Jugular blood samples were collected from each steer on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 post injection. On day 124, rumen fluid was collected from 3 steers per treatment and used to estimate in vitro rumen fermentation characteristics. Equal numbers of steers per treatment were transported to a commercial abattoir on days 145, 167, and 185 of the experiment, harvested, and carcass data were collected. Initial BW was similar across treatments. On days 28 and 55, steers receiving DFM had heavier BW (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) compared to controls. The average daily gain was greater in DFM-supplemented steers from days 0 to 28 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) and days 0 to 55 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) of the experiment compared to controls. Overall dry matter intake (DMI) was greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.04) and overall feed efficiency was similar in DFM-supplemented steers compared to controls. Dressing percentage (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.02) was greater in steers receiving DFM compared to controls. Antibody titers to injected antigens were similar across treatments. However, red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity was greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) in DFM-supplemented steers compared to controls. In vitro molar proportions of isobutyric and butyric acid were greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) and dry matter (DM) digestibility tended (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.07) to be greater in rumen fluid obtained from steers supplemented with DFM. These data suggest that BOVAMINE DEFEND Plus supplementation improves growth performance during the initial period of the finishing phase, increases overall DMI and dressing percentage, and may impact antioxidant status in beef cattle.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"93a58becbdbce59e40558dd4c535457b7dc047ba7143652e91f1233cf7dc0fba","category":"Environment"}
