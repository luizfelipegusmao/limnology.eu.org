{"title":"Design and Optimization of CO2 Recovery Process of Fire-Flooding Exhaust Based on Membrane Separation Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0620/v1","date":1723155704000,"content":"In order to achieve the dual carbon goal and simplify the decarbonization process, a CO2 recovery process of the fire-flooding exhaust was designed. The process adopted the two-stage membrane separation method to recover CO2 and obtain high purity CO2 rich flow, and then through the mixed refrigerant liquefaction and rectification column, food grade liquid CO2 was obtained. HYSYS process simulation shows that for the fire-flooding exhaust with a flow rate of 1000 kg/h and a given composition, the process can achieve a CO2 recovery of 69.02%, total product sales S=2086.8 yuan/h, and specific power consumption of 2.818 kWâˆ™h/kg. On this basis, a hybrid simulation platform of HYSYS &amp; Matlab was established. Taking the specific power consumption of the product as the objective function, sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm was adopted to optimize the process, and the optimized specific power consumption was reduced by 18.8%. Finally, by adjusting N2/CO2 components, the adaptability of the optimization condition was analyzed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c9defa4fe1be8730d53416804b3c9b6b426d79fa5057eab420a5417b4fdbd6ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
