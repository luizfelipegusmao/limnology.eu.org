A variety of rehabilitation strategies have been reported in previous studies, varying by country, race and even continent. However, the common rehabilitation strategies used by cervical cancer survivors in Tanzania and their outcomes are unknown. The study aimed to unfold sexual rehabilitation strategies and outcome practiced by cervical cancer survivors who experienced sexual dysfunction during and after treatment in North-western Tanzania. Methods: Descriptive qualitative study were employed. Phenomenology study design used with a sample of 7 participants and data corrected via in-depth interview guided by 11 questions. Audiotaped and transcribed to get main themes and sub themes through deductive analysis. Results: Most participants reported inability to achieve an orgasm and low libido and dyspareunia after treatment. Most participants were eagerly to have their sexual activity recovered. However, they were not familiar with any rehabilitation strategy after the experience of sexual dysfunction. Even though, some of the participants attempted various interventions, but all were unsatisfactory leading to a significant decline in sexual interest and activity. Conclusion: Cervical cancer survivors are not familiar with any sexual rehabilitation strategies. Health education concerning various sexual rehabilitation strategies should be provided to survivors during and even after treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72e70b981f10b79daa23e0d62698ff8f7c03231f34efe1a9c6bea011f92bb46e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
