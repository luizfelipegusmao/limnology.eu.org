Many extinctions could be prevented if impediments to protecting these species were addressed effectively. This article considers how current policies and practices are failing an endangered species and how biodiversity conservation is fraught with barriers such as rhetorical adoption, policy dismantling, circumvention of legislative obligations, and the deliberate disregard of scientific evidence. These issues became evident while researching the endangered Spectacled Flying-fox (<i>Pteropus conspicillatus</i> Gould 1850), which, despite over a decade of recognized decline, received little attention from authorities who could have acted to stabilize or recover its populations. Recovery plans are often the primary means used by many countries to help threatened species recover and typically fall under government responsibility for implementation. For these plans to be effective, they should be mandatory, well-funded, and subject to stringent monitoring and reporting requirements. However, the implementation of such plans is often inconsistent, with many not meeting these criteria. The scientific basis for recovery actions is usually well-researched, although uncertainties around outcomes remain since these actions are experimental and success is not guaranteed. The failure to implement recovery plans can be highly frustrating for conservation scientists and practitioners, often stemming from policy failures. For those involved in conservation research and practice, learning how to identify and overcome policy impediments would help to ensure the successful implementation of recovery plans. Vigilance is required to ensure that recovery teams function effectively, that recovery actions are executed, that decision-makers are held accountable for endangering species, and that legislation includes merits review provisions to challenge poor decision-making. Conservation scientists who monitor species of concern are often best placed to track the progress of recovery actions. When they detect insufficient action, they have a responsibility to intervene or to notify the responsible authorities. Ultimately, government policies should prioritize the protection of threatened species over economic and political interests, recognizing that extinction is irreversible and the stakes are high for biodiversity conservation.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>物种灭绝的速度越来越快且几乎没有逆转的趋势，这促使保护生物学家和相关从业人员重新思考如何恢复受威胁物种的方法。如果能有效解决保护这些物种所遇到的困难，许多物种的灭绝是可以避免的。本文探讨了当前的政策和实践是如何未能保护濒危物种的，以及生物多样性保护面临的各种障碍，例如仅口头的采纳、政策的拆解、规避立法义务以及故意无视科学证据。这些问题在研究濒临灭绝的眼镜狐蝠（<i>Pteropus conspicillatus</i> Gould 1850）时变得明显起来。尽管该物种种群已被认定衰退了十多年，但相关部门却几乎没有采取任何措施来稳定或恢复种群。</p>\n<p>恢复计划通常是许多国家帮助受威胁物种恢复种群的主要手段，通常由政府负责实施。为使这些计划有效，它们应该是强制性的、资金充足的、并且符合严格的监测和报告要求。然而，这些计划的实施往往并不一致，许多计划并不符合这些标准。尽管制定恢复行动的科学依据通常经过了充分的研究，但由于这些行动是具有实验性质的，结果仍存在不确定性，无法保证一定会成功。恢复计划实施的失败可能会让保护生物学家和相关从业人员非常沮丧，而这通常源于政策上的失误。对于那些参与保护研究和实践的人来说，学习如何识别和克服政策障碍将有助于确保恢复计划的成功实施。相关人员需要保持警惕，确保实施恢复计划的团队有效运作，恢复行动得到执行，决策者对危及物种的行为负责，并保证立法中包含案例优劣审查条款，以挑战错误决策。监测所关注物种的保护生物学家往往是监督恢复行动进展的最佳人选。当他们发现行动不力时，有责任进行干预或通知相关部门。</p>\n<p>最后，政府政策应将保护受威胁物种置于经济和政治利益之上，认识到物种灭绝是不可逆的，保护生物多样性事关重大。【审阅:于潇雨】</p>","author":"Noel Preece, \nChris McGrath, \nMaree Treadwell Kerr","siteTitle":"Wiley: Integrative Conservation: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b2434e359c647f096191c4befea99097fa9394fd28e02b126976eb35d9219c03","entryHash":"5b1b727dca9a92a0d4c1a632eff0deae4310e9ebfd7060ea5eb51965dce95fda","category":"Environment"}
