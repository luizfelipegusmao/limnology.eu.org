{"title":"Amelioration of nutritional properties of bakery fat using omega‐3 fatty acid‐rich edible oils: a review","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13225?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Bakery products have gained prominence in modern diets due to their convenience and accessibility, often serving as staple meals across diverse regions. However, the fats used in these products are rich in saturated fatty acids and often comprise trans fatty acids, which are considered as a major biomarker for non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular disorders, obesity and diabetes. Additionally, these fats lack the essential omega-3 fatty acids, which are widely known for their therapeutic benefits. They play a major role in lowering the risk of cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes. Thus, there is need for incorporating these essential fatty acids into bakery fats. Nevertheless, fortifying food products with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) poses several challenges due to their high susceptibility to oxidation. This oxidative deterioration leads to not only the formation of undesirable flavors, but also a loss of nutritional value in the final products. This review focuses on the development of healthier trans-fat-free bakery fat enriched with omega-3 fatty acids and its effect on the physicochemical, functional, sensory and nutritional properties of bakery fats and products. Further, the role of various technologies like physical blending, enzymatic interesterification and encapsulation to improve the stability of PUFA-rich bakery fat is discussed, where microencapsulation emerged as a novel and effective technology to enhance the stability and shelf life. By preventing deteriorative changes, microencapsulation ensures that the nutritional, physicochemical and sensory properties of food products remain intact. Novel modification methods like interesterification and microencapsulation used for developing PUFA-rich bakery fats have a potential to address the health risks occurring due to consumption of bakery fat having higher amount of saturated and trans fatty acids. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Aishwarya Dhiman, \nRajni Chopra, \nPriyanka Kumari Singh, \nSnigdha Homroy, \nMonika Chand, \nBinanshu Talwar","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"6462b71434e949d0c7e615210f51d2d353a494823e1f192e022f9a260ff1ad7e","category":"Environment"}
