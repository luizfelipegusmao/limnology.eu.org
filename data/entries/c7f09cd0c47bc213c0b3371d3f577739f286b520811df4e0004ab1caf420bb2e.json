In developed countries, N supplementation in agriculture has increased by more than 120% between the 1960s and 2020 (<a href=\"#kiae029-B1\">Adalibieke et al. 2023</a>). It is estimated that N applications will continue to rise as world population is expected to grow by 3 billion people within the next 80 years (<a href=\"#kiae029-B7\">Verma et al. 2023</a>). Moreover, a 56% increase in crop yield will be needed to sustain the predicted population growth (<a href=\"#kiae029-B7\">Verma et al. 2023</a>). However, pollution by excess N runoff from agriculture remains a global concern (<a href=\"#kiae029-B4\">de Vries 2021</a>). A holistic approach is thus needed to integrate knowledge of plant nitrogen use efficiency with management practices.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"c7f09cd0c47bc213c0b3371d3f577739f286b520811df4e0004ab1caf420bb2e","category":"Environment"}
