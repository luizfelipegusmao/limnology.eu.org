{"title":"Live and Pasteurized Akkermansia muciniphila Mechanisms of Action and Its Potential Use as an Aid in the Treatment of Non-communicable Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0704/v1","date":1715343723000,"content":"This comprehensive review delineates the extensive roles of Akkermansia muciniphila in various health domains, spanning from metabolic and inflammatory diseases to neurodegenerative disorders. A. muciniphila, known for its ability to reside in the mucous layer of the intestine, plays a pivotal role in maintaining gut integrity and interacting with host metabolic processes. Its influence extends to modulating immune responses and potentially easing symptoms across several non-communicable diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease. Recent studies highlight its capacity to interact with the gut-brain axis, suggesting a possible impact on neuropsychiatric conditions. Despite the promising therapeutic potential of A. muciniphila highlighted in animal and preliminary human studies, challenges remain in its practical application due to stability and cultivation issues. However, the development of pasteurized forms and synthetic mediums offers new avenues for its use in clinical settings, as recognized by regulatory bodies like the European Food Safety Authority. This narrative review serves as a crucial resource for understanding the broad implications of A. muciniphila across different health conditions and its potential integration into therapeutic strategies","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d84f15c8f3fe1705568e2a0cbf3ab36a3054c9e3a8fc06e9b5cef1fa2fd69c1b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
