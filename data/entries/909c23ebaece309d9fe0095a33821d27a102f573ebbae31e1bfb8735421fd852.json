Rice</p>\r\n\r\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recently launched the Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer (GICC), with the goal of attaining at least 60% cancer survival for children worldwide by the year 2030. This study aims to describe the global patterns of childhood cancer survival in 2019 to help guide progress in attaining the GICC target goal. In this ecological, cross-sectional study, we used 5-year net childhood cancer survival (2015â€“2019) data from a prior micro-modeling study from 197 countries and territories. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the patterns of overall childhood cancer survival and survival for each of the six cancer tracer diagnoses as proposed by the GICC. We used hot spot analysis to identify geographic clusters of high and low cancer survival. Most high-income countries reached at least 60% (92%, n = 59/64), net childhood cancer survival at baseline. No lower-middle-income or low-income country reached at least 60% overall cancer survival at baseline. The South-East Asia region had the highest proportion of countries that did not achieve at least 60% survival at baseline (100%, n = 10/10), followed by the African region (98%, n = 49/50). For each cancer tracer diagnosis, we found the highest number of countries that have achieved at least 60% survival was for Burkitt lymphoma (44%, n = 87/197) followed by acute lymphocytic leukemia (41%, n = 80/197).Hot spot analysis showed the highest overall survival was concentrated in North America and Europe, while the lowest survival was concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia.A majority of LMICs had not reached the WHO target goal of at least 60% survival from childhood cancer at baseline in 2019, with variable success for the six childhood cancer tracer diagnoses of the GICC. These findings provide baseline assessment of individual country performance to help achieve the GICC goal of 60% overall cancer survival globally by 2030.","author":"Emily R.
