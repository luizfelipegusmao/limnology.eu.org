{"title":"Unlocking Prognostic Potential: A Genomic Signature of Caloric Restriction in Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1498/v1","date":1719198456000,"content":"Epithelial ovarian cancer significantly contributes to cancer-related mortality in women, often recurring post-treatment with chemotherapy resistance. Dietary interventions have demonstrated influence on cancer progression; for instance, caloric restriction has exhibited tumor growth reduction and enhanced survival in animal cancer models. This study aims to calculate a transcriptomic signature based on caloric-restriction for ovarian cancer patients and explore its correlation with disease progression. We identified proteins modulated by fasting, intermittent fasting or caloric restriction in human females. Based on their gene expression, we calculated a Non-Fasting Genomic Signature score for ovarian cancer samples from the TCGA database. We examined the association between this genomic profile and clinical characteristics. The non-fasting signature, comprising eight genes, demonstrated higher prevalence in primary ovarian tumors compared to normal tissue. Patients with elevated signature expression exhibited reduced overall survival and increased lymphatic invasion. The mesenchymal subtype, associated with chemotherapy resistance, displayed the highest signature expression. Multivariate analysis suggested the non-fasting genomic signature as a potential independent prognostic factor. Ovarian cancer tumors expressing a “non-fasting” transcriptional profile correlate with poorer outcomes, emphasizing the potential impact of caloric restriction on improving patient survival and treatment response. Further investigations, including clinical trials, are warranted to validate these findings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"938c6f529f2f5c423ced21e5822af6e01fd8c8bc0b6f1fe7808125c8644eec89","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
