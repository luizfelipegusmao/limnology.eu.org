{"title":"Prognostic significance of Lung ultrasound for Heart Failure Patient Management in Primary Care. A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1376/v1","date":1711103890000,"content":"Heart failure (HF) affects about 60 million people worldwide, making it one of the chronic conditions with the greatest health and economic impact. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of lung ultrasound (LUS) in the management of HF in order to intervene early and reduce the rate of hospital readmissions. A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus, including clinical trials, meta-analysis, systematic reviews, and original articles from 2019/1/1-2023/12/31, about LUS for the assessment of HF, on an outpatient basis, for HF diagnosis or/and decompensation. There may be risk of bias because the effects are dependent on the persons delivering the intervention. The results were synthetized by PRISMA method. A total of 873 articles were identified of which 33 articles were selected: [n=19] focused on prognostic assessment of HF, [n=11] centred on multimodal diagnostic assessments, and [n=2] addressing therapeutic guidance for HF diagnosis. LUS exhibits advantages in the detection of sub-clinical congestion linked to prognostic significance in re-admission and mortality during out-patient follow-up, after hospital discharge, and in complex scenarios as the patients' homes or institutional long-term care facilities. However, there are considerable uncertainties in their interpretation and monitoring changes due to its lack of standardization. The need for an updated international consensus on the use of LUS seems obvious.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"96305f6f4855bf3eca86955944787c840b2510621cd45a3a66086c4421ce74ed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
