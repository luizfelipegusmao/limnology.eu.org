{"title":"Modelling Lifetime Data and Athletes Red Cells Counts\nUsing the New Topp-Leone-Lomax Poisson Distribution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0885/v1","date":1728630744000,"content":"A new compounded distribution called the Topp-Leone-Lomax Poisson\nis developed. The statistical properties of this model are derived. The\nmodel parameters are estimated via the maximum likelihood technique.\nThe performance of the estimation techniques was assessed by means\nof simulation studies. The new model was exposed to three data sets\nand compared to other models within the same class and the evidence\nsupports the importance of the new model in data modelling.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92ca77cda44ffdc852d09cf6b838be8bb2cf6bb637549f2c4227b7c5bc60d4f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
