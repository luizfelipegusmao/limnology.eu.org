{"title":"Morphological and Genetic Assessment of Invasive Corbicula Lineages in Southern South America: A Case Study in Argentina","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0457/v1","date":1715157281000,"content":"The broad global distribution of freshwater clams belonging to the genus Corbicula is driven by multiple hermaphroditic lineages. These lineages, characterized by shared morphological traits and phenotypic plasticity, pose challenges to morphological identification. Genetic markers, such as the mitochondrial COI gene, play a crucial role in delineating these lineages and their ranges. Morphotypes represent observed phenotypic variations, while lineages are defined based on genetic markers. Here, we comprehensively review Corbicula's distribution in Argentina, dis-criminate extant lineages based on both morphological and genetic (COI) data, and describe variation in internal and external morphology using 15 Argentine populations. Haplotype net-works identified two mitochondrial lineages: A/R morphotype (FW5 haplotype) and C/S mor-photype (FW17 haplotype). Strikingly, despite having similar vectors, origins, and invasive stages, Corbicula lineages exhibit virtually segregated distributions. However, intermediate morphotypes and both mitochondrial haplotypes are found in sympatry in northeastern Argen-tina, suggesting the presence of hybrids due to maternal genome retention. These findings con-tribute to the clarification of the identity and distribution of Corbicula lineages in Argentina, where the genus has been found for over half a century. Similar studies are needed in other areas to better understand the invasion patterns of a successful and plastic group.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c0cba8201f670d224ec8bd45455e8a7560d705157ef155fa81272573f109912","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
