In this scenario, understanding the factors that capture audience attention and drive viral content is crucial. Employing Gibrat’s Law, which posits that an entity’s growth rate is unrelated to its size, we examine the engagement growth dynamics of news outlets on social media. Our analysis includes the Facebook historical data of over a thousand news outlets, encompassing approximately 57 million posts in four European languages from 2008 to the end of 2022. We discover universal growth dynamics according to which news virality is independent of the traditional size of the outlet. Moreover, our analysis reveals a significant long-term impact of news source reliability on engagement growth, with engagement induced by unreliable sources decreasing over time. We conclude the article by presenting a statistical model replicating the observed growth dynamics.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"23ab8147cb34c02fc05198d33431db12fcb8edf1ae9ca0393ec9fa2766dcec9f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
