Every rock has different behavior, which makes the optimum L/D ratio different. Therefore, this study established the optimum L/D ratio for floatstone, which served as a benchmark for compressive strength tests. The analysis was carried out on undisturbed samples of floatstone by performing uniaxial tests based on American standard testing and material. Statistical analysis was used to construct relationship models between the L/D ratio and several mechanical properties, including compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, and Poisson ratio, in order to determine the optimum L/D ratio. The optimal L/D ratio corresponded to the central tendency of this relationship and represented the point at which changes in the mechanical property behavior on the L/D ratio become apparent. The result showed that the L/D ratio of floatstone had a very strong relationship with compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, as well as the Poisson ratio. By applying a mathematical approach to the obtained relationship models, the optimum L/D ratio was found to be 2.20. Furthermore, based on the analysis results, the optimum ratio of length-to-diameter (L/D) of floatstone was 22:10. The Standard L/D ratio for testing the compressive strength of limestone was set to get the best result, while other rock types were analyzed to enrich the database of standard.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"ed7811ad51ce24ebc0afbc8d17c4a4b0adbd195eb255d4fa72a6e0d3ffdab39e","category":"Environment"}
