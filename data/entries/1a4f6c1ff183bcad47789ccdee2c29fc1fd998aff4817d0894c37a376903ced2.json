{"title":"Coniocybe Ach. Revisited","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1653/v1","date":1711523338000,"content":"Calicioids form a research field that has encompassed ascomycetous fungi with stalked ascomata similar to those of the lichen genus Calicium. Early generic circumscriptions in calicioid lichens and fungi were mainly based on morphological and secondary chemistry information. After the introduction of molecular data, taxonomy in the group has been reconsidered. Here, based on a broad geographical sampling, Coniocybe Ach. was revised using molecular and morphological features. Three loci (ITS, LSU and rpb1) were compared to infer its phylogenetic position, and a total of 52 new sequences (14 ITS, 24 LSU and 14 rpb1) were produced. Coniocybe was revised and emended to include, apart for its type C. furfuracea, also C. brachypoda and C. confusa. In addition, a new species Coniocybe eufuracea, was described, and a key to the species of Coniocybe provided.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a4f6c1ff183bcad47789ccdee2c29fc1fd998aff4817d0894c37a376903ced2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
