{"title":"Research on Neonatal Conditions in Africa: Volume, Impact, Thematic Spectrum, and Collaboration from a Bibliometric Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0186/v1","date":1727873023000,"content":"The literature has addressed the negative impact of poor neonatal conditions (NC) across regions. This has drawn attention to the need to improve NC, particularly in Africa. NC research can make an important contribution. However, there is no study dedicated to this topic in Africa. Through a bibliometric analysis, we arrive at outputs that can inform scientists in planning ongoing or new NC research and those involved in developing and implementing strategies to combat poor NC. Using bibliometrics, the study identified the scientific knowledge on NC between 2000 and 2019, its visibility in the community, the main topics researched, and collaboration patterns.The results show that knowledge on NC has increased between 2000 and 2019, it is concentrated in a few African countries (Egypt, South Africa, Nigeria, Tanzania and Kenya), its visibility is below the world average, in general, maternal mortality is the most researched topic and collaborative activities are frequently, mainly international research collaboration (IRC), being the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK) the main partners (they participated in 57% and 28% of all articles with IRC). The collaboration networks are fragile as 43%-67% of all links represent one article in 20 years.Ongoing or new research on NC in Africa should consider the main African players and their partners. There is a need to implement strategies to increase NC knowledge in other African countries, expand and strengthen the collaboration networks and diversify the sources of knowledge.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3194bd1a9a7ba53f2b83147770de9d11249a065bfcf35b86ac6a8345f2079296","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
