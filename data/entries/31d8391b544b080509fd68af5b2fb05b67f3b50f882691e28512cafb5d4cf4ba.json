{"title":"Intertwining Between Temperature, Amount of Mixture, and Particle Number, in a Paradigmatic Many-Fermion Problem","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1898/v1","date":1716960492000,"content":"n this study,  using information theory tools, we investigate the\nquantum degree of mixedness, particle number fluctuations, and temperature\nvariations in the paradigmatic Lipkin model, focusing on the interplay\nbetween these factors in a system of many fermions. Our analysis\nreveals intriguing dependencies of quantum mixedness on the total\nfermion number, showcasing distinct behaviors at different\ntemperatures. Notably, we find that the degree of quantum mixedness\nexhibits a strong dependence on the total fermion number, with varying\ntrends observed across different temperature regimes. Remarkably, this\ndependence remains unaffected by the strength of the fermion-fermion\ninteraction (if it does not vanish, of course), underscoring the\nrobustness of the observed phenomena. Through comprehensive numerical\nsimulations, we provide illustrative graphs that  depict these\ndependencies, offering valuable insights into the fundamental\ncharacteristics of many-fermion systems. Our findings shed light on\nthe intricate dynamics of quantum degree of mixedness and particle number\nfluctuations in fermionic systems, with potential implications for\ndiverse fields ranging from condensed matter physics to quantum\ninformation science.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31d8391b544b080509fd68af5b2fb05b67f3b50f882691e28512cafb5d4cf4ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
