{"title":"Antimicrobial Peptides Derived from Bacteria: Classification, Sources, and Mechanism of Action against Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0665/v1","date":1723344256000,"content":"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are short, usually cationic peptides with an amphiphilic structure, which allows them to easily bind and interact with the cellular membranes of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other pathogens. Bacterial AMPs, or bacteriocins, can be produced from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria via ribosomal synthesis to eliminate competing organisms. Bacterial AMPs are vital in addressing the increasing antibiotic resistance of various pathogens, potentially serving as an alternative to ineffective antibiotics. Bacteriocins have a narrow spectrum of action, making them highly specific antibacterial compounds that target particular bacterial pathogens. This review covers the two main groups of bacteriocins produced by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, their modes of action, classification, sources of positive effects they can play on the human body, and their limitations and future perspectives as an alternative to antibiotics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25b455609b9981798e81940db02c58e5985e03db76c6cf8c6b5769b77ef1fc2a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
