{"title":"New Test to Detect Graphic Passwords Clustered in Passpoints, Based on the Perimeter of the Convex Hull","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1502/v1","date":1716453920000,"content":"This research paper presents a new test based on a novel approach for identifying clustered graphical passwords within the Passpoints scenario. Graphical authentication methods serve as a viable alternative to the conventional alphanumeric password-based authentication method, which is susceptible to known weaknesses arising from user-generated passwords of this nature. The test proposed in this study is based on estimating the distributions of the perimeter of the convex hull. This perimeter is calculated based on the points users select as passwords within an image measuring 1920 × 1080 pixels. The test is formulated once the optimal theoretical distributions that fit the data are identified. Evaluating the proposed test’s effectiveness involves estimating type I and II errors. In this study, we compare the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed test with existing tests from the literature that can detect this type of pattern in Passpoints graphic passwords. Our findings indicate that the new test demonstrates a significant improvement in effectiveness compared to previously published tests. Furthermore, the joint application of the two tests also shows improvement. Depending on the significance level determined by the user or system, the enhancement results in a higher detection rate of clustered passwords, ranging from 0.1% to 8% compared to the most effective previous methods. This improvement leads to a decrease in the estimated probability of committing a type II error. In terms of efficiency, the proposed test outperforms several previous tests; however, it falls short of being the most efficient. It can be concluded that the newly developed test demonstrates the highest effectiveness and the second-highest efficiency level compared to other tests available in the existing literature for the same purpose.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6224746d9848d53eff1fb3e120e04a82cc287d049050912cd72434c045f36f83","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
