{"title":"Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping by Retroperitoneal vNOTES for Uterus-Confined Malignancies: A Standardized 10-Step Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0816/v1","date":1712838564000,"content":"(1) Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping represents an accurate and feasible technique for the surgical staging of endometrial and cervical cancer. This is commonly performed by conventional laparoscopy or robotic-assisted laparoscopy, but in recent years, a new retroperitoneal transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) approach has been described. This technique provides easy visualization of lymphatic afferent vessels and pelvic lymph nodes, early SLNs assessment, and a coherent mapping methodology following the lymphatic flow from caudal to cranial. However, only a few publications have reported it. Following the IDEAL (Idea Development Exploration Assessment Long-term follow-up) framework, research concerning this technique is at stage 2a, with only small case series as evidence of its feasibility. Its standardized description appears necessary to provide the surgical homogeneity required to move further. (2) Methods: description of a standardized approach for retroperitoneal pelvic SLN mapping by vNOTES. (3) Results: we described a 10-step approach to successfully perform retroperitoneal vNOTES SLN mapping, including pre-, intra-, and postoperative management. (4) Conclusions: This IDEAL stage 2a study could help other surgeons approach this new technique, and it proposes a common methodology necessary to evolve through future IDEAL stage 2b (multi-center studies) and stage 3 (randomized controlled trials) studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ffb26e55b63d4025111ce376ef99e3d32c1280b08469c0a8fea8ce623184a481","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
