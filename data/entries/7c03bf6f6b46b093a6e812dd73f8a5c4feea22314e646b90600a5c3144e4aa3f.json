{"title":"Smart Health Monitoring System for Elderly Palestinians Using Internet of Things (IoT)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0302/v1","date":1717591871000,"content":"Problem:Palestinian demographic landscape is undergoing an increase in the elderly population like many regions across the world. The elderly Palestinians  face a unique challenges and problems of limited access to traditional care  due to restricted movement, checkpoints, and also for limited healthcare resources. Therefore, the need arose to develop a sensitive and adaptable smart health monitoring system for Palestinian elderly to provide accurate and timely health data to improve well-being and prevent complications.\nMethod: The proposed system (SHMS) leverages the Internet of Things (IoT) with appropriate sensors to track vital signs like heart rate, blood oximeter, body temperature and signal from a patient heart. Advanced algorithms analyze the data, generating alerts for potential health risks, triggering timely interventions, and enabling remote consultations.\nResults: This system has the potential to contributes to SDG 3 to significantly improve the health and well-being of elderly Palestinians by providing an accurate, low-power, and low-cost system for remote health monitoring. The system, being wearable, reads vital signs in real-time, overcoming geographical barriers and facilitating remote monitoring, especially in areas with limited healthcare centers and suffered from barriers along the way. The Doctor can suggest the patientâ€™s prescription needed based on the momentary condition of the elderly and on previous readings of the sensors, if necessary. Which will also be notified via messages. Moreover, the doctor can take immediate intervention in case of an emergency. By implementing the system, it will be unnecessary for more than 50\\% of the elderly to visit health care, thus reducing the cost to 50\\%.}","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c03bf6f6b46b093a6e812dd73f8a5c4feea22314e646b90600a5c3144e4aa3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
