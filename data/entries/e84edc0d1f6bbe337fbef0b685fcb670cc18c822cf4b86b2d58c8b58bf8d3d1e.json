{"title":"Occurrence of pesticide residues and associated ecological risks assessment in water and sediment from selected dams in northern Ghana","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312273","date":1729519200000,"content":"<p>by Abdou Orou-Seko, Dennis Chirawurah, Alexis Houndji, Felix Achana, Joyce Aputere Ndago, Matilda Nkansah-Baidoo, Martin Nyaaba Adokiya</p>\r\n\r\nPesticides are chemicals used to enhance crop production. However, their residues can persist and accumulate in various environmental settings. This study assessed the occurrence of pesticide residues and ecological risks in surface water and sediment from the Libga and Builpela dams in northern Ghana. A total of 42 pesticides were analysed. Toxic units were used to assess the acute risk to sediment-dwelling organisms and aquatic biota. Risk quotients were employed to assess the chronic risk to aquatic organisms. Chlorpyrifos, atrazine, profenofos, and chlorfenvinphos were the main chemicals found in surface water. The concentrations were highest near the Builpela dam (0.413μg/L, 2.927μg/L, 0.304μg/L, 0.692μg/L, 0.073μg/L, 0.290μg/L, 0.06μg/L, and absent in the Libga dam). In the sediment, the organophosphates pyrimiphos-methyl and chlorpyrifos were found at high concentrations. They were found in higher quantities in the Libga dam (0.554mg/kg and 0.052mg/kg, respectively) and Builpela dam (0.051mg/kg and 0.043mg/kg, respectively). For organochlorines, p,p’-DDE and p,p’-DDD were the main residues detected at high concentrations. However, concentrations were higher for p,p’-DDD at Builpela than for p,p’-DDE. Additionally, high concentrations of atrazine were detected in this study. The toxic units showed a high acute risk for organisms that live in sediment as a result of chlorpyrifosfos and chlorfenvinphos residues. Similarly, pirimiphos-methyl and chlorfenvinphos, followed by chlorpyrifos, contributed to high acute risk in aquatic invertebrates. Risk quotients showed that both dams had a high long-term risk for aquatic life; however, the risk was higher at the Builpela dam due to Pirimiphos-methyl and Chlorfenvinphos. Ghana’s pesticide regulations are less comprehensive and enforcement is often weaker in protecting aquatic organisms. It is recommended to enforce strict limits on pesticide residues. Additionally, there is a need to regularly review and update these regulations based on new scientific data to protect aquatic ecosystems.","author":"Abdou Orou-Seko","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e84edc0d1f6bbe337fbef0b685fcb670cc18c822cf4b86b2d58c8b58bf8d3d1e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
