{"title":"Drug Resistance: A Modern Threat Confronting Humanity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1436/v1","date":1718889203000,"content":"Our world is rife with challenges, many of which arise from both natural phenomena and human-made issues. While natural problems like diseases and environmental changes often elude our immediate control, a troubling number of today's issues are unintended consequences of human innovations. A striking example is the evolution of drug resistance. The discovery of antibiotics in the early days of modern medicine marked a monumental breakthrough, drastically reducing mortality rates and improving quality of life. Pioneers like Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin in 1928, ushered in a new era of medical treatment, transforming healthcare by effectively combating bacterial infections.However, the widespread and often indiscriminate use of these drugs has led to the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. This natural phenomenon, accelerated by human practices such as overprescription and the misuse of antibiotics in agriculture, exemplifies a double-edged swordâ€”initially celebrated solutions have now become significant challenges. The same drugs that once cured deadly infections are losing efficacy, making us vulnerable to diseases previously thought under control.The inventors of these drugs acted with the intent to save lives and alleviate suffering, unaware of the long-term consequences. Today, the responsibility to address drug resistance lies with us, armed with hindsight and a deeper understanding of microbial resistance complexities. This review explores the origins and evolution of drug resistance, the role of scientific knowledge, and the implications for future actions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"26efb0b0df9730cbdc9c84f7b8c1f4244b45fec69ba29a7c14498f79e38a1052","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
