Visual assessment and the Turbiscan stability index revealed that the stability of MP emulsions improved with increasing FVP concentration. The greatest stability was achieved when the FVP concentration was 16 gL<sup>−1</sup>. The incorporation of FVP enhanced the elasticity and viscosity of the emulsions by forming a dense three-dimensional network structure. The droplet size of the emulsions initially decreased and then increased with increasing FVP concentration. The addition of FVP increased the amount of protein absorbed by the emulsion layer. <i>Flammulina velutipes</i> powder is promising as a stabilizer that could improve the emulsifying and functional properties of low-salt myofibrillar protein emulsions. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Qingquan Fu, \nChun Qin, \nQuanzhan Chen, \nWei Zhang, \nMiaomiao Han","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"2167b7455dbc4fc410f98b420e5600796a1c064059b98343a80ff59e4f4c65fa","category":"Environment"}
