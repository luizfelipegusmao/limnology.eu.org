{"title":"Robust Wideband Interference Suppression Method for GNSS Array Antenna Receiver via Hybrid Beamforming Technique","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1284/v1","date":1713447731000,"content":"Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) array antenna receivers are widely used to suppress wideband interference in navigation countermeasures. However, existing array antenna receivers all adopt digital array structure and digital beamforming technique, and it has limited analog-front-end (AFE) dynamic range. In strong interference scenarios, AFE saturation will occur, which limits the maximum interference suppression ability of the array receiver. Aiming at this issue, this paper proposes a robust wideband interference suppression method for GNSS array antenna receivers based on hybrid beamforming technique. Firstly, a novel fully connected hybrid array receiver structure is proposed; Secondly, the corresponding hybrid beamforming method is proposed at the same time, and it realizes the complete elimination of strong interference by jointly suppression in analog domain and digital domain. After mathematical simulation experiments, it is verified that compared to the digital beamforming-based anti-jamming technique, the proposed method can effectively suppress strong wideband interference, and the maximum interference suppression ability is improved by 36 dB.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51e95324acb41f1c1cfedbfa5068cc0cebd0af2c2c47ffe740d8b05c54d04546","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
