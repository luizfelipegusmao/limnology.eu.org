{"title":"Field evaluation the effect of two transgenic Bt maize events on predatory arthropods in the Huang-Huai-Hai summer maize-growing region of China","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/3/398/7633348?rss=1","date":1710979200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>To illustrate the impact of genetically modified (GM) Bt maize on the natural enemy communities in the Huang-Huai-Hai summer maize-growing region in China, the abundance of 7 common predator taxa (<span>Geocoris pallidipennis</span> Costa, <span>Harmonia axyridis</span> (Pallas), lacewings, <span>Orius sauteri</span> (Poppius), <span>Propylea japonica</span> (Thunberg), spiders, and Staphylinidae) was quantitatively evaluated by comparing Bt-Cry1Ab DBN9936 and Bt-Cry1Ab/Cry2Aj Ruifeng 125 events to their near non-Bt isolines during the growing season from 2016 to 2019. A total of 10,302, 19,793, 13,536, and 5,672 individuals were observed during 4 years, and the abundance of each taxa on Bt maize varied between sample dates among those arthropod taxa. Shannonâ€“Wiener diversity index of predator communities from 7 taxa showed very similar temporal dynamics and principal response curve analyses to examine community-level effects showed no significant differences in predator abundance in Bt maize compared with non-Bt maize. We conclude that the 2 Bt maize hybrids did not adversely affect the predator community in the Huang-Huai-Hai summer maize-growing region of China.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"ee1947fe0610684737cbf73c95a73715764d446a8190f8eff732df4a9d7e6b3f","category":"Environment"}
