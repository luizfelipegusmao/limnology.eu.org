However, knowledge on their recovery patterns following reductions in N enrichment and the regulatory mechanisms involved remains scarce. Our findings indicate that bacteria exhibit greater resilience compared to fungi. The recovery of bacterial communities is primarily attributed to the differential regulation of functional taxa by metal ions. In contrast, the sensitivity and resilience of fungal communities are influenced by alterations in soil pH and plant community composition. This study offers valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying soil microbial recovery from N enrichment.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has been substantially reduced due to declines in the reactive N emission in major regions of the world. Nevertheless, the impact of reduced N deposition on soil microbial communities and the mechanisms by which they are regulated remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the effects of N addition and cessation of N addition on plant and soil microbial communities through a 17-year field experiment in a temperate grassland. We found that extreme N input did not irreversibly disrupt the ecosystem, but ceasing high levels of N addition led to greater resilience in bacterial and fungal communities. Fungi exhibited diminished resilience compared to bacteria due to their heightened reliance on changes in plant communities. Neither bacterial nor fungal diversity fully recovered to their original states. Their sensitivity and resilience were mainly steered by toxic metal ions and soil pH differentially regulating on functional taxa. Specifically, beneficial symbiotic microbes such as N-fixing bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi experienced detrimental effects from toxic metal ions and lower pH, hindering their recovery. The bacterial functional groups involved in carbon decomposition, and ericoid mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi were positively influenced by soil metals, and demonstrated gradual recovery. These findings could advance our mechanistic understanding of microbial community dynamics under ongoing global changes, thereby informing management strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of N enrichment on soil function.</p>","author":"Mengmeng Chen, \nYao Zheng, \nXiufeng Zhai, \nFangling Ma, \nJi Chen, \nCarly Stevens, \nWen‚ÄêHao Zhang, \nQiuying Tian","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"40fcb561a4b0eb6fdfd0e489690bd1728f1b85e6fa156d293503c39d0629364e","category":"Environment"}
