{"title":"Anti-HER2 cancer-specific mAb, H2Mab-250-hG1 possesses higher complement-dependent cytotoxicity than trastuzumab","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0864/v1","date":1720668018000,"content":"Cancer-specific monoclonal antibodies (CasMabs) that recognize cancer-specific antigens with in vivo antitumor efficacy are innovative therapeutic strategies for minimizing the adverse effects. We previously established a cancer-specific anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)monoclonal antibody (mAb), H2Mab-250/H2CasMab-2. In flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, H2Mab-250 reacted with HER2-positive breast cancer cells but did not show the reactivity to normal epithelial cells. In contrast, a clinically approved anti-HER2 mAb, trastuzumab, strongly recognizes both breast cancer and normal epithelial cells in flow cytometry. The human IgG1 version of H2Mab-250 (H2Mab-250-hG1) possesses compatible in vivo antitumor effects against breast cancer xenografts with trastuzumab despite the lower affinity and effector activation than trastuzumab in vitro. This study compared the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDC) between H2Mab-250-hG1 and trastuzumab. Both H2Mab-250-hG1 and trastuzumab showed ADCC activity against CHO/HER2 and breast cancer cell lines (BT-474 and SK-BR-3) in the presence of human natural killer cells. Some tendency was observed that trastuzumab showed a more significant ADCC effect compared to H2Mab-250-hG1. Importantly, H2Mab-250-hG1 exhibited superior CDC activity in these cells compared to trastuzumab. Similar results were obtained in mouse IgG2a types of both H2Mab-250 and trastuzumab. These results suggest the different contributions of ADCC and CDC activities to the antitumor effects of H2Mab-250-hG1 and trastuzumab and indicate the future direction for the clinical development of H2Mab-250-hG1 against HER2-positive tumors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6bd2e43bcbbba30d10e09cfd12b25630ca7b471f3556d2eba960d219dc958acd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
