{"title":"On Visual Data Analysis of IEEE Xplore Bibliometric Records on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Power Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0003/v1","date":1725240683000,"content":"This paper addresses the lack of analytical tools for visual data analysis in IEEE Xplore, an abstract database of publications on technical problems in electronics and electrical engineering. The openness of the platform and the good fillability of a large number of bibliometric record fields make it attractive for visual data analysis. The topic of machine learning and artificial intelligence applied to power systems, which are critical issues in the energy transition process, is chosen as an example for visual data analysis. The programs and utilities used for data analysis were VOSviewer, Scimago Graphica, FP-Growth algorithm, Inkscape, and MultiDendrograms. The use of IEEE Terms field data to identify publication topics in the exported data is analyzed in the most comprehensive way. This paper can be considered a reference for professionals interested in bibliometric analysis and visualization of IEEE Xplore data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd1ae543bd0153cd55744a1bef6e64743d4e9a3f7ba6fec1068b783af5260355","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
