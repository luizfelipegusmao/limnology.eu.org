We aim to determine the leading dimensions of tree trait variation for above- and belowground functional traits, and test whether they represent spectra of adaptation along a soil fertility gradient in tropical Andean forests.\n\nWe measured leaf, stem and fine root functional traits, and individual-level soil nutrient availability for 433 trees from 52 species at three elevations between 1000 and 3000 m a.s.l.\n\nWe found close coordination between above– and belowground functional traits related to the trade-off between resource acquisition and conservation, whereas root diameter and specific root length formed an independent axis of covarying traits. The position of a tree species along the acquisition–conservation axis of the trait space was closely associated with local soil nitrogen, but not phosphorus, availability.\n\nOur results imply that above- and belowground plant functional traits determine at which edaphic microhabitats coexisting tree species can grow, which is potentially crucial for understanding community assembly in species-rich tropical montane forests.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/03/15/leaf-root-and-wood-properties-of-tree-species-in-tropical-montane-forests-are-adaptations-to-soil-fertility-and-determine-which-tree-species-grows-where/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Kerstin Pierick, \nChristoph Leuschner, \nRoman M.
