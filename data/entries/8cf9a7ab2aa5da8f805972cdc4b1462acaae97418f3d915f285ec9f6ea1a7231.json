{"title":"Exploring natural genetic variation in photosynthesis-related traits of barley in the field","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/4904/7663878?rss=1","date":1714694400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Optimizing photosynthesis is considered an important strategy for improving crop yields to ensure food security. To evaluate the potential of using photosynthesis-related parameters in crop breeding programs, we measured chlorophyll fluorescence along with growth-related and morphological traits of 23 barley inbred lines across different developmental stages in field conditions. The photosynthesis-related parameters were highly variable, changing with light intensity and developmental progression of plants. Yet, the variation in photosystem II quantum yield observed among the inbred lines in the field largely reflected the variation in CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation properties in controlled climate chamber conditions, confirming that the chlorophyll fluorescence-based technique can provide proxy parameters of photosynthesis to explore genetic variation under field conditions. Heritability (H2) of the photosynthesis-related parameters in the field ranged from 0.16 for the quantum yield of non-photochemical quenching to 0.78 for the fraction of open photosystem II center. Two parameters, the maximum photosystem II efficiency in the light-adapted state (H2=0.58) and the total non-photochemical quenching (H2=0.53), showed significant positive and negative correlations, respectively, with yield-related traits (dry weight per plant and net straw weight) in the barley inbred lines. These results indicate the possibility of improving crop yield through optimizing photosynthetic light use efficiency by conventional breeding programs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"8cf9a7ab2aa5da8f805972cdc4b1462acaae97418f3d915f285ec9f6ea1a7231","category":"Environment"}
