{"title":"Theoretical Model Based on the Influence of Turbulence Intensity on the Wake of Vertical Axis Turbine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1714/v1","date":1721667544000,"content":"In this study, Fluent software 2020R2 is used to simulate vertical axis turbine in two dimensions, aiming to analyze the influence of turbulence intensity on wake characteristics. The detailed flow field data are obtained by simulating the operation of turbine under different turbulence intensities. On this basis, the influence factor of turbulence intensity are creatively introduced into the wake mathematical formula of vertical axis turbine established by Lam, and some parameter calculations of the formula are supplemented and perfected. The results show that the theoretical model can well reflect the influence of turbulence intensity on the wake distribution of vertical axis turbines. The formula can provide a theoretical basis for the design and optimization of vertical axis turbines and the array arrangement, and can be used to predict the wake characteristics under different turbulence intensity operating conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a5169c367e45919ce6b4d526a72e4ddaac777713851c72c3f105e8817bff652","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
