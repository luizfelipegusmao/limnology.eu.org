This innovative approach involved the return of waste activated sludge (WAS) from the biological nutrient removal (BNR) system to enhance the nitrification in the high carbon removal rate system. The <span>com</span>plete <span>amm</span>onia <span>ox</span>idizer (comammox) <i>Nitrospira Nitrosa</i> was identified as the main nitrifier in the system. Bioaugmentation was shown to be successful as nitrifiers returned from BNR were able to increase the nitrifying activity of the high carbon removal rate system. There was a positive correlation between returned sludge from the BNR stage and the specific total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) removal rate in A stage. The bioaugmentation process resulted in a remarkable threefold increase in the specific TKN removal rate within the A stage. Result suggested that recycling of WAS is a simple technique to bio-augment a low SRT system with nitrifiers and add ammonia oxidation to a previously non-nitrifying stage. The results from this case study hold the potential for applicable implications for other WWTPs that have a similar operational scheme to Blue Plains, allowing them to reuse WAS from the B stage, previously considered waste, to enhance nitrification and thus improving overall nitrogen removal performance.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nComammox identifying as main nitrifier in the B stage.\nComammox enriched sludge from B stage successfully bio-augmented the East side of A stage up to threefold.\nBioaugmentation of comammox in the West side of A stage was potentially inhibited by the gravity thickened overflow.\nSludge returned from B stage to A stage can improve nitrification with a very minor retrofits and short startup times.\n</p>","author":"Bao Nguyen Quoc, \nBo Peng, \nHaydee De Clippeleir, \nMari‐Karoliina H.
