{"title":"Severe Plastic Deformation Significantly Enhances Strengthening and Toughening Effect of T6 Treated 7046 Aluminum Alloy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1587/v1","date":1724301815000,"content":"7046 aluminum alloy has good fatigue property, corrosion resistance and weld property, but the moderate strength and plasticity limit its wider application and development. In the present study, severe plastic deformation (SPD) was applied prior to T6 treatment to significantly strengthen and toughen the 7046 aluminum alloy. Results indicate that the alloy processed by 4 passes of equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) at 300 ℃ prior to T6 treatment exhibits an excellent mechanical performance, with ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation (EL) of 485 MPa and 19%, exhibiting an improvement of 18.6% and 375% compared to that of the T6 alloy, respectively. The mechanical properties of the alloy are further improved by the additional room temperature (RT) rolling process, with UTS of 508 MPa and EL of 23.4%. There are more precipitates of η' and Al6Mn phases in the 300℃4P-R80%-T6 and 300°C4P-T6 alloys, which contribute to the strengthening and toughening enhancement by SPD processed T6 alloy. The results of this work may shed some light on enhancing 7046 aluminum alloy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93fc57afbcbce147e31054ac576ac3cdad7da010206f1b3d7b41a700579bedc4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
