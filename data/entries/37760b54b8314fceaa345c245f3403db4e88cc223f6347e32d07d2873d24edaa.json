{"title":"Roles of Hydrology and Transport Processes in Denitrification at Watershed Scale","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034971?af=R","date":1711987164000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Rainfall runoff and leaching are the main driving forces that nitrogen, an important non-point source (NPS) pollutant, enters streams, lakes, and groundwater. Hydrological and transport processes thus play a pivotal role in NPS nitrogen pollution. Existing hydro-environmental models for nitrogen pollution often over-simplify the within-watershed processes. It is unclear how such simplification affects the pollution assessment regarding the formation and distribution of denitrification hot spots—which is important for the design of land-based countermeasures. To study this problem, we developed a model, DHSVM-N, and its variant, DHSVM-N_alt. DHSVM-N is developed by integrating nitrogen-related processes of SWAT into a comprehensive process-based hydrological model, the Distributed Hydrology Soil and Vegetation Model (DHSVM). DHSVM-N includes detailed representations of nitrate transport process at a fine spatial resolution with good landscape connectivity to accommodate interactions between hydrological and biogeochemical processes along the flow travel pathways. Because of the lack of spatially distributed observational data for validation, a model-to-model comparison study is conducted. Through comparison studies on a representative catchment using SWAT, DHSVM-N and DHSVM-N_alt, we quantify the critical roles of hydrological processes and nitrate transport processes in modeling the denitrification process. That is, the capabilities to give reasonable soil moisture estimates and to account for essential processes that take place along flow pathways are keys to simulate denitrification hot spots and their spatial variation. Furthermore, DHSVM-N results show that terrestrial denitrification from hotspots alone can reach as high as 36% of the annual stream nitrate export of the watershed.</p>","author":"Y. Wen, \nJ.‐S.
