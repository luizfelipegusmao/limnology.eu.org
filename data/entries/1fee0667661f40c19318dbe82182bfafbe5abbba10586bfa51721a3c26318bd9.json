{"title":"Mating dynamics of a sperm-limited drosophilid, <i>Zaprionus indianus</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300426","date":1711375200000,"content":"<p>by Jennifer M.

One such species is <i>Zaprionus indianus</i>, a drosophilid that is an introduced pest species in the Americas. We examined aspects of mating behavior in <i>Z</i>. <i>indianus</i> to determine the senses necessary for mating and measure female and male remating habits. We found that vision is necessary for successful copulation, but wings, which produce courtship song, are not needed. Males need their foretarsi to successfully copulate and although the foretarsi may be needed for chemoreception, their role in hanging on to the female during copulation may be more important for successful mating. Females that mate once run out of sperm in approximately five days, although mating a second time greatly increases offspring production. Females do not seem to exert pre-mating choice among males with respect to mating with a familiar versus a novel male. Males are not capable of mating continuously and fail to produce offspring in many copulations. Overall, females of this species benefit from polyandry, providing an opportunity to study sexual selection in females. In addition, the dynamics of male competition for fertilizing eggs needs to be studied.","author":"Jennifer M.
