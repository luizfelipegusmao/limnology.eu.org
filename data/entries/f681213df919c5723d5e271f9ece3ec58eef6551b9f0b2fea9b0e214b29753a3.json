{"title":"Genomic Exploration of Pediatric Neurological Diversity: Lessons from Clinical Exome Panel Sequencing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202312.1095/v2","date":1722983458000,"content":"Background: Pediatric neurological disorders include neurodegenerative disease causing cognitive impairment, vision loss to mention a few. They are one of the important causes of morbidity and mortality in children with diverse etiology. Diagnosis is difficult in spite of genetic work and in only 60% of cases final diagnosis can be achieved. Case presentation: We explore three cases of pediatric neurological diseases, viz. Arthrogryposis, congenital bilateral cataract and Autism by analyzing clinical exomes. In this work, we attempted to understand rare neurological disorders in an Indian pediatric cohort using exome studies. Conclusions: We used our benchmarked CONVEX pipeline for screening consensus variants, wherein EIF2B2 was found to be inherently pathogenic. We map the association of variants and genes,  disease correlation to neuroleptic malignant syndrome which is a matching phenotype to the cases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f681213df919c5723d5e271f9ece3ec58eef6551b9f0b2fea9b0e214b29753a3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
