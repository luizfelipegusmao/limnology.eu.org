{"title":"Phosphoric Acid Pre-treatment Improves Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Weedy Biomass (Thysanolaena latifolia) for Bioethanol Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0905/v1","date":1710483975000,"content":"Lignocellulosic biomass has garnered attention as an abundant and sustainable alternative energy source that can facilitate reliable and environmentally friendly energy generation. Energy security improves, and environmental impacts diminish when bioethanol, a biofuel produced via lignocellulose-based processes, is utilized. The lignocellulosic biomass of Thysanolaena latifolia has considerable potential as a bioethanol feedstock due to its high carbohydrate content (62.4 Â± 0.7%). In this study, feedstock derived from T. latifolia was pretreated with various concentrations of H3PO4 to determine the ideal conditions for enzymatic hydrolysis to convert the feedstock to fermentable sugar. The findings revealed that hydrolysis efficiency and glucose recovery yields were substantially improved compared to those of the untreated sample. Pretreated samples were enzymatically digested to produce a liquid hydrolysate. This hydrolysate was fermented without detoxification using Saccharomyces cerevisiae TISTR 5339 to produce ethanol. The results indicated that T. latifolia biomass hydrolysate is a promising long-term carbon source for ethanol production from cellulosic biomass. Furthermore, the morphological and crystallographic characteristics of the treated T. latifolia biomass were influenced by H3PO4 concentration, as indicated by the SEM images, X-ray diffractogram patterns, and crystallinity index values. Therefore, utilizing T. latifolia feedstock to produce bioethanol can enhance bioenergy sustainability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"879731d894fce64bd17e13e597ca252ba317e2d447409dc399dfc82d32cf652b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
