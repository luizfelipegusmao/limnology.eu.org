{"title":"Feathered Predators: The Role of Plumage in the Hunting Tactics of Velociraptor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2304/v1","date":1722250599000,"content":"This literature review investigates the role of plumage in the hunting tactics of Velociraptor, integrating anatomical analysis and biomechanical modeling. Velociraptor, a swift and agile theropod from the Late Cretaceous, exhibited advanced intelligence and sensory capabilities that contributed to its effective predatory strategies. Recent discoveries have confirmed that Velociraptor was covered in feathers, with quill knobs indicating well-developed plumage. This review explores the potential functions of feathers beyond flight, focusing on their impact on hunting behavior. Evidence suggests that Velociraptor’s plumage likely facilitated camouflage and enhanced aerodynamic control, improving its stealth and maneuverability during high-speed chases. Additionally, feathers might have contributed to stability during incline running, further supporting its adaptability in diverse environments. Velociraptor’s hunting strategies, characterized by agility and precision, were complemented by its feathered anatomy, which may have also played a role in pack hunting and social interactions. Overall, the integration of plumage with Velociraptor’s anatomical features and behavioral adaptations underscores its efficiency as a predator, demonstrating how feathers may have been a critical factor in its successful hunting tactics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de92705406eb48a82927bec2e54f894b4c969856023713db605404caee21b224","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
