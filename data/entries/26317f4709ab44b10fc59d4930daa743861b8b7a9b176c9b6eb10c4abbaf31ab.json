The COVID-19 crisis was an intense reminder. Environmental perspective of SARS-CoV-2 as an emerging viruses is at the focus of many studies. Multiple investigations have shown the presence of the virus in the excrement of an individual who is infected, even during an extended duration of medical intervention. This review aims to understand the destiny of SARS-CoV-2 in various environments with respect to its occurrence, persistence and elimination based on the papers published so far. The SARS-Co2 virus was isolated from contaminated water and rivers, but there is insufficient evidence for viral transmission via water and wastewater. To date, few studies have confirmed the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 due to cell culture infectivity assay results. Furthermore, some studies have investigated the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 in different stages of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). High inactivation in WWTPs can be completed using efficient disinfectants. There have been no recorded instances of the transmission of this virus to individuals through sewage up until now. Nevertheless, research findings have demonstrated the importance of wastewater monitoring in the early detection of the virus variants in communities. There is a need for constant surveillance of emerging viral diseases in all countries around the world. Wastewater surveillance can serve as an initial evaluation of viral infection within a community in the case of SARS-CoV-2.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"26317f4709ab44b10fc59d4930daa743861b8b7a9b176c9b6eb10c4abbaf31ab","category":"Environment"}
