{"title":"Pregnancy and Risks from Cosmetics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2137/v1","date":1727389047000,"content":"This review aimed to identify the risks of cosmetics during the sensitive period of pregnancy. Pregnancy causes many hormonal changes and skin issues, such as red stretch marks, cellulite, and more. These aesthetic concerns can impact both the appearance and health of the pregnant woman. Cosmetics and aesthetic treatments can help improve these problems and positively affect the mental well-being of these women. However, the lack of clinical trials regarding the safety of such treatments during pregnancy has led to the recommendation of only the mildest aesthetic applications. Additionally, professional aestheticians and dermatologists who provide cosmetics and other aesthetic treatments (e.g., laser, ultrasound, radiofrequency) during pregnancy face challenging and sometimes adverse working conditions. They should be treated with respect for their situation, with careful consideration of all the peculiarities associated with pregnancy. Further research and additional recorded data are crucial for better understanding the use of cosmetics and aesthetic treatments during pregnancy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c834ef1efd2d8776afcb60f8257f0d6a004e562c5669bebfb267dc733bc0cbed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
