{"title":"Otolith Microchemistry Reveals the Diversity of Migration Patterns and Spawning Grounds Distribution of Coilia nasus from the Yangtze River Estuary","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1875/v1","date":1724743554000,"content":"Coilia nasus is an important fish resource in the Yangtze River, and the Yangtze River Estuary is a crucial migration pathway for it. In this study, we used otolith microchemistry to analyze the strontium/calcium (Sr/Ca) ratios and Sr contents in the sagitta otolith of C. nasus from the south branch (SB) and north branch (NB) of the Yangtze River Estuary, and obtained the diversity of migration patterns and spawning grounds distribution for C. nasus. The results indicate that C. nasus from both branches include two types of habitat history: freshwater (F)-brackish water (B) (Type I) and F-B-seawater (S) (Type II), with Type I being dominant at 62.50% in both branches. The C. nasus from SB comprises six migration patterns, while that from NB has seven migration patterns. The C. nasus from both branches hatch in F habitats. At the time of capture, the C. nasus from SB predominantly remain in F, accounting for 62.5%, while C. nasus from NB primarily stay in B, accounting for 87.5%. Throughout the migration process, C. nasus from both branches switch between different habitats, with C. nasus from NB exhibiting more frequent transitions between F and B, showing a greater reliance on the estuarine brackish habitat. The radius of the first blue region near the core (Lf) and freshwater coefficient (Fc) of otolith for C. nasus from both branches are divided into three groups: Long-distance freshwater dependence (LD), medium-distance freshwater-dependent (MD), and short-distance freshwater dependence (SD), with the LD only appearing in the SB, while the NB is primarily represented by the MD. There is a correlation between the differences in Lf among different groups of C. nasus and the differences in the distance from the spawning grounds of C. nasus in different sections of the Yangtze River to the Estuary (DYRE), reflecting the distribution pattern of C. nasus spawning grounds in different sections of the Yangtze River. This study provides theoretical guidance for the protection of migration pathway and maintenance of spawning grounds for C. nasus, which has significant practical value in the precise management of C. nasus resources in the Yangtze River Estuary.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02371c5e7ce8be6e37dddf4248c98b223e1817afe009e6eb9b238868da413c8d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
