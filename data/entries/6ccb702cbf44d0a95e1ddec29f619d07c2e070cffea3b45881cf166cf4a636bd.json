{"title":"Factors Associated with Anxiety Symptoms Among Filipino Farmers in Central Luzon: An Analytical Cross-sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1838/v1","date":1716899624000,"content":"This article aims to determine the different factors that are associated with anxiety symptoms among Filipino farmers in Central Luzon. Eligible participants were screened for anxiety symptoms using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), while the Data Collection Tool for Factors Associated with Anxiety Symptoms (DCFAAS) was constructed and validated to determine the exposure of these factors. Among the 113 eligible farmers, only 19 (16.8%) experienced anxiety symptoms, with excessive worrying (39.8%) being the most frequent anxiety symptom. The mental health of Filipino farmers was significantly affected by the presence of physical illness (OR = 10.70 [1.367, 83.773]) and having relatives affecting work completion (OR = 6.45 [1.346, 30.896]). Therefore, policies must be focused on tackling these issues to address the mental health issues faced by farmers. The low prevalence of anxiety symptoms may stem from existing perceptions and barriers encountered in confiding psychological issues, and the Filipinoâ€™s religiosity and resiliency.
