{"title":"BetaBuddy: An automated end-to-end computer vision pipeline for analysis of calcium fluorescence dynamics in β-cells","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299549","date":1710511200000,"content":"<p>by Anne M. Alsup, Kelli Fowlds, Michael Cho, Jacob M. Luber</p>\r\n\r\nInsulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells is integral in maintaining the delicate equilibrium of blood glucose levels. Calcium is known to be a key regulator and triggers the release of insulin. This sub-cellular process can be monitored and tracked through live-cell imaging and subsequent cell segmentation, registration, tracking, and analysis of the calcium level in each cell. Current methods of analysis typically require the manual outlining of β-cells, involve multiple software packages, and necessitate multiple researchers—all of which tend to introduce biases. Utilizing deep learning algorithms, we have therefore created a pipeline to automatically segment and track thousands of cells, which greatly reduces the time required to gather and analyze a large number of sub-cellular images and improve accuracy. Tracking cells over a time-series image stack also allows researchers to isolate specific calcium spiking patterns and spatially identify those of interest, creating an efficient and user-friendly analysis tool. Using our automated pipeline, a previous dataset used to evaluate changes in calcium spiking activity in β-cells post-electric field stimulation was reanalyzed. Changes in spiking activity were found to be underestimated previously with manual segmentation. Moreover, the machine learning pipeline provides a powerful and rapid computational approach to examine, for example, how calcium signaling is regulated by intracellular interactions.","author":"Anne M.
