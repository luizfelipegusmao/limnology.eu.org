{"title":"Initial clubfoot treatment in Sweden from 2016 to 2019: A national register study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305900","date":1719410400000,"content":"<p>by Arne Johansson, Henrik Wallander, Anna-Clara Esbjörnsson</p>\r\nBackground <p>This study aimed to describe the initial treatment of clubfoot deformity in Sweden using a national cohort. Secondarily we aimed to analyse the results of the initial treatment in relation to foot severity and additional diseases.</p> Methods <p>A national register, the Swedish Pediatric Orthopedic Quality Register, was used to extract data on children born with clubfoot in 2016–2019. Children with a registered evaluation after initial treatment were included. Data on deformity severity (Pirani score), casting treatment, and achillotenotomy were extracted. For children with bilateral clubfeet, one foot was included in the analysis.</p> Results <p>A total of 565 children were included in the analysis. Of these, 73% were boys and 47% had bilateral clubfeet. Children with isolated clubfoot required a median of six casts to correct the deformity, while children with non-isolated clubfoot needed a median of eight casts. Seventy-seven percent underwent an achillotenotomy. Residual deformities of 0.5 or above (often soft-tissue issues) according to the Pirani score were noted in 23% (isolated clubfoot) and 61% (non-isolated clubfoot) after initial treatment.</p> Conclusions <p>We have described the initial clubfoot treatment of children born with isolated or non-isolated clubfoot in Sweden based on data from a national register. The initial treatment was performed to a large extent according to the Ponseti method and international recommendations. Moreover, we discuss the usefulness of the Pirani score in classifying clubfoot deformity after treatment.</p>","author":"Arne Johansson","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"86e556c1a392205fb8c39fe2a6c922a5d88edf9c9edfff5854af36c6db795c8d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
