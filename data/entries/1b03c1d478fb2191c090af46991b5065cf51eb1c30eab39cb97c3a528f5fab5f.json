Before that, she was one of the first to demonstrate atomically resolved chemical mapping using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and aberration-corrected STEM. At the beginning of her academic career though, I met her as Lena Fitting when we joined David Muller’s group at Cornell University in 2003; she was the first graduate student of David’s, followed by me and Peter Ercius who is a staff scientist at the Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. During our Ph.D. years, we shared hotel rooms, attending M&amp;M conferences, and had many discussions on all technical aspects of STEM, EELS, and our projects as well as on life in Ithaca, NY. She loved Ithaca and never wanted to leave, and I couldn’t wait to leave Ithaca at the end of my Ph.D. even though I eventually returned to Ithaca.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1b03c1d478fb2191c090af46991b5065cf51eb1c30eab39cb97c3a528f5fab5f","category":"Environment"}
