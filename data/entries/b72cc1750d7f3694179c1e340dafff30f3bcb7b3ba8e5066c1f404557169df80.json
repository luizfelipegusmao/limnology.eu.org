By integrating this model into the ViBe motion detection algorithm, we have significantly improved detection accuracy and reduced false positive rates. Our approach leverages adaptive techniques to increase the robustness of the segmentation model in complex scenarios, without requiring extensive manual parameter tuning. Despite the notable improvements, we recognize that further training is necessary to optimize the model for specific applications. The results indicate that our method provides a promising direction for real-time motion detection systems that require high precision and adaptability to varying conditions.","author":"Jabulani Brown Mpofu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b72cc1750d7f3694179c1e340dafff30f3bcb7b3ba8e5066c1f404557169df80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
