{"title":"The Microscopic Production Characteristics of CO2 Flooding AF-Ter Water Flooding for Tight Oil Sandstones Reservoirs Utilized NMR and Microscopic Visualization Apparatus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1216/v1","date":1710937644000,"content":"The microscopic pore structure of tight sandstone reservoir significantly influences the characteris-tics of CO2 flooding after water flooding. The research was conducted using various techniques such as casting thin sections, high pressure mercury injection, scanning electron microscopy, Nu-clear magnetic resonance (NMR) testing, and a self-designed high-temperatures and high-pressures microscopic visualization displacement system. Three type cores with different pore structures were selected for the flooding experiments and the microscopic visualization displace-ment experiments, including CO2 immiscible flooding, near-miscible flooding, and miscible flood-ing after the conventional water flooding. The characteristics of CO2 flooding and the residual oil distribution after water flooding were quantitatively analyzed and evaluated. The results show that: (1) During the water flooding process, the oil produced from type I and type III samples mainly comes from large and some medium pores. Oil utilization of all pores is significant for type II samples. The physical properties and pore types have a greater impact on water flooding. Type I and II samples are more suitable for near-miscible flooding after water flooding. Type III samples are more suitable for miscible flooding after water flooding. (2) In the CO2 flooding, oil recovery increases gradually with increasing pressure for all three types of samples. Type II core samples have the highest recovery. Before miscibility, the oil recovered from type I and type II samples was primarily from large pores, however, the oil recovery mainly comes from medium pores when reaching miscibility. As for the type III samples, the oil produced in the immiscible state mainly comes from large and medium pores, and the enhanced oil recovery mainly comes from medium and small pores after reaching the near-miscible phase. (3) It can be seen from the microscopic re-sidual oil distribution that oil recovery will increase as the petrophysical properties of the rock model improve. The oil recovery of near-miscible flooding after water flooding regarding the type II model is up to 68.11%. The oil recovery of miscible flooding after water flooding about type III model is the highest at 74.57%. With increasing pressure, the proportion of flake residual oil grad-ually decreases, while the proportion of droplet-like and film-like residual oil gradually increases. Type II samples have a relatively large percentage of reticulated residual oil in the near-miscible stage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5bed0e3818522eba8516eff14e1b61c15e97e0cfb39e6068b4a88d5cb709a30d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
