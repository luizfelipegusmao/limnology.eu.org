{"title":"Soil Health Management Using Artificial Intelligence for Smart Agriculture Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0605/v1","date":1725864193000,"content":"In the recent years, with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) traditional methods have seen a significant transformation in the agriculture sector, especially in soil management. Soil management involves practices that maintains and improves the physical, chemical as well as the biological properties of the soil. Soil health management is essential for both the environmental conservation and sustainable agriculture production, ensuring the soil productivity and functional aspects associated with the ecosystem. Soil health management is one of the most important aspects of agriculture and food production, hence preserving and enhancing the soil health is an essential factor for supporting agriculture. Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies with soil health management offers the potential to enhance agricultural sustainability, productivity, adapt to the climatic changes and resource constraints. The study of AI tools that can help improve soil health management by providing more accurate and efficient monitoring, analysis and decision-making capabilities. This paper studies the potential AI technologies including machine learning, robotics, and remote sensing in enhancing soil health, raising crop yields, and lowering environmental concerns by examining previous research and case studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1f9337704b86db13f4e14ff5696ec37c67312541ba87ecede433113b91c4fe9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
