{"title":"A Device-on-Chip Solution for Real-Time Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy Using FPGA","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0056/v1","date":1714544285000,"content":"Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a non-invasive technology for the evaluation of the blood perfusion in deep tissue. However, it requires high computational resources for data analysis which poses challenges in its implementation for real-time applications. To address the unmet need, we developed a novel device-on-chip solution that fully integrates all the necessary computational components needed for DCS. It takes the output of a photon detector and determines the blood flow index (BFI). It is implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip including a multi-tau correlator for the calculation of the temporal light intensity autocorrelation function and a DCS analyzer to perform the curve fitting operation that derives the BFI. The FPGA DCS system was evaluated against a lab-standard DCS system for both phantom and cuff-ischemia studies. The results indicate that the autocorrelation of the light correlation and BFI from both the FPGA DCS and the reference DCS matched well. Furthermore, the FPGA DCS system was able to achieve a measurement rate of 50 Hz and resolve pulsatile blood flow.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"737c09dcce1b6e1a4e4a4a7bcc24e0f5787b31db6201daeea45e207f77d0fb7b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
