{"title":"Large-Scale Solar Potential Analysis as a Use Case of Urban Digital Twins","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1310/v1","date":1716229013000,"content":"Solar radiation impacts diverse aspects of city life, such as harvesting energy with PV panels, passive heating of buildings in winter, cooling loads of air-conditioning systems in summer, and urban microclimate. Urban digital twins and 3D city models can support solar studies in the process of urban planning and provide valuable insights for data-driven decision support. This study examines the calculation of solar incident radiation at the city scale in Sofia using remote sensing data for the large shading context in a mountainous region and 3D vector building data. The building footprints and the terrain are preprocessed using GIS. The solar calculation uses a raytracing algorithm in 3D CAD at the city scale. To evaluate the performance, two cases were considered at the city and district scale, respectively. The total face count of meshes for the simulations constituted approximately 2 000 000 faces. 64379 roofs for the whole city and 4796 buildings for one district were selected. All calculations were performed in one batch and visualized in a 3D web platform. Using a 3D CAD environment establishes a seamless process of updating 3D models and simulations while preprocessing in GIS ensures working with large-scale datasets. The proposed method showed moderate computation time for both cases and could be extended to include reflected radiation and dense photogrammetric meshes in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ae80154ebae163a2c2f5f67d2d47e41f25646dbf20afcb807c4cd2eb4a2c0618","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
