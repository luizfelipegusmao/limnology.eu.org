{"title":"Development of Broad-Range Microbial Minimal Culture Medium for Lanthanide Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2036/v1","date":1719799175000,"content":"Rare Earth Elements (REE), also known as Lanthanides (Ln3+), are a group of 17 elements showing peculiar physical and chemical properties. Unlike technological applications, very little is known about the physiological role and toxicity of Ln3+ on biological systems, in particular on microorganisms (e.g., bacteria), which represent the most abundant domains on our planet. Up to now, very limited studies have been conducted due to Ln3+ precipitation with some anions commonly present in the culture media. Therefore, the development of a minimal medium is essential to allow the study of Ln3+-microbial interactions, limiting considerably the precipitation as insoluble salts. In this regard, a new minimal culture medium capable of solubilizing large amounts of Ln3+, and allowing the growth of different microbial taxa, was successfully developed. Assays have shown that the medium is capable of solubilizing Ln3+ up to 100 times more than other common culture media and allowed the growth of 63 bacteria and 5 fungi. The kinetic growth of one yeast and one gram-positive bacterium has been defined, proving to support superior growth and biomass compared to other commonly used minimal media. Moreover, the sensitivity and uptake/absorption of a Bacillus stratosphericus strain was tested, highlighting its capability to tolerate concentrations up to 10 mM of either Cerium, Gadolinium or Lanthanum and accumulate different quantities of the three.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7eac99474a1acabfba1a9776c57451f31e0f9fc22f96826981120debfb152894","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
