{"title":"Progression-Free Survival and Treatment-Free Interval in Head and Neck Cancer With Long-Term Response to Nivolumab: Timing of Active Discontinuation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1840/v1","date":1719391657000,"content":"The optimal timing for actively discontinuing immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in long-term responders with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) remains unresolved. We conducted a retrospective study of 246 patients with R/M HNSCC treated with nivolumab to determine the optimal timing to actively discontinue nivolumab therapy. We examined the point at which progression-free survival (PFS) plateaued in all cases. We compared the prognosis of 19 (7.7%) ongoing cases and 227 (92.3%) discontinued cases and analyzed treatment duration and treatment-free interval (TFI). The 6-year overall survival was 11.8% (median, 12.1), and the 6-year PFS was 15.3% (median, 3.0). The PFS curve remained stable for 3 years. The median duration of nivolumab treatment was 2.9 months (range, 0.03–81.9): Ongoing group, 41.8 (5.6–81.9); Decision group, 36.8 (4.0–70.1); Toxicity group, 30.6 (2.8–64.8); and progressive disease group, 2.0 (0.03–42.9). TFI in the Decision group was 15.1 months (0.6–61.6) and 30.6 months (2.8–64.8) in the Toxicity group. Limited number of long-term responders in R/M HNSCC cases treated with nivolumab exists. Given that PFS plateaued at 3 years, we propose that the optimal duration of treatment for this subset of patients is 3 years.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4e0def8e63caac6b586e33ae52a4f138f7cf7a0bd64616b48289529dcab9caf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
