Tolerance values (TV) derived from analyses of the relationship between species and their environment are considered to be more objective than those that rely on expert opinion. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to derive a generalized stressor gradient based on physicochemical characteristics and physical habitat quality and structure. Scores of the first principal component axis (PC1) were used to estimate TV for 37 fish species collected from 54 sites in the Karun River basin, Iran. PCA of 17 variables identified stressors that were influential such as total phosphate, total nitrogen, total coliform, and habitat and morphological score. The species were separated into three categories on the stressor gradient: sensitive (18.9%), semi-tolerant (48.6%), and tolerant species (32.4%). Based on these results we developed the Karun Fish Tolerance Index (KFTI) and demonstrated that it performed well in separating the least, moderate, and most disturbed sites in the study area. The discrimination efficiency of the KFTI was 82.5%, which makes it a robust management tool for the protection and conservation of streams and rivers in the Karun River watershed. TV developed here reflect objective characteristics of the sensitivity of fish species to the predominant stressors in the Karun and similar systems.</p>","author":"Mojgan Zare Shahraki, \nPejman Fathi, \nEisa Ebrahimi Dorche, \nJoseph Flotemersch, \nKaren Blocksom, \nJames Stribling, \nAndreas Bruder","siteTitle":"Wiley: River Research and Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"dd8f8dcb48cf1db6f6edba43098839a842d88bad9f088e9d186fa05ae3366ba7","entryHash":"2972b06f49f53ec7e477930e1f76f81edd16aadc962cb7ca59d4c7f6bf08293b","category":"Environment"}
