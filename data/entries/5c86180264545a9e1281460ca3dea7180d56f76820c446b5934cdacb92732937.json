{"title":"Nicotinamide Mononucleotide: Deciphering Metabolic Complexities for Improved Health Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1752/v1","date":1711628975000,"content":"Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a key NAD+ precursor, exhibits distinct metabolic characteristics and potential health benefits. Recent investigations underscore the pivotal role of gut bacteria and specialized uptake mechanisms in NMN metabolism. While human trials demonstrate NMN's safety and promising health outcomes, challenges persist. Variability in results is likely influenced by lifestyle, health conditions, and individual genetic and gut microbiota differences. Understanding how these factors affect NMN metabolism is crucial for personalized approaches and maximizing NMN's potential. Advances in delivery systems show promise for enhancing NMN bioavailability, but further understanding of optimal NAD+ levels and reliable measures of NMN's effects is necessary. This comprehensive approach is key to optimizing NMN's impact on human health and longevity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c86180264545a9e1281460ca3dea7180d56f76820c446b5934cdacb92732937","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
