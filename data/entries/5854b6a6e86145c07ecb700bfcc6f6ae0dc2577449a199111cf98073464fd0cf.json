Nanocomplexes Design And Characterization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1087/v1","date":1721020918000,"content":"The objective of the present contribution was to design and characterize resveratrol (RSV) and tocopherol (TOC) loaded 11S quinoa seed protein nanocomplexes. Firstly, molecular docking was performed to describe the probable binding sites between protein and ligands. Isothermal titration calorimetry allowed to obtain the thermodynamic parameters that described the molecular in-teractions between RSV or TOC with the protein. 11S globulin intrinsic fluorescence spectra showed a quenching effect exerted by RSV and TOC, demonstrating protein-bioactive compounds interactions. Stern-Volmer, Scatchard and FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer models application confirmed static quenching and allowed to obtain parameters that described the 11S-RSV or 11S-TOC complexation process. Secondly, protein aggregation induced by bioactive compounds interactions was confirmed by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy with diam-eters","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5854b6a6e86145c07ecb700bfcc6f6ae0dc2577449a199111cf98073464fd0cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
