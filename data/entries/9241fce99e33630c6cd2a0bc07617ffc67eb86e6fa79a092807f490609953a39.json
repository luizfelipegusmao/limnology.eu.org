{"title":"Recovery of electrical power from exhaust airâ€”role of vertical axis wind turbine","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14502?af=R","date":1729333399000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This article explores the potential of regeneration of power from unnatural wind sources with the help of vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT). Researchers are searching for urban as well as industrial wind sources, which can be useful as the natural wind source to obtain electrical energy and utilize it. The wind sources considered here are the exhaust of the cooling or ventilation fans used in buildings, industries, and other places. The Darrieus VAWT extracts wind power from the exhaust air and reduces the power consumption of the concerned electrical drives. These uncommon energy sources have an inherent capability to recover a significant amount of energy without polluting the environment with less payback period. Recovered energy can be suitably converted into electrical energy and may be fed back to the power grid without any pollution, thus minimizing the total energy consumption of the building and reducing the cost operations. A detailed study of experimental models with different types of assembly and turbine models is conducted here with power outputs and operational behaviors on the existing systems. Various parameters and factors for existing and new applications are in detail that show the system has no negative impact on regular operation.</p>","author":"Soumyadip Banerjee, \nTanmoy Maity","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"9241fce99e33630c6cd2a0bc07617ffc67eb86e6fa79a092807f490609953a39","category":"Environment"}
