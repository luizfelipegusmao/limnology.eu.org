The reproductive cycle of this particular insect occurs annually because of reproductive diapause, leading to inadequate utilization of available natural resources. Despite its considerable ecological importance, the precise mechanisms underlying diapause in <span>A. chinensis</span> are not yet well understood. In this study, we conducted an analysis of comparing the microRNA (miRNA) regulation in the diapause and non-diapause gonads of <span>A. chinensis</span> and identified 303 differentially expressed miRNAs, among which, compared with the diapause group, 76 miRNAs were upregulated and 227 miRNAs downregulated. The results, regarding the Enrichment analysis of miRNA-targeted genes, showed their involvement in several essential biological processes, such as lipid anabolism, energy metabolism, and gonadal growth. Interestingly, we observed that the ATP-binding cassette pathway is the only enriched pathway, demonstrating the capability of these targeted miRNAs to regulate the reproductive diapause of <span>A. chinensis</span> through the above essential pathway. The current study provided the role of gonadal miRNA expression in the control of reproductive diapause in <span>A. chinensis</span>, the specific regulatory mechanism behind this event remained unknown and needed more investigation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"41849e0e53b2830275f9797f02e9b8afbdc6b020cf7341bcb3aa7f1db8e414b8","category":"Environment"}
