{"title":"Investigation of Structural Changes in TiSiCN Powders During Mechanical Activation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0361/v1","date":1728144296000,"content":"In modern materials science and surface engineering, Reactive Plasma Spraying (RPS) occupies a key po-sition due to its ability to create high quality coatings with unique properties. However, the efficiency of this process is highly dependent on the physicochemical characteristics of the starting powder materials. Mechanical activation, as a pretreatment, can have a significant effect on the structure and reactivity of powders, thereby modifying and improving the RPS process. The present study focuses on analysing the changes that occur to powder materials after mechanical activation and their subsequent effects on the quality and performance of coatings produced by the RPS process. The study of these changes is of key importance for optimising the spraying process as well as developing new materials with improved methods. This is important not only to improve the efficiency of reactive plasma spraying technologies, but also to expand their applications in various industrial and scientific fields. Improved materials can be a decisive factor in increasing the productivity and prevalence of products, as well as creating new opportunities for innovation and development in various industries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d02ad32da43182ee728cb002448c18fa2ce3ce6e15dc5f256f4f18dfda6cb767","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
