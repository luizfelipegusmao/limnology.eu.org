{"title":"Application of Inorganic-Based Nanoparticles and Bionanomaterials as Biocompatible Scaffolds for Regenerative Medicine and Tissue Engineering: Current Advances and Developments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1495/v1","date":1726735821000,"content":"Regenerative medicine is an interdisciplinary field that combines stem cell technology and tissue engineering to replace or regenerate human cells, tissues, or organs and restore normal functions. The term 'regenerative medicine' was coined by William Haseltine at a 1999 conference on Lake Como. Since its inception in 1968, the field has offered clinical benefits for the regeneration, repair, and restoration of bones, skin, cartilage, neural tissue, and heart, as well as scaffold fabrication. Inorganic biomaterials play a crucial role in regenerative medicine, often surpassing traditional synthetic materials due to their adjustable intrinsic properties, such as size, topography, charge, and chemical stability. These properties enable a flexible cellular response within intracellular matrix environments and provide structural support for cell adhesion and tissue regeneration. Given the wide gamut of near-future potential applications of inorganic biomaterials, this article gives an overview of their emerging roles in stem cell regenerative research, tissue engineering, artificial skin and cartilage regeneration, neural nerve injuries, 3D bioprinting, and development of new inorganic bio-scaffolds. The review also addresses the challenges related to the clinical application and tissue compatibility of inorganic biomaterials, utilizing current state-of-the-art techniques.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"681012cf6ceea961367b1f1b0f698e5276cd2e776bff01069ae3be925b9043ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
