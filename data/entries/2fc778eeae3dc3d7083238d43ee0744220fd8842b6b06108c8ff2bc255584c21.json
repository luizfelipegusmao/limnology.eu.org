{"title":"The Funding Puzzle in Adult Education for Sustainable Development: Case Study of Slovenia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0302/v1","date":1722848057000,"content":"This study investigates the landscape of public funding for Adult Education for Sustainable Development (AESD) in Slovenia, focusing on the distribution, types of funding, and their impact on accessibility and quality. Using a mixed methods approach to understand the distribution, types of funding, and their impacts on accessibility and quality. Data were collected through an online questionnaire completed by 59 organizations providing non-formal AESD, alongside semi-structured interviews conducted with 12 representatives. Key findings reveal a significant disparity between operational funding and that designated for AESD implementation, with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) emerging as the primary recipients of public funds. Notably, project-based funding predominates, raising concerns about the sustainability of AESD programs due to its typically time-limited nature. Public funding is essential for ensuring program accessibility and quality, as it enables organizations to hire experts and enhance curricula. However, the reliance on project-based grants creates instability, complicating long-term planning and program effectiveness. The study underscores the need for systematic and continuous funding strategies to support AESD, highlighting the importance of a cross-sectoral approach to policymaking. Overall, the research elucidates the intricate relationship between funding distribution, program effectiveness, and the advancement of sustainable development education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2fc778eeae3dc3d7083238d43ee0744220fd8842b6b06108c8ff2bc255584c21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
