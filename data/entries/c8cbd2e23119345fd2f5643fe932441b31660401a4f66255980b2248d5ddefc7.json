{"title":"Modeling and Simulation of Event Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0261/v1","date":1719967780000,"content":"The advanced industrial systems are characterized by complex event-driven processes. The specification and computer analysis are illustrated by the common problem of a servo drive with the PWM controller. A mathematical model from the class of Cauchy problems with non-liner control logic is presented to resolve the task discussed. The designed model is performed in two stages: the mathematical model specification (modeling) and implementation (simulation). Two approaches to make a model specification are considered, the first one is the traditional structural technique, and the advanced method is based on the finite state machine paradigm. Structural and finite state software models are built in progressive simulation tools. Computer implementation of the software models of hybrid systems is performed using platform built-in libraries with numerical methods and algorithms for correct event detection. The results of computational experiments for transient processes of phase variables are qualitatively identical, that proves the adequacy of the developed models. The algorithm for asymptotic event detection is considered in detail. This technique demonstrated the best results by the one-sidedness criterion, which is explained by using the authorâ€™s algorithm for the integration step determining and the event function dynamics monitoring in the vicinity of the event limits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c8cbd2e23119345fd2f5643fe932441b31660401a4f66255980b2248d5ddefc7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
