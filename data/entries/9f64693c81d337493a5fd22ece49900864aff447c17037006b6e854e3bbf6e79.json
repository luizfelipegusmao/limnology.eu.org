We find a unique period aligning with high fishing and extreme climatic events that reduces overall diversity. Furthermore, we find an effect of sea surface temperature and El Nino events over diversity, providing an idea of how future oceans might develop based on the past.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The hadopelagic environment remains highly understudied due to the inherent difficulties in sampling at these depths. The use of sediment environmental DNA (eDNA) can overcome some of these restrictions as settled and preserved DNA represent an archive of the biological communities. We use sediment eDNA to assess changes in the community within one of the world's most productive open-ocean ecosystems: the Atacama Trench. The ecosystems around the Atacama Trench have been intensively fished and are affected by climate oscillations, but the understanding of potential impacts on the marine community is limited. We sampled five sites using sediment cores at water depths from 2400 to ~8000 m. The chronologies of the sedimentary record were determined using <sup>210</sup>Pb<sub>ex</sub>. Environmental DNA was extracted from core slices and metabarcoding was used to identify the eukaryote community using two separate primer pairs for different sections of the 18S rRNA gene (V9 and V7) effectively targeting pelagic taxa. The reconstructed communities were similar among markers and mainly composed of chordates and members of the Chromista kingdom. Alpha diversity was estimated for all sites in intervals of 15 years (from 1842 to 2018), showing a severe drop in biodiversity from 1970 to 1985 that aligns with one of the strongest known El Niño events and extensive fishing efforts during the time. We find a direct impact of sea surface temperature on the community composition over time. Fish and cnidarian read abundance was examined separately to determine whether fishing had a direct impact, but no direct relation was found. These results demonstrate that sediment eDNA can be a valuable emerging tool providing insight in historical perspectives on ecosystem developments. This study constitutes an important step toward an improved understanding of the importance of environmental and anthropogenic drivers in affecting open and deep ocean communities.</p>","author":"Diego Elihú Rivera Rosas, \nNathan R.
