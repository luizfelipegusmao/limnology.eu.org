{"title":"Burden of multidrug-resistant bacteria among HIV-positive individuals in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309418","date":1724680800000,"content":"<p>by Muluneh Assefa, Azanaw Amare, Mitkie Tigabie, Getu Girmay, Abebaw Setegn, Yenesew Mihret Wondmagegn, Mebratu Tamir, Debaka Belete, Melak Aynalem, Teshome Belachew, Sirak Biset</p>\r\nBackground <p>Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are a significant cause of severe infections, particularly in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals because of their weakened immunity. Since there was no previous pooled representative data regarding the MDR bacteria among HIV-positive individuals in Ethiopia, this systematic review and meta-analysis is required.</p> Methods <p>This study was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A literature search was performed using PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Hinari, Web of Science, Science Direct, and African Journals Online databases. Data were extracted using Microsoft Excel 2019 and analyzed using STATA version 11.0 software. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size of outcome variables across studies with a 95% confidence interval. The I<sup>2</sup> statistic was used to check for heterogeneity. The presence of publication bias was determined using a funnel plot and Egger’s test with a p-value &lt; 0.05 evidence of statistically significant bias.</p> Results <p>The pooled prevalence of MDR was 58.02% (95% CI: 46.32–69.73%) with high heterogeneity (I2 = 97.1%, (p &lt; 0.001). In subgroup analysis, the highest multi-drug resistance was observed in the Oromia region (80.95%), patients with multiple infections (82.35%), and studies identified both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (61.45%). Furthermore, the pooled prevalence of MDR bacteria colonizing HIV-positive individuals was 48.76%. Regarding MDR species, <i>Enterococci</i> (77.41%) and <i>Pseudomonas spp</i>. (84.60%) were commonly identified in individuals with HIV infection.</p> Conclusion <p>Our study indicates a high burden of MDR among HIV-positive individuals in Ethiopia. The Oromia region, HIV patients with multiple infections, <i>Pseudomonas spp</i>., and <i>Enterococci</i> showed the highest MDR in the subgroup analysis. Therefore, regional hospitals should implement strategies to tackle MDR such as vaccination program, appropriate use of antibiotics, and further study on the associated factors of MDR bacteria in HIV are required.</p>","author":"Muluneh Assefa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6d731dc4bbf97c88b58eb721ffcfccb800e13fadca3b59b55097bbc804ee50a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
