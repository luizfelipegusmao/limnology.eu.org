{"title":"Deciphering prefrontal circuits underlying stress and depression: exploring the potential of volume electron microscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/73/5/391/7718991?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Adapting to environmental changes and formulating behavioral strategies are central to the nervous system, with the prefrontal cortex being crucial. Chronic stress impacts this region, leading to disorders including major depression. This review discusses the roles for prefrontal cortex and the effects of stress, highlighting similarities and differences between human/primates and rodent brains. Notably, the rodent medial prefrontal cortex is analogous to the human subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in terms of emotional regulation, sharing similarities in cytoarchitecture and circuitry, while also performing cognitive functions similar to the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It has been shown that chronic stress induces atrophic changes in the rodent mPFC, which mirrors the atrophy observed in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of depression patients. However, the precise alterations in neural circuitry due to chronic stress are yet to be fully unraveled. The use of advanced imaging techniques, particularly volume electron microscopy, is emphasized as critical for the detailed examination of synaptic changes, providing a deeper understanding of stress and depression at the molecular, cellular and circuit levels. This approach offers invaluable insights into the alterations in neuronal circuits within the medial prefrontal cortex caused by chronic stress, significantly enriching our understanding of stress and depression pathologies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"ea2444336ef57ce9c33259475b88ee0bbdc26b4ae914661576fe73c530b0368c","category":"Environment"}
