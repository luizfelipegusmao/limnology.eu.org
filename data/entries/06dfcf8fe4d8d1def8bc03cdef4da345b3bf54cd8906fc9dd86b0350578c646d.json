{"title":"Asymmetric response emerges between creation and disintegration of force-bearing subcellular structures as revealed by percolation analysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ib/article/doi/10.1093/intbio/zyae012/7696519?rss=1","date":1718841600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cells dynamically remodel their internal structures by modulating the arrangement of actin filaments (AFs). In this process, individual AFs exhibit stochastic behavior without knowing the macroscopic higher-order structures they are meant to create or disintegrate, but the mechanism allowing for such stochastic process-driven remodeling of subcellular structures remains incompletely understood. Here we employ percolation theory to explore how AFs interacting only with neighboring ones without recognizing the overall configuration can nonetheless create a substantial structure referred to as stress fibers (SFs) at particular locations. We determined the interaction probabilities of AFs undergoing cellular tensional homeostasis, a fundamental property maintaining intracellular tension. We showed that the duration required for the creation of SFs is shortened by the increased amount of preexisting actin meshwork, while the disintegration occurs independently of the presence of actin meshwork, suggesting that the coexistence of tension-bearing and non-bearing elements allows cells to promptly transition to new states in accordance with transient environmental changes. The origin of this asymmetry between creation and disintegration, consistently observed in actual cells, is elucidated through a minimal model analysis by examining the intrinsic nature of mechano-signal transmission. Specifically, unlike the symmetric case involving biochemical communication, physical communication to sense environmental changes is facilitated <span>via</span> AFs under tension, while other free AFs dissociated from tension-bearing structures exhibit stochastic behavior. Thus, both the numerical and minimal models demonstrate the essence of intracellular percolation, in which macroscopic asymmetry observed at the cellular level emerges not from microscopic asymmetry in the interaction probabilities of individual molecules, but rather only as a consequence of the manner of the mechano-signal transmission. These results provide novel insights into the role of the mutual interplay between distinct subcellular structures with and without tension-bearing capability.<div><strong>Insight:</strong> Cells continuously remodel their internal elements or structural proteins in response to environmental changes. Despite the stochastic behavior of individual structural proteins, which lack awareness of the larger subcellular structures they are meant to create or disintegrate, this self-assembly process somehow occurs to enable adaptation to the environment. Here we demonstrated through percolation simulations and minimal model analyses that there is an asymmetry in the response between the creation and disintegration of subcellular structures, which can aid environmental adaptation. This asymmetry inherently arises from the nature of mechano-signal transmission through structural proteins, namely tension-mediated information exchange within cells, despite the stochastic behavior of individual proteins lacking asymmetric characters in themselves.</div></span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"08ec31a93e0a3f830088f3051f0870206dac7048d685312e4717ea0a4882ca75","entryHash":"06dfcf8fe4d8d1def8bc03cdef4da345b3bf54cd8906fc9dd86b0350578c646d","category":"Environment"}
