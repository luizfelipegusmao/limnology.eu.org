{"title":"HISTONE DEACETYLASE19 Controls Ovule Number Determination and Transmitting Tract Differentiation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2117/7462147?rss=1","date":1701907200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The gynoecium is critical for the reproduction of flowering plants as it contains the ovules and the tissues that foster pollen germination, growth, and guidance. These tissues, known as the reproductive tract (ReT), comprise the stigma, style, and transmitting tract (TT). The ReT and ovules originate from the carpel margin meristem (CMM) within the pistil. SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) is a key transcription factor for meristem formation and maintenance. In all above-ground meristems, including the CMM, local <span>STM</span> downregulation is required for organ formation. However, how this downregulation is achieved in the CMM is unknown. Here, we have studied the role of HISTONE DEACETYLASE 19 (HDA19) in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) during ovule and ReT differentiation based on the observation that the <span>hda19-3</span> mutant displays a reduced ovule number and fails to differentiate the TT properly. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting coupled with RNA-sequencing revealed that in the CMM of <span>hda19-3</span> mutants, genes promoting organ development are downregulated while meristematic markers, including <span>STM</span>, are upregulated. HDA19 was essential to downregulate <span>STM</span> in the CMM, thereby allowing ovule formation and TT differentiation. <span>STM</span> is ectopically expressed in <span>hda19-3</span> at intermediate stages of pistil development, and its downregulation by RNA interference alleviated the <span>hda19</span>-3 phenotype. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that <span>STM</span> is a direct target of HDA19 during pistil development and that the transcription factor SEEDSTICK is also required to regulate <span>STM</span> via histone acetylation. Thus, we identified factors required for the downregulation of <span>STM</span> in the CMM, which is necessary for organogenesis and tissue differentiation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"bcbf2e6b47c6b4a276b79d44a21e27250e3994507f60b3fb3f22e36cafc15758","category":"Environment"}
