{"title":"How do hydroelectric dams affect non-migratory fish?: genomic evidence for Cichla temensis (Perciformes: Cichlidae) in the Uatumã River, Amazonas, Brazil","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/biolinnean/blae078/7764566?rss=1","date":1726876800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Balbina hydroelectric dam was built in the 1980s on the Uatumã River to supply electricity to Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Its construction caused a drastic change to the alluvial landscape, forming a large, lentic, artificial reservoir rather than a previously dynamic river system. The objective of our research was to evaluate the impact of the hydroelectric dam on the microevolutionary processes of fish, taking as a model <span>Cichla temensis</span>, an iconic non-migratory fish from the Amazon, abundant in this ecosystem. We collected double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data and extracted single nucleotide polymorphisms, which we identified at neutral and adaptive loci, for subsequent analyses. The results showed that the connectivity of the population was affected historically by natural physical barriers, before the construction of the hydroelectric dam, recognizing two independent population units. We detected that the hydroelectric dam increased the differentiation between populations and affected the genetic diversity and effective population sizes, in addition to promoting a recent population expansion upstream of the dam, as a consequence of adaptation to the new environment. This study provides the first evidence that hydroelectric dams can promote local adaptation in some fish, such as non-migratory ones.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"9976bc947fab0ba64fa9b0bf4e1743d9c60ce475740e6de7868fdcecac1e6776","category":"Environment"}
