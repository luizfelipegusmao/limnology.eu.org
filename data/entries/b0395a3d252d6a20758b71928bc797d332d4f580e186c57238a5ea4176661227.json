{"title":"Comparative Effectiveness of Supervised and Home-based Rehabilitation after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Competitive Athletes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0734/v1","date":1710326216000,"content":"Background: After the increasingly common anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) procedure in competitive athletes, rehabilitation is crucial for facilitating a timely return to sports (RTS) and preventing re-injury. This pilot study investigates the biomechanical and psychological outcomes of postoperative rehabilitation in competitive athletes, comparing supervised rehabilita-tion (SVR) and home-based rehabilitation (HBR). Methods: After ACLR, 60 (out of 74 screened) athletes were recruited and equally divided into 2 groups using non-probability convenience sam-pling: 30 HBR and 30 SVR (each group comprising 15 males and 15 females). Rehabilitation out-comes in respective groups were evaluated at 8 months using measures (Tegner-Activity-Scale [TAS], International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form [IKDC-SKF], ACL Return to Sport after Injury [ACL-RSI]) and objective parameters (isometric muscle strength, hamstring/quadriceps asymmetry). RTS was evaluated at 9 months; with ACL re-injury rates rec-orded approximately 6 months post-RTS. Results: Both groups exhibited decreased TAS scores (HBR: 8 to 6, SVR: 8 to 7), with the SVR group demonstrating superior post-operative IKDC-SKF scores (81.82 vs. 68.43) and lower ACL-RSI scores (49.46 vs. 55.25). Isometric and isokinetic mus-cle strength, along with asymmetry values, favored the SVR group 8 months post-ACLR (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0395a3d252d6a20758b71928bc797d332d4f580e186c57238a5ea4176661227","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
