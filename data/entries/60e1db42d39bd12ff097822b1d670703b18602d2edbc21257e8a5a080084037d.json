{"title":"Natural variation in LONELY GUY-Like 1 regulates rice grain weight under warmer night conditions","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/164/7686082?rss=1","date":1717113600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Global nighttime temperatures are rising at twice the rate of daytime temperatures and pose a challenge for rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) production. High nighttime temperature (HNT) stress affects rice yield by reducing grain weight, size, and fertility. Although the genes associated with these yield parameters have been identified and characterized under normal temperatures, the genetic basis of grain weight regulation under HNT stress remains less explored. We examined the natural variation for rice single grain weight (SGW) under HNT stress imposed during grain development. A genome-wide association analysis identified several loci associated with grain weight under HNT stress. A locus, <span>SGW1</span>, specific to HNT conditions resolved to <span>LONELY GUY-Like 1</span> (<span>LOGL1</span>), which encodes a putative cytokinin-activation enzyme. We demonstrated that <span>LOGL1</span> contributes to allelic variation at <span>SGW1</span>. Accessions with lower <span>LOGL1</span> transcript abundance had higher grain weight under HNT. This was supported by the higher grain weight of <span>logl1</span>-mutants relative to the wild type under HNT. Compared to <span>logl1</span>-mutants, <span>LOGL1</span> over-expressers showed increased sensitivity to HNT. We showed that LOGL1 regulates the thiamin biosynthesis pathway, which is under circadian regulation, which in turn is likely perturbed by HNT stress. These findings provide a genetic source to enhance rice adaptation to warming night temperatures and improve our mechanistic understanding of HNT stress tolerance pathways.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"60e1db42d39bd12ff097822b1d670703b18602d2edbc21257e8a5a080084037d","category":"Environment"}
