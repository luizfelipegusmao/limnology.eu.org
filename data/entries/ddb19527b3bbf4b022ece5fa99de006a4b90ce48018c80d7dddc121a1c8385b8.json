{"title":"Conversion of Atmospheric Gases into Glucose Using Solar Energy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1284/v1","date":1724062527000,"content":"This ambitious research project seeks to revolutionize sustainable glucose production by harnessing solar energy for the conversion of atmospheric gases. The process involves water collection, electrolysis for hydrogen and oxygen production, PDMS membrane-based CO2 collection, CO2 splitting, formaldehyde generation, and the synthesis of glucose/sucrose. Key innovations include the strategic application of PDMS membranes with varying pore sizes and non-reactive chemical layers to facilitate selective permeability for specific gases. Our goal is to create a cost-effective, eco-friendly glucose production method, paving the way for renewable and sustainable energy solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ddb19527b3bbf4b022ece5fa99de006a4b90ce48018c80d7dddc121a1c8385b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
