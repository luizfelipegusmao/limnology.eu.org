{"title":"Alloantibody Identification: The Importance of Temperature, Strength Reaction and Enzymes&mdash;A Pratical Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1146/v1","date":1728970194000,"content":"Red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization and antibodies formation against non-self-antigen on red cells may occur after blood transfusion, pregnancies or other exposures. The RBC alloimmunization rates varies from 2% to 6% according to recent studies. The antibody screen is performed to identify or confirm the presence of antibodies in patientâ€™s serum or plasma, as a preoperative or pretransfusion tests. The antibody identification process and major crossmatch are provided to improve the safety of red blood transfusion administration. I report three examples associated with clinically significant single and multiple alloantibodies. Ultimately, I summarize key points for a clinical transfusion practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e207ca62685b9057e6c6c50b79506bb8d7fb664b239839e5517551e601c2ad0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
