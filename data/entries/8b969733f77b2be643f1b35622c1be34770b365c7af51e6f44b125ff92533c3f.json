NIES-4101 (NIES-4101), the four genes essential for nitrogen fixation (<span>nifB, nifH, nifD</span> and <span>nifK</span>) are highly fragmented into 13 parts in a 350-kb chromosomal region, and four of these parts are encoded in the reverse strand. Such a complex fragmentation feature makes it difficult to restore the intact <span>nifBHDK</span> genes by the excision mechanism found in the <span>nifD</span> gene of the <span>Anabaena</span> sp. PCC 7120 heterocyst. To examine the nitrogen-fixing ability of NIES-4101, we confirmed that NIES-4101 grew well on a combined nitrogen-free medium and showed high nitrogenase activity, which strongly suggested that the complete <span>nifBHDK</span> genes are restored by a complex recombination process in heterocysts. Next, we resequenced the genome prepared from cells grown under nitrogen-fixing conditions. Two contigs covering the complete <span>nifHDK</span> and <span>nifB</span> genes were found by <span>de novo</span> assembly of the sequencing reads. In addition, the DNA fragments covering the <span>nifBHDK</span> operon were successfully amplified by PCR. We propose that the process of <span>nifBHDK</span> restoration occurs as follows. First, the <span>nifDâ€“nifK</span> genes are restored by four excision events. Then, the complete <span>nifH</span> and <span>nifB</span> genes are restored by two excision events followed by two successive inversion events between the inverted repeat sequences and one excision event, forming the functional <span>nif</span> gene cluster, <span>nifB-fdxN-nifS-nifU-nifH-nifD-nifK</span>. All genes coding recombinases responsible for these nine recombination events are located close to the terminal repeat sequences. The restoration of the <span>nifBHDK</span> genes in NIES-4101 is the most complex genome reorganization reported in heterocystous cyanobacteria.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"8b969733f77b2be643f1b35622c1be34770b365c7af51e6f44b125ff92533c3f","category":"Environment"}
