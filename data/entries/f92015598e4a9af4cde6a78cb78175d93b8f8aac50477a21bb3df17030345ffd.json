{"title":"Trends and determinants of clustering for non-communicable disease risk factors in women of reproductive age in Nepal","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309322","date":1727877600000,"content":"<p>by Barun Kumar Singh, Shiva Raj Mishra, Resham B. Khatri</p>\r\nBackground <p>Understanding the clustering of two or more risk factors of non-communicable disease, such as smoking, overweight/obesity, and hypertension, among women of reproductive age could facilitate the design and implementation of strategies for prevention and control measures. This study examined the factors associated with smoking, overweight/obesity, and hypertension among Nepalese women of reproductive age (15–49 years).</p> Methods <p>This study used the Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS) 2016 (6,079 women for smoking and overweight/obesity, 6076 for hypertension) and 2022 (6,957 women for overweight/obesity and smoking status and 3,749 women for hypertension) for comparison of trends of NCD risk factors among women aged 15–49 years. Additionally, for each participant, risk factors score (range of 0 to 3) was created by summing individual risk factors. We assessed the determinants of risk factor clustering using multivariable Poisson regression models with robust sandwich variance estimator to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios using NDHS 2022.</p> Results <p>The national prevalence of overweight/obesity increased from 22.2% in 2016 to 29.2% in 2022 among women of reproductive age. In 2022, the prevalence for smoking, overweight/obesity, and hypertension were 3.8%, 29.2%, and 9.6%, respectively. More than one in four women (28.7%) had one NCD risk factor, while 6.5% had two such risk factors. Higher aged women (40–49 years) were more likely to have multiple NCD risk factors than those aged 15–29 years (APR: 3.19; 95% CI: 2.68–3.80). Those in the richest wealth quintile (APR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.24–1.85), as well as married (APR: 3.02; 95% CI: 2.43–3.76) and widowed/divorced (APR: 2.85; 95% CI: 2.14–3.80) were more likely to have multiple NCD risk factors. Women from Koshi province (APR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.41–2.15) had more NCD risk factors than those from the Sudurpaschim province. Working women also had a higher prevalence of NCD risk factors compared to non-working women (APR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.06–1.43). Additionally, Hill Janajatis (APR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.21–1.72) and Dalits (APR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.15–1.75) women were more likely to have NCD risk factors compared to women of Brahmin hill origin.</p> Conclusions <p>Clustering of two or more NCD risk factors was higher among women aged ≥30 years, those who are currently married or widowed/divorced/separated, working women, and individuals from the wealthiest socioeconomic groups. A higher burden of risk factors underscores the importance of targeted public health interventions, particularly among women from advantaged socio-economic groups, those of affluent regions, and in the workplace.</p>","author":"Barun Kumar Singh","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f92015598e4a9af4cde6a78cb78175d93b8f8aac50477a21bb3df17030345ffd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
