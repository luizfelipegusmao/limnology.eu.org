{"title":"89 Improving cattle grazing efficiency with multi-functional cover crops","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/30/7617985?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Grazing cool-season cover crops provides a sustainable way of extending the grazing season and reducing the impact row-crop farming systems on the environment. Cover crops promote soil health; however, the impacts of grazing cover crops on soil health in the Southeast are not well understood. The objective of the current study was to determine the effects of different cover crop mixtures on a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)-peanut (Arachis hypogaea) cropping system. The experiment consisted of 18 paddocks, planted in mixtures of grass [‘Coker’ oat (Avena sativa)], grass + legume [‘Dixie’ crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum)], or grass + legume + brassica [(‘T-raptor’ brassica (Brassica napus × B. rapa)] planted at the Wiregrass Research and Extension Center (Headland, AL). Paddocks were randomly allocated to grazed or not grazed (n = 3). Grazed paddocks were grazed with yearling beef steers (266 ± 44 kg) using the put and take method to maintain a forage alloance of 1 kg DM per kg BW. Forage samples were collected every 2 wk, for biomass, botanical compositions, and nutritive value. Paddocks were grazed from 17 Jan – 22 Mar 2023 (65 d) and steer BW were taken at the beginning and end of the grazing season for calculation of average daily gain Data were analyzed using Proc Glimmix of SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with forage sampling date considered a repeated measure. No difference in steer average daily gain was detected among grazed treatments (1.5 kg/d; P &gt; 0.44). Cover crop (forage) biomass was also not different among all grazed and ungrazed treatments (1,097 kg DM/ha; P = 0.56). According to the results, grazing cool-season annual cover crops may reduce the supplementation required to maintain cattle through the winter months in the Southeast.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"5589c932a8a1f967a1309ec1464fc84d9e6413bf0ec7ba316b6876727203bbb9","category":"Environment"}
