{"title":"Review of the Role of Mitochondria in the Actions of Nitroglycerin and Redox Disturbances Underlying Diseases It Treats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2331/v1","date":1722258368000,"content":"ABSTRACT\n\n                   The purpose of this paper is to review the involvement of mitochondria in the\n actions of nitroglycerin (glycerol trinitrate -GTN) and the redox disturbances underlying\n diseases it treats. The paper begins by explaining complex I as the initial site of formation\n of superoxide and the process whereby it leads to the development of glutathione dependent\n tolerance. Next, the paper describes new formulations for preventing tolerance. The paper\n ends by illustrating diseases that may benefit from treatment with novel glutathione based\n GTN formulations and treatment approaches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15d23ba4e9b6d1a9d39e9d1f5c0133bade8ac3e50784697ee1cd2c494f3d3049","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
