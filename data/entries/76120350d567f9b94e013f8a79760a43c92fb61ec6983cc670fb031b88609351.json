{"title":"Does Farm wage Influence Gender gap in Household Welfare? A Microlevel Evidence from Nigeria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1412/v1","date":1718882707000,"content":"Few studies have explored the gender wage gap among farmworkers, and there is a notable absence of research on how farm wages impact household welfare differently based on gender. This study aims to fill this gap by examining how farm wages affect gender disparities in household welfare among farmworkers in Nigeria. Using survey data from 720 farmworkers, we investigated gender-based differences in household welfare. Our approach combined parametric methods (Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition) to assess gender gaps in household welfare and non-parametric techniques (Propensity Score Matching, PSM) to estimate the effects of farm wages. The analysis reveals that female farmworkers experience significantly lower per capita food consumption expenditure (₦11,486.51 less) compared to their male counterparts. These disparities partly stem from differences in socioeconomic factors, job characteristics, and enterprise attributes between male and female farmworkers. The study underscores the role of farm wages in mitigating gender gaps in household welfare, demonstrating that farm wages have increased per capita food consumption expenditure for female farmworkers by ₦6,640.698. This finding highlights the potential of wage increases to enhance livelihoods, underscoring the importance of equitable wage policies in farming. Furthermore, our findings emphasize that the impact of farm wages on welfare varies with household characteristics, suggesting the need for targeted interventions tailored to enhance identified household attributes. Addressing these factors could effectively reduce gender inequalities in farm work and contribute to overall welfare improvements.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76120350d567f9b94e013f8a79760a43c92fb61ec6983cc670fb031b88609351","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
