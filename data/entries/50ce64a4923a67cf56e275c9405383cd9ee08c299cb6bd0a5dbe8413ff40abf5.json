{"title":"A New AI Dialogue Framework with ChatGPT: Exploring Synthetic Man within the Context of Synthetic Biology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1468/v1","date":1713871007000,"content":"The article explores the concept of 'synthetic man' (SM) in the context of 'synthetic biology' (SB), analysing the potential, challenges, and ethical implications of these achievements. Through dialogue with ChatGPT 4, an in-depth understanding of the evolution, contributions of SM, ChatGPT's contribution, and concerns associated with SM is sought, providing insight into how this technology could affect our society.\nOur study uses a structured dialogue framework with ChatGPT that addresses essential SM questions regarding SM history, contributions, challenges, and concerns. ChatGPT responses are analysed to extract relevant information and identify trends and insights. The ChatGPT dialogue reveals that MS is still a theoretical and speculative concept with significant advances in gene therapy and genetic engineering. The potential contributions of SM in addressing global challenges such as health, environment and education are identified. Ethical and social concerns such as health risks and psychological impact are also highlighted. Differences in ChatGPT responses were observed between different sessions or even within the same session, which highlighted the limitations in the replicability of the research and sometimes the need for clarification of the questions.\nThe article is distinguished by its unique approach of using an advanced language model to explore a complex and speculative topic. The LLM Dialogue Framework on Technology (LLM-DFonTech) framework proposal for structured dialogue with ChatGPT on various technological topics related to the original contribution provides an adaptable tool for interdisciplinary research in emerging technologies. This methodology opens up new possibilities for analyzing and developing trends in technology and society.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50ce64a4923a67cf56e275c9405383cd9ee08c299cb6bd0a5dbe8413ff40abf5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
