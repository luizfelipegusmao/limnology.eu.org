{"title":"An Anti-Mouse CXCR5 Monoclonal Antibody (Cx5Mab-3) Shows High Affinity for Flow Cytometry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0497/v1","date":1728370446000,"content":"The CXC chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family that is highly expressed in B cells and a subset of T cells such as T follicular helper cells. Various types of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer also express CXCR5; therefore, antibodies that specifically bind to CXCR5 could be useful for clarification of the mechanisms of cancer progression. In this study, we aimed to develop high-affinity monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for flow cytometry against mouse CXCR5 (mCXCR5). The established anti-mCXCR5 mAb, Cx5Mab-3 (rat IgG2b, kappa), reacted with mCXCR5-overexpressed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 (CHO/mCXCR5) by flow cytometry. Kinetic analyses using flow cytometry indicated that the dissociation constants (KD) of Cx5Mab-3 for CHO/mCXCR5 is 7.2 × 10−10 M, indicating that Cx5Mab-3 is useful for detecting mCXCR5 by flow cytometry with high affinity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e292d92ba69e54549568a73cc9048f2f83bcf1ef4ecf0206173e6d5ccb8f991","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
