Using mountain pass theorem together with Ekeland's variational principle, we prove, under appropriate conditions on the functions involved, that the problem admits at least two solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9db0782a5d9c4d70c86473a8f4fe3108c7ea96355ef92c162bbe2e879b10f55f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
