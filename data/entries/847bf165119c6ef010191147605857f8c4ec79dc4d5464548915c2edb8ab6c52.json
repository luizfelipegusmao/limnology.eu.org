{"title":"Effect of crosslinking/antioxidant agents as final irrigant on the fracture resistance of endodontically treated root after radiotherapy","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311132","date":1729173600000,"content":"<p>by Maryam S. Tavangar, Fereshteh Shafiei, Sepehr Eslami Pirharati, Mohsen Bakhshandeh, Yasamin Ghahramani</p>\r\nAim <p>To investigate the effects of Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and curcumin, as a final irrigant on the fracture resistance of irradiated root that obturated with an epoxy resin sealer.</p> Methodology <p>Eighty mandibular premolars were randomly divided into non-irradiated (NIR) and irradiated (IR) groups. The teeth were irradiated at 2 Gy per fraction, 5 times a week for a total dose of 60 Gy over 6 weeks. All specimens were decoronated, remaining 13±1 mm root length. Two groups were subdivided into four groups (n = 10): 1) non-instrumented; the intact root served as control. The other roots were instrumented with a pro-taper NiTi rotary system. The final irrigation used was 17% EDTA, followed by three irrigation solution groups; 2) 2.5% NaOCl, 3) 0.02% EGCG, and 4) 0.1% curcumin. Root canals were filled with gutta-percha and AH plus. All specimens were embedded in self-curing acrylic resin and loaded vertically at 1 mm/min until fracture occurred. Also, sealer penetration was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The data were evaluated statistically using two-way ANOVA and Tukey test (α = 0.05).</p> Results <p>In irradiated roots, fracture resistance of EGCG and curcumin groups did not differ from non-instrumented roots, but they were higher than the NaOCl group (P = 0.006). However, NaOCl, EGCG, and curcumin in irradiated roots had comparable strength that was higher than in the non-instrumented group (p&lt;0.001). Difference between irradiated and non-irradiated roots was observed only for NaOCl and non-instrumented groups (P≤0.004). In irradiated roots, a higher sealer penetration was observed in EGCG and curcumin groups compared to NaOCl.</p> Conclusion <p>EGCG and curcumin could be promising final irrigants to reverse the adverse effect of radiotherapy on the strength of irradiated roots obturated with AH Plus sealer.</p>","author":"Maryam S.
