Both cohorts were obtained from 6 hospitals across Catalonia, Spain, from April 2020 to April 2022. The primary outcome was large for gestational age rate at birth. Secondary outcomes were composite adverse outcomes including pregnancy complications, delivery complications, and neonatal complications. Cost differences between screening methods were also evaluated. A similar analysis was performed in the subgroup diagnosed with GDM.\n\nResults: Data were collected from 1,543 pregnant individuals in the standard screening group and 2,197 in the alternative screening group. The standard screening group had a higher GDM diagnostic rate than the alternative screening group (10.8% vs 6.9%, respectively; p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a1cecee8a91abfb4892500319277f8492c408ef45216df9d33a9c9da865b884","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
