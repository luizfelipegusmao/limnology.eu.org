{"title":"Commodity WiFi-Based Wireless Sensing Advancements over the Past 5 Years","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0789/v1","date":1723450328000,"content":"With the compelling popularity of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), WiFi sensing has drawn increasing attention in recent years. Starting from 2010, WiFi CSI-based wireless sensing has enabled various exciting applications such as indoor localization, target imaging, activity recognition and vital sign monitoring. In this paper, we retrospect the up-to-date achievements of WiFi sensing using commodity-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices over the past 5 years in detail. Specifically, this paper first presents the background of CSI signal and related sensing models. Then, recent researches are categorized from two perspectives, namely according to their application scenario diversity and corresponding sensing methodology difference respectively. Next, this paper points out the challenges faced by WiFi sensing including domain dependency and sensing range limitation. Finally, three imperative research directions are highlighted, which are critical for realizing more ubiquitous and practical WiFi sensing in real-life applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"897d8302417b4ab48c196f37a598c8842dc66625dcd128cef6b0ee5a79f12e90","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
