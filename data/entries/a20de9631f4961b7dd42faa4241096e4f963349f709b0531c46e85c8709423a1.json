{"title":"Diagnostic Modalities in the Detection of Cardiac Amyloidosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0627/v1","date":1712647930000,"content":"Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) results mainly from infiltration of myocardium by either immunoglobulin light chain fibrils (AL) or transthyretin fibrils (ATTR), causing restrictive cardiomyopathy and eventually death if untreated (3). AL derives from monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain produced by plasma cell clone in the bone marrow, while ATTR is the misfolded form of hepatically-derived transthyretin (TTR) protein, and could be hereditary (hATTR) or wild-type (wtATTR). Over the last decade, improvement in diagnostic imaging and better clinical awareness has unleashed a notable presence of CA in the community, especially ATTR in the elderly population. These multimodality imaging modalities include echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance and radionuclide scintigraphy with bone-avid tracers. There has been remarkable progress in the therapeutic landscape as well, and there are disease-modifying therapies available now that can alter the course of the disease and improve survival if initiated at an early stage in the disease. There remains an unmet need for detecting this disease accurately and early, so that these patients could benefit the most from newly-emerging therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a20de9631f4961b7dd42faa4241096e4f963349f709b0531c46e85c8709423a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
