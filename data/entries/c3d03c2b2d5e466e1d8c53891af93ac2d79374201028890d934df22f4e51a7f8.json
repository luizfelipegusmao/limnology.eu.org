{"title":"A dual regulatory role for the arbuscular mycorrhizal master regulator RAM1 in tomato","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/5021/7668065?rss=1","date":1715299200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The REQUIRED FOR ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZATION1 (RAM1) transcription factor from the GRAS family is well known for its role as a master regulator of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis in dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species, being essential in transcriptional reprogramming for the development and functionality of the arbuscules. In tomato, <span>SlGRAS27</span> is the putative orthologue of <span>RAM1</span> (here named <span>SlRAM1</span>), but has not yet been characterized. A reduced colonization of the root and impaired arbuscule formation were observed in <span>SlRAM1</span>-silenced plants, confirming the functional conservation of the RAM1 orthologue in tomato. However, unexpectedly, <span>SlRAM1</span>-overexpressing (<span>UBIL:SlRAM1</span>) plants also showed decreased mycorrhizal colonization. Analysis of non-mycorrhizal <span>UBIL:SlRAM1</span> roots revealed an overall regulation of AM-related genes and a reduction of strigolactone biosynthesis. Moreover, external application of the strigolactone analogue GR24<sup>4DO</sup> almost completely reversed the negative effects of <span>SlRAM1</span> overexpression on the frequency of mycorrhization. However, it only partially recovered the pattern of arbuscule distribution observed in control plants. Our results strongly suggest that SlRAM1 has a dual regulatory role during mycorrhization and, in addition to its recognized action as a positive regulator of arbuscule development, it is also involved in different mechanisms for the negative regulation of mycorrhization, including the repression of strigolactone biosynthesis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"c3d03c2b2d5e466e1d8c53891af93ac2d79374201028890d934df22f4e51a7f8","category":"Environment"}
