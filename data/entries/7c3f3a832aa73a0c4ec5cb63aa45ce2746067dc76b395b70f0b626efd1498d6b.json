At the Pacific Northwest Center for Cryo-EM (PNCC), we aim to train researchers in sample preparation, screening, single-particle (SPA) data collection, and data processing [<a href=\"#ozae044.445-B1\">1</a>]. Our goal is that following completion of our programs, researchers can perform these workflows independently, either on PNCC instruments or at their local cryo-EM facilities. In order to achieve this goal, we employ strategic methods to effectively communicate ideas from biochemistry, physics, electron optics, and data analysis to researchers with varying degrees of familiarity and expertise in each of these disciplines.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7c3f3a832aa73a0c4ec5cb63aa45ce2746067dc76b395b70f0b626efd1498d6b","category":"Environment"}
