{"title":"An Improved Sum Peak Removal Method for EDS Analysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.095/7719519?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (hereafter, EDS) is a microanalytical technique in which X-rays that are generated by an electron beam interacting with a sample in an electron microscope are detected and processed into spectra. Ideally, an EDS spectrum would consist of a background—the Bremsstrahlung (or braking radiation)—and peaks representing the characteristic X-rays from the elements present in the sample. However, depending on a variety of factors, peaks that do not directly represent elemental characteristic X-rays may appear in EDS spectra. Examples of such peaks are escape peaks and sum peaks. These unwanted peaks result from and confound the analysis of both low- and high-Z elements. This paper describes sum peaks, problems with previous methods of sum peak removal, and a new method for sum peak removal.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f81927da79fa75f594bdb707b4e6cceb1c609fc286d9d491c68f8038dbb0d003","category":"Environment"}
