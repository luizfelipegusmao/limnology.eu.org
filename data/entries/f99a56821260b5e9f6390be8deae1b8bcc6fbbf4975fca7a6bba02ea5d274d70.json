{"title":"Optimization of a Dynamic Supply Chain Network: Kinetic Modeling of E-Waste Plants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0774/v1","date":1715581623000,"content":"E-waste management (EWM) refers to the operation-management of discarded or unproductive electronic devices and components, a challenge exacerbated due to overindulgent urbanization. This article presents a multidimensional cost-function-based analysis of the EWM framework structured on three modules - environmental, economic, and social uncertainties - which contemplate the 3 pillars of sustainability in an e-waste recycling plant, including the production-delivery-utilization process. The framework incorporates material recovery from a single e-waste facility provisioning for chemical and mechanical recycling. Each module is ranked using independent Machine Learning (ML) protocols: a) Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and b) combined AHP and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). From a long list of possible contributors, the model identifies and ranks two key sustainability contributors to the EWM supply chain: overall energy consumption and volume of carbon dioxide generated. Another key finding is a precise time window for policy resurrection, which for the data considered, happens to be 400-600 days from the start of operation. Another interesting outcome is the quality of prediction using a combination of AHP and PCA, which consistently produced better results than any of these ML methods individually implemented. Model outcomes have been verified using a case study to outline a future E-waste sustained roadmap.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f99a56821260b5e9f6390be8deae1b8bcc6fbbf4975fca7a6bba02ea5d274d70","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
