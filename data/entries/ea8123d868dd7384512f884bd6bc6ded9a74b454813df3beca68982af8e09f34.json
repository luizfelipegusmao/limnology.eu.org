Nonetheless, there are limited techniques available to directly investigate the surface atom configurations of nanoparticles, particularly under realistic chemical environments. In this study, we introduce a novel microscopic approach, termed \"atom-resolved secondary electron (SE) imaging technique\" in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), to examine the complete oxygen coverage on metallic Fe nanoparticles and elucidate a atom configuration of surface oxide on the (111) surface of Î³-Fe nanoparticles. Employing atom-resolved secondary electron (SE) imaging and other microscopic tools, we reveal its single-layered honeycomb feature of 2D iron oxide over the metallic nanoparticles, providing an insightful understanding of the surface properties of iron materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ea8123d868dd7384512f884bd6bc6ded9a74b454813df3beca68982af8e09f34","category":"Environment"}
