{"title":"Effect of Preheating on Mechanical Properties of AISI 1037 and AISI 304 Welded Joints Using SMAW","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1847/v1","date":1729705400000,"content":"AISI 1037 and AISI 304 steels are widely used across various industrial sectors, including manufacturing, transportation, petrochemical, and automotive industries. In this study, the effect of preheating on the toughness of dissimilar welded joints between AISI 1037 and AISI 304, joined by Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW) using E309-16 electrodes, was investigated. The preheating process was performed prior to welding, and its influence on the joint's toughness was assessed through impact testing. Additionally, the hardness profile across the welded joint was evaluated using hardness testing. Macrostructure and microstructure examinations were conducted using an optical microscope and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyse the fracture surfaces and microstructural evolution of the welded joints. The experimental results revealed that the impact strength increased as the preheating temperature was elevated. The highest hardness value, recorded in the fusion zone, reached 313 VHN. Compared to joints welded without preheating, the impact strength of the preheated welded joints significantly improved, with a notable transition in fracture mode from brittle to ductile behaviour. This indicates that the preheating process plays a critical role in enhancing the toughness and mechanical properties of dissimilar welded joints.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30347ddefade4d7e3bd3a7cbe3c2902036a14f32ee468dbfbf123a4b4f994a7d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
