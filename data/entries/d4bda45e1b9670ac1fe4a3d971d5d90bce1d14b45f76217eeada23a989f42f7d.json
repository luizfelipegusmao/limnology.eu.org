{"title":"Clinical and Diagnostic Features of Post-Acute COVID-19 Vaccination Syndrome (PACVS)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0848/v1","date":1718195765000,"content":"Post-acute COVID-19 vaccination syndrome (PACVS) is distinguished from the normal post-vaccination state by altered receptor antibodies (Semmler et al. Vaccines 2023, 11, 1642). Here, we explore the symptoms registry and standard serum markers acquired in the above study to delineate the disease phenotype of PACVS. Symptoms reported by the participants overlapped with established complex dysautonomia syndromes (ME/CFS, POTS, MCAS, SFN). However, many participants were qualified for several (131/191) or none (31/191) of these syndromes. Unbiased clustering (modified Jaccard index) revealed a prevalent cross-cohort symptomatology of malaise and chronic fatigue (&amp;gt; 80% of cases). Overlapping clusters of (i) peripheral nerve dysfunction, dysesthesia, motor weakness, pain, vasomotor dysfunction, (ii) cardiovascular impairment, and (iii) cognitive impairment, headache, optic, oculo-motoric and acoustic dysfunctions were also frequently represented. Conspicuous serum markers encompassed increases in interleukins 6 and 8 and low fT3 levels (&amp;gt; 80%), IgG-subclass imbalances and impaired iron-storage (&amp;gt; 50%), and increases in sNFL (&amp;gt; 30%). Serum markers were not correlated to specific symptoms or symptom clusters. A single and unique cause (i. e. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination) is improbable to trigger several distinct etiologies. Therefore, the symptoms and serological features observed in our study cohort probably represent facets of a single complex syndrome.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4bda45e1b9670ac1fe4a3d971d5d90bce1d14b45f76217eeada23a989f42f7d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
