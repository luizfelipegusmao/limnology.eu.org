{"title":"Computational Fluid Dynamic Optimization of Micropatterned Surfaces: Towards Biofunctionalization of Artificial Organs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0108/v1","date":1727858831000,"content":"Modifying surface topography to prevent surface-induced thrombosis in cardiovascular implants allows endothelialization, which is the natural thrombo-resistance of the blood-contacting surfaces and is deemed to be the only long-term hemocompatible material. We have adapted a simulation framework to predict platelet deposition on the modified surface and developed an optimization strategy to promote endothelial retention and limit platelet deposition. Under supraphysiological bulk shear stress, a maximum of 79% linear coverage was achieved. This study concludes that the addition of microtrenches promotes endothelial retention and can be improved through optimal selection of geometric parameters.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3e09688e9364d9274d81800e1183bafb00c18a9f4044ed6101dd4fe650adaf5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
