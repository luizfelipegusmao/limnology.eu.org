{"title":"Budd-Chiari Syndrome Research Collaboration: A Network Analysis of Scientific Contributions (2000-2023)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0944/v1","date":1726155946000,"content":"Aim: This study aims to analyze the structure of the co-authorship network in Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) research from 2000 to 2023 using data from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection. The objective is to identify key researchers, evaluate the collaborative dynamics, and understand the evolution of scientific contributions in this field. Method: This study utilized network analysis techniques to evaluate 2,877 publications related to BCS research indexed in the WoS Core Collection between 2000 and 2023. The analysis was conducted using Python (Version 3.10.5) in the PyCharm development environment (Software Version 2022.1.3). The co-authorship networks were assessed using macro-level indicators such as network density (the ratio of actual to possible connections), clustering coefficient (degree of node clustering), number of components (distinct connected subgroups), and average path length (average distance between nodes). Micro-level indicators including degree centrality (importance based on the number of connections), closeness centrality (proximity to other nodes), and betweenness centrality (frequency of a node on the shortest paths between others) were also analyzed.Result: The results revealed a highly fragmented network structure in the early years (2000-2009), characterized by low network density (0.0017) and a large number of disconnected components (533). Key researchers such as Aurelie Plessier and Dominique Valla emerged as central figures in terms of degree and closeness centrality. In the 2010-2019 period, the network showed slight improvements, with density decreasing to 0.0016 but an increase in the number of components to 645, indicating persistent fragmentation. From 2020 to 2023, the network demonstrated increased cohesiveness with a density of 0.0032 and a reduction in components to 376. Influential researchers in the final period included Virginia Hernandez-Gea and Valerie Paradis, who played pivotal roles in connecting disparate research clusters.Conclusion: The co-authorship network analysis of BCS research over the past two decades highlights a gradual yet incomplete evolution towards greater collaboration and integration among researchers. While the network's cohesiveness has improved, significant fragmentation remains, suggesting that further efforts are needed to enhance global and interdisciplinary collaboration. Addressing these challenges is crucial for fostering a more connected and productive research community that can advance the understanding and management of BCS.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4136a3188b7860916c14541cbad53109e883cef8c4a4beb68b3e404d8c1db23d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
