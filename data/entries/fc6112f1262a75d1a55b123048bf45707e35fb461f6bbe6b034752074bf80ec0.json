{"title":"Comparison of pediatric poisoning patterns before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309016","date":1723816800000,"content":"<p>by Juho An, Yura Ko, Heewon Yang</p>\r\nObjective <p>To investigate the epidemiological changes in emergency department (ED), including changes in toxic substances and ED outcomes in pediatric and adolescent patients who visited the EDs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> Methods <p>This cross-sectional observational study used data from the ED-based Injury In-depth Surveillance from 2017 to 2021 in South Korea (SK). The study population comprised patients aged &lt;19 years who visited 23 EDs because of poisoning before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. We divided the study period into pre-COVID-19 (January 2017 to February 2020) and COVID-19 periods (March 2020 to December 2021).</p> Results <p>In total, 5862 patients were included in the final analysis, with 3863 and 1999 in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively. The patients’ mean age increased from 8.3 ± 7.1 to 11.2 ± 6.9 years between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods (P &lt; 0.001), and the number of adolescents (aged 13–18 years) significantly increased during the COVID-19 period (1653 [42.8%] vs. 1252 [62.6%]; P &lt; 0.001). The number of intentional poisoning cases increased from 1332 (34.5%) before COVID-19 to 1174 (58.7%) during COVID-19 (P &lt; 0.001). Specifically, pharmaceutical poisoning significantly increased during the COVID-19 period (2242 [58.0%] vs. 1443 [72.2%]; P &lt; 0.001), with central nervous system (CNS) drug poisoning being the most common type (780 [34.8%] vs. 747 [51.8%]; P &lt; 0.001). Among the intentional poisoning cases, pharmaceutical substance use significantly increased during the COVID-19 period (1207 [90.6%] vs. 1102 [93.9%]; P = 0.007). We used Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) forecasting models to forecast the number of ED visits during COVID-19. The total number of pediatric patients with poisoning decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when using the BSTS forecasting model, the decrease in the number of patients was not significant. Furthermore, the forecasting models showed no statistically significant increase in the number of intentional pediatric poisoning cases.</p> Conclusions <p>The previous studies suggested a decrease in the total number of patients with poisoning but an increase in intentional poisoning cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. By using similar methods to those of previous studies, our results also reached the same conclusion. However, the BSTS model, which predicts real-world time series patterns, seasonal effects, and cumulative effects, shows no significant change in pediatric poisoning patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>","author":"Juho An","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fc6112f1262a75d1a55b123048bf45707e35fb461f6bbe6b034752074bf80ec0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
