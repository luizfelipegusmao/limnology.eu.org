{"title":"Optimizing placement of bioretention systems in the US Puget Sound region","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.13219?af=R","date":1718873295000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Puget Sound Basin, US Pacific Northwest, is experiencing rapid population and urban growth. This growth adversely impacts local ecosystems, especially the spawning and rearing habitat for several salmonid species. Sustainable urban design strategies such as green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) are required in the region to manage stormwater onsite when new development occurs. However, the effectiveness of any GSI depends on its location relative to where stormwater is produced. This study aimed to develop a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based framework for the optimal placement of GSI, specifically bioretention systems. We computed the Hydrologic Sensitivity Index (<i>λ</i>\n<sub>HSI</sub>, indicating runoff generation potential at a landscape location) for the lower Puyallup River Watershed study area. The index and federal and state feasibility criteria were used to identify suitable sites for bioretention systems. The suitability of identified sites was verified through ground-truthing, including soil sampling and infiltration testing. We found that 2.5% of the watershed area was suitable for bioretention, concentrated in the center and north of the study watershed. The method described in this study can be readily applied to watersheds for which spatial data (topography, soil, and land use) are available. We recommend choosing locations with high <i>λ</i>\n<sub>HSI</sub> when resources are limited since these locations contribute most to runoff generation and urban flooding.</p>","author":"Anish Mahat, \nJoan Q.
