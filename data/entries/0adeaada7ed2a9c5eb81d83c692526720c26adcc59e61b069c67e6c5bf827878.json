{"title":"Best digital practices in Mental Health: Design and Implementation of a Tailored Mobile Application for Vulnerable Populations in the European Union","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0284/v1","date":1717575895000,"content":"This paper outlines the ongoing development of a specialised mobile application to address the mental health needs of vulnerable populations in the European Union (EU). Conducted as a mixed-methods research within two EU Science and Technology Cooperation Actions, the study prioritises stakeholder feedback to identify features for initial testing and strategies to improve application uptake, using critical digital health analysis. With a focus on marginalised groups such as refugees, migrants and socio-economically disadvantaged individuals, the application aims to provide an accessible and culturally sensitive platform for mental health support, integrating evidence-based interventions such as cognitive behavioural techniques and mindfulness exercises. Key features include multilingual support, habit tracking, personalised recommendations for support and services, and real-time crisis intervention. Collaboration with stakeholders and ongoing rigorous usability testing are driving the refinement process to ensure usability, acceptability and effectiveness, underscoring the importance of user engagement in technology-based mental health interventions in the EU context and highlighting the importance of collaborative science and technology for societal benefit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0adeaada7ed2a9c5eb81d83c692526720c26adcc59e61b069c67e6c5bf827878","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
