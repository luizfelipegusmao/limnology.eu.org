{"title":"Randomness of Spinal Formation Decreases When Extracellular Vesicle Neuron Contact is Inhibited Blocking the Transfer of MicroRNA","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2526/v1","date":1722414157000,"content":"Dendritic spines are protruding membrane organelles from neuronal dendrites. The quantity of dendritic spines formed seems to be regulated with the -BAR family proteins, as they would initiate the membrane curvature to form the spines; however it is unclear whether the positions of these spines are selected based on spatial information due to the location of pre-existing spines or are selected via random molecular interactions. Through measuring the distance between dendritic spines from the images of Prada et. al (6), a distribution graph was created to determine whether the spine formations followed a random distribution pattern. Two groups of images were measured: dendritic spines when extracellular vesicles (EV) neuron contact was normal (control) and when EV-neuron contact was inhibited (experimental), preventing the transfer of MicroRNA (miRNA). Two randomly generated simulation groups were then created with the same spine density as the control and experimental conditions. Distribution graphs were created for the two randomly generated simulation groups as well. It was found that the randomly generated control simulation and the control group had significantly similar distribution; however, the randomly generated experimental simulation and the experimental simulation showed less of a similar distribution. These findings show that an element of randomness was removed when EV-neuron contact was inhibited.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05f5c8c0b4f34721a42b5ae170401a3e4cadcc1b8be9dc24b9acb73bcdb6c771","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
