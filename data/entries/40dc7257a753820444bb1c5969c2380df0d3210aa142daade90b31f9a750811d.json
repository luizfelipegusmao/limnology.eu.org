The concerns recently documented in a dossier on more than 100 of his papers most directly challenge an experimental Parkinsonâ€™s disease therapy developed by Prothena (see main story, p. 1406). But 238 active patents concerning neurological conditions also cite suspect work noted in the dossier, according to data from Dimensions Analytics. And the corporate holders of those patents include dozens of firms at work on treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"40dc7257a753820444bb1c5969c2380df0d3210aa142daade90b31f9a750811d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
