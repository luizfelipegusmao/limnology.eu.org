In this work, we use a deep learning network to classify STEM images into all 7 crystal systems with sample materials oriented at random zone axes. The dataset used for this project is the Atomagined dataset [<a href=\"#ozae044.187-B1\">1-3</a>] which consists of simulated HAADF STEM images. It contains 6,670 ICSD structure prototypes oriented at random zone axes to give us 67,869 distinct images. The dataset also contains images with simulated noise such as scanning noise, background noise, blur, etc.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8dee8c31d2f752ca5bb3b4cb255bbb2dc2ad1a7af0079a748929a8983b217543","category":"Environment"}
