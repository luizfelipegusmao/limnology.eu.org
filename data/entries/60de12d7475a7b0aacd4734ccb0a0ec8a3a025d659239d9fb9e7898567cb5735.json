{"title":"The response pattern of the microbial community structure and metabolic profile of jiupei to Bacillus subtilis JP1 addition during baijiu fermentation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13345?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p><i>Baijiu</i> brewing is a complex and multifaceted multimicrobial co-fermentation process, in which various microorganisms interact to form an interdependent micro-ecosystem, subsequently influencing metabolic activities and compound production. Among these microorganisms, <i>Bacillus</i>, an important bacterial genus in the liquor brewing process, remains unclear in its role in shaping the brewing microbial community and its functional metabolism.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A <i>baijiu</i> fermentation system was constructed using <i>B. subtilis</i> JP1 isolated from native <i>jiupei</i> (grain mixture) combined with <i>daqu</i> (a saccharifying agent) and <i>huangshui</i> (a fermentation byproduct). Based on high-throughput amplicon sequencing analysis, it was evident that <i>B. subtilis</i> JP1 significantly influences bacterial microbial diversity and fungal community structure in <i>baijiu</i> fermentation. Of these, <i>Aspergillus</i> and <i>Monascus</i> emerge as the most markedly altered microbial genera in the <i>jiupei</i> community. Based on co-occurrence networks and bidirectional orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis models, it was demonstrated that the addition of <i>B. subtilis</i> JP1 intensified microbial interactions in <i>jiupei</i> fermentation, consequently enhancing the production of volatile flavor compounds such as heptanoic acid, butyl hexanoate and 3-methylthiopropanol in <i>jiupei</i>.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p><i>B. subtilis</i> JP1 significantly alters the microbial community structure of <i>jiupei</i>, enhancing aroma formation during fermentation. These findings will contribute to a broader application in solid-state fermentation.
