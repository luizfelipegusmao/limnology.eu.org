{"title":"Significance of Cellular Lipid Metabolism for the Replication of Rotaviruses and Other RNA Viruses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1097/v1","date":1713358998000,"content":"The replication of species A rotaviruses (RVAs) and other RNA viruses involves recruitment of and inter-action with the cellular organelles lipid droplets (LDs), both physically and functionally. Inhibition of en-zymes involved in the cellular fatty acid biosynthesis pathway or of cellular lipases that degrade LDs re-duces the functions of ‘viral factories’ (viroplasms for rotaviruses or replication compartments of other RNA viruses) and decreases the production of infectious progeny virus. Similarly, disturbance of the cellular lipid homeostasis in various ways blocks the replication of flaviviruses (hepatitis C viruses, Zikavirus, others), HIV-1, SARS-CoV-2, picornaviruses, noroviruses, influenza viruses and other negative-strand RNA viruses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ed0d680aa26aaedc16be2f2f009dc4fb259e84a8c8f517150f1e8a3edbfa9a3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
