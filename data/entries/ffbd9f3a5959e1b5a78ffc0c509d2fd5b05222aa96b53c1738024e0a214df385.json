{"title":"Improving Laser Welding Penetration Depth Process Capability for Automotive Seat Adjusters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0843/v1","date":1728630339000,"content":"One of the most important aspects in the fabrication of car seats is the quality of its welded joints. In this proposal, a design of experiments (DoE) approach is used to improve the actual process capability (Cpk) of weld penetration depth in automotive seat adjusters using a laser beam welding (LBW) machine TRUMPF TruDiode 3006. Welding speed effects, laser power, and focal position in the Z axis were considered to determine the optimal welding penetration depth conditions, which is a minimum of 1.20 mm in cold rolled steel metal sheets ZE 790 with a thickness of 1.60 mm. The initial process capability evaluation indicated a Cpk value of 0.50, considering the initial process parameters. The proposed design was modeled using the response surface methodology, stepwise reduction technique, F-test, and before and after process capability evaluation for validation purposes. After applying the proposed methodology, a Cpk of 1.81 was obtained, resulting in a significant improvement of the process, reducing defective parts from 6.51% to 0.00%.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ffbd9f3a5959e1b5a78ffc0c509d2fd5b05222aa96b53c1738024e0a214df385","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
