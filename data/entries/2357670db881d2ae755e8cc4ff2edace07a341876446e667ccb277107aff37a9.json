{"title":"Long-Acting, Longer-Acting and Ultralong-Acting Peptides","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0475/v1","date":1728296561000,"content":"This perspective describes the current status and future prospects of developing long- to ultralong-acting anti-obesity peptides. First, we review the current status of lipidation, PEGylation, and Fc fusion technologies to obtain long-acting peptides administered once weekly. Next, we describe the approach and current results of using macromolecular peptide prodrugs with pre-programmed releasable linkers to achieve longer-acting peptides that can be administered weekly or monthly. Finally, we posit novel modifications of the latter technology that could provide ultralong half-lives of over one month by advantageously exploiting the clearance rates of released peptides. As examples, we posit that prodrugs of low-clearance GLP-1 agonists derived from peptides already modified by lipidation, PEGylation, and Fc fusion could produce ultralong-acting agonists with dosing intervals reaching 3 to even 6 months.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2357670db881d2ae755e8cc4ff2edace07a341876446e667ccb277107aff37a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
