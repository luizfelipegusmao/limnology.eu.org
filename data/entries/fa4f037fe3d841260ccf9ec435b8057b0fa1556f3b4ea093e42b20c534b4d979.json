{"title":"Effective paclitaxel: β-Cyclodextrin-based formulation boosts in vitro anti-tumor potential and lowers toxicity in zebrafish","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae150/7765062?rss=1","date":1727049600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Paclitaxel (PCTX) is one of the most prevalently used chemotherapeutic agents. However, its use is currently beset with a host of problems: solubility issue, microplastic leaching, and drug resistance. Since drug discovery is challenging, we decided to focus on repurposing the drug itself by remedying its drawbacks and making it more effective. In this study, we have harnessed the aqueous solubility of sugars, and the high affinity of cancer cells for them, to entrap the hydrophobic PCTX within the hydrophilic shell of the carbohydrate<span> β</span>-cyclodextrin. We have characterized this novel drug formulation by testing its various physical and chemical parameters. Importantly, in all our <span>in vitro</span> assays, the conjugate performed better than the drug alone. We find that the conjugate is internalized by the cancer cells (A549) via caveolin 1-mediated endocytosis. Thereafter, it triggers apoptosis by inducing the formation of reactive oxygen species. Based on experiments on zebrafish larvae, the formulation displays lower toxicity compared to PCTX alone. Thus, our “Trojan Horse” approach, relying on minimal components and relatively faster formulation, enhances the anti-tumor potential of PCTX, while simultaneously making it more innocuous toward non-cancerous cells. The findings of this study have implications in the quest for the most cost-effective chemotherapeutic molecule.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"fa4f037fe3d841260ccf9ec435b8057b0fa1556f3b4ea093e42b20c534b4d979","category":"Environment"}
