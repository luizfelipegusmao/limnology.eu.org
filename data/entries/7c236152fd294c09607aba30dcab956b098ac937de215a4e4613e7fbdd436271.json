However, it also entails financial responsibilities that can pose challenges and have negative wellbeing impacts for both human and animal.\nAims/Purpose: This study aimed to explore pet owners' the financial aspects of pet ownership in New Zealand, including the importance of pet insurance, the impact of veterinary costs, and the ethical considerations of owning a pet. Understanding these aspects of pet ownership is crucial for promoting responsible pet ownership and ensuring animal welfare.\nStudy Designs: Data was collected through a nationwide online survey conducted in 2019 as part of the Furry WhƒÅnau Wellbeing research project. The survey included questions about the financial aspects of pet ownership, and respondents were asked to indicate their level of agreement with various statements.\nFindings: The study found that the cost of veterinary care is a significant concern for many pet owners, with 83.9% of respondents agreeing that expense is a factor in the level of healthcare their pets receive. While pet insurance can mitigate financial burdens, only a third of respondents considered it essential due to high costs and exclusions. The study also revealed disparities for rural and low-income households.\nConclusions: The financial aspects of pet ownership present a complex challenge, impacting both pet and owner wellbeing. This research highlights the need for comprehensive strategies to promote sustainable and equitable pet ownership, including improving access to affordable vet-erinary care, enhancing financial literacy among pet owners, and providing support systems for those facing economic hardship.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c236152fd294c09607aba30dcab956b098ac937de215a4e4613e7fbdd436271","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
