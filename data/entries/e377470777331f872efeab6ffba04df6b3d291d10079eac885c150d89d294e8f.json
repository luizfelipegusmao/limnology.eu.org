{"title":"But can it drive to Lapland? A comparison of electric vehicle owners with the general population for identification of attitudes, concerns and barriers related to electric vehicle adoption in Finland","link":"https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000346","date":1727877600000,"content":"<p>by Nils Sandman, Elisa Sahari, Aki Koponen</p>\r\n\r\nTransportation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions with private car use accounting for a large proportion of those emissions. Battery powered electric vehicles (EV) are a currently available technology that has the potential to significantly reduce emissions from car use. Therefore, promoting a shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs should be supported by policy makers aiming to curtail emissions from car use. To design policies and interventions to promote EV adoption, information is needed on how people perceive electric vehicles and what are the real and perceived barriers preventing their adoption. With this objective in mind, it was investigated what the current EV owners in Finland are like and how they compare with the general population. We also endeavored to identify real as well as potentially misperceived barriers to EV adoption and factors affecting EV purchasing intentions. The study utilizes a sample of 3857 participants, including 141 electric car owners, who answered a questionnaire investigating lifestyle, car use, environmental and political attitudes as well as household carbon footprint and attitudes towards EVs. EV owners in Finland have more financial security, own more cars, drive more, and have a larger average household carbon footprint than the general population. There are two distinct subgroups among electric car owners, one group being interested in environmental impact of their car use and the other focused on the performance of their cars. People without experience of EVs generally have negative attitudes towards electric cars and also maintain some misconceptions about EVs. Personal experience with electric vehicles is associated with a positive outlook on these types of vehicles and is the strongest predictor of EV purchasing intentions.","author":"Nils Sandman","siteTitle":"PLOS Climate","siteHash":"ab511bb583c9cc103fc6bd74737f07eb1311e1e62c758b30431d090c3da71072","entryHash":"e377470777331f872efeab6ffba04df6b3d291d10079eac885c150d89d294e8f","category":"Environment"}
