{"title":"Focus on photosynthesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/3895/7717638?rss=1","date":1721433600000,"content":"<span>Photosynthesis encompasses the processes by which plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria transform light energy into chemical energy and fix carbon from the atmosphere into organic compounds to support their growth and development. We cannot overstate the importance of photosynthesis to life on Earth. Yet, critical gaps remain in our understanding of photosynthesis, its interplay with other metabolic pathways, and the adaptation and acclimation processes that allow photosynthetic organisms to live almost everywhere on our planet. Filling these gaps will enable improving the efficiency of photosynthesis in crop plants, accurately modeling the global carbon cycle, and enhancing terrestrial carbon sequestration to combat global climate change.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"f225856ec624a0ceaa9febd14b4ed7cdb014a96427403354d80d21925c45c2a7","category":"Environment"}
