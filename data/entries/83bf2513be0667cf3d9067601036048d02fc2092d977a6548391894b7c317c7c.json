{"title":"How to Parallelize &ldquo;Non-Parallelizable&rdquo; Minimization Functions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0571/v2","date":1719221258000,"content":"The paper proposes a universal algorithm for parallelizing calculations that arise when using highly-optimized minimization functions available in many computing packages. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is based on the fact that although the “inner workings” of the minimization function used may not be known to the user, it inevitably uses in its work auxiliary functions that implement the calculation of the minimized functional and its gradient, which are usually implemented by the user, which means that in most cases they can be parallelized relatively easily. The paper discusses in detail both the parallelization algorithm and its software implementation using MPI parallel programming technology. Examples of the software implementation of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated using the Python programming language, but can be easily rewritten using the C/C++/Fortran programming languages.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"83bf2513be0667cf3d9067601036048d02fc2092d977a6548391894b7c317c7c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
