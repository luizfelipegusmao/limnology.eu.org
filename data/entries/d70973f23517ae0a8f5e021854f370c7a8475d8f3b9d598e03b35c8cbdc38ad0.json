{"title":"Biomolecule-Based Anti-diabetic Nano-Formulation Models &ndash; Effect on Blood Glucose Level, Insulin/Drug Release and Other Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2153/v1","date":1717168314000,"content":"Diabetes is one of the metabolic syndromes that demands the great concern affecting millions of people all over the world. Viral infections were also considered as responsible for diabetes. Though, variety of medications for prevention and treatment of diabetes are available, numerous limitations are also prevailing that cannot be neglected. Precise drug-targetability, controlled drug-release, oral bioavailability, minimizing side effects are a few to consider. To address most of these shortcomings of traditional drug-delivery models, nanoformulation has been employed therein a wide range of nanoformulation models are developed. The pharmacology of a drug can be greatly enhanced through nanoformulation models in diabetes treatment in terms of enhanced bioavailability, prolonged and sustained drug-lease, maintain maximum drug concentration in serum, higher intestinal absorption, and protection from enzymatic degradation. In this review work, recently designed nanoformulation models for efficient insulin delivery and the other properties concerning diabetes such as reducing blood glucose level, total cholesterol, triglycerides, lipid profile, wound healing, elevating antioxidant enzymes etc. are discussed. Classification of the nanoformulation models is done based on the nature of the fabricating material employed in nanoformulation. This review may be helpful in designing a more efficient nanoformulation model for diabetes treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d70973f23517ae0a8f5e021854f370c7a8475d8f3b9d598e03b35c8cbdc38ad0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
