{"title":"Effect of Bleaching Agents on Healthy Enamel, White Spots, and Carious Lesions: A Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0045/v1","date":1711959130000,"content":"This Systematic Review examines studies focusing on tooth bleaching and its effect on healthy enamel or incipient caries and bacterial adhesion. The aim is to explore the impact of different bleaching agents on incipient caries lesions and healthy enamel. Randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and in vitro studies that compared at least two groups were included. A comprehensive search strategy was used to select studies from Pubmed and Scopus databases. Two evaluators performed data extraction, screening, and quality assessment independently. Only studies written in English were included. From 968 initial records, 28 studies were selected for a full-text evaluation. 7 studies were classified as cluster 1 (bacterial adherence on teeth), 12 studies as cluster 2 (no bacteria involved), 4 studies as cluster 3 (no teeth deployment), and 5 clinical studies were cluster 4. Of the selected studies, 6 (21.43%) supported increased bacterial attachment capacity and cariogenic dynamics, 4 (14.29%) decreased adhesion and cariogenic activity, 7 (25%) no difference, and 11 (39.28%) followed a differentiated methodological approach and could not be categorized. Due to different methodology strategies used in the studies of all clusters, the risk of bias was high. Thus, we cannot reach a confident conclusion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa7e278dfa9ff167aa74da773957a6c0325052f6b19472b50158914a3c51fbd6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
