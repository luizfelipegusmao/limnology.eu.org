{"title":"Impact of Saussurea lappa against foodborne parasite Trichinella spiralis experimental infections induced variation in DNA damage, oxidative stress and PCNA expression in rat skeletal muscles","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae047/7634258?rss=1","date":1711152000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Trichinellosis is a parasite zoonosis that is spread through ingesting raw or undercooked meat that contains the Trichinella spiralis (<span>T. spiralis</span>) infective larvae. It has three clinical phases: intestinal, migratory, and muscular. Kuth root, also known as Costus (Saussurea lappa) roots, is used in many traditional medical systems all over the world to treat a variety of illnesses, such as dyspepsia, diarrhoea, vomiting, and inflammation. Current study assessed the therapeutic Potential of costus <span>roots extract</span> (CRE) treatment on experimental trichinellosis induce changes in DNA damage, oxidative stress and Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in muscle fibers in male rats. A total of 60 male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups (Gps) [Gp1, Negative control; Gp2, Costus (CRE); Gp3, Positive control or Infected rats with <span>T. spiralis,</span> Gp4; Pre-treated infection with CRE; Gp5 &amp; Gp6, Post treated infection with CRE for one and two weeks respectively]. Current results revealed that; <span>Trichinella spiralis experimentally</span> infection induced significant elevation in tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), DNA damage, PCNA expression and significant depletion in tissue glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (Cat) activities. Pre or/and post CRE treated infected rats with <span>T. spiralis</span> (Gp4-Gp6) induced improvements and depletion in DNA damage, PCNA expression, MDA and elevation in GSH, SOD, catalase as compared to infected rats with <span>T. spiralis</span> (Gp3) with best results for the pretreatments (Gp4). Trichinella spiralis experimental infection induced DNA damage and oxidative stress in rat skeletal muscles and treatments with costus roots extract modulates these changes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"374cace4a3f3d82b01c286f77a4099d3015461ab927d409811ff6bcd5d8a4106","category":"Environment"}
