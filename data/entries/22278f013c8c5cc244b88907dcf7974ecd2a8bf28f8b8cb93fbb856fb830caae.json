Cement in concrete accounts for 10-15 wt.% and the most widely used cement, is Portland Cement (PC). Consequently, PC has a high global demand with annual global production of approx. 4.6 billion tonnes with predicted growth to 6 billion tonnes by 2050 [<a href=\"#ozae044.224-B1\">1</a>]. However, the production of PC has significant environmental impacts accounting for approx. 8% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions [<a href=\"#ozae044.224-B2\">2</a>]. For this reason, there is a considerable push to develop greener means of producing PC as well as alternative cements, including the addition of supplementary cementitious material (SCMs) to PC and other non-PC based mixtures.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"22278f013c8c5cc244b88907dcf7974ecd2a8bf28f8b8cb93fbb856fb830caae","category":"Environment"}
