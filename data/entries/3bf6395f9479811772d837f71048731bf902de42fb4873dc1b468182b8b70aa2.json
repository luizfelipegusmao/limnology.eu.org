{"title":"RSM to Explore the Influence Mechanism of Process Configuration and Fiber Diameter in a New Multi-needle Spinneret Electrospinning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0427/v1","date":1715153676000,"content":"Nowadays, Multi-needle electrospinning has used to be an efficient method for producing nanofiber membranes. But in the process, the fluctuation errors in electrospinning fluid flow rate have directly influence the membrane quality, which bringing instability and still have not been solved yet. For finding out the solution to the inaccurate flow control in multi-needle, it is necessary to develop a multi-stage flow runner spinneret for large-scale production of nanofiber membrane. At first, the paper uses the finite element software COMSOL to numerically simulate the polymer flow in the runner of spinneret. Based on it, the velocity field distribution curve was draw and the velocity instability coefficient of the polymer flow was attained, which are providing theoretical guidance for the optimal design of spinneret. Next, the response surface analysis method (RSM) was used to establish a regression model between the average diameter of the nanofiber membrane and the process parameters. Then, above regression model used to perform variance data processing between the average diameter and the process parameter configuration. After that, the 2D and 3D response surface profiles and the significance analysis were completed. Finally, the stability of the nanofibers production was improved, which attained the optimal adjustment of process configuration in multi-needle electrospinning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3bf6395f9479811772d837f71048731bf902de42fb4873dc1b468182b8b70aa2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
