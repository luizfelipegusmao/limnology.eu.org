{"title":"Adverse Childhood Experiences and Health Outcomes: A 20-Year Real-World Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0670/v1","date":1723426053000,"content":"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) refer to traumatic life events in childhood that comprise abuse (e.g., psychological, physical, sexual), neglect (psychological and physical), indirect violence or household dysfunctions. Studies have found ACEs to be related to severe short-, medium- and long-term consequences in victimsâ€™ health. The current work consists of a real-world, multicentric, prevalence study of health outcomes in children &lt;16 years suspected of ACEs by physicians. It relies on electronic health records and healthcare registries from a Portuguese local healthcare unit between January 2001 and December 2021 (N=40 536). Three health outcome groups were analyzed: (1) traumatic injuries and intoxications (2) mental health disorders, and (3) physical disorders. Keywords and ICD-9, ICD-10, and ICPC-2 codes from were employed. Children suspected of ACEs represent 2% (n=918). Social problems, injuries and intoxications, mental health disorders, and physical disorders arise in higher percentages in suspected victims than in non-suspected individuals. Findings uncover that child victims of ACEs may be underdiagnosed. Given the severe consequences for their current and future health, this should be taken as a critical warning for healthcare professionals. Detection and reports in health units are fundamental for early treatment, aiming to avoid an escalation of damage and prevent re-victimization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"13254c7d7fc23ab90df3d443837ddf0d76f140abc2e15b110e774ea198b57b26","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
