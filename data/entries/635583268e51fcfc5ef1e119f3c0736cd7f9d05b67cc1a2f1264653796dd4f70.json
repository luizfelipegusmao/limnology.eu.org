{"title":"China’s road slopes need long-term protection | Science","link":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp5259","date":1717074060000,"content":"Large-scale road construction in China’s mountainous regions has led to many exposed road slopes. Bare road slope patches, stripped of soil and vegetation, have resulted in severe landscape fragmentation and destructive effects on surrounding habitats (1, 2). They are also potentially dangerous to humans. In April, the slope of a section of the Yinkun Expressway roadbed collapsed, blocking the road with about 4000 m3 of debris (3). China needs long-term strategies to stabilize and restore road slopes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"635583268e51fcfc5ef1e119f3c0736cd7f9d05b67cc1a2f1264653796dd4f70","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
