{"title":"Seasonal and daily patterns in known dissolved metabolites in the northwestern Sargasso Sea","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12497?af=R","date":1704950922000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Organic carbon in seawater plays a significant role in the global carbon cycle. The concentration and composition of dissolved organic carbon reflect the activity of the biological community and chemical reactions that occur in seawater. From 2016 to 2019, we repeatedly sampled the oligotrophic northwest Sargasso Sea in the vicinity of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study site (BATS) to quantitatively follow known compounds within the pool of dissolved organic matter in the upper 1000â€‰m of the water column. Most metabolites showed surface enrichment, and 83% of the metabolites had significantly lower concentrations with increasing depth. Dissolved metabolite concentrations most notably revealed temporal variability. Fourteen metabolites displayed seasonality that was repeated in each of the 4 yr sampled. Concentrations of vitamins, including pantothenic acid (vitamin B<sub>5</sub>) and riboflavin (vitamin B<sub>2</sub>), increased annually during winter periods when mixed layer depths were deepest. During diel sampling, light-sensitive riboflavin decreased significantly during daylight hours. The temporal variability in metabolites at BATS was less than the spatial variability in metabolites from a previous sample set collected over a broad latitudinal range in the western Atlantic Ocean. The metabolites examined in this study are all components of central carbon metabolism. By examining these metabolites at finer resolution and in a time-series, we begin to provide insights into the chemical compounds that may be exchanged by microorganisms in marine systems, data which are fundamental to understanding the chemical response of marine systems to future changes in climate.</p>","author":"Krista Longnecker, \nMelissa C.
