{"title":"Self-Esteem, Student Engagement, and Academic Performance in Universitas Terbuka, Indonesia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1372/v1","date":1726637063000,"content":"Self-esteem and student engagement play critical roles in shaping academic performance, particularly in the context of distance education, where direct classroom interaction is limited. This preliminary study examines the relationships between self-esteem, student engagement, and academic performance among 1,479 students at an Indonesia's open university, Universitas Terbuka. Using a cross-sectional survey design, the study employed multiple validated scales, including the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Student Engagement Scale, and self-reported academic performance measures, to explore how these variables interact. The results show that self-esteem alone does not significantly predict academic performance (F = 2.31, p = 0.071), but student engagement plays a moderating role, significantly enhancing the effect of self-esteem on academic outcomes (interaction term: B = 0.25, p = 0.010). Additionally, students from matrilineal family systems reported significantly higher self-esteem (M = 3.92, SD = 0.569, p = 0.014) and academic engagement (M = 3.93, SD = 0.870, p &lt; 0.001) compared to their patrilineal counterparts. These preliminary findings highlight psychological and cultural factors in online education, with ongoing qualitative analyses in a broader mixed-method study set to deepen insights into technology challenges and further contribute to distance learning research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ecc96e08ce81e4b384ce5d3acae354d31a0029c7ea665388829be1bfa7fe7206","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
