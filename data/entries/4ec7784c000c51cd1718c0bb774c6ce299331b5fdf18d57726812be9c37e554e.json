{"title":"Trends and Patterns of Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty: 2016-2019","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1190/v1","date":1721082273000,"content":"This study investigates the trends and patterns of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) from 2016 to 2019. Using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), we analyzed demographics, prevalence of comorbidities, total cost, and length of stay (LOS) for 88,415 RA-TKA cases identified during this period. Our analysis revealed a significant increase in RA-TKA procedures, from 5,330 in 2016 to 39,495 in 2019. Patients undergoing RA-TKA were slightly younger, with an average age of 66.2 years. The average hospital stay was 1.89 days, and total charges averaged $65,891. We also examined various comorbidities and demographic factors, including race, median household income, and hospital teaching status. The results show that RA-TKA usage in the US has grown substantially, with specific demographic and clinical patterns. Further studies on the long-term outcomes of RA-TKA are needed to fully understand the benefits of this technology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ec7784c000c51cd1718c0bb774c6ce299331b5fdf18d57726812be9c37e554e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
