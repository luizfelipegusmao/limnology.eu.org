Traditionally, the primary means through which water users receive information about drinking water is via the annual Consumer Confidence Report, which summarizes water quality information at the water system-scale and not at the point-of-use. In this study, we recruited 24 water users from different homes in Detroit, Michigan to assess the effect of access to individualized data on perceptions related to their drinking water quality and service provider. Each participant had a water quality sensor node, which measured five different water quality parameters, temporarily installed in their home for four weeks. Entry interviews were completed at the time of sensor node installation. After four weeks, water quality reports summarizing the individual water quality data collected by the sensor nodes were prepared and shared with participants, after which the exit interviews were completed. We found that access to individualized water quality data positively affected participants’ perceptions of drinking water quality and safety, for example, 92% of participants rated the safety of water at the faucet as at least ‘Somewhat Safe’ in the exit interview compared to 46% in the entry interview. However, participants’ perceptions of the water service provider did not change significantly in response to this information (p &gt; 0.05). Half of the study participants expressed interest in more frequent monitoring and communication, including actionable data that allowed participants to make more informed decisions about how to better manage their water quality at home. We saw evidence of long-term changes in response to access to individualized information with 50% reporting changes in behavior related to drinking water use. We conclude that access to localized water quality data provides actionable information that Detroit, Michigan water users value.","author":"Alyssa Schubert","siteTitle":"PLOS Water","siteHash":"76ba47a8597c89f4cf217272433133ba8aa6d0dba9c907d21e63f90c34e21e00","entryHash":"be74a61d0c4ee62f32cea324348c8d928bd4dc9527e518923c32ea30a57c6e79","category":"Environment"}
