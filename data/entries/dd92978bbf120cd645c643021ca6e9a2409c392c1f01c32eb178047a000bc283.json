{"title":"Anxiety among Medical Students Regarding Generative Artificial Intelligence Models: A Pilot Descriptive Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1215/v1","date":1723785541000,"content":"Despite the potential benefits of generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI), concerns about its psy-chological impact on medical students, especially with regard to job displacement, are apparent. This pilot study, conducted in Jordan during July–August 2024, aimed to examine the specific fears, anxieties, mistrust, and ethical concerns medical students could harbor towards genAI. Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected from 164 medical students studying in Jordan across various academic years, employing a structured self-administered questionnaire with an internally consistent FAME scale—representing Fear, Anxiety, Mistrust, and Ethics and comprising 12 items, with three items for each construct. The results indicated variable levels of anxiety towards genAI among the participating medical students: 34.1% reported no anxiety about genAI role in their future careers (n = 56), while 41.5% were slightly anxious (n = 61), 22.0% somewhat anxious (n = 36), and 2.4% extremely anxious (n = 4). Among the FAME constructs, Mistrust was the most agreed upon (mean: 12.35±2.78), followed by Ethics construct (mean: 10.86±2.90), Fear (mean: 9.49±3.53), and Anxiety (mean: 8.91±3.68). Sex, academic level, and Grade Point Average (GPA) did not significantly affect the students’ perceptions of genAI. However, there was a notable direct association between the students’ general anxiety about genAI and elevated scores in the Fear, Anxiety, and Ethics constructs of the FAME scale. Prior exposure to genAI and its previous use did not significantly modify the scores of the FAME scale. These findings highlighted the critical need for refined educational strategies to address the integration of genAI in medical training. The results demonstrated a pervasive anxiety, fear, mistrust, and ethical concerns among medical students regarding the deployment of genAI in healthcare, indicating the necessity for curriculum modifi-cations that focus specifically on these areas. Interventions should be tailored to increase genAI familiarity and competency, which would alleviate apprehension and equip future physicians to engage with this inevitable technology effectively. The study also highlighted the importance of incorporating ethical discussions into medical courses to address mistrust and concerns about the human-centered aspects of genAI. Conclusively, the study calls for a proactive evolution of medical education to prepare students for AI-driven healthcare practices shortly to ensure that physicians are well-prepared, confident, and ethically informed in their professional interactions with genAI technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd92978bbf120cd645c643021ca6e9a2409c392c1f01c32eb178047a000bc283","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
