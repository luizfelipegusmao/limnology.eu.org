{"title":"Electrical Model Analysis for Bifacial PV Modules Using Real Performance Data in Laboratory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0709/v1","date":1728549586000,"content":"The new PV technologies, such as bifacial modules, brings the challenge of analyzing the response of numerical models and their fit to actual measurements. Thus, this study explores various models available in the literature for simulating the IV curve behavior of bifacial photovoltaic modules. The analysis contains traditional models, such as single and double-diode models, and empirical or analytical methodologies. Therefore, this paper proposes and implements a model performance assessment framework. This framework aims to establish a common basis for comparison and verify the applicability of each model by contrasting it with experimental data under controlled conditions of irradiance and temperature. \n\nThe study utilizes bifacial modules of PERC+, HJT, and n-PERT technologies, tracing IV curves using a high-precision A+A+A+ solar simulator and conducting two sets of laboratory illumination easurements: single-sided and double-sided. In the first case, each face of the module is illuminated separately, while in the latter, the incident frontal illuminating light is reflected on a reflective surface. Experimental data obtained from these measurements are used to evaluate three different approximations for bifacial IV curve models in the case of double-sided illumination. The employed model for single-sided illumination is a single-diode model. The evaluation of various models revealed that shadowing from frames and junction boxes contributes to an increase in the error of modeled IV curves.\n\nHowever, among the three evaluated bifacial electrical models, one exhibited superior performance, with current errors approaching approximately 20%. To mitigate this discrepancy, a proposed methodology highlighted the significance of accurately estimating Io, suggesting its potential to reduce errors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd3b4df3e953a027dc0ca3533ba7fea0ff8dea95c2c1a3e0e14863a8521c30cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
