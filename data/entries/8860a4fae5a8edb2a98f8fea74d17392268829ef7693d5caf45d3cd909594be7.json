{"title":"Effect of obesity on the aquaporin5 expression in the human placental and uterus tissues","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1024/v1","date":1720760214000,"content":"Abstract: Obesity and overweight also increasingly affect women of childbearing age and pregnant women. In maternal obesity, the activation of metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative stress pathways is proven, which appears to be a key step in placental and uterus function pathological changes. Several recent studies have evidenced that aquaporins (AQPs) are critical players in adipose tissue biology and are involved in the onset of obesity. Our studies aimed to investigate the changes in placental volume and vascularization and measure the AQP5 expression and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in the placenta and uterus tissues in obese and normal-weight mothers. We also aim to measure the AQP5 plasma concentration. We found AQP5 dominance in the uterus and plasma at 34 weeks of normal pregnancy. The placental volume increased, and the vascularization decreased in obese mothers compared to the control. The AQP5 expression increased in the uterus of the obese group and did not change in the placenta. The TAC decreased in the plasma of overweight mothers. We hypothesize that increased AQP5 expression prolongs the length of pregnancy and inhibits the onset of contractions. Based on our findings, we can develop diagnostic tests and provide new targets for tocolytic drug development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8860a4fae5a8edb2a98f8fea74d17392268829ef7693d5caf45d3cd909594be7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
