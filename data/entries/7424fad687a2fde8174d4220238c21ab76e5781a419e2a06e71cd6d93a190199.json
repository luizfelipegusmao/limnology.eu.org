It summarizes relevant definitions and theorems, proposes valuable research hypotheses, combines grouping and insertion, and innovatively introduces the practice of \"grouped insertion.\"","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7424fad687a2fde8174d4220238c21ab76e5781a419e2a06e71cd6d93a190199","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
