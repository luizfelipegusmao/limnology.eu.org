{"title":"A Constant Voltage WPT System for AM-Modulated Implant Neural Stimulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0038/v1","date":1719814301000,"content":"Resonance inductive coupling is widely used for wireless power transfer (WPT) in medical applications. In this paper, we analyze the LCL-compensated WPT structure and propose a novel constant voltage transmission system based on gain estimation, without any extra feedback from the receiver. The system is capable for implant neural stimulation where the load impedance and the coupling coefficient are both variable. Compared to existing methods for constant voltage transmission, our approach offers advantages in compact size and the compatibility with the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band. We validate the load-independent resonant characteristic and the feasibility of constant voltage transmission using an experimental prototype working at 6.78MHz. Finally, we discuss the structure of the implant stimulator and methods of applying the proposed WPT system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3368c84617065cd9716060335531f8f4eb3d9b5d65192eefe411d7d3e31a0eaf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
