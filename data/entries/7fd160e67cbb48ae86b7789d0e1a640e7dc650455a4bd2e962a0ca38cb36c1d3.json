{"title":"Employing Phonemic Awareness in the Student&rsquo;s Language Development Leads to Transformative Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1122/v1","date":1721012035000,"content":"Employing phonemic awareness in language development can lead to transformative educational outcomes. Having mastered this skill, students have a good foundation in language comprehension, writing, and reading, which increases their chances of academic achievement. This change can affect entire classrooms and schools, fostering a culture of literacy and academic performance, rather than just a select few students. The aim of the study is to gather literature that offers substantial information about this topic based on the facts presented. The overwhelming body of research points to the benefits of teaching phonemic awareness in early childhood education. The foundation of transformative education is phonemic awareness, which fosters fundamental language and reading skills. This profound effect emphasizes how crucial phonemic awareness is to the teaching process. Educators can use phonemic awareness to boost students' language development and create a transformative learning environment by putting these guidelines into practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7fd160e67cbb48ae86b7789d0e1a640e7dc650455a4bd2e962a0ca38cb36c1d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
