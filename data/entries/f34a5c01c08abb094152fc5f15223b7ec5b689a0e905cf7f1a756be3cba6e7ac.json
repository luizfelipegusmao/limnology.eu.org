However, the higher operating temperatures (150 – 300 °C) of the SAFC make traditional Pt- supported -on carbon- electrocatalyst ill-suited for direct translation from the state-of-the-art polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) to solid oxide fuel cells. Metal-organic coordination polymers meet the expansive and varied needs of a SAFC electrode [<a href=\"#ozae044.603-B2\">2</a>] – thermal stability, chemical resistivity to the solid acid electrolyte corrosive environment, electrical conductivity, porosity to facilitate fuel mass transport, and catalytic ability towards hydrogen oxidation or oxygen reduction – thus making them one of the few options available for SAFC electrode materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.603-B3\">3</a>]. Here we investigate a metal-organic hybrid precursor material suitable for pyrolysis in inert atmospheres to create metal-doped carbonized materials in pursuit of highly electrically conductive and porous carbonaceous materials to facilitate nano-Pt catalysis and gas transport toward a more robust solid acid fuel cell electrode material.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f34a5c01c08abb094152fc5f15223b7ec5b689a0e905cf7f1a756be3cba6e7ac","category":"Environment"}
