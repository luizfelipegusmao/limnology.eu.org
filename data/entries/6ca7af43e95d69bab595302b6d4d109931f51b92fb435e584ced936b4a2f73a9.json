Tiegun maturity (DM) is an important factor influencing its quality. However, there are few studies on the impact of harvest time on its maturation. In the present study, a NMR-based metabolomics approach was applied to investigate the dynamic metabolic changes of <i>D. opposita</i> Thunb. cv. Tiegun at six different harvest stages: stage 1 (S1), stage 2 (S2), Stage 3 (S3), stage 4 (S4), stage 5 (S5) and stage 6 (S6).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Principal component analysis showed distinct segregation of samples obtained from S1, S2 and S3 compared to those derived from S4, S5 and S6. Interestingly, these samples from the two periods were obtained before and after frost, indicating that frost descent might be important for DM. Eight differential metabolites responsible for good separation of different groups were identified by the principal component analysis loading plot and partial least squares-discriminant analysis. In addition, quantitative analysis of these metabolites using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry determined the effects of harvest time on these metabolite contents, two of which, sucrose and allantoin, were considered as potential biomarkers to determine DM.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study demonstrated that NMR-based metabolomics approach could serve as a powerful tool to identify differential metabolites during harvesting processes, also offering a fresh insight into understanding the DM and the potential mechanism of quality formation. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Li An, \nHao Liu, \nMeng Li, \nJingwei Ma, \nLufei Zheng, \nJuan Zhou, \nJunfeng Zhang, \nYongliang Yuan, \nXujin Wu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"6ca7af43e95d69bab595302b6d4d109931f51b92fb435e584ced936b4a2f73a9","category":"Environment"}
