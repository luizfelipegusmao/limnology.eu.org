{"title":"Non-foliar photosynthesis and nitrogen assimilation influence grain yield in durum wheat regardless of water conditions","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/11/3412/7613626?rss=1","date":1708732800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>There is a need to generate improved crop varieties adapted to the ongoing changes in the climate. We studied durum wheat canopy and central metabolism of six different photosynthetic organs in two yield-contrasting varieties. The aim was to understand the mechanisms associated with the water stress response and yield performance. Water stress strongly reduced grain yield, plant biomass, and leaf photosynthesis, and down-regulated C/N-metabolism genes and key protein levels, which occurred mainly in leaf blades. By contrast, higher yield was associated with high ear dry weight and lower biomass and ears per area, highlighting the advantage of reduced tillering and the consequent improvement in sink strength, which promoted C/N metabolism at the whole plant level. An improved C metabolism in blades and ear bracts and N assimilation in all photosynthetic organs facilitated C/N remobilization to the grain and promoted yield. Therefore, we propose that further yield gains in Mediterranean conditions could be achieved by considering the sourceâ€“sink dynamics and the contribution of non-foliar organs, and particularly N assimilation and remobilization during the late growth stages. We highlight the power of linking phenotyping with plant metabolism to identify novel traits at the whole plant level to support breeding programmes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"c52120d6dff1419d1ebc6a30181a7fa7a5584c3210fe53e45b08812ce8e2c964","category":"Environment"}
