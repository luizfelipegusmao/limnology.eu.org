{"title":"Dispensing Error Rate in an App-Based, Semaglutide-Supported Weight-Loss Service: A Retrospective Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0092/v1","date":1719827367000,"content":"Digital weight-loss services (DWLSs) combining pharmacotherapy and health coaching have the potential to make a major contribution to the global struggle against obesity. However, there is currently no evidence to counter the widespread concern that these services enable large numbers of unsuitable patients to obtain Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA). This study retrospectively analysed the rate at which the partner pharmacy network of Australiaâ€™s largest DWLS provider committed GLP-1 RA dispensing errors over a 6-month period. The analysis found that 191 (0.14%) of the 135131 dispensed Semaglutide orders contained an error. Non-compliant dose escalation (44.5%) and dispatch errors (32.5%) were the two most common error types. Most errors (89%) were deemed to have been of medium urgency, with 6.8% considered high urgency. A disproportionate number of high urgency cases were from wrong medication (31%) and general complaint errors (15%). A Chi-square test revealed a statistically higher dispensing error rate among orders to female patients (0.16%) compared to males (0.076%). The results lay an important foundation in digital pharmacy literature and suggest that comprehensive DWLSs have the potential to safely collaborate with third-party pharmacies in dispensing GLP-1 RAs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8be31e623401f0a45d5d088823fd478cb8c811e846731a8da4a5722a5e7573b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
