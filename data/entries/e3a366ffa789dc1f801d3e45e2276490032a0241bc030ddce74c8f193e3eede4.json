{"title":"Dysnatremia as a Mortality Marker in Intensive Care Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1319/v1","date":1716228951000,"content":"Introduction: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may cause acute respiratory failure but also remains responsible for many other pathologies, including electrolyte disorders. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and disrupt water hemostasis with thirst and appetite abnormalities. Dysnatremia affects prognosis and may be associated with mortality in patients admitted to SARS-CoV2 intensive care.\nPatients and Methods: The study included 209 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit  between April 12, 2021, and March 1, 2022 who were over 18 years old and diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by clinical and thoracic tomography findings or with a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result.  \nThe laboratory markers, treatment modalities, nutritional, and respiratory support also for outcome evaluation, length of stay in the ICU, total hospitalization duration, and mortality in ICU were recorded.The laboratory marker comparison was made admission with the final assessment performed before the time of mortality in ICU or discharge.\nResults: Inotropic requirements among patients were high which was reflected in the first-month mortality. Hypernatremia presence was associated with an increase in enteral support and inotropic support requirement and mortality. Hypernatremia was correlated with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and a longer duration under mechanical ventilation. \nDiscussion: Hypernatremia was an important risk factor in ICU patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was also affected by the treatment regimens given itself. This complex relationship underlies the importance of proper electrolyte management, especially in patients who were under severe stress and organ failure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3a366ffa789dc1f801d3e45e2276490032a0241bc030ddce74c8f193e3eede4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
