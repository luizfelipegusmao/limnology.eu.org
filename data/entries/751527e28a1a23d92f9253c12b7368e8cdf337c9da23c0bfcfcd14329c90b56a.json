{"title":"A 2-Year Randomized Clinical Trial of Three Bonding Techniques in Non-carious Cervical Lesions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1636/v1","date":1713974072000,"content":"The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial was to compare the 2-year clinical performance of resin composite restorations placed at non-caries cervical lesions (NCCL) with one-step self-etch, total-etch, and selective enamel etch &amp; self-etch adhesive techniques. Thirty-two patients received three resin composite restorations each at NCCLs (Tetric EvoCeram/Ivoclar/Vivadent), bonded with a total-etch adhesive agent (ExciTE F/Ivoclar/Vivadent) and a self-etch (AdheSE One F/Ivoclar/Vivadent) without and with selective enamel etching. All restorations were evaluated by two examiners at baseline, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months post-operation regarding retention, caries occurrence, marginal adaptation, and marginal staining. A logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equations was used. After 2 years, the retention rate was 86,8% for total-etch, 92.26% for self-etch, and 93.63% for selective enamel etching &amp; self-etch. No caries were detected during all the restorations. Concerning marginal adaptation, the clinically perfect restorations were 26.9% for the total-etch technique, 16% for self-etch, and 25,9% for selective enamel etch &amp; self-etch. All three adhesive strategies provided restorations with no significant differences in the retention rate and the marginal adaptation, whereas the total etch yielded better performance for marginal staining. All the restorations were assessed as clinically acceptable after 2 years.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"751527e28a1a23d92f9253c12b7368e8cdf337c9da23c0bfcfcd14329c90b56a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
