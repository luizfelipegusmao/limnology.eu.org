{"title":"Cardiovascular Alterations in Workers Performing at High Altitude on the Etna Volcano","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2087/v1","date":1717135836000,"content":"Background: high-altitude work exposes individuals to reduced oxygen levels, imposing physi-ological adaptations. These conditions can induce alterations in the cardiovascular system, po-tentially exacerbating pre-existing health issues and impacting overall well-being of workers in such environments. This study has investigated the cardiovascular challenges for the high-altitude worker on Etna volcano. Methods: Through an observational study, ten healthy, non-smoking male participants underwent cardiovascular and pulmonary function tests at alti-tudes below 500m and above 3000m, simulating work conditions on the volcano. Results: signif-icant findings include elevated systemic blood pressure and heart rate, indicating an increased cardiovascular workload necessary for adaptation to hypoxia. Conclusions: the study highlights the importance of acclimatization to high altitude for minimizing cardiovascular risks among workers. It calls for the development of safety protocols, underlining the critical role of preven-tative measures and specific safety protocols for high-altitude workers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d2ea5dc40f14deccf52527536daf4305c96511c84604d6d4edf917bcde490530","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
