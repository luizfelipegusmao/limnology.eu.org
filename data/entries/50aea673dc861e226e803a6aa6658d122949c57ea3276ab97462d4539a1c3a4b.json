{"title":"The Use of Ground Coal Bottom Ash/Slag as a Cement Replacement for Sustainable Concrete Infrastructure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0988/v1","date":1713185716000,"content":"Cement production requires a significant amount of energy and natural resources, severely impacting the environment due to harmful gas emissions. Coal Bottom Ash (CBA) and Coal Boiler Slag (CBS), byproducts of coal-fired power plants, have pozzolanic properties. CBA and CBS can be mechanically ground to obtain Ground Coal Bottom Ash (GCBA) or Ground Coal Bottom Slag (GCBS), which can potentially replace cement in concrete, reducing waste in landfills, benefit the economy, preserving natural resources, and reducing health hazards. This study was performed to determine the optimum amount of GCBA and GCBS that can replace cement in concrete. The fresh, mechanical, and durability properties of the concrete containing GCBA were compared to a control mix consisting of 100% Portland cement. The optimum amount of cement replaced with GCBA and GCBS was 10% and 5%, respectively, based on compressive strength. The GCBA-based concrete's tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and durability properties were better than the control. The compressive strength of the GCBA and GCBS-based mortars increased with an increase in fineness. GCBA and GCBS fineness should be within the limit recommended in the ASTM C618 standard to enhance concrete or mortar properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50aea673dc861e226e803a6aa6658d122949c57ea3276ab97462d4539a1c3a4b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
