{"title":"CFD-Powered Ship Trim Optimization: Integrating ANN for User-Friendly Software Tool Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1253/v1","date":1718705013000,"content":"This study presents a comprehensive approach to trim optimization as a energy efficiency improvement measure, focusing on reducing fuel consumption for one RO-RO car carrier. Utilizing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, the methodology incorporates Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to develop a mathematical model for estimating key parameters such as brake power, daily fuel oil consumption (DFOC) and propeller speed. The complex ANN model is then integrated into a user-friendly software tool for practical engineering applications. The research outlines a seven-phase trim optimization process and discusses its potential extension to other types of ships, aiming to establish a universal methodology for CFD-based engineering analyses. Based on trim optimization results, the biggest DFOC goes up to 10.5% at 7.5m draft and up to 8% for higher drafts. Generally, in every considered case, it is recommended to sail with the trim towards the bow, meaning that the shipâ€™s weight (ballast) should be adjusted to tilt slightly forward.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"759f8eee5e1188cc3223cd5535cd677aef9d6417962f0287a7dde1a57658928b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
