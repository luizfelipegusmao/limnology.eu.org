{"title":"CHCHD2 P14L, found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, exhibits cytoplasmic mislocalization and alters Ca2+ homeostasis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae319/7723884?rss=1","date":1722297600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>CHCHD2 and CHCHD10, linked to Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia (ALS), respectively, are mitochondrial intermembrane proteins that form a heterodimer. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the CHCHD2 P14L variant, implicated in ALS, on mitochondrial function and its subsequent effects on cellular homeostasis. The missense variant of CHCHD2, P14L, found in a cohort of patients with ALS, mislocalized CHCHD2 to the cytoplasm, leaving CHCHD10 in the mitochondria. <span>Drosophila</span> lacking the <span>CHCHD2</span> ortholog exhibited mitochondrial degeneration. In contrast, human CHCHD2 P14L, but not wild-type human CHCHD2, failed to suppress this degeneration, suggesting that P14L is a pathogenic variant. The mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering capacity was reduced in <span>Drosophila</span> neurons expressing human CHCHD2 P14L. The altered Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffering phenotype was also observed in cultured human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells expressing CHCHD2 P14L. In these cells, transient elevation of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> facilitated the activation of calpain and caspase-3, accompanied by the processing and insolubilization of TDP-43. These observations suggest that CHCHD2 P14L causes abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and TDP-43 aggregation, reflecting the pathophysiology of ALS.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"e183ab875b28772d4dd6b77d397376fd6e4dfc7b19206e73c2e728ed52862923","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
