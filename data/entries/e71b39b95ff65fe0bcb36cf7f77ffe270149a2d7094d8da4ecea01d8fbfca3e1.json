{"title":"Experimental Study on the Cutting Characteristics of King Grass Stalk under Different Physical Properties and Mechanical Parameters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0730/v1","date":1718106673000,"content":"To guide the design and optimization of King Grass (KG) harvesting machinery, this paper studied the cutting characteristics of KG stalks under different physical properties and mechanical parameters. A cutting device that can achieve different parameter adjustments was designed, and indoor cutting experiments were conducted. The results of the single factor experiment show that with the increase of moisture content and stalk height, the ultimate shear stress (USS) and unit-area cutting energy consumption (UCEC) gradually decrease. The optimal range of blade clearance for cutting KG stalks is 2.0-4.0 mm. The optimal value range for oblique cutting angle is 10 ° -40 °. The reasonable range of skew cutting angle is 10 °-20 °. The optimal range for sliding cutting angle is 20 ° - 40 °. The response surface methodology was used to conduct parameter optimization experiments. The regression models were established for various factors and the USS, as well as the UCEC. The optimal combination of cutting parameters has been determined. Under this parameter setting, the USS is 0.4 MPa and UCEC is 3.5 mJ/mm2. The average relative errors between the predicted and experimental values of USS and UCEC were 6.34% and 4.71%, respectively. This indicates that the model can correct reflect the mathematical relationship between various factors and USS and UCEC. This study provides theoretical support for the design of KG harvesting machinery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e71b39b95ff65fe0bcb36cf7f77ffe270149a2d7094d8da4ecea01d8fbfca3e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
