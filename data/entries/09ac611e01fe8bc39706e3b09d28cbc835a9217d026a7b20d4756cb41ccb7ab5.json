{"title":"Precipitation impacts the physicochemical water quality and abundance of microbial source tracking markers in urban Texas watersheds","link":"https://journals.plos.org/water/article?id=10.1371/journal.pwat.0000209","date":1706796000000,"content":"<p>by Kiran Kumar Vadde, Sina V.

Water samples (n = 316 and 107 for dry and wet events, respectively) were collected biweekly from eight sampling sites (6 sites from creeks and ponds, and 2 well sites) during two-year monitoring and analyzed for six physico-chemical parameters and ten qPCR-based assays targeting general (<i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>, <i>Enterococcus</i>, and universal <i>Bacteroidales</i>), human (BacHum and HF183), animal (Rum2Bac, BacCow, BacCan), and avian (Chicken/Duck-Bac and GFD) fecal markers. Elevated concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub>-N and NO<sub>2</sub>-N were observed in ponds and creeks sites during wet weather. Fecal markers analysis indicated higher concentrations of Rum2Bac, BacCow, and BacCan markers in most of pond and creek sites under wet weather, suggesting stormwater runoff contributed to non-point sources of fecal contamination by animal sources. Furthermore, sporadically higher concentrations of these markers were detected at groundwater sampling sites, demonstrating the significant human health risk. Multivariate statistical analysis such as cluster analysis (CA) and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed to identify relationship between sampling sites; while CA majorly classified ponds, creeks, and well sites separately, PCoA identified similarities in water quality characteristics between waters of wells with ponds and creeks. Overall, results indicate ruminant and dog fecal contamination is a major concern during storm events, consequently impacting surface and groundwater quality of the study.","author":"Kiran Kumar Vadde","siteTitle":"PLOS Water","siteHash":"76ba47a8597c89f4cf217272433133ba8aa6d0dba9c907d21e63f90c34e21e00","entryHash":"09ac611e01fe8bc39706e3b09d28cbc835a9217d026a7b20d4756cb41ccb7ab5","category":"Environment"}
