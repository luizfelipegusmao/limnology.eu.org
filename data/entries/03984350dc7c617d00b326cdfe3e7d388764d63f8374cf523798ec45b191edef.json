{"title":"Influence of introducing a story stem in an interactive play context on maternal and their four-year-old children’s use of mental state language","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311237","date":1727704800000,"content":"<p>by Mette Skovgaard Væver, Camilla Overbye Roos, Johanne Smith-Nielsen, Ida Egmose, Katrine Isabella Wendelboe, Anne Christine Stuart</p>\r\n\r\nMaternal and child mental state language is associated with improved socioemotional and cognitive child development. This study examined if introducing a story stem (a narrative playing out socioemotional conflicts) in a play situation facilitated maternal and child mental state language compared to a free-play (baseline) situation, and if mothers and children with low baseline mental state language profited more from the story stem situation. Participants were 101 four-year-old children and their mothers. Maternal and child mental state language correlated and providing the story stem increased both maternal and child mental state language. Providing a story stem increased mental state language more for mothers and children groups with lowest mental state language at baseline compared to a high mental state language group. The results indicate a validation of the use of story stems to increase maternal and child mental state language within a typical population.","author":"Mette Skovgaard Væver","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"03984350dc7c617d00b326cdfe3e7d388764d63f8374cf523798ec45b191edef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
