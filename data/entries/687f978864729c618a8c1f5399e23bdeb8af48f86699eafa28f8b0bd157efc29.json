{"title":"Determination of energy values in pistachio shell powder and soybean hulls fed to gestating and lactating sows","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae135/7756380?rss=1","date":1726099200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pistachio shell powder is a high-fiber co-product from the pistachio nut industry that may provide energy and nutrients in animal diets, but no data have been reported for the nutritional value of pistachio shell powder when fed to pigs. Two experiments were, therefore, conducted to test the hypothesis that apparent total tract digestibility (<strong>ATTD</strong>) of gross energy (<strong>GE</strong>), dry matter (<strong>DM</strong>), and total dietary fiber (<strong>TDF</strong>) and concentration of digestible energy (<strong>DE</strong>) in pistachio shell powder are not different from those in soybean hulls when fed to gestating or lactating sows. In experiment 1, 24 gestating sows were housed in metabolism crates and fed a corn-based basal diet or 2 diets that contained corn and 20% pistachio shell powder or corn and 20% soybean hulls. Sows were fed experimental diets for 13 d with feces and urine being quantitatively collected for 4 d after 6 d of adaptation. In experiment 2, 24 lactating sows were housed in farrowing crates and fed a diet based on corn and soybean meal (<strong>SBM</strong>) or 2 diets that contained corn, SBM, and 20% of either pistachio shell powder or soybean hulls, and feces were collected for 6 d after 7 d of adaptation to the diets. Results indicated that for gestating sows, the diet containing soybean hulls had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) ATTD of DM, GE, and TDF than the diet containing pistachio shell powder. The DE and metabolizable energy (<strong>ME</strong>) in the pistachio shell powder diet were less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) than in the basal diet and the diet containing soybean hulls. The ME in pistachio shells (2,606 kcal/kg DM) was less (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) than in soybean hulls (3,645 kcal/kg DM). When fed to lactating sows, ATTD of DM, GE, and TDF in the diet containing pistachio shell powder was less (<span>P &lt; </span>0.05) than in the diet containing soybean hulls or in the basal diet. The DE in the diet containing pistachio shell powder was also less (<span>P </span>&lt; 0.05) than in the soybean hulls diet. The DE in pistachio shell powder (1,664 kcal/kg DM) was less (<span>P </span>&lt; 0.05) than in soybean hulls (2,795 kcal/kg DM). In conclusion, the ATTD of DM and GE and the DE in pistachio shell powder were less than in soybean hulls, and inclusion in lactation diets, therefore, needs to be limited.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"687f978864729c618a8c1f5399e23bdeb8af48f86699eafa28f8b0bd157efc29","category":"Environment"}
