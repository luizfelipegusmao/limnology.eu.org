{"title":"The Seismic Performance of Self-Centering Ribbed Floor Flat Beam Frame Joints","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1530/v1","date":1713888052000,"content":"To achieve rapid post-earthquake repair of self-centering ribbed floor flat beam frame structures, a ductile hybrid joint consisting of dog bone weakened energy dissipating steel bars connected to the upper and lower column sections through high-strength threads based on the damage control design concept is proposed. By moving the ductile energy dissipating zone out to the locally weakened section of the energy dissipating steel bars and the locally unbonded prestressed steel bars in the core area, the residual deformation was limited and the seismic performance was improved. Based on the working principle of hybrid joints, low cycle loading tests were conducted on two joint specimens to analyze the influence of lateral prestress on the seismic performance of the hybrid joints. Numerical modeling methods were used to compare the position of the energy-consuming steel bars in the composite layer and the friction performance of joints. The research results indicated that the hybrid joint had stable load-bearing, deformation, and energy dissipation capabilities, with damage primarily concentrated on the energy-consuming steel bars. Even at an inter-story displacement angle of 5.5%, the upper and lower column segments remained elastic. After unloading, the connection seam at the joint was closed, and the self-centering performance was good. When the inter-story displacement angle reached 5.5%, the lateral prestress increased from 150 kN to 250 kN, the ultimate bearing capacity of the joint increased by 16.3%, and the cumulative energy consumption increased by 30.0%. The influence of the friction coefficient of the joint surface on the structural performance was set at a threshold of 0.7. When it was less than the threshold, the ultimate bearing capacity and initial stiffness of the joint increased with an increase in the friction coefficient. After reaching the threshold, the increase in the ultimate bearing capacity of the joint slowed down, and the rate of stiffness degradation gradually accelerated. This joint had excellent seismic performance and can also achieve post-earthquake repair of structures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a4f113973024b0b8f4f871dcd8638d557466a55d98fe32c0b86dedc633b50b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
