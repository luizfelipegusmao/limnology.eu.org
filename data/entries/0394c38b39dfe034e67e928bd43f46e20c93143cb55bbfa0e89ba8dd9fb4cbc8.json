{"title":"White Hydrogen (H2) from Scrap Aluminium (Al3+) Dross: Transformation of Industrial Waste into a Fuel Source for the Future","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0507/v1","date":1725594982000,"content":"Aluminium dross is the industrial waste from aluminium refining industry and accordance with toxic waste materials, it’s also recognized as a by-product of aluminium production, has historically posed significant environmental challenges due to its toxic and reactive nature. However, recent advancements in technology have revealed the potential of transforming aluminium dross into a valuable source of white hydrogen. This review paper explores the methodologies, benefits, and challenges associated with this transformation. By analysing current research and industrial practices, our review highlighted the potential of this innovative approach to mitigate waste and contribute to sustainable energy solutions. In addition, the utilization of Aluminium dross can be considered as innovative and advancement in sustainable waste management strategy instead of direct disposal, and hot springs use advances in direct utilization. Our experimental work achieved white hydrogen maximum flowrate at 600 sec. with 120ºC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0394c38b39dfe034e67e928bd43f46e20c93143cb55bbfa0e89ba8dd9fb4cbc8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
