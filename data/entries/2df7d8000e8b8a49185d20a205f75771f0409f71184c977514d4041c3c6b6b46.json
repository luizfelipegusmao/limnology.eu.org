{"title":"Recent Proteomics, Metabolomics, Lipidomics Approaches in Meat Safety, Processing and Quality Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1557/v1","date":1716535709000,"content":"With a view to understand and resolve the complexity of the food matrix, ohmic technologies alone or in combination were extensively employed. In this sense, the newest developments and advances of proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics whith their unique benefits could simplify and understand the link between physiological and pathological activities in biology, physiology, pathology, and food science and processing. This review aims to briefly introduce the basis of proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, then expansively review their impact on the assessment of meat quality and safety. Here, also, we discuss the application of proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics for the authentication and adulteration of meat and meat derivatives from different sources, and provides some perspectives regarding the use of emerging techniques such as rapid mass spectrometry (MS) and non-invasive measurements for the analysis of meat quality and safety. This paper summarizes all significant investigation in these matters, and underlines the advances in analytical chemistry technologies and meat science areas. By emphasizing the requirement for additional examinations, this paper attempts a comprehensive knowledge of “foodomics” and their potential to improve their employment in meat science.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2df7d8000e8b8a49185d20a205f75771f0409f71184c977514d4041c3c6b6b46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
