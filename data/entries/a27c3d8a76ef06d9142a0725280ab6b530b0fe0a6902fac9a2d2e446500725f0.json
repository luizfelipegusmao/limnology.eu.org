Claudin-7 has also been shown to be involved in cancer metastasis and invasion. Here, we test our hypothesis that claudin-7 plays an important role in regulating colonic intestinal stem cell function. Conditional knockout of <i>Cldn7</i> in the colon led to impaired epithelial cell differentiation, hyperproliferative epithelium, a decrease in active stem cells, and dramatically altered gene expression profiles. In 3D colonoid culture, claudin-7–deficient crypts were unable to survive and form spheroids, emphasizing the importance of claudin-7 in stem cell survival. Inhibition of the Hippo pathway or activation of Notch signaling partially rescued the defective stem cell behavior. Concurrent Notch activation and Hippo inhibition resulted in restored colonoid survival, growth, and differentiation to the level comparable to those of wild-type derived crypts. In this study, we highlight the essential role of claudin-7 in regulating Notch and Hippo signaling–dependent colonic stem cell functions, including survival, self-renewal, and differentiation. These new findings may shed light on potential avenues to explore for drug development in colorectal cancer.</p>","author":"Amna N. Naser, \nTiaosi Xing, \nRodney Tatum, \nQun Lu, \nPhilip J.
