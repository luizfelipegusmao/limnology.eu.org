{"title":"Unlocking the Puzzle: Investigating the Role of Interleukin 17 Genetic Polymorphisms, Circulating Lymphocytes, and Serum Levels in Venezuelan Women with Recurrent Pregnancy Loss","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0299/v1","date":1722905893000,"content":"The immune response is crucial in Pregnancy Loss (RPL), which affects 1-2% of women. In RPL, peripheral blood lymphocytes and local immune cells are activated with a concomitant decrease in the leukocyte tolerogenic response in the uterus and decidua. IL-17 plays an essential role in T cell activation, weakening tolerogenic responses of the T cells. The report aims to analyze the IL-17 genetic polymorphism, circulating IL-17 lymphocyte populations, the reaction upon lymphocyte priming, the amount of cytokine in serum, and the number of T-reg cells in a group of 50 RPL and 50 normal women from the admixed Venezuelan population. No differences were observed in the genetic polymorphisms rs2275913 and rs763780. A significant decrease (P&amp;lt;0.001) was observed in RPL patients compared to controls in the IL-17+ cell populations CD3+, CD8+, CD56+, and CD4CD25 FoxP3, but not in the CD4IL17+ cells. The response upon cell priming was significantly decreased (P&amp;lt;0.001) in all subpopulations of RPL as compared to controls. It is concluded that despite the increase in IL-17A in the serum of patients, the number of circulating IL-17 cells and the lymphocyte response to stimulation was significantly decreased (p&amp;lt;0.001). No differences in the genetic polymorphism compared to controls suggest that biological factors influence IL-17 levels in RPL patients, which must be carefully studied.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cca86430035acb14a02e0407f5a27c22a9ed064e1d4a304ad50b9231dfca3534","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
