{"title":"Graph Neural Network and Increment Learning in Blockchain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2117/v1","date":1727354855000,"content":"This paper investigates the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and incremental learning for blockchain applications, with a focus on fraud detection, anomaly detection, and smart contract verification. By leveraging graph structure exploitation, GNNs can propagate information across nodes, reducing label dependency. Incremental learning enhances the model's adaptability to evolving blockchain networks, allowing continual learning without full retraining. Together, these technologies provide a scalable, efficient solution for improving security, performance, and adaptability in decentralized financial systems and smart contract environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"715a010b216d68d52844cce4bfd787da48bffa89d92d151fa820b92cb46fce1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
