{"title":"Responses to sound in three Centrarchid species: Do heterospecific interactions change behavior?","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15955?af=R","date":1728283128000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Due to the increasing prevalence and variety of underwater anthropogenic noise sources, and the growing human population, anthropogenic noise has the potential to negatively impact aquatic organisms. With this growing threat, the question of how fishes respond to this stressor in their natural environments becomes more urgent. The current study used behavioral trials with bluegill sunfish <i>Lepomis macrochirus</i>, pumpkinseed sunfish <i>Lepomis gibbosus</i>, and rock bass <i>Ambloplites rupestris</i>, both in isolation and in a heterospecific trial, to determine how behaviors indicative of stress were influenced by interspecific interactions when exposed to recordings of pure tones and boat motors. Regardless of social context, all three species experienced an increase in fin beats per second, an increase in time spent at the bottom of the pen, and a decrease in time spent swimming when exposed to boat noise. Fishes in heterospecific trials experienced more fin beats per second and spent less time swimming, but there was no significant difference when comparing time spent at the bottom of pen with fish in individual trials. Our findings of behavioral changes when exposed to acoustic stimuli, in two social contexts, allow for a deeper understanding of interspecific effects and provide insight into how varied field studies can be useful in studying fish behavior when encountering acoustic stressors.</p>","author":"Taylor A.
