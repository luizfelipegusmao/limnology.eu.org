{"title":"mRNA Trafficking and Local Translation: Shaping Mitochondria in the Synapse","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1029/v1","date":1723684133000,"content":"Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that can adjust and respond to different stimuli within a cell. This plastic ability allows them to effectively coordinate several cellular functions in cells and becomes particularly relevant in highly complex cells such as neurons. An imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics can disrupt mitochondrial function, leading to abnormal cellular function and ultimately to a range of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders.\nRegulation of mRNA transport and local translation inside neurons is crucial for maintaining the proteome of distal mitochondria, which is vital for energy production and synaptic function. A significant portion of the axonal transcriptome is dedicated to mRNAs for mitochondrial proteins, emphasizing the importance of local translation in sustaining mitochondrial function in areas far from the cell body.\nIn neurons, local translation and the regulation of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial-shaping proteins could be essential for synaptic plasticity and neuronal health. The dynamics of these mRNAs, including their transport and local translation, may influence the morphology and function of mitochondria, thereby affecting the overall energy status and responsiveness of synapses. Comprehending the mitochondria-related mRNAs regulation and local translation, as well as its influence on mitochondrial morphology near the synapses will help to better understand neuronal physiology and neurological diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired synaptic plasticity play a central role.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92a21b8b7f6be04866349c862c3d495da2eed8ba2729960c824668ff8d9dbaaf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
