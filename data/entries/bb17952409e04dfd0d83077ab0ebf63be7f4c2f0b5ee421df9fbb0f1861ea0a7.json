{"title":"Design and Synthesis of Novels Alkylglycerols based Acetylenic Derivatives from 1,10-Decanediol and Stearolic Acid Analogues of Bioactive Ether Lipids","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1576/v1","date":1716475679000,"content":"Resistance to the existing drugs and increasing numbers of diseases result in identifying new drug candidates with new forms of activity. Marine sources of alkylglycerols such as the liver oil Shark (SLO) mixture of certain species or rat fish (elasmobranch fishes) contain high levels of these compounds as a mixture of few species varying by length and unsaturation or saturation of the alkyl chain. They have multiple biological activities such as hematopoiesis stimulation, lowering radiotherapy-induced injuries, reducing tumor growth and improving vaccination efficiency. The synthesis of two Alkylglycerols (AKGs) containing at least one alkyne moiety in the alkyl chain has been reported. In this work, we describe the synthesis of others unknown AKGs based alkyne 1-O-(hexadec-11’-ynyl)-sn-glycerol 4 and 1-O-(octadec-9’-ynyl)-sn-glycerol 5 as analogues of bioactive ether lipids found in the SLO mixture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb17952409e04dfd0d83077ab0ebf63be7f4c2f0b5ee421df9fbb0f1861ea0a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
