{"title":"Arbutin abrogates cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity via upregulating Nrf2/HO-1 and suppressing genotoxicity, NF-κB/iNOS/TNF-α and caspase-3/Bax/Bcl2 signaling pathways in rats","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae075/7676327?rss=1","date":1715990400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Background: Cisplatin is a potent anticancer agent widely employed in chemotherapy. However, cisplatin leads to toxicity on non-targeted healthy organs, including the liver. We investigated the hepatoprotective mechanism of arbutin (ARB), a glycosylated hydroquinone, against cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity. Methods: Rats were orally administered with ARB (ARB1 = 50 mg/kg; ARB2 = 100 mg/kg) for 14 consecutive days against hepatotoxicity induced by a single dose of cisplatin (10 mg/kg) on day 15. Three days after the intraperitoneal cisplatin injection, serum and liver tissue were collected for subsequent analyses. Results: Cisplatin triggered marked increases in serum AST, ALT, and ALP activities, hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) coupled with a considerable diminution in hepatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and the concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH). The gene expressions of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and IL-6 were notably increased. The pre-administration of ARB1 and ARB2 reduced AST, ALT and ALP in serum and restored SOD, CAT, GSH, ROS, MDA and cytokine levels which was also evidenced by alleviated hepatic lesions. Further, cisplatin-induced prominent alterations in the gene expressions of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), iNOS, NF-κB, Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3 and 8-OHdG in the liver. Interestingly, ARB protected the liver and mitigated the cisplatin-induced alterations in serum AST, ALT, ALP, and reduced hepatic redox markers, 8-OdG, inflammatory markers and gene expressions. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that ARB is a potential protective adjuvant against cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity via inhibition of hepatic oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"3836b6e3e8f6c2479d46e2349c88fe10069373df392e7d18b5f3a27d53c1de0a","category":"Environment"}
