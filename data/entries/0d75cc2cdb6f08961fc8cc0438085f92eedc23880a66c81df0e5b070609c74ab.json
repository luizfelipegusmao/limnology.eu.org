{"title":"Oreonectes yuedongensis (Cypriniformes, Nemacheilidae), a new freshwater fish species from the Lianhua Mountains in eastern Guangdong, China","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15909?af=R","date":1725275128000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In this work, we describe a new species of the genus <i>Oreonectes</i>, <i>Oreonectes yuedongensis</i> sp. nov., collected from the Lianhua Mountains in eastern Guangdong, China. Phylogenetic trees constructed based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b (<i>Cyt b</i>) gene showed that this new species represents an independent evolutionary lineage, with uncorrected genetic distances (Kimura 2-parameter model) from congeners ranging from 5.1% to 8.3%. In addition, nuclear DNA analysis indicated <i>O. yuedongensis</i> as an independent lineage separate from its closely related species. Morphologically, the new species can be distinguished from other six species in the genus <i>Oreonectes</i> by a combination of serial characters. The description of this new species suggests that it is necessary to reassess the biodiversity of <i>Oreonectes platycephalus</i> as a complex, especially in the middle reaches of the Pearl River near the border between Guangdong and Guangxi. Morphological and genetic evidence supports <i>O. yenlingi</i> as a synonym of <i>O. platycephalus</i>.</p>","author":"Chang‐Ting Lan, \nTao Luo, \nXin‐Rui Zhao, \nJing Yu, \nNing Xiao, \nJiang Zhou","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"0d75cc2cdb6f08961fc8cc0438085f92eedc23880a66c81df0e5b070609c74ab","category":"Environment"}
