{"title":"Rice false smut virulence protein subverts host chitin perception and signaling at lemma and palea for floral infection","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/2000/7595670?rss=1","date":1706659200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The flower-infecting fungus <span>Ustilaginoidea virens</span> causes rice false smut, which is a severe emerging disease threatening rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) production worldwide. False smut not only reduces yield, but more importantly produces toxins on grains, posing a great threat to food safety. <span>U. virens</span> invades spikelets via the gap between the 2 bracts (lemma and palea) enclosing the floret and specifically infects the stamen and pistil. Molecular mechanisms for the <span>U. virens</span>–rice interaction are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that rice flowers predominantly employ chitin-triggered immunity against <span>U. virens</span> in the lemma and palea, rather than in the stamen and pistil. We identify a crucial <span>U. virens</span> virulence factor, named UvGH18.1, which carries glycoside hydrolase activity. Mechanistically, UvGH18.1 functions by binding to and hydrolyzing immune elicitor chitin and interacting with the chitin receptor CHITIN ELICITOR BINDING PROTEIN (OsCEBiP) and co-receptor CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE1 (OsCERK1) to impair their chitin-induced dimerization, suppressing host immunity exerted at the lemma and palea for gaining access to the stamen and pistil. Conversely, pretreatment on spikelets with chitin induces a defense response in the lemma and palea, promoting resistance against <span>U. virens</span>. Collectively, our data uncover a mechanism for a <span>U. virens</span> virulence factor and the critical location of the host–pathogen interaction in flowers and provide a potential strategy to control rice false smut disease.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"1f8fd42561876747615368b07a03f73655146e552fe17d493cfe7f8a886661be","category":"Environment"}
