{"title":"Spatial ecology and population dynamics of brown trout Salmo trutta L. in reservoirs and headwater tributaries","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15814?af=R","date":1721628921000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This investigation compared the spatial ecology and population dynamics of brown trout <i>Salmo trutta</i> L. between reservoirs with (impact; Langsett Reservoir) and without (control; Grimwith Reservoir) barriers to fish movements into headwater tributaries, and the effectiveness of a fish pass intended to remediate connectivity. Passive integrated transponder (PIT) telemetry revealed that fish that emigrated from Langsett and Grimwith tributaries were 1–3 and 0–2 years old, respectively, and predominantly did so in spring and autumn-early winter in both systems. Weirs at Langsett Reservoir appeared to thwart emigration rate (26%) relative to Grimwith Reservoir (85%). Acoustic telemetry (two-dimensional positions) in the impacted reservoir revealed that the largest home range was in October–December (95% monthly activity space S.D. up to 26.9 ± 6.69 ha in November), activity was influenced by both month and time of day, and fish occupied shallow water depths (relative to reservoir depth), especially at night. Brown trout tagged in Grimwith and Langsett Reservoirs (42.9% and 64.1%, respectively) and fish tagged in the tributaries that emigrated (37.2% and 27.7%, respectively) were detected immigrating into tributaries throughout the year. At both reservoirs, peak immigration for ≥3-year-old trout occurred primarily in autumn-early winter. Overall passage efficiency went from 3% prior to remediation to 14% after and there was no significant increase in fish densities following the construction of the fish pass. Fish were attracted towards and entered the fish pass under a wide range of river levels, but only succeeded in passing upstream during low levels, which are uncommon druing the main migration period. Overall, this investigation significantly furthers our understanding of brown trout spatial ecology and population dynamics in reservoirs and headwater tributaries.  </p>","author":"Jamie R.
