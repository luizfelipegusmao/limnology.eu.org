{"title":"Evaluation of Topical Administration of Low Molecular Weight Hyaluronic Acid (LMWHA) Solution and High Concentration Oxygen (HCO) versus Hyaluronic Acid (HA) Alone in the Improvement of Urinary Incontinence: A Double Center Retrospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0624/v1","date":1723156144000,"content":"Objectives: To rate the effects of low molecular weight hyaluronic acid (LMWHA) solution and high concentration oxygen (HCO) through a specific medical device (Caress Flow©), compared to topical administration of hyaluronic acid (HA) alone on symptoms of mild and moderate stress and mixed urinary incontinence in women with genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM).\nMethods: A total of 68 postmenopausal women were enrolled (from October 2021 to September 2023). Patients were separated in two groups: one group used therapy with LMWHA solution and HCO combined and the second group used therapy with HA alone. Patient Global Impres-sion of Improvement (PGI-I) as the first outcome was used. As secondary outcomes International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - short form (ICIQ-SF) questionnaire and Internation-al Quality of Life (IQoL) questionnaire were used.\nResults: Sixty-eight (68) women, 35 (51%) and 33 (49%), were treated with LMWHA solution and HCO combined and HA alone for 10 weeks, respectively. 28 (80%) versus 7 (20%) women reported an improvement (PGI-I score ≤3) of the symptoms in LMWHA solution and HCO com-bined group versus HA alone group. According to the ICIQ-SF, a statistically significant differ-ence was recorded after treatment between the two groups (median, 7 [5-11] vs 10 [8-11]; P = 0.03). According to the IQoL questionnaire, a statistically significantly lower median score was recorded in the LMWHA solution and HCO combined compared with the HA group, before (71 [IQR 55-81] vs 89 [IQR 67-94]; P &lt; 0.01) and after (78 [IQR 65-86] vs 88 [IQR 72-99]; P = 0.04) treatment.\nConclusions: LMWHA solution and HCO combined might improve the mild and moderate stress and mixed urinary incontinence in this set of women and that it is superior to HA therapy alone. However, these results need to be confirmed in further studies with a controlled design and a larger population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e9244b577699b0f471e337b7cd9bb225fa718317501ed775c1e1369e981c2bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
