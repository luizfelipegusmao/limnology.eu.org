{"title":"Assessment of the Thermomechanical Behavior and Microstructure of AA 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy Lap Joints at Optimal Predicted FSW Process Parameters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1622/v1","date":1716549672000,"content":"Lap joints were friction stir welded in AA 7075-T6 at 1320 rpm and using two welding speeds: 70 mm/min and 120 mm/min. The temperature profiles of the weld zone were registered during the process; furthermore, the microhardness, tensile strength, and microstructure of the joints produced were examined.\nThis study brings new insights into the thermomechanical behavior of the material during the process. The peak temperature obtained with the lower welding speed (70 mm/min) is 10% higher than that obtained with the higher speed (120 mm/min). Moreover, a 5% increase in microhardness and a 6% increase in tensile strength were were observed increasing the welding speed. Addition-ally, the microstructure examination demonstrated that, by decreasing the welding speed, the larger interaction between the tool and the material results in a deeper stir zone due to the increased heat diffusion downwards to the material. This heat flow affects the thermal profile and influences the resulting mechanical properties of the welded joints.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a83735788d821516af47839491468d28ad3cea40c406f975f9845acb00162c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
