{"title":"PSII-1 Weaning as prenatal stress: preliminary study on indicators of calf resiliency","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/433/7757023?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Maternal stressors have been reported to alter fetal development in many species. During pregnancy beef cattle are subjected to different potential stressors, such as weaning their current offspring, as part of beef production practices. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between weaning method as a prenatal maternal stress and the effect on offspring resiliency. Multiparous cows were weaned of their calves in the fall of 2022 using either abrupt (A), fenceline (F), or nose-flap (N) weaning methods (n = 30 per group). Calves born from these cows the following spring (2023) were followed for birthweights, morbidity, and mortality. Mean estimated fetal age at exposure was 126 d (range 66 to 219 d) using breed averages for gestational length. Cognitive tests were performed at 2 mo of age using an outdoor arena to continuously monitor calves during 2 min of initial isolation, 2 min exposed to a novel object, and 1 min of exposure to a human in the arena. Tests were performed sequentially, and treatments were balanced across days. Prenatal exposure to A was associated with a 74.8 (2.5 to 2,237.3, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) and 21.5 (1.2 to 385.7, <span>P</span> = 0.03) times increase in the odds of calves being stillborn or failure to thrive within 24 h of birth compared with F or N, respectively. There was no difference in morbidity or mortality during d 1 to 60. Birthweights were available on one-half of the calves from each group and showed no statistical difference; however, there was a 4.53 kg numerical difference between A and N groups. Behavioral data from a subset of 36 calves (A = 14, F = 11, and N = 11) was assessed for time spent standing, moving, exploring, duration in the open center vs. perimeter of the arena. There was a tendency for A exposed calves to spend more time in the perimeter after being confronted with a novel object compared with N exposed calves (mean difference of percent of total test time in perimeter from isolation to novel object test: A = 24.0 ± 23.9 %, N = -2.9 ± 22.1 %, <span>P</span> = 0.08). Fenceline exposed calves spent more time moving during initial isolation than either abrupt or nose-flap (69.3 ± 14.7 %, 50.6 ± 11.9 %, and 69.9 ± 17.8 % for A, F, N, respectively (<span>P</span> = 0.01 for A vs F and F vs N). These behavioral and physiological indicators support a potential divergence in survivability and coping mechanisms associated with prenatal exposure to different weaning methods. Future research will evaluate different dimensions of cognitive performance as well as increasing sample size.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"eeab7677fe4828ed3f68cf570806766e847d55e658d5b64f498b1d2b90077935","category":"Environment"}
