The development of AI is currently facing a crisis of trust. Therefore, the governance of AGI industry must be prioritized and the opportunity of the implementation of the Interim Administrative Measures for Generative Artificial Intelligence Services should be taken. It is necessary to enhance the norms for the supervision and management of scientific and technological ethics within the framework of the rule of law. Additionally, it is also essential to continuously improve the regulatory system for liability, balance the dual values of fair competition and innovation encouragement, and strengthen data security protection systems in the field of AI. All of these will enable coordinated governance across multiple domains, stakeholders, systems, and tools.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72f8137a790dc2a83c13fd245ecd9e72bd8791b011475bfbdeba9dd4221d0423","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
