{"title":"Preliminary Analysis of Protein Catalytic Ability and Catalytic Structure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1526/v1","date":1721313950000,"content":"When water molecules or other particles collide with protein molecules in a solution, the protein molecules absorb some of the momentum and deform, forming a certain molecular potential energy. When a protein molecule in a high-energy state changes to a stable state, if there is a suitable substrate binding and the potential energy of the protein molecule is greater than the energy required to break the substrate chemical bond, catalytic action will occur. The α-helices and β-folds in protein molecules play a major role in converting the kinetic energy of water molecules into their own potential energy due to the large number of amino acids involved and their regular structure. The internal structural deformation of proteins caused by the impact of water molecules on α-helices and β-folds also has a profound impact on the structure of substrates. ‌","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d0d371d1e692b371af341c83568016ab88be1158172cbca4e0cadbb832864a98","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
