{"title":"Is the diel cycle of routine metabolic rate in mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) affected by near‐infrared lighting used for visualizing behavior of fishes at night?","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15930?af=R","date":1726459190000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The metabolic rate of a freely moving fish (routine metabolic rate) is tightly coupled with volitional movement (spontaneous activity), both of which commonly show strong daily cycles linked to the species-specific diel activity pattern. Mummichog (<i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>), an important estuarine fish in the north western Atlantic Ocean, are historically reported as diurnal (i.e., more active during daylight). Our recent laboratory studies on a Bay of Fundy population, however, showed a free-running (i.e., similarly active daytime and night-time) or even nocturnal (i.e., more active at night-time) diel activity pattern. In the laboratory, near-infrared (NIR) illumination is commonly used with a NIR-sensitive camera to visualize fish activity across the light–dark periods of the day. Because NIR light is close to the visible light spectrum and certain fishes show sensitivity to NIR, the use of NIR with mummichog possibly could disturb the animals and obscure the identification of their true diel activity pattern. We aimed to determine if NIR illumination (940 nm wavelength) influences the diel activity pattern of mummichog. We used measurements of routine metabolic rate (oxygen consumption rate, MO<sub>2</sub>) as a proxy for activity, as evaluating the effect of NIR requires treatments where NIR lights are off, which precludes visualization and direct assessment of fish activity at night-time. We measured routine MO<sub>2</sub> of mummichogs over 6 days, exposed to either NIR off–on–off (2 days for each off or on period) or the opposite sequence of NIR on–off–on (to control for time-dependent effects). NIR lights did not influence the diel cycle of routine MO<sub>2</sub>, and activity by proxy, in mummichog. Thus, NIR illumination is a suitable method to visualize mummichog during light–dark diel cycles. Routine MO<sub>2</sub>, and presumably activity, was similar or higher during night-time periods compared to daytime periods, confirming a free-running or nocturnal activity pattern for at least certain populations of mummichog.</p>","author":"Annie M.
