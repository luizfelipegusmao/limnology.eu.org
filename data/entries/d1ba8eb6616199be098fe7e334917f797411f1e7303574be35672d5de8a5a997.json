{"title":"Functional divergence of Arabidopsis REPRESSOR OF UV-B PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 and 2 in repression of flowering","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1563/7416824?rss=1","date":1699833600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Photoperiodic plants coordinate the timing of flowering with seasonal light cues, thereby optimizing their sexual reproductive success. The WD40-repeat protein REPRESSOR OF UV-B PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 2 (RUP2) functions as a potent repressor of UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) photoreceptor-mediated UV-B induction of flowering under noninductive, short-day conditions in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>); however, in contrast, the closely related RUP1 seems to play no major role. Here, analysis of chimeric <span>ProRUP1:RUP2</span> and <span>ProRUP2:RUP1</span> expression lines suggested that the distinct functions of RUP1 and RUP2 in repressing flowering are due to differences in both their coding and regulatory DNA sequences. Artificial altered expression using tissue-specific promoters indicated that RUP2 functions in repressing flowering when expressed in mesophyll and phloem companion cells, whereas RUP1 functions only when expressed in phloem companion cells. Endogenous <span>RUP1</span> expression in vascular tissue was quantified as lower than that of <span>RUP2</span>, likely underlying the functional difference between RUP1 and RUP2 in repressing flowering. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of phloem vasculature expression of <span>RUP2</span> in repressing flowering under short days and identify a basis for the functional divergence of Arabidopsis RUP1 and RUP2 in regulating flowering time.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"d1ba8eb6616199be098fe7e334917f797411f1e7303574be35672d5de8a5a997","category":"Environment"}
