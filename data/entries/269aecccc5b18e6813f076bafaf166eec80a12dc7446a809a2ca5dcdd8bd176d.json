{"title":"Role of Flavonoids in Sepsis: Advances and Future Prospects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1306/v1","date":1716216528000,"content":"Due to the host immunological disease brought on by infection is sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which has a high morbidity and mortality rate, could be the result. With advances in pathogen detection technologies, breakthroughs in anti-infection drugs, and the creation of organ function support, the clinical diagnosis and treatment of sepsis have advanced significantly. Pathogen-induced abnormal immunological responses, which can range from excessive inflammation to immunosuppression, are recognized to play a significant role in the high death rate. Unfortunately, no medications that are specifically intended to treat sepsis have been licensed. In order to offer a theoretical foundation for the management of sepsis, we will now discuss current advancements in research on immunological responses in sepsis. The prognosis of sepsis patients may be improved by developing and optimizing a dynamic immune system treatment plan based on anti-infection therapy, fluid replacement, support for organ function, and timely application of immunomodulatory therapies","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"269aecccc5b18e6813f076bafaf166eec80a12dc7446a809a2ca5dcdd8bd176d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
