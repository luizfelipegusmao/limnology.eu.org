{"title":"On the Interpretation of Cosmic Acceleration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202309.0873/v7","date":1724240330000,"content":"In relativity, the newtonian concepts of velocity and acceleration are observer-dependent quantities that vary with the chosen frame of reference. It is well established that, in the comoving frame, cosmic expansion is currently accelerating; however, in the rest frame, this expansion is actually decelerating. In this paper, we explore the implications of this distinction.  The traditional measure of cosmic acceleration, denoted by \\( q \\), is derived from the comoving frame and describes the acceleration of the scale factor \\( a \\) for a 3D space-like homogeneous sphere. We introduce a new parameter, \\( q_E \\), representing the acceleration experienced between observers within the light cone. By comparing \\( q_E \\) to the traditional \\( q \\), using observational data from Type Ia supernovae (SN) and the radial clustering of galaxies and quasars (BAO)—including the latest results from DESI2024—our analysis demonstrates that \\( q_E \\) aligns more closely with this data.  The core argument of the paper is that $\\Lambda$—regardless of its origin—creates an Event Horizon that divides the manifold into causally disconnected regions, analogous to conditions inside a black hole’s interior, thereby allowing for a rest frame perspective $q_E$ in which cosmic expansion appears to be decelerating and the horizon acts like a friction term.  Such horizon suggests that the universe cannot maintain homogeneity outside. The observed cosmological constant \\( \\Lambda \\) can then be interpreted not as a driver of new dark energy or a modification of gravity, but as a boundary term exerting an attractive force, akin to a rubber band, resisting further expansion and preventing event horizon crossings.  This interpretation calls for a reconsideration of current cosmological models and the assumptions underlying them.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"721f8fe77df9f5f118d50c36bfdd58649258310d507a5650e560ecdb24491eb6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
