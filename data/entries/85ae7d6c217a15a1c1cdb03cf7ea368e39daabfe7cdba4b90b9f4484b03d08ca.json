{"title":"Combined exposure to lead and microplastics increased risk of glucose metabolism in mice via the Nrf2/NF‐κB pathway","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24125?af=R","date":1713250800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of combined lead (Pb) and two types of microplastic (MP) (polyvinyl chloride [PVC] and polyethylene [PE]) exposure on glucose metabolism and investigate the role of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway in mediating these effects in mice. Adult C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, Pb (100 mg/L), MPs (containing 10 mg/L PE and PVC), and Pb + MPs, each of which was treated with drinking water. Treatments were conducted for 6 weeks. Co-exposure to Pb + MPs exhibited increase glycosylated serum protein levels, insulin resistance, and damaged glucose tolerance compared with the control mice. Additionally, treatment with Pb + MPs caused more severe damage to hepatocytes than when exposed to them alone concomitantly, exposed to Pb + MPs exhibited improved the levels of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and malondialdehyde, but reduced superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase assay in livers. Furthermore, they increase the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and phosphorylated p-NF-κB protein levels but reduced the protein levels of heme oxygenase-1 and Nrf2, as well as increased Keap1 mRNA and Nrf2 mRNA. Co-exposure to Pb + MP impacts glucose metabolism via the Nrf2 /NF-κB pathway.</p>","author":"Mengqiang Zhu, \nPeng Li, \nTongfen Xu, \nGuoyun Zhang, \nZhuo Xu, \nXiangrong Wang, \nLulu Zhao, \nHaibo Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"85ae7d6c217a15a1c1cdb03cf7ea368e39daabfe7cdba4b90b9f4484b03d08ca","category":"Environment"}
