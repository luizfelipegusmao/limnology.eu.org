{"title":"Air plant genomes shed light on photosynthesis innovation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/3897/7719052?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Photosynthesis requires the uptake of CO<sub>2</sub>. In land plants, however, gas permeability is a double-edged sword. Opening stomata facilitates CO<sub>2</sub> exchange but also allows water to evaporate. To support photosynthesis under water limitations, some plants have evolved a workaround process termed Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). CAM allows plants to stockpile CO<sub>2</sub> at night, in the form of malate, when darkness and cooler temperatures lessen the burden of water loss through transpiration. Additionally, CAM concentrates CO<sub>2</sub>, which promotes the efficiency of Rubsico in producing sugars (<a href=\"#koae213-B5\">Wickell et al. 2021</a>). Despite the complexity required, over 30 different plant families have independently rearranged their physiology for variations of CAM (<a href=\"#koae213-B4\">Silvera et al. 2010</a>). The genetic features that drive the independent evolution of this metabolic process in diverse lineages are not well understood. This is especially vital as understanding the evolution of CAM may lead to strategies to increase crop resilience to drought (<a href=\"#koae213-B1\">Borland et al. 2014</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"ce83e5476e4e472fc036463db2df6974f1f0711d5934f7db7da8d9502c62da24","category":"Environment"}
