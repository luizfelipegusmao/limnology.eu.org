{"title":"Heat Stress in Japanese Quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica): Benefits of Phytase Supplementation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1342/v1","date":1726642417000,"content":"In tropical and subtropical climate regions, heat stress is one of the main causes of production losses in laying quails, aggravated by the antinutritional effects of the phytate in diet ingredients, which negatively affect the bioavailability of minerals, especially calcium and phosphorus. This situation results in a reduction in production and quality of eggs from commercial laying hens. Several nutritional strategies are utilized to reduce the adverse effects of high temperatures and antinutritional factors such as phytate. Among these strategies, the use of exogenous enzymes, such as phytase, stands out as a viable alternative. Phytase breaks down phytate molecules, optimizing the absorption of essential minerals and improving productive performance and egg quality under unfavorable conditions. In this context, this bibliographic review sought to produce a document demonstrating the beneficial effects of the phytase enzyme on the hydrolysis of the phytate molecule and the availability of calcium for Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica), and its implications in thermal stress due to heat.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33cb39810f6af2ccc0a05b408390155c7b3ff98594935a4a29c4a1b1aaab92b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
