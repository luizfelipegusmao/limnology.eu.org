{"title":"Comparative phenotype and transcriptome analysis revealed the role of ferric uptake regulator (Fur) in the virulence of Vibrio harveyi isolated from diseased American eel (Anguilla rostrata)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13931?af=R","date":1708361994000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Vibrio harveyi</i> is commonly found in salt and brackish water and is recognized as a serious bacterial pathogen in aquaculture worldwide. In this study, we cloned the ferric uptake regulator (<i>fur</i>) gene from <i>V. harveyi</i> wild-type strain HA_1, which was isolated from diseased American eels (<i>Anguilla rostrata</i>) and has a length of 450 bp, encoding 149 amino acids. Then, a mutant strain, HA_1-Δ<i>fur</i>, was constructed through homologous recombination of a suicide plasmid (pCVD442). The HA_1-Δ<i>fur</i> mutant exhibited weaker biofilm formation and swarming motility, and 18-fold decrease (5.5%) in virulence to the American eels; compared to the wild-type strain, the mutant strain showed time and diameter differences in growth and haemolysis, respectively. Additionally, the adhesion ability of the mutant strain was significantly decreased. Moreover, there were 15 different biochemical indicators observed between the two strains. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 875 genes were differentially expressed in the Δ<i>fur</i> mutant, with 385 up-regulated and 490 down-regulated DEGs. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that, compared to the wild-type strain, the type II and type VI secretion systems (T2SS and T6SS), amino acid synthesis and transport and energy metabolism pathways were significantly down-regulated, but the ABC transporters and biosynthesis of siderophore group non-ribosomal peptides pathways were up-regulated in the Δ<i>fur</i> strain. The qRT-PCR results further confirmed that DEGs responsible for amino acid transport and energy metabolism were positively regulated, but DEGs involved in iron acquisition were negatively regulated in the Δ<i>fur</i> strain. These findings suggest that the virulence of the Δ<i>fur</i> strain was significantly decreased, which is closely related to phenotype changing and gene transcript regulation.</p>","author":"Qijuan Wan, \nShaowei Zhai, \nMinxia Chen, \nMing Xu, \nSonglin Guo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"99797d54d4a520781f114598dfde1ec4426b98db074c3224a65200cb6cd501de","category":"Environment"}
