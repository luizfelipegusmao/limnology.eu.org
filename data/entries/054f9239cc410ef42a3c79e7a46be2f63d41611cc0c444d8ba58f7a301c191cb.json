{"title":"Essential Oils as an Antifungal Alternative to Control Cladosporium spp., Lasiodiplodia spp., Colletotrichum spp., Fusarium spp. and Aspergillus spp. Isolated of Musa paradisiaca","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2122/v1","date":1724912930000,"content":"Antifungal properties are found in essential oil extracts of oregano (Origanum vulgare), rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus), clove (Syzygium aromaticum), thyme (Thymus), cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum), basil (Ocimum basilicum), therefore, the ability to prevent or inhibit the growth of Cladosporium spp., Lasiodiplodia spp., Colletotrichum spp., Fusarium spp., and Aspergillus spp. was studied.  Cladosporium spp., Lasiodiplodia spp. Colletotrichum spp. Fusarium spp. y Aspergillus spp. fungi that were isolated and purified from the rot found on the banana peels (Musa paradisiaca). To perform a visual (macro-scopic) analysis of the Petri dish containing the pure fungus and a more detailed (microscopic) analysis of the fungal spores to classify it by genus, then, dilutions are prepared to inoculate onto amended PDA medium with chloramphenicol. Weekly re-inoculations are performed until iso-lated and purified fungi are obtained, which are then evaluated for in vitro inhibition and in vivo growth, according to the results of the in vivo analysis, the fungi were classified from higher to lower severity in: Colletotrichum spp., Lasiodiplodia spp., Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp. and Cladosporium spp and based on fungal growth observations, it was found that basil and rosemary do not inhibit growth at the maximum concentration. Cinnamon inhibits at 400 ppm, rosemary halts fungal growth at 600 ppm, clove at 1000 ppm, and oregano at 800 ppm.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"054f9239cc410ef42a3c79e7a46be2f63d41611cc0c444d8ba58f7a301c191cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
