{"title":"A Mini-Review, Decoding the Gut Microbiota-Gestational Diabetes Link: Insights from the Last Seven Years","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1857/v1","date":1711708405000,"content":"Over the past years, burgeoning insights into the gut microbiota have unveiled its pivotal role in human health, influencing everything from metabolism to immune function. This article comprehensively reviews literature from the last seven years to dissect the link between gut microbiota and gestational diabetes (GD), a condition of glucose intolerance manifesting during pregnancy with long-term implications for both mother and offspring. Through detailed analysis, we highlight how alterations in the composition and function of the gut microbiota may contribute to the development of GD by influencing insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, including dysbiosis and its impact on systemic inflammation, as well as the interplay with genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, are discussed. Furthermore, we review current and potential microbiota-targeted interventions, such as probiotic use, and their capability to modify GD risk and management. With a focus on recent studies, this article underscores the significance of considering microbial health in the prevention and treatment of GD, offering insights into future research directions and clinical applications to improve maternal-infant health outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d2067a1df220a031ba21fe820baaf439b08f43c40252658a420a9c1ebf08fb7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
