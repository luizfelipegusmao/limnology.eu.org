{"title":"Patterns of Non-Native Species Introduction, Spread, and Ecological Impact in South Florida, the World's Most Invaded Continental Ecoregion","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110421-103104?TRACK=RSS","date":1698883200000,"content":"<div><p>Invasive species are a chief threat to native biodiversity and are only becoming more common with human globalization. This creates a need to understand the patterns in invasion biology, including where invasions are most likely to occur, which species are most likely to establish and spread, and what are likely to be the most influential ecological consequences. We examine these questions through the lens of South Florida, the continental region with the most invasive species across the globe. First, understanding why South Florida has so many invasives and how they are distributed across South Florida helps us to understand where we can expect similar levels of invasion to occur. Second, understanding which species are most likely to establish, spread, and have the greatest ecological impact informs which invasions we should be most concerned about. Finally, the history of control efforts and their relative success can help guide future management practices.</p></div>","author":"Christopher A. Searcy, Hunter J. Howell, Aaron S. David, Reid B.
