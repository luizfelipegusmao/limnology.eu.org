To minimize this limitation, we engineered a hyper fidelity AsCas12a variant carrying the mutations S186A/R301A/T315A/Q1014A/K414A (termed HyperFi-As) by modifying amino acid residues interacting with the target DNA and crRNA strand. HyperFi-As retains on-target activities comparable to wild-type AsCas12a (AsCas12aWT) in human cells. We demonstrated that HyperFi-As has dramatically reduced off-target effects in human cells, and HyperFi-As possessed notably a lower tolerance to mismatch at the position of the PAM-distal region compared with the wild type. Further, a modified single-molecule DNA unzipping assay at proper constant force was applied to evaluate the stability and transient stages of the CRISPR/Cas ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Multiple states were sensitively detected during the disassembly of the DNA-Cas12a-crRNA complexes. On off-target DNA substrates, the HyperFi-As-crRNA was harder to maintain the R-loop complex state compared to the AsCas12aWT, which could explain exactly why the HyperFi-As has low off-targeting effects in human cells. Our findings provide a novel version of AsCas12a variant with low off-target effects, especially capable of dealing with the high off-targeting in the distal region from the PAM. An insight into how the AsCas12a variant behaves at off-target sites was also revealed at the single-molecule level and the unzipping assay to evaluate multiple states of CRISPR/Cas RNP complexes might be greatly helpful for a deep understanding of how CRISPR/Cas behaves and how to engineer it in future.","author":"Peng Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"e4c12a2a0b9abb5ee3da6a4df0333cbdf9ad09b06a8b61ba22edc947b23dd758","category":"Environment"}
