{"title":"NIR‐HSI as a tool to predict deoxynivalenol and fumonisins in maize kernels: a step forward in preventing mycotoxin contamination","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13388?af=R","date":1708939496000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Maize is frequently contaminated with deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisins B<sub>1</sub> (FB<sub>1</sub>) and B<sub>2</sub> (FB<sub>2</sub>). In the European Union, these mycotoxins are regulated in maize and maize-derived products. To comply with these regulations, industries require a fast, economic, safe, non-destructive and environmentally friendly analysis method.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In the present study, near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) was used to develop regression and classification models for DON, FB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>2</sub> in maize kernels. The best regression models presented the following root mean square error of cross validation and ratio of performance to deviation values: 0.848 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> and 2.344 (DON), 3.714 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> and 2.018 (FB<sub>1</sub>) and 2.104 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> and 2.301 (FB<sub>2</sub>). Regarding classification, European Union legal limits for DON and FB<sub>1</sub> + FB<sub>2</sub> were selected as thresholds to classify maize kernels as acceptable or not. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.778 and 1 for the best DON classification model and 0.607 and 0.938 for the best FB<sub>1</sub> + FB<sub>2</sub> classification model.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>NIR-HSI can help reduce DON and fumonisins contamination in the maize food and feed chain. © 2024 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Bernat Borràs‐Vallverdú, \nSonia Marín, \nVicente Sanchis, \nFerran Gatius, \nAntonio J.
