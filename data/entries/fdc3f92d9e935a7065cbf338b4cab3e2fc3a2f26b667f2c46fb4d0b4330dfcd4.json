{"title":"Nitrate Is Ineffective in Improving Exercise Performance When Ingested Long-Term with Higher Doses &mdash; Is Less More?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0125/v1","date":1715043681000,"content":"This brief report presents a comparative analysis to examine differences in the mean dose of nitrate supplementation between studies with positive and negative results on exercise performance. Protocols of at least six days that had positive results used lower nitrate doses (~7.7 mmol), whereas those with negative results used higher doses (~10.2 mmol), showing a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest long-term supplementation with higher doses (~10.2 mmol) may not improve exercise performance. Further research is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fdc3f92d9e935a7065cbf338b4cab3e2fc3a2f26b667f2c46fb4d0b4330dfcd4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
