{"title":"Biosafety in Norwegian Aquaculture—Risks and Measures in RAS Facilities and Well‐Boats","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/raq.12979?af=R","date":1728522505000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Biosafety is a central concern in Norwegian salmon farming, as diseases and parasites are common. Continued production depends on preventing and controlling diseases and parasites. A critical part of the farmed salmon's life is during smolt production and the following well-boat transport out to sea. Biosafety here is thus essential, and there is a need for an overview of risk factors and measures. Biosafety is related to the technical solutions' design, construction, cleaning, and maintenance, that can be studied through field work, interviews, and document analysis. This paper presents results from a study identifying risk factors related to technical solutions in smolt production (with RAS—recirculating aquaculture systems) and well-boats, and potential measures to reduce risk. Risk factors for RAS facilities are divided into four main groups: Introduction of pathogens to the facility, spread of pathogens inside the facility, growth of pathogens inside the facility, and additional risks. Risk factors for well-boats are divided into three main groups: Introduction of pathogens through intake water, spread of pathogens between fish groups, and spread of pathogens from well-boat to the environment. Measures are proposed to mitigate the identified risk factors. The lists are not exhaustive, and risk magnitude is not quantified, so effect of measures is not calculated. Still, the measures' potential for risk reduction and implementation (cost/benefit) are discussed, suggesting measures vital for biosafety in RAS facilities and well-boats.</p>","author":"Hans Tobias Slette, \nCecilie Salomonsen, \nKristine Størkersen, \nGuro Møen Tveit, \nAndreas Misund, \nEivind Lona","siteTitle":"Wiley: Reviews in Aquaculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e603512385355dc11b8c11c7000aba80fad3ae9faea7a2537d8e3609c19b97a1","entryHash":"8d6d19bd3e73c82922b628ba09e83cb2b51e10b53920e748ca63fb331bb81fdf","category":"Environment"}
