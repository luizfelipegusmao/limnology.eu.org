{"title":"Two Different Forms of Thick Filament in the Flight Muscle of Drosophila melanogaster","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.377/7720489?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span><span>Drosophila melanogaster's</span> flight muscles offer a prime model for studying muscle biology, leveraging their organized structure and genetic tractability. These muscles, particularly the indirect flight muscles (IFM), are specialized for rapid wing beats and exhibit a high degree of structural homogeneity. Research has delved into the molecular dynamics of muscle contraction and the role of myosin II and associated proteins like paramyosin in filament architecture. This study focuses on the structural differences between two types of thick filaments in the IFM, characterized by their distinct protein compositions and conformations. We present two reconstructed maps at 2.8 Ã… resolution, highlighting variations in protein structure and composition that may influence muscle physiology and aging-related changes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e9cafb723075d92f077dcc3ee73ea1643f1849c59d38245b8be9b1943d411f10","category":"Environment"}
