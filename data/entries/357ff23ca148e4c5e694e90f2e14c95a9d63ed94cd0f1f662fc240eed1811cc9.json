{"title":"Indirect Model Predictive Control on Epidemiological Stochastic Blockmodels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0241/v1","date":1714974594000,"content":"This paper aims to demonstrate how the detection of communities for epidemiological networks can be used to reduce the dimensionality of optimal control problems. A range of planted partition stochastic blockmodels are generated, where the underlying communities in the model vary in detectability. A high-performance computing workflow is then used to simulate and estimate reduced model dynamics for the networks, which in turn is used to find optimal control solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"357ff23ca148e4c5e694e90f2e14c95a9d63ed94cd0f1f662fc240eed1811cc9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
