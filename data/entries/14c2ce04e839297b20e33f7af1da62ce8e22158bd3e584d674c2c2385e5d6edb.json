{"title":"The potential of mangosteen peel as a biosorbent: A review","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14330?af=R","date":1715141849000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The high productivity of mangosteen and its utilization in various industries produce the mangosteen peel as a waste of the process. Mangosteen peel as a lignocellulose-based material has great potential to be utilized as a biosorbent, especially in the separation process of wastewater pollutants. Previous studies on mangosteen peel biosorbent are limited to the adsorption of heavy metal ions, dyes, and CO<sub>2</sub> separation process. These studies show that the separation efficiency can reach above 90%, which indicates the potential to be expanded for the usage of other compounds as the adsorbate. The gradual diffusion process of adsorbate molecules into biosorbent pores depends specifically on the suitability of the materials and the operating conditions of the adsorption process. Materials suitability can be modified by the biosorbent pretreatment process to enhance its adsorption capacity. The mangosteen peel biosorbent, which still performs well in the adsorption process even after being regenerated for a few cycles, is an added value for its potential to be utilized as a biosorbent in various applications because it can reduce costs and process waste; also expand the possibility to reuse the desorbed adsorbate compound.</p>","author":"Ardiyan Harimawan, \nDian Shofinita, \nVincent Valentino, \n Jesica, \nAmarthya Benigna Achmadi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"14c2ce04e839297b20e33f7af1da62ce8e22158bd3e584d674c2c2385e5d6edb","category":"Environment"}
