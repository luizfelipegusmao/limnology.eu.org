{"title":"Parental non-involvement strategy for handling sibling conflict on social avoidance in migrant children: Chain mediation of sibling conflict and parent-child conflict","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308561","date":1725976800000,"content":"<p>by Yuge Yue, Kaiwu Lu, Danping Ye</p>\r\n\r\nIn the process of urbanization, the social adaptation of migrant children has become an important issue in their development. This study adopts family systems theory and ecological systems theory to examine the effects of parental non-involvement strategies in handling sibling conflict on migrant children’s social avoidance. It also investigates the mediating role of sibling conflict and parent-child conflict. The results of the study, reported by parents of 253 mobile children with siblings, suggest that parental strategies of not intervening in sibling conflict are an important factor influencing the development of social avoidance in mobile children. The Parental strategy of not intervening in sibling conflict had an effect on migrant children’s social avoidance through the separate mediating effect of parent-child conflict, and also through the chained mediating effect of sibling conflict and parent-child conflict. The study also found that the separate mediating effect of sibling conflict was not significant. This study contributes to the research on the relationship between parental non-intervention in sibling conflict and migrant children’s social avoidance. It also highlights the impact of sibling conflict and parent-child conflict on migrant children’s social avoidance by establishing and validating a comprehensive research model. The results of the study can help parents establish close parent-child relationships for migrant children and provide scientific guidance for children to develop positive sibling relationships. This, in turn, can assist migrant children in better adapting to a new social environment.","author":"Yuge Yue","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c3e6626f63cc93f93fc3896642bee3189ae6fbeb4627a6655b06fcdeaaca0314","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
