{"title":"Natural resource‐driven prosperity: Unveiling the catalysts of sustainable economic development in the United States","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12456?af=R","date":1712306098000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Achieving economic progress hinges upon the active and strategic utilization of a nation's inherent resources in economic and financial endeavors. This comprehensive study investigates the intricate dynamics influencing the economic development of the United States, employing a time series dataset spanning from 1991 to 2022. Key factors including total natural resource rents, domestic capital formation, the ‘financial risk index (FRI),’ and the count of patents filed by both domestic and foreign investors. Rigorous statistical analyses, including the ‘Modified Dickey-Fuller’ test and ‘Bayer-Hanck cointegration’ strategy, were employed to extract meaningful insights from the data. Addressing concerns related to endogeneity and serial correlation, advanced techniques such as ‘Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares’ and ‘Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares’ were applied. The findings illuminate the pivotal roles played by natural resource rents and domestic capital formation in propelling sustainable economic development in the United States. Notably, this study sheds light on the positive contributions of both domestic and foreign patent filings to the nation's economic trajectory. Furthermore, enhancements in the FRI are identified as catalysts for fostering sustainable economic growth. In essence, our research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering nuanced insights into the multifaceted influences shaping the economic landscape of the United States. The results not only underscore the significance of effective resource management and capital formation but also emphasize the positive impact of innovation, represented by patent filings, and improvements in the FRI on the nation's journey towards sustainable economic growth.</p>","author":"Xiukun Ge, \nMuhammad Imran, \nKishwar Ali","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"f8fc7e55f8a31a69333c838e7d9d4b347aa90acb9f6c03c6bcc3db913c6e248e","category":"Environment"}
