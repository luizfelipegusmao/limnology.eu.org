{"title":"Identification of Technical Requirements for the Initial Design of an Autonomous Fruit-Harvesting Robot","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0403/v1","date":1725517231000,"content":"Automation in agriculture is transforming the management of field tasks. This article focuses on identifying the needs and preliminary requirements for designing an autonomous robot for fruit harvesting. These robotic systems integrate advanced machine vision technologies and neural networks to accurately detect ripe fruits and obstacles, thereby optimizing harvesting efficiency. Additionally, the use of proximity and touch sensors is emphasized, ensuring careful and safe handling of fruits to prevent damage during harvesting. The technical specifications of these robots, including traction, speed, and their ability to operate on slopes, are evaluated to ensure adaptability to different types of crops and ground conditions. Perception systems, utilizing advanced cameras and sensors, provide essential data for crop inspection and route planning. Through a thorough analysis of operational demands, environmental conditions, and technical specifications, this article aims to establish a solid foundation for guiding the development and construction of an efficient and viable harvesting robot. The prospects and potential of fruit-harvesting robots to transform agriculture are highlighted, underscoring the importance of ongoing research and development to overcome current challenges and enhance the feasibility and effectiveness of these robotic systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ec2aa7054fd9dfb4348962f1b77f9fc4a7c2fdf37c9dfa08614196c096a8e37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
