The common carp, <i>Cyprinus carpio</i> L., is the main species farmed. The availability of fingerlings is one of the key constraints facing the sector. The present study shows the benefit of an appropriate feed and feeding regime to both broodfish and larvae/fry and also the positive impact of protecting larvae during the first stages of their life by using happa system. The combination of these technical approaches increases significantly carp fry production.</p>","author":"Samuel Rakotoambinina, \nDamien Desprez, \nHenri Adelphe Andriniaina, \nFanomezantsoa Randriarilala, \nDavid Rakotomavo, \nLovasoa Rakotoasimbola, \nMamy Andriantsoa, \nLéo Godard","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"a156dcf8b5416ced018dc4dff569acc869802c90cc7786b1f6fd7e04d4525c42","category":"Environment"}
