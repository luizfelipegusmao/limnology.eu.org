{"title":"Dystonia, Tremor, and Dystonic Tremor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1389/v1","date":1711114210000,"content":"Dystonia and tremor are distinct movement disorders, but they overlap in certain circumstances.  First, dystonia and tremor may co-exist in the same individual, in the same or different regions of the body.  Second, dystonic movements are sometimes rapid and repetitive, and they may mimic tremor.  The term dystonic tremor first appeared in the literature to describe a rapid and repetitive dystonic movement that mimicked tremor but could be discriminated from essential tremor.  With the first consensus statement on tremor, the term dystonic tremor was instead used to describe any combination of dystonia with tremor in the same body region, a definition retained in the latest consensus statement.  Both definitions continue to be used in the modern literature.  To address this problem, a group of specialists in dystonia and tremor met to review the problem and develop recommendations for more consistent approach.  The group agreed that a terminology that could be applied in the clinic was essential, even though laboratory-based measures may sometimes be required. The group also agreed that the term tremor should exclusively refer to rhythmic movements, and the establishment of boundaries for rhythmicity is needed.  The group also agreed that repetitive movements that are grossly arrhythmic in the context of dystonia, should be called jerky dystonia, rather than terms that imply tremor.  Moreover, when both tremor and dystonia coexist, they should be described according to affected body regions rather than given distinct labels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa247eccaa23b4e8d5014d58d48e8ccb1fe00e48a81082708120cdfbf6f96322","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
