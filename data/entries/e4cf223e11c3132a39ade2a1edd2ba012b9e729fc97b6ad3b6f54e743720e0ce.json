Elevated baseline CORT (CORT<sub>b</sub>) could support daily energy expenditure (DEE), promoting reproductive effort or downregulate costly behaviours in low quality individuals facing allostatic overload.\nWe investigated relationships between CORT<sub>b</sub>, time activity budgets (TABs), DEE and diving behaviour across 2 years and colonies of little auk (<i>Alle alle</i>), an Arctic seabird in which elevating DEE may support reproduction in the face of climate change.\nWe also explored whether mercury (Hg) contamination might suppress DEE by affecting the hypothalamus-pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and CORT production.\nFurthermore, we performed phylogenetically controlled analysis across breeding seabird species to build broader understanding of CORT-DEE relationships.\nCORT<sub>b</sub> positively correlated with little auk activity, DEE and dive duration during a cold year in East Greenland, when CORT<sub>b</sub> was elevated in the population, but not during a warmer year, or at Svalbard. CORT<sub>b</sub> did not predict chick provisioning nor did Hg suppress CORT<sub>b</sub>.\nAcross breeding seabird species, CORT<sub>b</sub> and DEE were uncorrelated. Rather, contrary to predictions, CORT<sub>b</sub> was higher in species breeding at lower latitudes.\nIntraspecific results suggest environment-dependent relationships between CORT<sub>b</sub>, behaviour and DEE, with implications for understanding CORT<sub>b</sub>'s role in climate change resiliency.\nInterspecific analyses suggest absence of correlational selection between CORT<sub>b</sub> and DEE during reproduction, and that DEE thresholds that induce changes in CORT<sub>b</sub> might differ between species.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/07/30/environmental-challenges-may-modify-the-relationship-between-hormones-and-energy-expenditure-in-a-breeding-arctic-seabird-facing-rapid-climate-change/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Andrea S.
