{"title":"A Comparative Study on the Interaction Between Protein and PET Micro/Nanoplastics: Structural and Surface Characteristics of Particles and Impacts on Lung Carcinoma Cells (A549) and Staphylococcus aureus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24366?af=R","date":1719320650000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The interaction between particles and proteins is a key factor determining the toxicity responses of particles. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the interaction between the emerging pollutant polyethylene terephthalate micro/nanoplastics from water bottles with bovine serum albumin. The physicochemical characteristics of micro/nanoplastics were investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance, x-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, dynamic light scattering, and x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy after exposure to various concentrations and durations of protein. Furthermore, the impact of protein-treated micro/nanoplastics on biological activities was examined using the mitochondrial activity and membrane integrity of A549 cells and the activity and biofilm production of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. The structural characteristics of micro/nanoplastics revealed an interaction with protein. For instance, the assignment of protein-related new proton signals (e.g., <span></span>CH<sub>2</sub>, methylene protons of CH<sub>2</sub>O), changes in available protons s (e.g., <span></span>CH and <span></span>CH<sub>3</sub>), crystallinity, functional groups, elemental ratios, zeta potentials (−11.3 ± 1.3 to −12.4 ± 1.7 to 25.5 ± 2.3 mV), and particle size (395 ± 76 to 496 ± 60 to 866 ± 82 nm) of micro/nanoplastics were significantly observed after protein treatment. In addition, the loading (0.012–0.027 mM) and releasing (0.008–0.013 mM) of protein also showed similar responses with structural characteristics. Moreover, the cell-based responses were changed regarding the structural and surface characteristics of micro/nanoplastics and the loading efficiencies of protein. For example, insignificant mitochondrial activity (2%–10%) and significant membrane integrity (12%–28%) of A549 cells increased compared with control, and reductions in bacterial activity (5%–40%) in many cases and biofilm production specifically at low dose of all treatment stages (13%–46% reduction) were observed.</p>","author":"Asli Baysal, \nHasan Saygin, \nAhu Soyocak","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"505109c375ce517f53b8bea028528c8282e7e5fb7b73400b473eb82a20eaf523","category":"Environment"}
