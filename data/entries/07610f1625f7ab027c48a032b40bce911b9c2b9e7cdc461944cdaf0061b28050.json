{"title":"Tuberculosis Reactivation in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients: A Preemptive Strategy in an Endemic Country","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0458/v1","date":1717739548000,"content":"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health issue, particularly in developing countries. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients are at elevated risk for TB due to immunosuppression. This retrospective study (2005-2022) assessed a preemptive latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) screening and treatment strategy in 338 HSCT recipients and their donors. Screening included tuberculin skin test (TST) or QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT), and pulmonary imaging, with positive cases receiving isoniazid (INH) therapy. Statistical analyses aimed to compare TB reactivation rates, overall survival (OS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) across HSCT groups. Of 338 patients, 92 (27%) were diagnosed with LTBI. Screening involved TST in 325 cases and QFT in 13. INH therapy was completed by 81 patients, with 5 discontinuing due to hepatotoxicity. The cumulative incidence of active TB was 0.6%, and LTBI reactivation rate in patients who received INH was 1.2%. LTBI status did not affect OS or RFS. Our study exemplifies the effectiveness of LTBI protocols incorporating TST/QFT and CT-scan testing, followed by INH therapy, in reducing TB reactivation among HSCT recipients in a high-burden region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07610f1625f7ab027c48a032b40bce911b9c2b9e7cdc461944cdaf0061b28050","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
