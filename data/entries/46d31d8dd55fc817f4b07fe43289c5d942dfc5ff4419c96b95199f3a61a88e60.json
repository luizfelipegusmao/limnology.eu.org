{"title":"Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s Cat Paradox Is an Illusion, We Are All Quantum Illusions When Seen From the Universal Quantum Referential","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1576/v1","date":1719222211000,"content":"At the beginning of our observations, humanity believed that the Earth was the center of the uni-verse and that the sun was spinning around the Earth. Claude Ptolémée (100-168) made a mistake by modelling the movements in the geocentric referential, the model of the sun and planet move-ments was an illusion and all Humanity was wrong. Nicolas Copernic (1473-1543) showed the illusion and simplified the system by moving from the geocentric referential to the heliocentric referential.  In the present paper, I would like to discuss about the possibility of making mistakes with quantum theory because we are all in the wrong classical referential. In my interpretation, the decoherence problem and wave function collapse do not exist at all, because we are the illusion, we are living in a quantum illusion, in a mirage. It is impossible to observe the quantum world as it is, in our classical referential, and we see the quantum world with a false vison of quantum reality be-cause we are not yet in the universal quantum referential whose I postulate the existence. As we are quantum illusions when seen from this universal quantum referential, Schrödinger’s cat paradox is a non-sense as life and death are illusions. We must be very humble with quantum theory and we should not put ourselves in the center of the quantum world again particularly with our lives and deaths. We will thus be collectively able to reach the universal quantum referential by changing our vision of life and quantum world. This will be our Big Bang.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46d31d8dd55fc817f4b07fe43289c5d942dfc5ff4419c96b95199f3a61a88e60","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
