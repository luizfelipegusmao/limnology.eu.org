{"title":"Control Group in Foot Plantar Pressure Studies &ndash; Does Chronic Low Back Pain Matter?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1519/v1","date":1721368384000,"content":"Many studies utilize sensors to measure foot plantar pressure and analyze gait patterns, often focusing on assessing weight-bearing symmetry or asymmetry compared to control groups. However, a critical question arises: does the selection of the control group significantly impact study outcomes? Does chronic low back pain affect foot plantar pressure measurements? This experimental study involved 23 participants, including healthy individuals and those without foot disorders but with chronic low back pain. Dynamic foot pressure measurements were conducted using the Ortopiezometr, and data were analyzed using the \"Steps\" program. Participants were divided into two groups: Group 1 comprised completely healthy individuals, while Group 2 consisted of individuals without foot problems but with moderate chronic low back pain. The findings highlight a prevalence of energy release in the forefoot sensors compared to the hindfoot for both the right and left legs in most cases. Even among healthy volunteers, achieving perfect symmetry in the maximum values on the sensors for the right and left feet was a challenge. Results showed no statistically significant differences in energy released on specific sensors or duration of gait phases between the groups. Essentially, this suggests that foot pressure patterns are comparable between healthy individuals and those with low back pain. The use of sensor-equipped inserts for pedobarographic examinations indicates that, in cases of degenerative changes in the lumbar and sacral spine without accompanying acute pain, gait patterns resemble those of the healthy population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61f0283617a8ccbb521aaadabadcf9d0da0ad5105a548a29fa4e4087b7fdc93e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
