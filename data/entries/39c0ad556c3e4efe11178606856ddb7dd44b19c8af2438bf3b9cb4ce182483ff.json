{"title":"A Comparative Data Augmentation-Assisted Diagnostic Framework for Industrial Centrifugal Pumps","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0789/v1","date":1725959238000,"content":"This study presents an advanced data augmentation framework to enhance diagnostics in centrifugal pumps using vibration data, with a focus on practical industrial applications. Initially, Gaussian noise and signal stretching were employed to generate synthetic data, addressing the common issue of insufficient defect data in industrial settings. These methods simulate varied operating conditions and different rotating speeds. Recognizing the limitations of traditional approaches, we further integrated advanced modelsâ€”Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Autoencoder (AE), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment the dataset comprehensively. This enhanced approach increases the robustness and accuracy of machine-learning models for fault detection and classification. Experimental results show significant improvements in diagnostic algorithm performance, reducing false positives and increasing fault detection rates. The study offers a complete framework for incorporating both traditional and advanced data augmentation techniques into predictive maintenance protocols, ensuring reliable operation of centrifugal pumps in diverse industrial environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39c0ad556c3e4efe11178606856ddb7dd44b19c8af2438bf3b9cb4ce182483ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
