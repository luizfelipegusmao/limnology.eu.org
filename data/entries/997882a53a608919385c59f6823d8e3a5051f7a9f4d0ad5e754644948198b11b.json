These have been generated using a variety of techniques including phaseplates [<a href=\"#ozae044.763-B1\">1</a>] and diffracting holograms [<a href=\"#ozae044.763-B2\">2</a>]. Electron beams created in transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) can be sculpted into vortex beams with different intensity distributions and quantized amounts of OAM [<a href=\"#ozae044.763-B3\">3</a>]. The structure and properties of these beams show potential for use in new electron imaging techniques such as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to probe chiral plasmons and nanomagnetic materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.763-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"997882a53a608919385c59f6823d8e3a5051f7a9f4d0ad5e754644948198b11b","category":"Environment"}
