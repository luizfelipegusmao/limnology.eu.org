{"title":"Evolution of Skipper (SK), a family of DD34E/Tc1 transposons, in animals","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/142/2/220/7310947?rss=1","date":1697155200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>High diversity and differential evolution profiles have been observed for DD34E/<span>Tc1</span> transposons; several families originating from these groups, such as DD34E/<span>ZB</span>, DD34E/<span>SB</span>, DD35E/<span>TR</span>, DD36E/<span>IC,</span> and DD38E/<span>IT</span>, have been well defined. Even though <span>Frisky</span>, <span>Tiang</span>, <span>Tsessebe,</span> and <span>Topi</span> transposons have been identified in <span>Anopheles gambiae</span>, their taxonomic distribution and phylogenetic relationship in nature remain largely unknown. The evolutionary profiles of <span>Frisky</span>, <span>Tiang</span>, <span>Tsessebe</span>, and <span>Topi</span> homology transposons were investigated in the current study. In total, 254 homology transposons of <span>Frisky</span>, <span>Tiang</span>, <span>Hob</span>, <span>Tsessebe,</span> and <span>Topi</span> were obtained in 200 species by data mining. The phylogenetic tree revealed that these transposons were classified into five main clades (<span>Frisky</span>, <span>Tiang</span>, <span>Hob</span>, <span>Tsessebe</span>, and <span>Topi</span>) forming a monophyletic clade with 98% bootstrap support, belonging to the DD34E/<span>Tc1</span> group, and named as <span>Skipper</span> (<span>SK</span>). <span>SK</span> transposons show a wide distribution in animals; however, differential taxonomic distribution patterns were observed for the subfamilies of <span>Frisky</span>, <span>Tiang</span>, <span>Hob</span>, <span>Tsessebe,</span> and <span>Topi</span>; extensive invasion of <span>Frisky</span> in animals was found, whereas <span>Tiang</span>, <span>Hob</span>, <span>Tsessebe,</span> and <span>Topi</span> were mainly detected in Diptera. <span>SK</span> elements share a similar structural organization and display high sequence identities across subfamilies. Evolutionary dynamics and structural analysis revealed that <span>SK</span>s in some species, such as <span>Bombyx mori</span>, <span>Lordiphosa magnipectinata</span>, <span>Carassius gibelio</span>, <span>Triplophysa dalaica</span>, and <span>Silurus glanis</span>, have recently evolved and present as intact copies, indicating that <span>SK</span>s in these genomes may be active. Together, these observations improve our understanding of the diversity of DD34E/<span>Tc1</span> transposons and their impacts on genome evolution in animals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"cb4eaee8815eaecd417ebffd02df1bfb208f6a23f414ff28145d687666b38e1c","category":"Environment"}
