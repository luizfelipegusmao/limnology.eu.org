{"title":"Techno-Economic Evaluation on Solar-Assisted Post-Combustion CO2 Capture in Hollow Fiber Membrane Contactors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0550/v1","date":1712639989000,"content":"Membrane gas absorption technology and solar-assisted regeneration system are two promising approaches to reduce high energy consumption associated with carbon dioxide capture from coal fired power plants. In the present study, a solar-assisted hollow fiber membrane contactor (SOL-HFMC) power plant is proposed to capture and desorb CO2 in hollow fiber membrane contactors with the assistance of solar thermal collectors. Techno-economic assessment and sensitivity analysis of the proposed system is carried out in three studied locations with different weather conditions for a 580 MWe pulverized coal power plant. Research results show that, the output capacity and net efficiency of the SOL-HFMC power plant are significantly higher than those of the reference power plant regardless whether TES system is applied or not. In addition, CEI of the SOL-HFMC power plant with TES system is 4.36 kg CO2/MWh, 4.45 kg CO2/MWh and 4.66 kg CO2/MWh lower than that of the reference power plant. The prices of membrane, vacuum tube collector and phase change material should be reduced to achieve lower LCOE and COR values. Specifically for SOL-HFMC power plant with TES system, the corresponding vacuum tube collector price shall be lower than 25.70 $/m2 for Jinan, 95.20 $/m2 for Xining, and 128.70 $/m2 for Lhasa, respectively. To be more competitive than solar-assisted ammonia-based post-combustion CO2 capture power plant, the membrane price in Jinan, Xining and Lhasa shall be reduced to 0.012 $/m, 0.015 $/m and 0.016 $/m for the sake of LCOE, and 0.03 $/m, 0.033 $/m and 0.034 $/m for the sake of COR, respectively. The findings can provide guidance for decision-making and risk management strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9088550e8b68d6c4628f9ca9cb836f03175a05201cf612711ab293eae334a68a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
