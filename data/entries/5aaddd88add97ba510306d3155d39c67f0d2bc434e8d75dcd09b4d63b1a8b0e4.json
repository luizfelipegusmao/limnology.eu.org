{"title":"Revisions, new taxa, and venation transformations of the sawfly family Blasticotomidae sensu lato (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinoidea) highlight the evolution of the basal Hymenoptera","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlae113/7764562?rss=1","date":1726876800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Wing venation pattern is particularly important in the taxonomy and classification of insects, especially for fossil material. There are recognized transformation series that apparently often represent a mainstream in the evolutionary trend of the wing venation of Hymenoptera. One notable instance is the gradual reduction of the subcosta veins from multiple branches to their total absence. Herein, we place four new genera and six new species in the family Blasticotomidae (=Xyelotomidae) of Hymenoptera. They are <span>Xyelocerus abruptus</span> sp. nov., <span>Liberitoma tenella</span> gen et sp. nov., <span>Liberitoma compta</span> sp. nov., <span>Liberitoma incompleta</span> sp. nov., <span>Aduantoma insolita</span> gen. et sp. nov., and <span>Apertoma</span> gen. nov. from the Middle Jurassic of China, and <span>Enspeletoma oligocaenica</span> gen. et sp. nov. from the Upper Oligocene of Germany. The newly discovered species of <span>Liberitoma</span> from China possessed a supernumerary hind branch of vein Sc in its forewing, which has apparently never been recorded before in other hymenopterans, and the unique venation pattern of <span>Aduantoma</span> suggests the possibility of two additional steps of vein Sc transformation before its complete loss. Based on the new findings, Blasticotomidae are proposed to be divided into four subfamilies: Blasticotominae Thomson 1871, Dahurotominae subfam. nov., Pseudoxyelocerinae subfam. nov., and Undatominae subfam. nov.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"5aaddd88add97ba510306d3155d39c67f0d2bc434e8d75dcd09b4d63b1a8b0e4","category":"Environment"}
