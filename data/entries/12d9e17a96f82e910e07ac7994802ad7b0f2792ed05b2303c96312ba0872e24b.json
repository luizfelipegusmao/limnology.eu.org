{"title":"A Vehicle Classification Method Based on Machine Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0981/v1","date":1720756532000,"content":"In this article, we propose a machine learning based fine-grained vehicle classification method VehiClassNet, which effectively solves the challenges of precise vehicle recognition and classification in intelligent transportation systems by combining multi-scale feature extraction, cross modal fusion, and attention mechanisms. Our model demonstrated excellent performance on the Stanford Cars-196 dataset. The innovation of this study lies in its advanced multi-scale feature extraction, cross modal fusion, and attention mechanism. It not only improves classification accuracy, but also lays the foundation for further research on intelligent transportation systems and autonomous vehicle technology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"12d9e17a96f82e910e07ac7994802ad7b0f2792ed05b2303c96312ba0872e24b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
