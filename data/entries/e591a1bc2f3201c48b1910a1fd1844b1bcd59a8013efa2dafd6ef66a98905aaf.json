{"title":"Mediator kinase subunit CDK8 phosphorylates transcription factor TCP15 during tomato pollen development","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/865/7607897?rss=1","date":1707868800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pollen development in flowering plants has strong implications for reproductive success. Pollen DNA can be targeted to improve plant traits for yield and stress tolerance. In this study, we demonstrated that the Mediator subunit CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 8 (CDK8) is a key modulator of pollen development in tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>). <span>SlCDK8</span> knockout led to significant decreases in pollen viability, fruit yield, and fruit seed number. We also found that SlCDK8 directly interacts with transcription factor TEOSINTE BRANCHED1-CYCLOIDEA-PCF15 (SlTCP15) using yeast two-hybrid screens. We subsequently showed that SlCDK8 phosphorylates Ser 187 of SlTCP15 to promote SlTCP15 stability. Phosphorylated TCP15 directly bound to the TGGGCY sequence in the promoters of <span>DYSFUNCTIONAL TAPETUM 1</span> (<span>SlDYT1</span>) and <span>MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 103</span> (<span>SlMYB103</span>), which are responsible for pollen development. Consistently, disruption of <span>SlTCP15</span> resembled <span>slcdk8</span> tomato mutants. In sum, our work identified a new substrate of Mediator CDK8 and revealed an important regulatory role of SlCDK8 in pollen development via cooperation with SlTCP15.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"e591a1bc2f3201c48b1910a1fd1844b1bcd59a8013efa2dafd6ef66a98905aaf","category":"Environment"}
