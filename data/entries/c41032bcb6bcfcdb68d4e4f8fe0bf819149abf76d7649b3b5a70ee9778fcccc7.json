{"title":"Increasing the Reliability of a Critical Software System Using a Large Language Model Based Solution for Onboarding","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1945/v1","date":1716971256000,"content":"Software systems are often maintained by a group of experienced software developers, in order to ensure that faults which may bring the system down are less likely. Large turnover in organizations such as CERN makes it important to think of ways of onboarding newcomers on a technical project rapidly. This paper focuses on optimizing the way that people get up-to-speed on the business logic and technologies used on the project, using a knowledge-imbued large language model that is enhanced using domain-specific knowledge from the group or teamâ€™s internal documentation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c41032bcb6bcfcdb68d4e4f8fe0bf819149abf76d7649b3b5a70ee9778fcccc7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
