{"title":"Hemp regulates the fitness of corn earworm (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) and its tachinid (Diptera) parasitoids","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311220","date":1727704800000,"content":"<p>by Armando Falcon-Brindis, Raul T. Villanueva</p>\r\n\r\nPest management on hemp is still in its infancy, and biological control options are limited. <i>Helicoverpa zea</i> (corn earworm) is one of the key pests of hemp cultivated outdoors, especially on cultivars grown for cannabinoids and grain. In a three-year study, we assessed the effect of diet on the performance of <i>H</i>. <i>zea</i> and its tachinid parasitoids. Parasitized (bearing fly eggs) and unparasitized (without eggs) <i>H</i>. <i>zea</i> larvae were fed on hemp flowers or an artificial diet. Five tachinid species parasitized <i>H</i>. <i>zea</i> larvae, but the most abundant species were <i>Winthemia rufopicta</i> (68.8%) and <i>Lespesia aletiae</i> (28.3%). Overall, 55.2% of <i>H</i>. <i>zea</i> larvae bearing tachinid eggs died, while the mortality of unparasitized larvae reached 24.7%. The success of tachinids increased by 2-fold when the host larvae were fed on an artificial diet. Our results demonstrated that high protein food (artificial diet), intensity of parasitism, and caterpillar size play a role in the fitness of both the herbivores (<i>H</i>. <i>zea</i>) and its tachinid parasitoids. These findings have important implications for understanding biological control mechanisms and open new insights into the impact of landscape variation on plant-herbivore-parasitoid interactions. This study contains supporting evidence that makes both <i>Winthemia rufopicta</i> and <i>Lespesia aletiae</i> excellent candidates for biological control programs against <i>H</i>. <i>zea</i>, a key pest of hemp in the United States.","author":"Armando Falcon-Brindis","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c745cb75d8888a85f469570a66e1b3eab9b67eec5651074cc8b60c578ae6f9ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
