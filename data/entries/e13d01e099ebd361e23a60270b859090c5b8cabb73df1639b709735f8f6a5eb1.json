{"title":"The Light Wavelength, Intensity, and Biasing Voltage Dependency of Dark and Photocurrent Density of Solution-Processed P3HT:PC61BM Photodetector for Sensing Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0609/v1","date":1723111523000,"content":"KThe promising possibility of organic photodetector (OPD) is emerging in the field of sensing applications for its tunable absorption range, flexibility, and large-scale fabrication abilities. In this work, we fabricated bulk heterojunction OPD with a device structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ P3HT:PC61BM/Al by spin coating process and characterized the dark and photocurrent at different applied bias conditions for red, green, and blue incident LED light. OPD photocurrent density exhibited up to 2.5–3 orders higher magnitude compared to the dark current density at -1 V bias while it increased up to 3–4 orders at zero bias conditions for red, green, and blue lights showing an increasing trend higher voltage applied in the negative direction. Different OPD inner periphery shapes, OPD to LED distance, and OPD area were also considered to bring the variation in OPD dark and photocurrent, which can affect the on/off ratio of the OPD–LED hybrid system and is a critical phenomenon for any sensing application.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e13d01e099ebd361e23a60270b859090c5b8cabb73df1639b709735f8f6a5eb1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
