{"title":"An Overview of Nanoparticle-Based Delivery Platforms for Vaccines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0738/v1","date":1715595298000,"content":"With its unique properties and potential applications, nanoparticle-based delivery platforms for vac-cines have gained significant attention in recent years. Nanoparticles have the advantages of enhancing immunogenicity, targeting delivery and improving stability, providing a new solution for drug and vaccine delivery. And in some clinical studies, a variety of nanoparticle delivery platforms have been gradually applied to a wide range of vaccine applications. Current research priorities are exploring various types of nanoparticles as vaccine delivery system to enhance vaccine stability and immunogen-icity. Lipid nanoparticles have shown promising potential in preclinical and clinical studies to efficiently deliver antigens to immune cells. Moreover, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and other nanoparticles as nu-cleic acids especially mRNA delivery system, have shown vast potential for vaccine development. In this review, we present various vaccine platforms with an emphasis on nanoparticles for mRNA nano-vaccine delivery vehicles. We introduce several novel nanoparticles delivery platforms for mRNA vac-cine such as lipid, polymer, protein-based nanoparticle and so on. In addition, we overview the an-ti-tumor immunity of nanovaccine against different tumors in cancer immunotherapy. Finally, we give an outlook future perspectives and remaining challenges for this promising technolo-gy-nanoparticle-based delivery platforms for vaccines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c06ff32a40319f6e395146795e86be0a31cfd7b54dc4afd1ae2807da90bef40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
