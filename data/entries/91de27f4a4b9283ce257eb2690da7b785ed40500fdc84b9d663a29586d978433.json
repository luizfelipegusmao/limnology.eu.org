Unfortunately, these alloys require aggressive heat treatments due to the slow diffusion of Zr which results in the sluggish precipitation of L1<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>3</sub>Zr [<a href=\"#ozae044.651-B2\">2</a>]. The standard aging heat treatments used for the precipitation of L1<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>3</sub>Zr are performed between 375°C and 425°C [<a href=\"#ozae044.651-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.651-B3\">3</a>]. In this work, L1<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>3</sub>Zr nuclei were observed to form at 200°C in an Al-Zr-Sn alloy due to the formation of β-Sn precipitates. The identity of the L1<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>3</sub>Zr nuclei was confirmed by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and an explanation for L1<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>3</sub>Zr nucleation at 200°C where Zr is essentially immobile in Al is presented based on a combination of atom probe tomography (APT) and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"91de27f4a4b9283ce257eb2690da7b785ed40500fdc84b9d663a29586d978433","category":"Environment"}
