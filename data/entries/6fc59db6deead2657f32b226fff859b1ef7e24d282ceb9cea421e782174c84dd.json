{"title":"Parentage Determination of Chinese Hooksnout Carp (Opsariichthys bidens) Based on Microsatellite DNA Markers","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/8870953?af=R","date":1714978800000,"content":"<p>In this study, a panel of 14 microsatellite markers was screened to determine the parentage of 144 progenies in 12 Chinese hooksnout carp (<i>Opsariichthys bidens</i>) full-sib families. The combined exclusion probabilities for 14 loci were 97.6% and 99.9%, respectively, when there was no available parent information or only one parent information was provided. Simulation analysis demonstrated that the power of five loci to exclude false parents exceeded 99.0%, while that of eight loci reached 99.9% based on allele frequency data obtained from full-sib families (168 individuals). Moreover, the cumulative assignment success rate reached 100% with known parental and filial information when utilizing 13 or more loci, even in cases where no parent information was available. The results showed that this set of microsatellite markers proved to be a reliable and efficient tool for parentage determination of <i>O. bidens</i>.</p>","author":"Jianhui Ge, \nXiaojun Xu, \nJindong Ren, \nXiaoming Shen, \nJin Yu, \nBao Lou, \nMahmoud Dawood","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"6fc59db6deead2657f32b226fff859b1ef7e24d282ceb9cea421e782174c84dd","category":"Environment"}
