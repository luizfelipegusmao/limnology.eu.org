{"title":"A molecularly defined subpopulation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells controls the generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes during postnatal development","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002655","date":1720620000000,"content":"<p>by Shayan Moghimyfiroozabad, Maela A. Paul, Lea Bellenger, Fekrije Selimi</p>\r\n\r\nOligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are a class of glial cells that uniformly tiles the entire central nervous system (CNS). They play several key functions across the brain including the generation of oligodendrocytes and the control of myelination. Whether the functional diversity of OPCs is the result of genetically defined subpopulations or of their regulation by external factors has not been definitely established. We discovered that a subpopulation of OPCs found across the brain is defined by the expression of <i>C1ql1</i>, a gene previously described for its synaptic function in neurons. This subpopulation starts to appear during the first postnatal week in the mouse cortex. Ablation of <i>C1ql1</i>-expressing OPCs in the mouse leads to a massive lack of oligodendrocytes and myelination in many brain regions. This deficit cannot be rescued, even though some OPCs escape <i>Sox10</i>-driven ablation and end up partially compensating the OPC loss in the adult. Therefore, <i>C1ql1</i> is a molecular marker of a functionally non-redundant subpopulation of OPCs, which controls the generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes.","author":"Shayan Moghimyfiroozabad","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"024ee3de38f7cd8027da813722abb35286be1c1bdfc97a0d394c958448e19fa0","category":"Environment"}
