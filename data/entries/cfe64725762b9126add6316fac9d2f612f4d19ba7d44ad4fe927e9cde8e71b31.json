{"title":"Flight Control Design Based on Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion for Post-Stall Maneuvers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0423/v1","date":1722994629000,"content":"The nonlinear dynamics exhibited by aircraft flying at high angle of attack (AOA) pose great challenges to the design of flight control. The control design based on nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) is to reversely find the required control input based on the current nonlinear dynamics of the aircraft and the control objectives to be achieved. Since it is derived from the nonlinear dynamics of the aircraft, a single NDI controller can cover the entire flight envelope without the need for controller switching or gain scheduling. This paper employs the layered structure of the flight control loop to implement the NDI controller through the combination of aerodynamic control and thrust vectoring control (TVC). The resulting NDI controller is applied to an experimental F-16 installed with TVC to verify its high AOA maneuverability in the post-stall region. The verification simulation shows that the experimental F-16 under the NDI control can effectively track the high AOA command and successfully demonstrate the Herbst maneuver by performing the heading reversal with 70Â° AOA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cfe64725762b9126add6316fac9d2f612f4d19ba7d44ad4fe927e9cde8e71b31","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
