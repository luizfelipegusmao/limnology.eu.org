{"title":"Optimization of microbial fuel cell performance application to high sulfide industrial wastewater treatment by modulating microbial function","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305673","date":1718719200000,"content":"<p>by Nattawet Sriwichai, Rutrawee Sangcharoen, Treenut Saithong, David Simpson, Igor Goryanin, Nimaradee Boonapatcharoen, Saowalak Kalapanulak, Pornpan Panichnumsin</p>\r\n\r\nMicrobial fuel cells (MFCs) are innovative eco-friendly technologies that advance a circular economy by enabling the conversion of both organic and inorganic substances in wastewater to electricity. While conceptually promising, there are lingering questions regarding the performance and stability of MFCs in real industrial settings. To address this research gap, we investigated the influence of specific operational settings, regarding the hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR) on the performance of MFCs used for treating sulfide-rich wastewater from a canned pineapple factory. Experiments were performed at varying hydraulic retention times (2 days and 4 days) during both low and high seasonal production. Through optimization, we achieved a current density generation of 47±15 mA/m<sup>2</sup>, a COD removal efficiency of 91±9%, and a sulfide removal efficiency of 86±10%. Microbiome analysis revealed improved MFC performance when there was a substantial presence of electrogenic bacteria, sulfide-oxidizing bacteria, and methanotrophs, alongside a reduced abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens. In conclusion, we recommend the following operational guidelines for applying MFCs in industrial wastewater treatment: (i) Careful selection of the microbial inoculum, as this step significantly influences the composition of the MFC microbial community and its overall performance. (ii) Initiating MFC operation with an appropriate OLR is essential. This helps in establishing an effective and adaptable microbial community within the MFCs, which can be beneficial when facing variations in OLR due to seasonal production changes. (iii) Identifying and maintaining MFC-supporting microbes, including those identified in this study, should be a priority. Keeping these microbes as an integral part of the system’s microbial composition throughout the operation enhances and stabilizes MFC performance.","author":"Nattawet Sriwichai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"03a6a2219bc532089d316c051acca62cab6fc2cce603c9c4bb2803a944b8a37a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
