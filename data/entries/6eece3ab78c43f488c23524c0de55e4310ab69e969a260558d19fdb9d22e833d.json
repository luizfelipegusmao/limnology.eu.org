{"title":"A corn-fermented protein ingredient can be included in early nursey diets without compromising pig growth performance and health status","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txad149/7511660?rss=1","date":1704412800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In nursery diets, ingredients with high protein content and highly digestible nutrients, such as corn-fermented protein product with added yeast mass (<strong>GDDY</strong>), can be included as an alternative to common protein sources. This study investigated the dietary inclusion of GDDY as an alternative protein source on growth performance and intestinal health of weaned pigs. A total of 594 weaned pigs (5.7 ± 0.9 kg; 18.5 days of age) were allotted to 36 pens in a randomized incomplete block design. Pens were assigned to one of 4 dietary treatments: <strong>CON</strong>: a common nursery feeding program; <strong>SBM75</strong>: CON diet replacing 75% of soybean meal (<strong>SBM</strong>) with GDDY; <strong>FM/ESBM</strong>: CON diet without fish meal (<strong>FM</strong>) and enzyme-treated SBM (<strong>ESBM</strong>) + GDDY; <strong>GDDY50</strong>: CON diet replacing 50% of SBM, FM, and ESBM with GDDY. Experimental diets were formulated to meet nutrient requirements of nursery pigs and provided in meal form through four phases during the nursery period. Pig growth performance was assessed on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 53. Pen fecal score was assessed daily from days 0 to 14, and 3 times per week from days 15 to 35. Intestinal health was assessed based on plasma immunoglobulin A (<strong>IgA</strong>) concentration and the differential sugar absorption test. The total tract digestibility of dry matter (<strong>DM</strong>), crude protein (<strong>CP</strong>), gross energy (<strong>GE</strong>), and phosphorus was also evaluated. From days 0 to 7 and days 7 to 14, dietary treatment had no effect (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) on BW, ADG, and ADFI. For the rest of the experimental period, ADG and ADFI were greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) in pigs fed CON in comparison with those fed SBM75 and GDDY50 and did not differ from pigs fed FM/ESBM. Pigs fed GDDY50 tended (<span>P</span> = 0.082) to have greater serum IgA concentration on day 20 when compared with SBM75 and FM/ESBM pigs. There were no differences among dietary treatments for DM, CP, and GE digestibility. Phosphorus digestibility was higher in FM/ESBM (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) compared with SBM75 and GDDY50. These results supported the hypothesis that GDDY can be incorporated in nursery pig diets during the first couple weeks after weaning without affecting growth performance. However, in the late nursery period, inclusion levels starting at 14% can compromise performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"6eece3ab78c43f488c23524c0de55e4310ab69e969a260558d19fdb9d22e833d","category":"Environment"}
