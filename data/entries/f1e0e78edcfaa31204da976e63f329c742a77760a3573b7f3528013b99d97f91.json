{"title":"A New Therapeutic Approach Utilizes Probiotics, Prebiotics, Synbiotics, Postbiotics, and Gut Microbiota","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1866/v1","date":1714376082000,"content":"Recent advancements in gut microbiome research have highlighted the complex interplay between gut microbiota and various physiological and pathological processes, showing that gut microbiota plays a vital role in human health and disease. Imbalances in the gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, have been associated with a range of health conditions, including gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic diseases, etc. In response to these findings, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to modulate gut microbiota composition and functionality. This review paper explores the latest research on how gut microbiota impacts host physiology, immune responses, and overall well-being. Furthermore, the paper delves into the therapeutic potential of probiotics, postbiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in therapeutic applications and curing various diseases. The paper also addresses the challenges and opportunities in the field, highlighting the need for personalized approaches to probiotic therapy and the importance of considering factors such as strain specificity, dosing, and safety.Overall, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolving landscape of gut microbiota and probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics as novel therapeutic agents. It underscores the potential of harnessing the gut microbiome to improve health, prevent diseases, and complement traditional medical interventions. As research in this field continues to expand, a deeper understanding of the gut microbiota and probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics promises new avenues for preventive and therapeutic healthcare strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1e0e78edcfaa31204da976e63f329c742a77760a3573b7f3528013b99d97f91","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
