We interviewed 55 leaders at hardware startups, 20 of which are cleantech, mapped their development timelines, and found prototyping to be the longest development step (median of 19 weeks per prototype) regardless of prototype complexity or iteration. Qualitative interview analysis reveals the prototyping team’s choice of development style is a major factor affecting timeline. We define two development styles: natural and structured, typified by free-form exploration and rule-based execution, respectively. On average, natural development takes 35% less time than structured, and is thus preferred for early iterations, but adopting structure at strategic points is needed for timely commercialization. Critical points of transition to a structured style include adding new team members or engaging external partners, which demand clear communication and expectations. When pivoting to a new product or market, returning to a natural style is beneficial.","author":"Erin Looney","siteTitle":"PLOS Sustainability and Transformation","siteHash":"5acd099bb614e5ebff1e724af0cad6ab2b3ef1c50ce1616dc0b5d51f3d4a8e96","entryHash":"e2f0f7d93a1b862443d17610867544360953bbaeb88a11503d2c75106c91ab27","category":"Environment"}
