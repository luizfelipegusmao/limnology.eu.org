{"title":"Number of Components in the Graph Exponential with Complete Graph Exponents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1720/v1","date":1716800986000,"content":"Although Lov\\'{a}sz introduced the graph exponential $G^K$ in 1967, this product has received little attention. This paper focuses on the number of components in $G^K$ when exponent $K$ is a complete graph $K_n$. For a connected bipartite $G$, when $K$ is $K_2$, $G^{K_2}$ has three components; and when $K$ is $K_n$ with $n&gt;2$, $G^{K_n}$ produces $\\lceil\\frac{n+1}{2}\\rceil$ components. A connected $G$ with an odd cycle produces one component in $G^{K_n}$.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fdce2031b1383a3da8f5ebaefbc6a8010cc5bc972b02ff7d866208b662c19b48","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
