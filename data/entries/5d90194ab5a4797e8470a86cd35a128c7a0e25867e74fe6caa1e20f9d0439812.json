{"title":"Grammar-Based Computational Framework for Predicting Pseudoknots of K-Type and M-Type in RNA Secondary Structures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1078/v1","date":1723639174000,"content":"Understanding the structural intricacies of RNA molecules is essential for deciphering numerous biological processes. Traditionally, scientists have relied on experimental methods to gain insights and draw conclusions. However, the recent advent of advanced computational techniques has significantly accelerated and refined the accuracy of research results in several areas. A particularly challenging aspect of RNA analysis is the prediction of its secondary structure, which is crucial for elucidating its functional role in biological systems. This paper deals with the prediction of pseudoknots in RNA, focusing on two types of pseudoknots: K-type and M-type pseudoknots. Pseudoknots are complex RNA formations in which nucleotides in a loop form base pairs with nucleotides outside the loop and thus contribute to essential biological functions. Accurate prediction of these structures is crucial for understanding RNA dynamics and interactions. Building on our previous work in which we developed a framework for the recognition of H- and L-type pseudoknots, an extended grammar-based framework tailored to the prediction of K- and M-type pseudoknots is proposed. This approach uses syntactic pattern recognition techniques and provides a systematic method to identify and characterize these complex RNA structures. Our framework uses context-free grammars (CFGs) to model RNA sequences and predict the occurrence of pseudoknots. By formulating specific grammatical rules for type K and type M pseudoknots, we enable efficient parsing of RNA sequences to recognize potential pseudoknot configurations. This method ensures an exhaustive exploration of possible pseudoknot structures within a reasonable time frame. In addition, the proposed method incorporates essential concepts of biology, such as base pairing optimization and free energy reduction, to improve the accuracy of pseudoknot prediction. These principles are crucial to ensure that the predicted structures are biologically plausible. By embedding these principles into our grammar-based framework, we aim to predict RNA conformations that are both theoretically sound and biologically relevant.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d90194ab5a4797e8470a86cd35a128c7a0e25867e74fe6caa1e20f9d0439812","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
