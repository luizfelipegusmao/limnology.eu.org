{"title":"Exploring the Therapeutic Potential of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Antagonists in Neuropathic Pain Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0899/v1","date":1726059734000,"content":"Neuropathic pain (NeP) is a complex and debilitating condition that impacts millions of people globally. Although various treatment options exist, their effectiveness is often limited, and they can be accompanied by significant side effects. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in targeting the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) as a potential therapeutic approach to alleviate different types of neuropathic pain. This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive examination of NMDAR antagonists, specifically ketamine, memantine, methadone, amantadine, carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenytoin, dextromethorphan, riluzole, and levorphanol, in the management of NeP. By analyzing and summarizing current preclinical and clinical studies, this review seeks to evaluate the efficacy of these pharmacologic agents in providing adequate relief for NeP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b5f7e064f2c7ae61410c66b39bce8160caceee9af6680bc80081688e8ddf684","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
