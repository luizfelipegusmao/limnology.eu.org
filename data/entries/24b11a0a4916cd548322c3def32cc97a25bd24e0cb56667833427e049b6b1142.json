It is widely employed for tasks such as grain size distribution analysis, strain visualization, and more. Due to these capabilities, SEM-EBSD has become integral to research in metallurgy and mineralogy, encompassing fields such as steel and ceramics [<a href=\"#ozae044.266-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"24b11a0a4916cd548322c3def32cc97a25bd24e0cb56667833427e049b6b1142","category":"Environment"}
