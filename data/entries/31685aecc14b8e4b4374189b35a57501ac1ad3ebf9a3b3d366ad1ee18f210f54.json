{"title":"The SARM1 TIR domain produces glycocyclic ADPR molecules as minor products","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302251","date":1713448800000,"content":"<p>by Jeremy Garb, Gil Amitai, Allen Lu, Gal Ofir, Alexander Brandis, Tevie Mehlman, Philip J. Kranzusch, Rotem Sorek</p>\r\n\r\nSterile alpha and TIR motif-containing 1 (SARM1) is a protein involved in programmed death of injured axons. Following axon injury or a drug-induced insult, the TIR domain of SARM1 degrades the essential molecule nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), leading to a form of axonal death called Wallerian degeneration. Degradation of NAD<sup>+</sup> by SARM1 is essential for the Wallerian degeneration process, but accumulating evidence suggest that other activities of SARM1, beyond the mere degradation of NAD<sup>+</sup>, may be necessary for programmed axonal death. In this study we show that the TIR domains of both human and fruit fly SARM1 produce 1′′–2′ and 1′′–3′ glycocyclic ADP-ribose (gcADPR) molecules as minor products. As previously reported, we observed that SARM1 TIR domains mostly convert NAD<sup>+</sup> to ADPR (for human SARM1) or cADPR (in the case of SARM1 from <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>). However, we now show that human and <i>Drosophila</i> SARM1 additionally convert ~0.1–0.5% of NAD<sup>+</sup> into gcADPR molecules. We find that SARM1 TIR domains produce gcADPR molecules both when purified <i>in vitro</i> and when expressed in bacterial cells. Given that gcADPR is a second messenger involved in programmed cell death in bacteria and likely in plants, we propose that gcADPR may play a role in SARM1-induced programmed axonal death in animals.","author":"Jeremy Garb","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"31685aecc14b8e4b4374189b35a57501ac1ad3ebf9a3b3d366ad1ee18f210f54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
