{"title":"It is time to populate quantum multiverse.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0522/v1","date":1715248758000,"content":"At the beginning of our observations of relative universe, humanity believed that the earth was the center of the universe and that the sun was spinning around the earth. Claude Ptolémée (100-168), modelled the movements, in the geocentric referential. Then Nicolas Copernic (1473-1543) simplified the system by going to another referential, the heliocentric referential. We had to wait 14 centuries to understand that earth has been spinning around the sun and it was very difficult to change the believes.  Then we observed solar system, and gravitation explained the movement of planets with Isaac Newton (1642-1727). Classical mechanics was born. At the end of 19th century, classical mechanics became very complicated.  Then Albert Einstein (1879-1955) simplified the laws of gravitation with the spacetime referential and spacetime curvature, with general relativity. Gravitation became a spacetime curvature. Movements in the relative universe were explained, models of black holes and gravitational waves were predicted and experimentally observed. However, models of cosmos are divergent nowadays or very complicated because they include general relativity and gravitation combined with quantum theory. I propose in this article a new quantum theory of cosmos with a new referential: the quantum referential. I think this theory can completely change our believes. This theory does not take into account Einstein’s general relativity and gravitation. Therefore, the model of cosmos which results is highly convergent, simple, and it will be possible to populate quantum universes (multiverse) with bosons from matter and anti-matter annihilation. Indeed, we do not exist yet in this quantum theory as we are fermions. Therefore, by populating multiverse, and by transforming ourselves into bosons, we will not suffer anymore. If we populate quantum multiverse, it will be Love for everybody.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4376d7e0ffe632be2ffba798ab5e7a05055e1bded18c13135eb370bae79c70d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
