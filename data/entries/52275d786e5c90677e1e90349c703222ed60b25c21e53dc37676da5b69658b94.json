{"title":"Prevalence of cognitive impairment and its predictors among chronic kidney disease patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304762","date":1717423200000,"content":"<p>by Jialing Zhang, Leiyun Wu, Peixin Wang, Yajing Pan, Xingtong Dong, Linpei Jia, Aihua Zhang</p>\r\nBackground <p>Cognitive impairment (CI) is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and is associated with a poor prognosis. We assessed the prevalence and associated factors of CI in patients with CKD.</p> Methods <p>A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted by searching PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science through December 1, 2023. Random effects models were performed with subgroup analyses to further explore the heterogeneity.</p> Results <p>50 studies involving 25,289 CKD patients were included. The overall prevalence of CI was 40% (95% confidence interval 33â€“46). The pooled prevalence of CI was relatively higher in CKD patients from Africa (58%), Asia (44%) and America (37%). Attention and executive dysfunction appeared to be the most common manifestations. The prevalence of CI was higher among patients with hemodialysis (53%) and peritoneal dialysis (39%) than those without dialysis (32%) and post-kidney transplanted (26%). In addition, advanced age, the presence of diabetes and hypertension might increase the risk of CI in CKD patients.</p> Conclusions <p>People with CKD have a high prevalence of CI, especially in patients with hemodialysis. An early and comprehensive screening for CI in CKD patients is needed to improve clinical outcomes.</p> Trial registration <p>Registration number: PROSPERO (CRD42023412864)</p>","author":"Jialing Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"52275d786e5c90677e1e90349c703222ed60b25c21e53dc37676da5b69658b94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
