Stress-induced mucosal bleeding is a serious complication observed in many critically ill patients. Due to the harmful side effects of proton pump inhibitors, natural and active alternative treatment methods for peptic ulcer treatment that are safe in terms of side effects are an urgent need for human health. We aimed to investigate the dose-dependent protective effects of <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> GG (LGG) against stress ulcer induced by cold restraint stress in rats. This study was performed in a total of 42 rats, in control group (C), stress group (S), pantoprazole (20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) group (P), LGG (3 × 10<sup>8</sup> cfu mL<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) + stress group (M1), LGG (15 × 10<sup>8</sup>  mL<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) + stress group (M5) and LGG (30 × 10<sup>8</sup>  mL<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) + stress group (M10) (each <i>n</i> = 7). Ulceration areas (mm<sup>2</sup>) were determined quantitatively with ImageJ software. Glucocorticoid, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels were determined by ELISA and malondialdehyde levels were determined by spectrophotometric measurement. Histopathological examinations were performed in gastric tissue.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Therapeutic dose of LGG increased CAT, SOD and GPx levels; prevented excessive activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis; reduced ulceration and bleeding in the gastric mucosal layer; and provided stabilization of mast cells.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>We can suggest that LGG may be beneficial for reducing the negative effects of stress on the body, for protecting against ulcer disease and for reducing or preventing the risk of stress-induced gastrointestinal bleeding in patients staying in intensive care units. © 2024 The Author(s).
