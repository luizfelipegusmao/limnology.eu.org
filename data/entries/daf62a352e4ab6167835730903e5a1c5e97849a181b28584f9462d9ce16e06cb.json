{"title":"Adult-Onset Systemic Chronic Active Epstein - Barr virus Disease: A Case Report Highlighting Unique Immunophenotype and Novel Molecular Insights in the Context of Chronic HBV Hepatitis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2167/v1","date":1717394325000,"content":"We present a case of adult-onset systemic chronic active EBV disease (CAEBV) in a 40-year-old woman with chronic HBV hepatitis. Initial symptoms resembled a viral illness, progressing to recurrent fever, transaminitis, and anasarca. Investigations revealed high-level EBV viremia and an abnormal T-cell population in liver and bone marrow, indicative of CAEBV. Liver biopsy showed CD3+ T-cells lacking TCRbeta and displaying dim/negative CD5, with elevated EBV-infected T-cells. Next-generation sequencing identified rare variants in CREBBP, SPEN, TP73, and PLCG2, suggesting potential contributions to disease pathogenesis. This case underscores diagnostic challenges and management complexities of adult-onset CAEBV, particularly with underlying chronic HBV infection. Genomic profiling offers crucial insights into the molecular landscape of rare lymphoid malignancies, highlighting the importance of personalized treatment strategies. The distinct immunophenotypic features underscore the heterogeneity in EBV-associated T-cell LPDs, urging further research for optimized clinical management","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"daf62a352e4ab6167835730903e5a1c5e97849a181b28584f9462d9ce16e06cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
