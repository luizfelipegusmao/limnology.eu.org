{"title":"Influence of Habitat Type on the Composition of Pollinating Insect Assemblages in Two Protected Areas of Western Haiti","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0726/v1","date":1715585424000,"content":"Understanding the contribution of protected areas to pollinating insect conservation is crucial, especially in Haiti because of intense deforestation and environmental degradation. We compared pollinating insect assemblage composition and abundance in two protected areas: the suburban Wynne Farm Ecological Reserve (WFER) and the Urban National Park of Martissant (UNPM). Both sites encompass forest patches, agroforestry, and agricultural crops. Using colored pan-traps, we collected 3722 insects from six Orders, with 68.2% identified to family level due to taxonomic limitations. WFER exhibited significantly higher insect abundance than UNPM, though habitat differences varied between sites. Site, habitat, and their interaction significantly influenced insect composition. Among 118 identified families, only 30.51% were shared between sites. Our data suggest combined protection offers broader and more even insect diversity. We discovered patrimonial lepidopteran and hymenopteran species previously unrecorded in Haiti, emphasizing the importance of protected areas and the need for enhanced entomological expertise.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9240e66919ff93ed7456251a4b69e4a6f4ace57d765a628de63dc0e43fc61985","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
