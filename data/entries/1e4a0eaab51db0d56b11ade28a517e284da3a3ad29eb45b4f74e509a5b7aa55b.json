{"title":"Genome-Wide Characterization and Transcriptional Analyses of the Calmodulin and Calmodulin-Like Protein Family in Canavalia rosea Provide Insight into Their Potential Roles in Abiotic Stress Tolerance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0293/v1","date":1728022243000,"content":"Calmodulins (CaMs) and calmodulin-like-proteins (CMLs) belong to families of calcium-sensors that act as calcium-ion (Ca2+) signal-decoding proteins and regulate downstream target proteins. As a tropical halophyte, Canavalia rosea shows great resistance to multiple abiotic stresses, including high salinity-alkaline, extreme drought, heat, and intense sunlight. However, investigations of calcium ion signal transduction involved in the stress responses of C. rosea are limited. The CaM and CML gene families have been identified and characterized in many species. Nevertheless, there is limited available information about these genes in C. rosea. In this study, a bioinformatic analyses, including the gene structures, conserved domains, phylogenetic relationships, chromosome distribution, and gene synteny, was comprehensively performed to identify and characterize the CrCaM and CrCML gene members. A spatio-temporal expression analysis in different organs and environmental conditions were then assayed using the RNA sequencing technique. Additionally, several CrCaM and CrCML members were then cloned and functionally characterized using the yeast heterogeneous expression system, and some of them were found to change the tolerance of yeast to heat, salt, alkaline, and high osmotic stresses. Furthermore, this indicated that the CrCaMs and CrCMLs play important roles in stress resistance. The results of this study provide a foundation for understanding the possible roles of plant CaM and CML genes, especially for halophyte C. rosea natural ecological adaptability. This study also provides a theoretical basis for further study of the physiological functions of plant CrCaMs and CrCMLs that are involved in multiple abiotic stresses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e4a0eaab51db0d56b11ade28a517e284da3a3ad29eb45b4f74e509a5b7aa55b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
