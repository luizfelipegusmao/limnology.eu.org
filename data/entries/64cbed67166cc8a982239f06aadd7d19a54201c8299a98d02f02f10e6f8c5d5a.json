{"title":"Lessons from Eukaryl tRNA: Mammals Are Not Fungi","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1791/v1","date":1721735173000,"content":"Analysis of tRNA sequence structural features from forty mammals proves neither isoacceptors nor isodecoders are degenerate, and model organisms are inadequate representatives for multiple aspects of the translational process. It is proposed tRNA participate in protein construction beyond mere transport of amino acids to ribosomes: specifically, to facilitate amino acid modification and promote development of protein folding characteristics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64cbed67166cc8a982239f06aadd7d19a54201c8299a98d02f02f10e6f8c5d5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
