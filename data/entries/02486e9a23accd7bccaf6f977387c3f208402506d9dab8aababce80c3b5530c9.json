{"title":"Detecting Near-Surface Sub-millimeter Voids in Additively Manufactured Ti-5V-5Al-5Mo-3Cr Alloy Using a Transmit-Receive Eddy Current Probe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0342/v1","date":1717641307000,"content":"Additive Manufacturing (AM) Direct Laser Fabrication (DLF) of Ti-5Al-5V-5Mo-3Cr (Ti5553) is being developed as a method for producing aircraft components. The additive manufacturing process can produce flaws near the surface, such as porosity and material voids, which act as stress raisers, leading to potential component failure. Eddy current testing was investigated to detect flaws on or near the surface of DLF Ti5553 bar samples. For this application, the objective was to develop an eddy current probe capable of detecting flaws 500 µm in diameter, located 1 mm below the component's surface. Two initial sets of coil parameters were chosen: The first, based on successful experiments that demonstrated detection of a near surface flaw in Ti5553 using a transmit-receive array probe, and the second, derived from simulation by Finite Element Method (FEM). An optimized transmit receive coil design, based on the FEM simulations, was constructed. The probe was evaluated on Ti5553 samples containing sub-surface voids of the target size, as well as samples with side-drilled holes and samples with holes drilled from the opposing inspection surface. The probe was able to effectively detect 80% of the sub-surface voids. Limitations included the probe’s inability to detect sub-surface voids near sample edges and a sensitivity to surface roughness, which produces local changes in lift-off. Multifrequency mixing improved signal-to-noise ratio when surface roughness was present on average by 22%. A probe based on that described in this paper could benefit quality assurance of additively manufactured aircraft components.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02486e9a23accd7bccaf6f977387c3f208402506d9dab8aababce80c3b5530c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
