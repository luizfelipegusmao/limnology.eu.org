{"title":"Timed Interpreted Systems as a New Agent-Based Formalism for Verification of Timed Security Protocols","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0148/v1","date":1725353813000,"content":"This article introduces a new method for modelling and verifying the execution of timed security protocols (TSP) and their time-dependent security properties. The method, which is both novel and reliable, uses an extension of interpreted systems, accessible semantics in multi-agent systems, and timed interpreted systems (TIS) with dense time semantics to model TSP executions. We enhance the models of TSPs by incorporating delays and varying lifetimes to capture real-life aspects of protocol executions. To illustrate the method, we model a timed version of the Needham-Schroeder Public Key Authentication Protocol. We have also developed a new SMT-based bounded model checking reachability algorithm for the proposed structures and implemented it with the tool. The method comprises a new procedure for modelling TSP executions, a translation of TSP into TIS, and a translation of TIS's reachability problem into the SMT problem. The paper also includes thorough experimental results for nine protocols modelled by TIS and discusses the findings in detail.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"139c0767358b143ffae1d3806c5a51fa83dc7ed3775ecc202dc5f6b645435197","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
