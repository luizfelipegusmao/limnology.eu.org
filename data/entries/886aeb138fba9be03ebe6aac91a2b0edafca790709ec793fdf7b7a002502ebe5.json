{"title":"Improving Balance and Trunk Stability in Healthy Adults through Coordinative Locomotor Training (CLT)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1644/v1","date":1721620492000,"content":"This study investigated the effects of a ten-visit individual coordinative locomotor training (CLT) program, including both a hands-on and a hands-off approach, on static and dynamic trunk stability in healthy adults with sedentary occupations. During the ten-visit program, the performance of eight subjects was monitored using a modified one-leg stance test in the sprinter and skater position, the Y-balance test, and the scapula and ischial tuberosity control test in the four-legged position. The data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistics at an overall level of significance Î±=0.05. In the one-leg stance test, all subjects achieved a maximum value of 60 s on all ten visits. The improvement over time in the Y-balance test results was statistically significant for all directions (p&lt;0.001). In addition, a statistically significant improvement in the Y-balance test composite score was observed between the first and the last visit (p=0.015-0.041). Subject-specific patterns were observed in the results of the Y-balance test. Significant improvements were observed over time in the four-legged position test score (p=0.008-0.010). Overall, the CLT program led to a significant improvement in trunk stability and leg extension in the anterior and posterolateral directions, as well as a reduction in instability as determined by the composite score of the Y-balance test.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"886aeb138fba9be03ebe6aac91a2b0edafca790709ec793fdf7b7a002502ebe5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
