{"title":"Symptomatologic Profile and Associated Factors Observed in Patients with Dengue","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1632/v1","date":1724331094000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Dengue is an arbovirus caused by a virus. It is an endemic infectious and occurs in warmer climates. It is not uncommon for the disease to be asymptomatic. However, the severe form can also be triggered and require intensive care. In this sense, patients present a wide variety of symptoms, which can trigger comorbidities such as arthritis, hematologic diseases, liver diseases, kidney diseases, autoimmune diseases, and, mainly, diabetes and hypertension. Among the symptoms, the presence of fever, myalgia, headache, nausea, vomiting, leukopenia, petechiae, retroorbital pain, arthralgia, rashes, skin eruptions, cardiovascular symptoms, respiratory symptoms and, depending on the severity, the presence of hemorrhages may occur. Methods: 235 patients' anonymized records from a secondary hospital were analyzed. Ethics approval was obtained and no patientsâ€™ consent was needed. Statistical analysis used frequency distributions and Chi-square tests, with SPSS software. Results: Similar to other studies, our results show that dengue can lead to complications. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the distribution of the proportion of symptoms between patients with positive and negative serology. However, there was a significant association between age group and symptoms of fever and myalgia, with the occurrence of fever decreasing with increasing age and myalgia being more frequent in adults and less frequent in those &amp;lt;10 years old. Conclusions: Dengue can lead to complications, with fever becoming less common and muscle pain increasing as people age. Climate change could spread dengue to new areas. To address this, we need better vaccines and more effective mosquito control.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b86cea0c0dcfeaabd97fcb644890175612670322066eeb30a3d43552b109bcb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
