However, we live in a multisensory world, and how the eyes are driven by other senses has been explored much less. Here, we review the evidence on how audition can trigger and drive different eye responses and which cortical and subcortical neural correlates are involved. We provide an overview on how different types of sounds, from simple tones and noise bursts to spatially localized sounds and complex linguistic stimuli, influence saccades, microsaccades, smooth pursuit, pupil dilation, and eye blinks. The reviewed evidence reveals how the auditory system interacts with the oculomotor system, both behaviorally and neurally, and how this differs from visually driven eye responses. Some evidence points to multisensory interaction, and potential multisensory integration, but the underlying computational and neural mechanisms are still unclear. While there are marked differences in how the eyes respond to auditory compared to visual stimuli, many aspects of auditory-evoked eye responses remain underexplored, and we summarize the key open questions for future research.</p>","author":"Junchao Hu, \nPetra Vetter","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences: Table of Contents","siteHash":"98c7119f6adff358c1cf3a15f5efdc68ead59681d375d3da00900b474221c3c5","entryHash":"612898d7bb1b206048f9498b9a7a237734e91e59253712f9570731a44f4cf8bb","category":"Environment"}
