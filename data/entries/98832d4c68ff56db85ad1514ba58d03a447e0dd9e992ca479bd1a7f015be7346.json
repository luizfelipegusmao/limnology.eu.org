{"title":"Modeling the Stress-Strain State of a Filled Human Bladder","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1201/v1","date":1721081926000,"content":"The problems of modeling the human bladder and its stress-strain state under external static influence were considered. A method for identification of the anisotropic biomechanical characteristics of bladder tissue was proposed. A FEM model was created, which accepts into regard that the bladder is surrounded by fiber and affected by surrounding organs, and partially protected by pelvic bones. The model considered the presence of constant hydrostatic pressure on the walls of the bladder when it is full. It has been shown that isotropic mechanical characteristics of biological tissue can be used for studying the deformed state of a filled bladder if the filled bladder 300 ml is considered as initial non-deformed stage. This was shown by modeling and verification the effect of the external static force on the bladder. Numerical experiments were conducted based on the constructed model. To validate the results obtained, a series of natural experiments on the effect of external pressure on the bladder under ultrasound control was conducted. In the future, it is planned to use the constructed model to study rupture deformations of the bladder under the influence of static and dynamic loads.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"98832d4c68ff56db85ad1514ba58d03a447e0dd9e992ca479bd1a7f015be7346","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
