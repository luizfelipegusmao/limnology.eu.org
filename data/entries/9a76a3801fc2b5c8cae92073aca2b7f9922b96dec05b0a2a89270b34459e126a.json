{"title":"Seroprevalence of hepatitis B and C viruses and some possible associated factors among cancer patients at the Oncology Treatment Center, Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia: A cross-sectional study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308161","date":1722607200000,"content":"<p>by Tadesse Atanaw, Getu Girmay, Aragaw Zemene, Muluneh Assefa, Tewodros Eshetie, Gezahegn Bewket, Fikadu Alemiye, Debaka Belete, Nega Birhane</p>\r\nBackground <p>Cancer patients are prone to infections such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), which pose a major public health challenge, especially in developing countries. However, little is known about the magnitude of these infections among cancer patients in Ethiopia. Thus, this study determined the prevalence of HBV and HCV in cancer patients at the Oncology Treatment Center, Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia.</p> Materials and methods <p>An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 115 cancer patients from 15 April to 22 July 2023 at the Oncology Treatment Center, Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia. Sociodemographic, clinical, and other relevant data were collected using a pretested structured questionnaire. Five milliliters of venous blood were collected using a vacutainer tube, serum was harvested and tested for HBV and HCV using a one-step HBsAg and anti-HCV test strip with further confirmation through an ELISA test kit. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 and Fisher exact test was used to determine the association between HBV/HCV infection and associated factors.</p> Results <p>Out of 115 cancer patients, the majority (62.6%) were females. The median age was 50 (IQR; 40–56) years. The overall prevalence of HBV and HCV infections was 4.3% (95% CI; 0.6–8%) and 6.1% (95% CI; 1.7–10.5%), respectively. Sex was significantly associated with the prevalence of HCV (p = 0.011) with higher anti-HCV positivity in males (14%) than in females (1.4%).</p> Conclusions <p>In this study, the prevalence of HCV was higher and the HBV prevalence was intermediate in cancer patients. To reduce the burden of HBV and HCV infections, it is crucial to provide access to HBV and HCV screening services, strengthen vaccination, and improve prompt treatment in cancer patients.</p>","author":"Tadesse Atanaw","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9a76a3801fc2b5c8cae92073aca2b7f9922b96dec05b0a2a89270b34459e126a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
