{"title":"Comparative Analysis of Estimated Small Wind Energy Using Different Probability Distributions in a Desert City in Northwestern Mexico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0915/v1","date":1710526277000,"content":"In this paper, four probability functions are compared with the purpose of establishing a\nmethodology to improve the accuracy of the estimated wind energy in a desert city in northwestern\nMexico. For the statistical modeling, 3 time series of wind speed data were used, corresponding to\nthe years 2017, 2018, and 2019, recorded with a sonic anemometer at a sampling frequency of 10 Hz.\nFrom these, the analysis is performed with different stationarity periods (5, 30, 60, and 600 seconds).\nThe estimation of the parameters characterizing the probability density functions was performed\nusing different methods; the statistical models were evaluated by the coefficient of determination and\nthe Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, while their accuracy by the measured quadratic error, the\nmean square error, the mean absolute error, and the mean absolute percentage error. It was found\nthat Weibull with the energy pattern factor method and Gamma using the method of moments were\nthe probability density functions that best describe the statistical behavior of the wind speed and,\ntherefore, better estimate the energy generated, so it is concluded that the proposed methodology\nwill allow having greater confidence, both in the estimation of the wind speed and in the small wind\nenergy available for its use.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c34021f14c7bbcb4b07a42e52439b60b88e5c0056e8223ca6431b358c65f700f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
