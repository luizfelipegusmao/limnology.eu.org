{"title":"Stress Analysis of GFRP Joints Bonded with Different Epoxy Adhesives and Fillers at Various Temperatures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0787/v1","date":1723510325000,"content":"This study examines stress distributions in adhesive joints under various loading and temperature conditions. Finite element analysis (FEA) was employed to compute the peel and shear stresses at the adhesive interface and bondline midpoint. The analytical solutions proposed by Goland and Reissner were analyzed with modifications by Hart-Smith and Zhao. FEA revealed stress distributions at the adhesive/adherend interface and bondline midpoint. DP490 adhesive joints exhibited lower stresses than EA9696 due to a lower Young's modulus and the use of thicker adherends. Temperature variations significantly affected joint behavior, particularly above the adhesiveâ€™s glass transition temperature (Tg). Both EA9696 and DP490 adhesive joints displayed distinct responses to stress and temperature changes. The comparison between parabolic and biquadratic solutions for functionally graded adhesive (FGA) joints showed that the biquadratic solution consistently yielded higher shear and peel stress values, with an increase ranging from 15% to 71% compared to the parabolic solution at various temperatures. Comparing stress distributions between peel and shear stresses, emphasizing the importance of selecting adhesives based on stress type, temperature, and solution methods in optimizing adhesive bonding applications. These findings provide valuable insights for thermomechanical applications where thermal stimuli may be used for controlled debonding.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46b55891417882319df4d76a8382cfed74a2e708c5ef38a36d7b6a773e975cc1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
