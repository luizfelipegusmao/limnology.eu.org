{"title":"A Dual-Channel Naked-Eye Fluorescent Probe for Discriminative Detection of Sulfur Dioxide and Hydrazine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1168/v1","date":1728980594000,"content":"Hydrazine (N2H4) plays an important role in industrial production, but it is highly toxic, leakage or exposure will pollute the environment and cause serious harm to the human body. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is an important gas signaling molecule, but its excessive intake can cause a variety of diseases. However, due to the lack of two-color probes capable of detecting both N2H4 and SO2, the ability to monitor the crosstalk of these substances is limited. Therefore, it is necessary to find a simple and effective method for dual-response detection of N2H4 and SO2 in environmental systems and organisms. Here, we developed a two-response fluorescence probe PI-CO-NH based on FRET regulation to detect N2H4 and SO2. The experimental results show that the probe has high selectivity and sensitivity, excellent stability, low cytotoxicity and high cell permeability, can visualize N2H4 and SO2 in living cells, and has good mitochondrial targeting ability. It is worth noting that the ability of the probe to detect N2H4 in different soil samples and test strips was successfully verified. PI-CO-NH provides a platform for the analysis and visualization of two biologically active and environmentally important species, which has great potential in the analysis and monitoring of environmental pollutants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de9153167c8667c81cfb86e422694c208caae2dd38b54ce60bca445b9be34429","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
