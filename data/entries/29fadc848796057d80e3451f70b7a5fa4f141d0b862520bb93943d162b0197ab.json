The objective of this study was to investigate the protein expression, clinical impact, and prognostic role of MYC, BCL2, and Ki-67 in Thai DLBCL patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 100 DLBCL patients diagnosed between January 2018 and December 2019. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the expression of MYC, BCL2, and Ki-67. The study revealed a significant association between extranodal involvement and positive cases of MYC and BCL2. MYC expressions were associated with Ki-67 expression, while BCL2 positivity was associated with the non-germinal center B-cell (non-GCB) subtype. However, there were no significant differences in the three-year overall survival (OS) and three-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates when using cut-off points of ≥ 40% for MYC, ≥ 50% for BCL2, and ≥ 70% for Ki-67. Notably, DLBCL cases with co-expression of MYC and BCL2 exhibited significantly inferior three-year OS compared to other cases (0% vs. 53%; p = 0.020). Multivariate analysis identified age ≥ 60 years and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status as independent prognostic factors. In conclusion, MYC, BCL2, and Ki-67 expression can serve as prognostic biomarkers; however, their prognostic value may vary based on the specific cut-off values used. Therefore, determining the appropriate threshold for each biomarker based on individual laboratory analyses and clinical outcomes is crucial.","author":"Phuttirak Yimpak","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"29fadc848796057d80e3451f70b7a5fa4f141d0b862520bb93943d162b0197ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
