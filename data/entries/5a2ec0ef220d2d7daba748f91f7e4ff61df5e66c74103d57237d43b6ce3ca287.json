{"title":"Does the Use of Digital Marketing Communication and Sales Tools Affect the Economic Results of Polish SMEs?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1056/v1","date":1723641307000,"content":"The purpose of this manuscript is to examine the extent to which Polish SMEs use digital marketing tools in the context of their impact on economic performance. The choice of the objective is due to the research gap related to the lack of studies on the impact of the use of digital marketing tools on economic performance by SME companies in Poland.  In order to achieve the objective, a two-stage approach was used. The first stage identified the degree of use of digital marketing tools by Polish SMEs compared to EU countries based on secondary data. The second stage analyzed the impact of the use of selected digital marketing and sales communication tools on the economic performance of Polish SMEs. The analysis was based on primary data, which were the results of surveys conducted on a sample of 574 Polish SMEs in the industrial sector. The analysis used statistical methods such as difference significance tests (Mann-Whitney U test, ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post-hoc tests), Kendall's rank correlation coefficient and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARSplines).  The results obtained have theoretical and practical values. The theoretical implications are the enrichment of the marketing concept of customer value creation taking into account the digital customer, which is also the originality of the research. Practical implications refer to indicating to SME managers the need for, as well as ways of implementing and financing digital technologies within the framework of various EU programs for digital transformation of member states.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a2ec0ef220d2d7daba748f91f7e4ff61df5e66c74103d57237d43b6ce3ca287","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
