{"title":"Endocytic recycling in plants: pathways and regulation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/4712/7657456?rss=1","date":1713916800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Endocytic recycling is an intracellular trafficking pathway that returns endocytosed molecules to the plasma membrane via the recycling endosome. This pathway plays a crucial role in remodelling plasma membrane composition and is thus essential for cellular homeostasis. In plants, endocytic recycling regulates the localization and abundance of receptors, transporters, and channels at the plasma membrane that are involved in many aspects of plant growth and development. Despite its importance, the recycling endosome and the underlying sorting mechanisms for cargo recycling in plants remain understudied in comparison to the endocytic recycling pathways in animals. In this review, we focus on the cumulative evidence suggesting the existence of endosomes decorated by regulators that contribute to recycling in plant cells. We summarize the chemical inhibitors used for analysing cargo recycling and discuss recent advances in our understanding of how endocytic recycling participates in various plant cellular and physiological events.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"f298dd1edcbdfb57c4bfecbc9bc997d50b36140f6e67075df13f226ba0264dc9","category":"Environment"}
