{"title":"Paths to Attenuate Radiolysis-Induced Secondary Damage in Biological CryoEM","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.877/7720210?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The imaging electrons in a transmission electron microscope are a beam of bond-breaking beta-radiation. Imaging soft materials is a challenge because of beam damage and poor contrast between the substrate and specimen. Typically, only 10-100 electrons can strike an atomically sized area before disintegration [<a href=\"#ozae044.877-B1\">1</a>]. Peptide, hydrogen, disulfide bonds etc. are all irreparably broken by radiolysis while being simultaneously imaged. The total dose for loss of useful information is roughly the Henderson limit (often accumulated in a few seconds, see Figure 1), about 20 MGy [<a href=\"#ozae044.877-B2\">2</a>], which is roughly 9 orders of magnitude larger than an average person receives per year [<a href=\"#ozae044.877-B3\">3</a>]. This primary damage cannot be abated in small molecules, protein, or virus samples. In addition, unlike the case for x-rays, the inelastic scattering is more likely than elastic scattering for elements in atomic number less than about iron [<a href=\"#ozae044.877-B4\">4</a>]. This leads to poor contrast using parallel beam imaging modalities.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7ef04e394f3df4045b9e5df4416cd595747fef31d4a102d9b623adc7b1992ae4","category":"Environment"}
