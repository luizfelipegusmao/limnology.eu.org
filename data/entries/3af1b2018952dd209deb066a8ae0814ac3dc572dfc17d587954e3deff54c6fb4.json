{"title":"Mechanical Properties of Two-Dimensional Metal Nitrides: Numerical Simulation Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0624/v1","date":1728455868000,"content":"It is expected that two-dimensional (2D) metal nitrides (MNs), consisting of the elements of the 13th group of the periodic table and nitrogen, namely aluminium nitride (AlN), gallium nitride (GaN), indium nitride (InN) and thallium nitride (TlN) have enhanced physical and mechanical properties, due to a honeycomb graphene-like atomic arrangement, characteristic to these compounds. The basis for the correct design and improved performance of nanodevices and complex structures based on 2D MNs of the 13th group is the understanding of the mechanical response of their components. In this context, a comparative study to determine the elastic properties of metal nitride nanosheets was carried out making use of the nanoscale continuum modelling (or molecular structural mechanics) method. The differences in the elastic properties (surface Young´s and shear moduli, and Poisson´s ratio) found for 2D 13th group MNs are attributed to the bond length of the respective diatomic hexagonal lattice. The results obtained contribute to a benchmark in the evaluation of mechanical properties of AlN, GaN, InN and TlN monolayers by analytical and numerical approaches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3af1b2018952dd209deb066a8ae0814ac3dc572dfc17d587954e3deff54c6fb4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
