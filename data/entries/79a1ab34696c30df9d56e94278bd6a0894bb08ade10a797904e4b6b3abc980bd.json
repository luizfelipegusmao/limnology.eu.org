{"title":"Optimizing the Lateral and Vertical 2D In2S3 nanoflakes via Chemical Vapor Deposition for Enhanced PEC performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0801/v1","date":1728558193000,"content":"In the present work, vertically aligned ultrathin 2D In2S3 nanosheets are grown with a chemical vapor deposition technique to enhance the photoresponse by increasing surface area, and optical absorption. The 2D vertically aligned In2S3 nanosheets have shown excellent PEC water-splitting in terms of excellent photocurrent density value of  4.5 mAcm-2, incident photon to current conversion efficiency is 53 % and hydrogen production of 90% has been achieved in the visible region with higher stability. Ultrathin vertically aligned In2S3 nanosheets also show high responsivity, high charge carrier density, lesser recombination rate, and a capacious space charge layer for excellent water-splitting performance. This straightforward method of creating ultrathin 2D nanosheets of In2S3 also has significant potential for other fields where effective absorption and charge separations are required, like photodetection, optical electronics, and gas sensing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"79a1ab34696c30df9d56e94278bd6a0894bb08ade10a797904e4b6b3abc980bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
