{"title":"Sparganothis sulfureana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) egg surface characteristics stimulate parasitism by Ascogaster mimetica (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae092/7750681?rss=1","date":1725667200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Ascogaster mimetica</span> Viereck is an egg-larval parasitoid that targets <span>Sparganothis sulfureana</span> Clemens, a major cranberry pest in North America. While previous studies have shown that other <span>Ascogaster</span> species respond to cues from their hosts’ eggs, it remains unknown whether <span>A. mimetica</span> utilizes these cues to recognize <span>S. sulfureana</span>. We hypothesized that female <span>A. mimetica</span> recognizes <span>S. sulfureana</span> from another cranberry pest, <span>Choristoneura parallela</span> Robinson, based on the presence of surface cues on eggs. To test this, we observed female <span>A. mimetica</span> behavior when exposed to eggs from its host, <span>S. sulfureana</span>; a nonhost, <span>C. parallela</span>; and eggs of <span>S. sulfureana</span> that were washed clean with hexane. Additionally, we tracked parasitism rates in each group. Our results revealed that <span>A. mimetica</span> spent 9.5 times longer walking when exposed to <span>C. parallela</span> eggs and 6 times longer when exposed to hexane-washed <span>S. sulfureana</span> eggs compared to unwashed <span>S. sulfureana</span> eggs. Also, <span>A. mimetica</span> spent 3 times longer grooming when exposed to hexane-washed than unwashed <span>S. sulfureana</span> eggs. In contrast, females spent 6 and 18 times longer drumming and probing/ovipositing on unwashed <span>S. sulfureana</span> eggs than on <span>C. parallela</span> eggs and 5 times longer probing/ovipositing on unwashed <span>S. sulfureana</span> eggs than on hexane-washed <span>S. sulfureana</span> eggs. Higher parasitism rates were observed from unwashed <span>S. sulfureana</span> eggs compared to those from <span>C. parallela</span> eggs and hexane-washed <span>S. sulfureana</span> eggs. Our findings suggest that the presence of egg surface cues, like scales, of <span>S. sulfureana</span> likely plays a crucial role in host acceptance and parasitism success for <span>A. mimeti</span>ca.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"fdef982b0146fa9895bab8ea42c82a26aa97357f4002d65da424a4d7a3c5948d","category":"Environment"}
