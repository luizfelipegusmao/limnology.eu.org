{"title":"A Tale of Sustainable Energy Transition under New Fossil Fuel Discoveries: The Case of Senegal (West Africa)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1848/v1","date":1727147680000,"content":"The transition to renewable and sustainable energy sources is critical to solving the environmental and socioeconomic problems associated with the use of fossil fuel. This study uses an interdisciplinary approach to analyze the evolution, challenges and prospects of a sustainable energy transition in the context of recent discovery and exploitation of fossil resources. We study the case of Senegal from 2000 to 2027 and the role of natural gas in its energy transition. In 2000, Senegal's energy mix consisted of about 97% for fossil energy and only 3% for renewable energy. Nowadays, although fossil fuels are still dominant, but they account for about 70% of total electricity production. The country has indeed undertaken tremendous efforts to develop renewable energy sources including, solar, hydro and wind power, which currently account for about 30% of the total energy mix. Socio-economic indicators show that over the past two decades, Senegal's population and electricity production have grown significantly, leading to an increased energy demand/need. This growth has resulted in a five-fold increase in per capita energy consumption over the same period. Combining the strategic use of natural gas as a transition energy source with the continued development of renewable energy sources could make Senegal as a model for West Africaâ€™s energy transition. The projections for 2027 suggest a structural shift in the energy mix, with natural gas, oil, and renewables at 47%, 32%, and 21%, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"121a0889963a64e2facc698a9239b4c787c40bf20e8356095a0e5dd326d6826e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
