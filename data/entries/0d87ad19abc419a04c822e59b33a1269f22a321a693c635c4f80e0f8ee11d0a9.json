{"title":"Test and Analysis of Reinforced Concrete Beams Reinforced by Polyurethane Concrete-Prestressed Steel Wire (PUC-PSW)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2083/v1","date":1721987731000,"content":"In this paper, polyurethane concrete (PUC) is used as wire embedding material to form a new polyurethane concrete- prestressed steel wire (PUC-PSW) reinforcement method. The lightweight and high-strength PUC materials not only bond and anchor the prestressed steel wire (PSW), but also passively participate in the structural force. The problems caused by using mortar or composite mortar as the embedding material are avoided. Twelve reinforced concrete T-beams were tested for PUC-PSW flexural reinforcement. It consists of 1 unreinforced beam, 4 PSW reinforced beams, and 7 PUC-PSW reinforced beams. The wire embedding material, wire anchorage form, PUC material depth, amount of wire, and loading type were used as variables. The test results show that PUC-PSW reinforcement can obviously enhance the flexural load and ultimate load of the reinforced beams compared with PSW reinforcement. The ability of PUC-PSW reinforcement to limit crack development is better than that of PSW reinforcement beam, especially after the main beam steel yield. The strength, stiffness and crack limiting ability of the reinforced beam increase with the PUC thickness of the reinforced layer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d87ad19abc419a04c822e59b33a1269f22a321a693c635c4f80e0f8ee11d0a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
