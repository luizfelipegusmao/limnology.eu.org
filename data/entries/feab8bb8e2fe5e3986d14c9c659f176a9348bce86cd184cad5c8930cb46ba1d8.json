{"title":"From Play to Understanding: LLMs in Logic and Spatial Reasoning Coloring Activities for Children","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1321/v1","date":1724056970000,"content":"Visual thinking leverages spatial mechanisms in animals for navigation and reasoning. Therefore, given the challenge of abstract mathematics and logic, spatial reasoning-based teaching strategies can be highly effective. Our previous research verified that innovative box and ball coloring activities help teach elementary school students complex notions like quantifiers, logical connectors, and dynamic systems. However, given the richness of the activities, correction is slow, error-prone, and demands high attention and cognitive load from the teacher. Moreover, feedback to the teacher should be immediate. Thus, we propose to provide the teacher with real-time help with LLMs. We explored various prompting techniques with and without context Zero shot, Few shot, Chain of Thought, Visualization of Thought, Self Consistency, logicLM and Emotional to test GPT-4oâ€™s visual, logical, and correction capabilities. We obtained that Visualization of Thought and Self Consistency techniques enabled GPT-4o to correctly evaluate 90% of logical-spatial problems that we tested. Additionally, we propose a novel prompt combining some of these techniques that achieved 100% accuracy on a testing sample, excelling in spatial problems and enhancing logical reasoning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"feab8bb8e2fe5e3986d14c9c659f176a9348bce86cd184cad5c8930cb46ba1d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
