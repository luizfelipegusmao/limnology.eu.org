{"title":"Persistent Levels of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM Antibody Measured by an In-house ELISA in a Convalescent Latin Population Positively Correlate with the Neutralizing Percentages to Several Variants of Concern","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1226/v1","date":1724034707000,"content":"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent for the COVID-19 first registered in Wuhan, China and responsible for more than 6 million deaths worldwide. Currently, RT-PCR is the gold standard method for diagnosing COVID-19. However, serological tests are needed for screening acute disease diagnosis and screening large populations during the COVID-19 outbreak. Herein we described the development of an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting levels of anti-Spike-1-RBD IgM antibody in well-defined serum/plasma panel for screening and identifying subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a Latin population. We found that, compared to the RT-PCR as standard method, the in-house CovIgM-ELISA displayed sensitivities of 96.15% and 93.22% for samples collected up to 30 or 60 days after infection, respectively, as well as 95.59% specificity with 97.3% accuracy. The agreement kappa value (κ) of our CovIgM-ELISA was substantial when compared to RT-PCR (κ =0.873) and to SCoV-2 DetectTM IgM ELISA (κ = 0.684). The IgM levels detected in the population positively correlate with the neutralizing activity against the Wild-type, Alpha and Delta variants but failed to neutralize Omicron. These data indicate that our in-house CovIgM-ELISA is a compatible performing assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d526775504c6ecaf61bfb18f3860a2ca244b49ab3471f42fa6687901dc4fb7f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
