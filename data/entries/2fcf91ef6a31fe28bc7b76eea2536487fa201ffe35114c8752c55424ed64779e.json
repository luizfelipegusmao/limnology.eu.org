{"title":"Evaluating Success in Digital Transformation of Government Services: Insights and Evidence from Kuwait","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0124/v1","date":1727863193000,"content":"Digital transformation in government services is seen as a progression towards offering more efficient and convenient services. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments worldwide have expedited the digitisation of their services to facilitate social distancing. Digital transformation encompasses the shift from manual, face-to-face services to automated, online-based systems. This process occurs in three stages: digitisation, digitalisation, and digital transformation. However, the varying stages of digital government implementation across countries impact service outcomes differently. Little research has been devoted to focusing on the outcome metrics crucial for the success of digital services, particularly in Kuwait. Moreover, although the existing literature has explored some metrics, specific metrics have been neglected. This study aimed to investigate current trends and preferences in digital government services usage using empirical quantitative data gathered from users of digital services in Kuwait. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the aim is fourfold: (i) to identify crucial outcome metrics for the success of digital services, (ii) to assess how users evaluate these services according to these metrics, (iii) to examine significant differences between digital transformation and digitalisation services, and (iv) to develop and validate a model for evaluating the success of digital transformation services. To achieve the study's objectives, 378 users of digital government services were surveyed quantitatively. This study found that users primarily access services through smartphones and applications, underscoring the need for mobile optimisation. There was a marked preference for real-time, automated services, with dissatisfaction for those requiring lengthy approval processes. Six key metrics were identified and grouped into three domains: service-related (customer satisfaction and service quality), convenience-related (accessibility and ease of use), and security-related (perceived security and perceived trust). Digital transformation services outperformed digitalisation services in five key areas: customer satisfaction, service quality, accessibility, ease of use, and perceived security, except perceived trust, which remained consistent across both service types. Several recommendations were proposed to advance government digital transformation services, boost efficiency, and enhance the user experience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2fcf91ef6a31fe28bc7b76eea2536487fa201ffe35114c8752c55424ed64779e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
