{"title":"Presence of <i>Triatoma breyeri</i> (Reduviidae, Triatominae) in Bolivia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307989","date":1722002400000,"content":"<p>by Frédéric Lardeux, Alberto Llanos, Roberto Rodriguez, Luc Abate, Philippe Boussès, Rosenka Tejerina Lardeux, Christian Barnabé, Lineth Garcia</p>\r\n\r\nThe study focuses on identifying and understanding the ecological dynamics of <i>Triatoma breyeri</i> in Bolivia. Morphological identification and molecular analysis using gene fragments (<i>COI</i>, <i>CytB</i> and <i>16S</i>) confirms <i>T. breyeri’s</i> presence and its relation to other species. The species has been consistently found in the Estancia-Mataral–La Palma region since 2010 but has not spread to other regions in Bolivia. The region of occurrence is a small characteristic dry inter-Andean valley. A MaxEnt model suggests part of the Bolivian Montane Dry Forest ecoregion serves as a unique habitat within its range. The infrequent presence in Bolivia and the distance from its main range in Argentina suggest recent accidental introduction, possibly through human transport. Further research is needed to comprehend its persistence in this small area of Bolivia.","author":"Frédéric Lardeux","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cc1a267e91c473d5ea64c23a484983cc4813f97a91163cf1f9bb2a3134875f38","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
