{"title":"Promoting Food Security and Biodiversity Restoration: Insights from Kenyan Youth Climate Change Activists","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0920/v1","date":1728916620000,"content":"This article centers on the experiences and voices of eight Kenyan youth climate change activists by highlighting how they navigate local and global challenges while engaging in climate change action. Specifically, the article examines how the activists are combating food insecurity and promoting biodiversity restoration by discussing findings from two projects. The first project is the Ondiri Wetland Botanical Gardens, where youth activists have planted over 270 indigenous trees, of which about 58 are different species of trees native to the Kenyan Highland of Kikuyu, to counter the biodiversity loss and alleviate the impact of climate change on flora and fauna. The second project is the One Million Trees for Kilifi project, where activists are planting orchards in various schools in Kilifi County in Kenya to mitigate the impact of climate change and end malnutrition among K-12 learners. Guided by the Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) methodology, this study counters the deficit and exclusionary narrative that has often left out young people from climate change education and governance policy decision-making and advocates for a more equitable and inclusive approach that centers their voices and perspectives in solving existential problems like climate change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63e4233167d2dea433c459a04b356df1325e0d3a5f35ecf655bb94708927e5e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
