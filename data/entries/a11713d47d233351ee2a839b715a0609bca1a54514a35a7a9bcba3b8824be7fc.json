{"title":"Hydrotectonics of Grand Canyon Groundwater","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-080723-083513?TRACK=RSS","date":1721692800000,"content":"<div><p>The Grand Canyon provides a deeply dissected view of the aquifers of the Colorado Plateau and its public and tribal lands. Stacked sandstone and karst aquifers are vertically connected by a network of faults and breccia pipes creating a complex groundwater network. Hydrochemical variations define structurally controlled groundwater sub-basins, each with main discharging springs. North Rim (N-Rim), South Rim (S-Rim), and far-west springs have different stable isotope fingerprints, reflecting different mean recharge elevations. Variation within each region reflects proportions of fast/slow aquifer pathways. Often considered perched, the upper Coconino (C) aquifer has a similar compositional range as the regional Redwall-Muav (R-M) karst aquifer, indicating connectivity. Natural and anthropogenic tracers show that recharge can travel 2 km vertically and tens of kilometers laterally in days to months via fracture conduits to mix with older karst baseflow. Six decades of piping N-Rim water to S-Rim Village and infiltration of effluent along the Bright Angel fault have sustained S-Rim groundwaters and likely induced S-Rim microseismicity. Sustainable groundwater management and uranium mining threats require better monitoring and application of hydrotectonic concepts.\n</p><ul>\n<li><span>▪ \n</span>Hydrotectonic concepts include distinct structural sub-basins, fault fast conduits, confined aquifers, karst aquifers, upwelling geothermal fluids, and induced seismicity.\n</li>\n<li><span>▪ \n</span>N-Rim, S-Rim, and far-west springs have different stable isotope fingerprints reflecting different mean recharge elevations and residence times.\n</li>\n<li><span>▪ \n</span>The upper C and lower R-M aquifers have overlapping stable isotope fingerprints in a given region, indicating vertical connectivity between aquifers.\n</li>\n<li><span>▪ \n</span>S-Rim springs and groundwater wells are being sustained by ∼60 years of piping of N-Rim water to S-Rim, possibly inducing seismicity.\n</li>\n</ul><p></p></div>","author":"L.J.
