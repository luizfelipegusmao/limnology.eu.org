{"title":"Investigating the Influence of Fiber Content and Geometry on the Flexural Response of Fiber-Reinforced Cementitious Composites.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2332/v1","date":1722262372000,"content":"Abstract\nThis research investigates fiber-reinforced cementitious composites, with a particular emphasis on the geometric properties of soft micro and macro fibers. These fibers are characterized by a lower elastic modulus and larger aspect ratios than steel fibers. The composites were manufactured using a cement-to-sand ratio of 1:2.5, with 20% fly ash serving as a partial substitute. In order to attain varying strengths, two water-to-binder ratios (0.55 and 0.60) were implemented. Synthetic fibers, such as carbon and polypropylene, and natural sisal fibers, were introduced in volumes varying from 0.4% to 2.27%, with aspect ratios ranging from 71 to 3750. The flexural strength and behavior were evaluated using 75x75x380 mm prisms, while the compressive strength was measured using 50 mm cubes. Load-deflection curves were developed to investigate fracture behavior. The behavior of specimens reinforced with fibers post-cracking is dependent upon the matrix compressive strength, fiber type, quantity, and aspect ratio. A regression analysis was conducted on data from this study and previous publications to develop an equation that predicts the ratio of modulus of rupture (MOR) to initial fracture strength. The variables are matrix strength and fiber characteristics. The results reveal that carbon fiber-reinforced composites (CFRCCs) exhibit considerable brittleness post-cracking, despite exhibiting a flexural strength that is two to three times greater than that of control specimens. When workability is not compromised, the maximal load capacity and deflection are improved by increasing the fiber volume and aspect ratio. The maximal load stress is more significantly influenced by volumes of fibers than by aspect ratio.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9cbc96e19e756b97bef83035c79a0539825ffdbcb0ca206421b6c7db10c14e09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
