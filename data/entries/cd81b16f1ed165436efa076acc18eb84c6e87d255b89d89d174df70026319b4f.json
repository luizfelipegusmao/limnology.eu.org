{"title":"Micro-Opto-Electro-Mechanical Systems for High-Precision Displacement Sensing: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2195/v1","date":1721997528000,"content":"High-precision displacement sensing has been widely used across from both scientific researches and industrial applications. The recent interests in developing micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems (MOEMS) have given rise to an excellent platform for miniaturized displacement sensors. Advancement in this field during past years is now yielding integrated high-precision sensors which show great potential in applications ranging from photoacoustic spectroscopy to high-precision positioning and automation. In this review, we briefly summarize different techniques for high-precision displacement sensing based on MOEMS, and discuss the challenges for future improvement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd81b16f1ed165436efa076acc18eb84c6e87d255b89d89d174df70026319b4f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
