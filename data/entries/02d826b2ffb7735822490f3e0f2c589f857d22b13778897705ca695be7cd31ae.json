These characteristics are attributed to a fine two-phase microstructure composed of ferrite (α) and austenite (γ) presented in similar proportions. The presence of the ferritic phase confers a specific increase in the mechanical strength limit and resistance to stress corrosion cracking in these steels, when compared to austenitic stainless steels. Superduplex stainless steels differ from the known Duplex stainless steels due to their higher level of resistance to pitting corrosion determined by some alloy elements [<a href=\"#ozae044.276-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.276-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"02d826b2ffb7735822490f3e0f2c589f857d22b13778897705ca695be7cd31ae","category":"Environment"}
