{"title":"Longitudinal development and tracking of cardiorespiratory fitness from childhood to adolescence","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299941","date":1711720800000,"content":"<p>by Thuridur Helga Ingvarsdottir, Erlingur Johannsson, Vaka Rognvaldsdottir, Runa Sif Stefansdottir, Nanna Yr Arnardottir</p>\r\nBackground <p>Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is an important indicator of health in childhood and adolescence but longitudinal studies on the development and tracking of CRF from childhood to adolescence are scarce.</p> Objectives <p>The objectives of this study were (1) to assess longitudinal development and track CRF over 10 years from childhood to adolescence, and (2) to examine potential sex differences in the development and tracking of CRF during this period.</p> Methods <p>Participants were Icelandic children born in 1999, measured at the age of 7 (n = 190, 106 girls), 9 (n = 163, 95 girls), 15 (n = 239, 134 girls), and 17 (n = 202, 119 girls). CRF was assessed with a maximal cycle ergometer test and expressed as maximal power output (Max W) and maximal power output relative to lean mass (W/kg<sup>LM</sup>). Multilevel regression models were used to study the longitudinal development of CRF, and tracking was assessed with Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation, logistic regression, and the percentage of participants remaining in low, moderate, or high CRF categories between measurements.</p> Results <p>Max W and W/kg<sup>LM</sup> increased for both boys and girls up to age 15. Max W plateaued for both boys and girls while W/kg<sup>LM</sup> plateaued for girls but declined for boys from age 15 to 17. Boys had higher Max W than girls from age 15 and higher W/kg<sup>LM</sup> from age 9. CRF tracked at low to moderate levels from childhood to adolescence and at high levels in adolescence, with higher values observed for boys than girls.</p> Conclusions <p>Age 15 was a critical time point in the development of CRF, with values starting to plateau for girls and decline for boys. The results support early intervention for improved CRF in later years, with interventions targeting all children, regardless of their CRF level.</p>","author":"Thuridur Helga Ingvarsdottir","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5931ed6ff75926bf89074e6b79e038d920135ed015cfcebe3a44cfcd2ba73fc3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
