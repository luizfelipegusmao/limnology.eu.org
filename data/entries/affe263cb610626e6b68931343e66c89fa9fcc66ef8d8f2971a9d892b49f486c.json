{"title":"Fabrication of Helical Carbon Fiber Skeleton Using Arc Glowing Discharge Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1897/v1","date":1721801897000,"content":"An arc glow discharge device was used to prepare a helical carbon fiber skeleton with helical carbon fibers hooked to each other by spraying hydrogen and ethanol mixture onto the iron wire substrate through the discharge area, using anhydrous ethanol as carbon source. The various growth modes of carbon fiber during the formation of carbon fiber skeleton were investigated. A ring appearance that indicates a change in the direction of carbon fiber growth is observed. And double helical carbon fiber was constructed from single helical carbon fiber in two ways. A super-large carbon fiber with a diameter of about 13Î¼m was observed, and it is speculated that this super-large carbon fiber is the backbone of the carbon fiber skeleton. The mechanical properties of carbon fiber skeleton are isotropic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"affe263cb610626e6b68931343e66c89fa9fcc66ef8d8f2971a9d892b49f486c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
