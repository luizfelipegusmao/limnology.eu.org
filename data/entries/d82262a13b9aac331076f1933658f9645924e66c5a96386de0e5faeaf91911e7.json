The most notorious symptom of eutrophication is a massive proliferation of cyanobacteria, which cause aquatic organism death, impair ecosystem and harm human health. The method considered to be most effective to counteract eutrophication is to reduce external nutrient inputs. However, merely controlling external nutrient load is insufficient to mitigate eutrophication. Consequently, a rapid diminishing of cyanobacterial blooms is relied on in-lake intervention, which may encompass a great variety of different approaches. Coagulation/flocculation is the most used and important water purification unit. Since cyanobacterial cells generally carry negative charges, coagulants are added to water to neutralize the negative charges on the surface of cyanobacteria, causing them to destabilize and precipitate. Most of cyanobacteria and their metabolites can be removed simultaneously. However, when cyanobacterial density is high, sticky secretions distribute outside cells because of the small size of cyanobacteria. The sticky secretions are easily to form complex colloids with coagulants, making it difficult for cyanobacteria to destabilize and resulting in unsatisfactory treatment effects of coagulation on cyanobacteria. Therefore, various coagulants and coagulation methods were developed. In this paper, the focus is on the coagulation of cyanobacteria as a promising tool to manage eutrophication. Basic principles, applications, pros and cons of chemical, physical and biological coagulation are reviewed. In addition, the application of coagulation in water treatment is discussed. It is the aim of this review article to provide a significant reference for large-scale governance of cyanobacterial blooms.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nFlocculation was a promising tool for controlling cyanobacteria blooms.\nBasic principles of four kinds of flocculation methods were elucidated.\nFlocculant was important in the flocculation process.\n</p>","author":"Xian Yang, \nShulian Wang, \nKewu Pi, \nHongmei Ge, \nShuo Zhang, \nAndrea R.
