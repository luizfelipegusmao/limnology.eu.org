{"title":"58 Evaluation of a phytogenic blend on growth performance, health, carcass traits, and efficiency of dietary net energy utilization in finishing beef steers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/205/7665073?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to determine if a formulated blend of capsicum oleoresin, clove essential oil, and garlic essential oil (CCG; Fytera Advance - Selko USA, Indianapolis IN) influences measures of cattle growth, efficiency, health, or carcass traits, during the finishing phase in steers fed a concentrate-based diet. Charolais × Angus steers [n = 96; initial shrunk body weight (BW) = 391 ± 34.0 kg] were used in a 144-d finishing experiment at the Ruminant Nutrition Center in Brookings, SD. Steers were individually weighed and allotted to one of 14 pens (n = 6 to 7 steers; 7 pens/treatment) in a randomized complete block design and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: control diet without the test product (CON) or a diet including CCG at 500 mg/steer daily (CCG). The average nutrient content of the finishing diet was: 13.5% CP; 18.7% NDF; 2.06 Mcal/kg NEm; and 1.39 Mcal/kg NEg; monensin sodium was included in the diet at 30 g/907 kg. Steers were fed twice daily, and bunks were managed according to a slick bunk system. There were no differences (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.10) in any growth performance outcome from d 1 to 35, 36 to 70, or 71 to 98. The within pen standard deviation for average daily gain (ADG) from d 71 to 98 tended to be reduced (<span>P</span> = 0.10) for CCG steers compared with CON. From d 99 to 144 steers supplemented CCG had 5% greater dietary energy utilization (<span>P</span> = 0.01), tended to have 5% greater ADG (<span>P</span> = 0.09), and 8% improved feed efficiency (<span>P</span> = 0.01). Experimental periods when improved pen gain uniformity and feed efficiency were observed coincided with increased summertime temperatures. No differences (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.15) were noted for cumulative growth performance. No differences were noted for any carcass measurements or categorical carcass outcomes, nor lung or liver health outcomes (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.15). Use of CCG had no appreciable influence on any cumulative growth performance responses. However, the use of CCG decreased within pen variation in ADG indicating more uniform nutrient intake among cattle and increased feed efficiency during summertime heat events.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"f6131a320b92ff56f319a7b0cfa1d9257dcf30099ef1f2dce9f9e48b3ea53647","category":"Environment"}
