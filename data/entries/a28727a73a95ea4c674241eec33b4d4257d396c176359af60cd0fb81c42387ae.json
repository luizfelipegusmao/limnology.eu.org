{"title":"How Helpful May Be a CRISPR/Cas-Based System for Food Traceability?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2037/v1","date":1724832192000,"content":"Crops obtained by genome editing (GE) technologies represent a notable and disruptive shift from genetically modified or transgenic plants, outpacing public perception and regulatory frame-works. Multiple aspects of GE are contributing to the advancement of modern agriculture, in-fluencing the market structure by introducing specific changes within the existing genetic blue-print of an organism. Generally, the GE toolbox includes distinct technologies able to incorporate site-specific and pre-determined genomic modifications, exploiting well-established genetic modification strategies. For these reasons, GE-derived approaches are considered new plant breeding methods, known as new breeding techniques (NBTs). Particularly, CRISPR/Cas-based technologies represent a considerable improvement over prior techniques, being more precise, accurate and straightforward for targeted gene editing, in a reliable and reproducible way, with numerous applications. CRISPR/Cas system exploitation for non-editing purposes has also been widely documented, ranging from cell imaging to expression regulation and DNA assembly. Recently, CRISPR/Cas systems have been employed for target detection and could be used to ef-ficiently identify multiple organic chemicals. High-sensitivity and high-specificity detection are two main points of the CRISPR/Cas technology, without needing complex expertise or technical pipelines. This manuscript aims to provide an overview of the main advances of CRISPR/Cas-based systems into new frontiers of non-editing. The associated implications (e.g., molecular traceability) and their relative impacts are also presented and discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a28727a73a95ea4c674241eec33b4d4257d396c176359af60cd0fb81c42387ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
