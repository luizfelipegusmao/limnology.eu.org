{"title":"Significance of Internal Variability for Numerical Experimentation and Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2261/v1","date":1722243781000,"content":"When limited area models of the hydrodynamics of the atmosphere and of the ocean are 1\nrun over an extended time, variability unrelated to external \"drivers\" emerge - this variability is 2\ncolloquially named \"hydrodynamical noise\" or just \"noise\". This article summarises what we have 3\nlearned in the past few years about the properties of such noise, and the implications for numerical 4\nexperimentation and analysis. The presence of this noise can be identified easily in ensembles of 5\nnumerical simulations, and it turns out that the intensity of the noise is closely linked to the scale- 6\ndependent \"memory\". At the system level, this \"memory\" term as given by Hasselmannâ€™s Stochastic 7\nClimate model plays a key role. In the case of marginal seas, the process of baroclinic instability 8\nmodulated by tides and the formation of seasonal thermoclines are significant aspects. Some more 9\ngeneral aspects are discussed, such as the applicability of the Stochastic Climate model to systems 10\noutside of atmospheric and oceanic dynamics, the irreversibility of tipping points and the challenges 11\nof detecting changes beyond a noise level and of the attribution of causes of change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e114ed5164bc313548723a767ab682678afa6421796fc9c3ad0feb5fa84fc27c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
