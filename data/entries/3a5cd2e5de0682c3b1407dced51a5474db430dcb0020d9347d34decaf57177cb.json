{"title":"Analyzing the Influence of Energy Consumption, Economic Complexity on Carbon Emissions: Evidence from Malaysia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1499/v1","date":1713864260000,"content":"As a result of increased energy consumption, global trade has surged, and serious environmental problems have arisen. The problem is made more complicated by the fact that either environmental damage or economic advancement cannot be compromised. The elements contributing to environmental contamination must be identified and dealt with accordingly if we are to have a healthier future. In this study, what causes COâ‚‚ emissions in Malaysia are examined using the Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model using time series data from 1995 to 2020. The paper also examines the impact of energy use and economic complexity on CO2 emissions. Firstly, it is noted that the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory holds in Malaysia. Furthermore, energy consumption has a detrimental impact on reducing CO2 emissions. Furthermore, it has been noted that a greater degree of economic complexity leads to an elevated amount of CO2 emissions over an extended period. The findings suggest significant environmental policy implications for reducing CO2 emissions in Malaysia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a5cd2e5de0682c3b1407dced51a5474db430dcb0020d9347d34decaf57177cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
