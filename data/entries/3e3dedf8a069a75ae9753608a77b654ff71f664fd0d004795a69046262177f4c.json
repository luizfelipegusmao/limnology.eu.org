{"title":"Identification of the Promoter Antisense Transcript Enhancing the Transcription of the Equine Herpesvirus 1 Immediate Early Gene","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0974/v1","date":1715690006000,"content":"Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) causes respiratory diseases, abortion, and encephalomyelitis in horses. EHV-1 immediate-early (IE) protein, essential for viral replication, is transactivated by the binding of a multiprotein complex including the open reading frame 12 (ORF12) and some host factors to the IE promoter region. Promoter-associated non-coding RNAs (pancRNAs), which are transcribed from bidirectional promoters, regulate the transcription of neighboring genes in mammals and pathogens. In this study, we identified a novel pancRNA transcribed from across the areas of the 5â€™-untranslated region and promoter of EHV-1 IE and named it IE pancRNA. IE pancRNA and mRNA were simultaneously expressed in EHV-1-infected RN33B-A68B2M cells. This pancRNA was also transcribed in RK13 and E. Derm cells, which are highly susceptible to EHV-1 infection. Furthermore, IE pancRNA upregulated IE gene expression in the presence of ORF12, and stable expression of IE pancRNA increased the number of EHV-1-infected RN33B-A68B2M cells. These results suggest that IE pancRNAs facilitate EHV-1 proliferation by promoting IE gene expression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e3dedf8a069a75ae9753608a77b654ff71f664fd0d004795a69046262177f4c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
