{"title":"Synergistic Behavior of Hybrid Polymer Composites Reinforced Using Raw and Chemically Treated Agricultural Residues and Poultry Leftovers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0918/v1","date":1718270714000,"content":"The main motive of this study was to find an auxiliary application of the discarded agricultural remnants and poultry waste. Rice straw and chicken feathers are disposed off as landfills or incinerated causing pollution and environmental threats after their primary consumption. In this study epoxy composites were made using varying proportions of these raw and alkali treated materials. Flexural strength of the composites decreased till 35% fiber loading, followed by an increase. Chicken feather composites showed increased impact strength with fiber addition. Alkali treatment improved the mechanical properties of rice straw composites. Alkali treated chicken feather composites showed better impact strength but no significant change in flexural strength. Hybrid composites explicated enhanced properties both before and after alkali treatment corroborating noteworthy interfacial adhesion and synergistic effect of these fibers as ascertained from SEM images. The study evinced a better option for averting environmental problems by recycling these disposed materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7cdc7e3e058fe5a7ca2441887dd84ea2ae6c6c9e4005000f9ba50d8752543a95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
