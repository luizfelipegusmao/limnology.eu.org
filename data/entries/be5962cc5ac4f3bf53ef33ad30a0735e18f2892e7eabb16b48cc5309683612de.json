{"title":"Safety and Immunogenicity of the Intranasal Vaccine Candidate Mambisa and the Intramuscular Vaccine Abdala Used as Booster Doses for COVID-19 Convalescents: A Randomized Phase 1&ndash;2 Clinical Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0703/v1","date":1718100042000,"content":"A phase 1-2, prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial (Code RPCEC00000382, https://rpcec.sld.cu/trials/RPCEC00000382-En/), with parallel groups, involving 1161 participants was designed to assess safety and immunogenicity of two Cuban COVID-19 vaccines (Mambisa and Abdala) in boosting COVID-19 immunity of convalescent adults after receiving one dose of either vaccine. The main safety outcome was severe vaccination adverse events occurring in &amp;lt;5% of vaccinees. Main immunogenicity success endpoints were ≥4-fold anti-RBD IgG seroconversion or ≥20% increase in ACE2-RBD inhibitory antibodies in &amp;gt;55% of vaccinees in Phase 1 and &amp;gt;70% in Phase 2. Neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 variants were evaluated. Both vaccines were safe; no deaths or severe adverse events occurred. Mild intensity adverse events were the most frequent (&amp;gt;73%); headache predominated for both vaccines. Phase 1 responders were 83.3% (p = 0.0018) for Abdala. Mambisa showed similar results. Phase 2 responders were 88.6% for Abdala (p &amp;lt;0.0001) and 74.2% for Mambisa (p = 0.0412). In both phases, anti-RBD IgG titers, inhibition percentages and neutralizing antibody titers increased significantly after the booster dose. Both vaccines were safe and their immunogenicity surpassed the study endpoints.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be5962cc5ac4f3bf53ef33ad30a0735e18f2892e7eabb16b48cc5309683612de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
