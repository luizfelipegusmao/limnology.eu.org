The area of interest of the sample is excited by scanning an electron beam over it, with the emitted light being collected by a sensitive collection optic such as a parabolic mirror, and detected using a photomultiplier tube or a spectrograph. It is a versatile technique which can be used to study resin-embedded samples as well as thin sections. It enables rapid sample inspection (video rate scanning) by mapping the CL intensity, as well as providing advanced quantitative imaging capabilities such as high spectral resolution imaging (better than 1 nm). Scanning electron microscopy-based CL (SEM-CL) has the added power of providing complementary information from backscattered electron imaging (BSE/EBSD) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4d2c535465a3584ef0c0bf144773f0c4cbbbbe682390d7b16b4bb6d796d57c2c","category":"Environment"}
