Materials and Methods: In this study, 60 T2DM patients aged 18-60 years were randomly assigned to Groups A (30) receiving Metformin 500 mg twice a day after food and Group B (30) receiving PHMC capsule 500 mg twice a day after food in a prospective, randomized and open-label clinical study. The in-silico simulation study was performed to selected plants major compounds on target protein Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (1K3A). Result: The PHMC is found to be safe and effective in the management of T2DM. The FBS, PPBS and HbA1c were significantly lowered (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d3dae1ea6cf80eef1bc780c68a59e5ec2fbfe3fce2f0bb0f1f777a674299aa8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
