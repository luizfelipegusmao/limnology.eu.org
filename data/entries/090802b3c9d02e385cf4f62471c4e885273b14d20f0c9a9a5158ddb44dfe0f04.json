{"title":"Bacteria and Allergic Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1342/v1","date":1724079591000,"content":"Microorganisms have colonized all barrier tissues and are present on the skin and all mucous membranes since birth. Bacteria have many ways of influencing the host organism: activation of innate immunity receptors by PAMPs; synthesis of various chemical compounds, such as vitamins, short-chain fatty acids, bacteriocins, toxins. Bacteria, using extracellular vesicles, can introduce high-molecular compounds, such as proteins and nucleic acids, into the cell, regulating the metabolic pathways of the host cells. Epithelial cells and immune cells recognize bacterial bioregulators and, depending on the microenvironment and context, determine the direction and intensity of the immune response. A large number of factors influence the maintenance of symbiotic microflora, the diversity of which protects host against pathogen colonization. Reduced bacterial diversity is associated with pathogen dominance and allergic diseases of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, upper and lower respiratory tract, as seen in atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, food allergies, and asthma. Understanding the multifactorial influence of microflora on maintaining health and disease determines the effectiveness of therapy and disease prevention, changes our food preferences and lifestyle to maintain health and active longevity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"090802b3c9d02e385cf4f62471c4e885273b14d20f0c9a9a5158ddb44dfe0f04","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
