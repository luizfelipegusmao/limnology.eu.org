{"title":"Primordial Perturbations Including Second-Order Derivatives of the Inflationary Potential","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1681/v1","date":1727086158000,"content":"In inflationary cosmology the form of the potential is still an open problem. In this work, second-order effects of the inflationary potential are evaluated and related to the known formula for the primordial perturbations in a wide range of scales. We found effects that may help to unravel the unknown inflationary potential form and impose new constraints on the parameters that define this potential. In particular, we demonstrate here that even slight deviations in the inflaton potential can lead to significant differences in the calculated spectra if inflation persists for sufficiently long and the normal modes of perturbations are affected by these variations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a9fd2546f92669f416a869d14e4f4fd19564b610e092007afdf6395f3987ca6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
