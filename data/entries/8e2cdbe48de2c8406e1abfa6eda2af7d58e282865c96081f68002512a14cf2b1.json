To cope with hypoxia stress, a complex series of physiological and biochemical strategies can be employed in clams. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (<i>HIF-1α</i>) and antioxidant enzymes are commonly found in aquatic animals as an adaptation against hypoxia. In the present study, we cloned the <i>HIF-1α</i> sequence in clam <i>Cyclina sinensis</i>, and it consists of 2654 base pairs (bp) carrying a single open-reading frame that encompasses 2235 bp of the coding region. The predicted <i>C. sinensis</i> HIF-1α protein (744 amino acids) has the conserved HLH-PAS domain, which contained one N-terminal basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) domain and two Per-ARNT-Sim A/B (PAS) domains, followed by PAS-associated C-terminal (PAC) domain. <i>HIF-1α</i> is expressed predominantly in gills. Exposed to hypoxia, the transcript level of <i>HIF-1α</i> was significantly up-regulated in response to hypoxia, and then, the transcript level declined continuously with the time elapsed. The antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GSH-PX) in gills were increased initially and then decreased after acute hypoxia exposure. Our study indicates that the <i>HIF-1α</i> gene and antioxidant enzymes may play an important role in cope with acute hypoxia exposure.</p>","author":"Qian Ni, \nDi Wang, \nLingli Xie, \nHongxing Ge, \nZhiguo Dong","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"8e2cdbe48de2c8406e1abfa6eda2af7d58e282865c96081f68002512a14cf2b1","category":"Environment"}
