{"title":"Immersion immunization with recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae displaying ORF25 induced protective immunity against cyprinid herpesvirus 2","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13996?af=R","date":1720417733000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Displaying antigens on yeast surface as an oral vaccine has been widely explored, while its potential as an immersion vaccine has not been evaluated. Here, an immersion vaccine was prepared by displaying ORF25 of Cyprinid herpesvirus 2 (CyHV-2) on the surface of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. <i>Carassius auratus gibelio</i> was immersion immunized by 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mL yeast for 2 h, and reinforce the immunity using the same method 14 days after the first immunization. The results showed that ORF25 specific antibody in immunized crucian carp serum was detected at a high level, and the mRNA expression level of <i>IgM</i>, <i>IgT</i>, <i>IL-1β</i>, and <i>IFN-1</i> in vaccinated head-kidney and spleen tissues were higher than the control group, indicating that innate and adaptive immunity were induced. Moreover, the immersion vaccination provided effective protection for fish against CyHV-2, leading to a relative percent survival of 50.2%. Meanwhile, immersion vaccination restrained virus replication and histological damage in CyHV-2 infected crucian carp. Our data suggested that immersion immunization of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>-displayed ORF25 could be served as a candidate vaccine to prevent CyHV-2 infection.</p>","author":"Maoxia Yang, \nSheng Luo, \nQianjin Zhou, \nJianfei Lu, \nJiong Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"4258938de409ecde096dc9254ba27be67084fb84cc4cf5a5c2af002f9d3fa6c7","category":"Environment"}
