{"title":"Long-term increase in copepod community body size in a temperate estuary over a 40-year times series","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/5/486/7750919?rss=1","date":1725840000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We investigated long-term changes in copepod community body size in a temperate estuary in the Southeastern United States. Mesozooplankton samples were collected twice each lunar cycle from 1981 to 2020 during the months of March to July. We found strong evidence for a long-term increase in body size, likely driven by shifts in species composition, with the most rapid increase occurring during the most recent decade (2011â€“2020). Between the 1980s and 2010s, we documented an increase in the proportion of <span>Oithona</span> spp. (small species) and <span>Acartia tonsa</span> and <span>Pseudodiaptomus pelagicus</span> (large species) and decreased proportion of <span>Parvocalanus crassirostris</span> (small species). Temperature was inversely related with monthly mean body size, potentially driving the seasonal shifts in size, but was not correlated with the observed long-term trend. We detected strong seasonality in the normalized biomass size spectra slope, but the slope for each month did not vary interannually with changes in temperature. Overall, our study showed a long-term increase in copepod community body size that was not directly linked to changes in temperature but instead to changes in species composition.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"531869a84e30b1a4b6e6caeecb3dedeae98724743aa5b3c37b4b905378aea7e0","category":"Environment"}
