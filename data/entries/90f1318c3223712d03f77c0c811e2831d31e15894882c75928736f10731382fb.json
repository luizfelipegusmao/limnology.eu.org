However, the changes in the body size of fish communities in the western North Pacific, which is one of the most active fishing grounds, remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate changes in the body size of fish assemblages in the western North Pacific and whether fish sizes were potentially driven by the temperature–size rule, bottom-up effects and intra- and interspecies competition at a community scale. We evaluated the fish weight data of 6 stocks of 4 species from 1978 to 2018 and 17 stocks of 13 species from 1995/1997 to 2018. Weight reduction in the fish assemblage was observed in the 1980s and was associated with the biomass peak of the Japanese sardine (<i>Sardinops melanostictus</i>), indicating the effect of intra- and interspecies competition. Another weight reduction was observed in the 2010s, which was associated with a moderate increase in the biomass of the Japanese sardine and chub mackerel (<i>Scomber japonicus</i>). Our analyses indicate that stronger stratifications in the surface layers during the 2010s potentially reduced the nutrient supply from the subsurface to the surface layers. This limitation in food availability forced intra- and interspecies competition under a moderate increase in fish biomass. Our findings underscore the critical significance of integrating the impacts of species competition and climate change on fish sizes to improve fishery management at a community level.</p>","author":"Zhen Lin, \nShin‐ichi Ito","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fish and Fisheries: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3de509ad0f312c77d6dd4d37070c89263edb7695bf1d0e15e1eb17cfd4455e34","entryHash":"90f1318c3223712d03f77c0c811e2831d31e15894882c75928736f10731382fb","category":"Environment"}
