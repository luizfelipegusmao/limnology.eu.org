{"title":"Developmental, Physiologic and Phylogenetic Perspectives on the Expression and Regulation of Myosin Heavy Chains in Craniofacial Muscles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0650/v1","date":1710174977000,"content":"This review deals with the developmental origins of extraocular, jaw and laryngeal muscles, the expression, regulation and functional significance of myosin heavy chains (MyHCs) they express and changes in MyHC expression during phylogeny. Myogenic progenitors from mesoderm in the prechordal plate and branchial arches specify craniofacial muscle allotypes with different repertoires for MyHC expression. To cope with very complex eye movements, extraocular muscles express 11 MyHCs, ranging from the superfast extraocular MyHC to the slowest, non-muscle MyHC IIB. They have distinct global and orbital layers, singly- and multiply-innervated fibres, longitudinal MyHC variations, and palisade endings that mediate axon reflexes. Jaw-closing muscles express the high-force masticatory MyHC, cardiac or limb MyHCs depending on the appropriateness for the acquisition and mastication of their food. Laryngeal muscles express extraocular and limb muscle MyHCs but shift towards slower MyHCs in large animals. During postnatal development, MyHC expression of craniofacial muscles is subject to neural and hormonal modulation. The primary and secondary myotubes of developing EOMs are postulated to induce, via different retrogradely transported neurotrophins, the rich diversity of neural impulse patterns that regulate the specific MyHCs they express. Thyroid hormone shifts 2A MyHC towards 2B in jaw, laryngeal muscles and possibly extraocular muscles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc151efeffd0731c14bb14bc0741f0edcaf5b2fa205358dde84701929eaf5ca9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
