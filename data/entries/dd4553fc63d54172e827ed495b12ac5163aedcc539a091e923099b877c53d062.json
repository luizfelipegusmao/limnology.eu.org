{"title":"163 Affecting the senses: Impacts of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals on olfactory acuity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/126/7757323?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Evolutionary pressures have driven species-specific sensory system modifications resulting in a diversity of capabilities and adaptations. The sense of smell, olfaction, is an important sensory system in companion animals for communication, modulating behavior and influencing biological fitness. The enhanced olfactory acuity of companion animals relative to humans, and in particular domestic dogs, has led to employment of these animals in modern society as highly capable biological sensors. The use of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals in companion animals may directly or indirectly impact olfactory acuity. Identifying knowledge gaps, exploring capabilities, and addressing limitations associated with pharmaceutical and nutraceutical interventions is important in optimizing outcomes and maintaining minimal side effects, especially in working animals performing olfactory-based tasks.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"dd4553fc63d54172e827ed495b12ac5163aedcc539a091e923099b877c53d062","category":"Environment"}
