{"title":"The Output of Bacterial L-arginase Using 16S rRNA from Different Soil Environments in Egypt as an Anticancer Agent","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0056/v1","date":1722507025000,"content":"Background: The World Health Organization identifies lung and prostatic cancers as solid tumors with significant global lethality, both being auxotrophic cancers for L-arginine aminoacid. The aim of the study: The study aims to detect L-arginase-expressing bacteria from various soil environments in Egypt using 16S rRNA and characterize its anticancer activity. Methodology: A hundred samples of Egyptian grassland soil were gathered at a depth of 11–20 cm, close to wheat mills. Using fast plate assay screening and spectrophotometric analysis, the presence of bacteria generating L-arginase was verified. The major soil bacterial isolates were identified by morphological characterization, biochemical responses, and 16SrRNA sequencing methods. The anticancer activity of the test enzyme was assessed using MTT assay. Results: On the MAA medium, only the bacterial isolates capable of using L-arginine as the only metabolic source for carbon and nitrogen were cultivated. Bacillus cereus DSM 360 was shown to be the prevailing bacterial isolate generating L-arginase using molecular detection and biochemical reactions. When Co+2, Ni+2, and Mn+2 metal ions were present as co-factors, bacterial L-arginase demonstrated remarkable anticancer action against auxotrophic tumors for L-arginine. The total protein content was 0.349 mg, while total enzyme activity was 8.174 U with 61% enzyme recovery. As well as the specific activity reached 23.4212 U/mg. Using the mass spectrometer, the molecular weight of the bacterial L-arginase was revealed to be 37 KDa. The bacterial L-arginase's IC50 values were 3.12 U/ml for the lung cancer cell line, 3.91 U/ml for prostatic cancer cell line, 0.91 U/ml for acute promyelocytic leukemia cancer cell line and 2.73 U/ml for kidney cancer cell line. The enzyme under test showed kinetic characteristics of 7.36 mmol/l and 6.14 μmol/min for Km and Vmax, respectively. The half-life time (T1/2) was 90.17 min at 50°С, while being 86.53 min at 60°С. The test enzyme was thermostable at 60°С for 1 hour. Conclusion: The study showed a potential strategy by identifying and determining a newly discovered bacterial L-arginase enzyme as an anticancer agent in Egypt's soil settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d03afb7b8ea61bedcb98e61d18089cf10557f5e2d22a1a38dce0508e9bb2374","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
