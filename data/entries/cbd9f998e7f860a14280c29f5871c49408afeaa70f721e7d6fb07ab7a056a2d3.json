{"title":"Determination of the effects of sunset yellow on mouse liver and pancreas using histological methods","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae070/7668008?rss=1","date":1715299200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>Sunset Yellow (SY) is an azo synthetic food dye. Although the amount of SY consumed varies in different periods of life, it increases especially in children and adolescents. It may cause pathologic effects in organs at early ages. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of SY on the liver and pancreas of mice of different age groups using histological methods.<div>Methods</div>The study included Swiss albino mice that were divided into three treatment groups and three control groups based on age (4, 8, and 10 weeks old), with six mice in each group (n = 6/group). SY was administered at 30 mg/kg/bw/week orally for 28 days to treatment groups. The liver and pancreas tissues were kept in 10% formaldehyde, then passed through alcohol and xylene series and stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin.<div>Results</div>They were evaluated using light and electron microscopy. In SY groups, the mean body weight (p: 0.026) and the mean liver weight (p: 0.013) of the mice increased, and their mean pancreas weight decreased (p: 0.045).The numbers of degenerative cells in the liver tissues of the mice in the SY groups were high. Severe dilation in the sinusoids and haemorrhages focused around the Vena Cava were detected. In the pancreatic tissues of the SY groups, increases in fibroblasts and lymphocytic infiltration were observed.<div>Conclusions</div>Pathologies interpreted as chronic pancreatitis were more intense in the weaning group (4 weeks old). SY may be more harmful at an early age, and it may be beneficial to limit its use during this period.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"cbd9f998e7f860a14280c29f5871c49408afeaa70f721e7d6fb07ab7a056a2d3","category":"Environment"}
