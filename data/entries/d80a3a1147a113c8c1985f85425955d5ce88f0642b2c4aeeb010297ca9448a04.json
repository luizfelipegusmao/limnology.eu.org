{"title":"Reliability Analysis of Developing Programs for Converting MIDAS GEN to ANSYS Models Based on Python","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0435/v1","date":1728295238000,"content":"The reasonableness and accuracy of engineering design are often assessed through the use of a variety of structural design analysis software, which are then compared and verified. However, it is challenging for a single analysis software to meet the diverse and complex design requirements. In order to meet the specific engineering requirements, it is necessary to convert the MIDAS result model into an ANSYS structural model and conduct a nonlinear analysis and simulation in ANSYS. Nevertheless, the existing interface is unable to facilitate direct conversion of the model. Accordingly, this paper presents a Python-based ANSYS APDL program that enables the complete conversion of MIDAS GEN structural models to ANSYS finite element models. The program is capable of converting a range of data, including material, section, element, connection, load, node mass, constraint, time history function, and so forth. The program is capable of converting specific connection units, including elastic and general connection units. Additionally, the beam-column section direction, beam end freedom release, rigid element, and special anti-rocking structure of the structure can be considered. Ultimately, the theatre model is transformed. Following a comparison of the analysis results, it was found that the mass and mode of the model before and after the transformation were essentially identical. The maximum error of the first six orders of the structure is 2.95%, with the structural displacement under gravity load remaining essentially unchanged. The research and analysis demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the MIDAS GEN conversion ANSYS program. The conversion program significantly reduces the time required for direct modeling in ANSYS, enhancing work efficiency. The study has considerable practical significance for the seismic sway design and analysis of buildings based on vibration isolation design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d80a3a1147a113c8c1985f85425955d5ce88f0642b2c4aeeb010297ca9448a04","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
