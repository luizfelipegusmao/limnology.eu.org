{"title":"Cranial anatomy of the Triassic rhynchosaur Mesosuchus browni based on computed tomography, with a discussion of the vomeronasal system and its deep history in Reptilia","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlae097/7731279?rss=1","date":1723248000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The stem lineage of Archosauria is populated by a diverse fossil record that remains notably understudied relative to the crown clade. Prominent among these specimens is a beautifully preserved skull of the early mid-Triassic rhynchosaur <span>Mesosuchus browni</span> [Iziko South African Museum (SAM) 6536], whose phylogenetic position has considerable influence on patterns of pan-archosaurian cranial evolution. We used high-resolution, micro-computed tomography to re-examine the anatomy of this specimen, building on previous studies that were either limited to external observations or restricted to the braincase. A digital segmentation of the cranial elements and primary neurovascular canals of SAM-PK-6536 allows for expanded character scoring and constitutes a foundation for future comparative insights. Our data support the phylogenetically oldest instance of a pneumatized maxilla in a pan-archosaur, bringing the record of antorbital pneumatization into closer alignment with that of the neurocranium. The nasal cavity and primary palate of <span>Mesosuchus</span> includes a complex septomaxilla, a novel element anterior to the vomer, and is likely to have supported a well-developed vomeronasal system. The evolution of this system is discussed in terms of both phylogenetic pattern and how the skeletal architecture of <span>Mesosuchus</span> and other fossils could inform the signalling dynamics that pattern the vomeronasal system during development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"58a7d581778f3c0c48cf734f1db4c674eac5193727044668278686a7fd6eb8f4","category":"Environment"}
