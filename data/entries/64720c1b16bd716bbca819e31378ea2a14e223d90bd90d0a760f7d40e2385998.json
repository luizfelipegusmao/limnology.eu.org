{"title":"The Inverted U‐Shaped Relationship Between Socio‐Economic Status and Infections During the COVID‐19 Pandemic","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GH001025?af=R","date":1716447600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Although the World Health Organization has declared that the COVID-19 pandemic no longer qualifies as a global public health emergency, it still needs to explore the response of society to the COVID-19 pandemic. Socio-economic status (SES) was proven to be linearly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, although this relationship may be more complex due to regional differences. In the study, we analyzed and revealed the effects and mechanisms of SES on infections among low, lower-middle, upper-middle and high SES group (LSG, LMSG, UMSG, and HSG, respectively). The results showed that the relationship between SES and infections was inverted U-shaped, especially in the first three phases. In Phase I, UMSG had the highest number of infections, with an average of 238.31/1M people (95%CI: 135.47–341.15/1M people). In Phases II and III, infections decreased insignificantly with increasing SES (<i>r</i> = −0.01, <i>p</i> = 0.92; <i>r</i> = −0.11, <i>p</i> = 0.22) and the highest number of infections were found in the LMSG. In Phase IV, SES was positively related to the number of infections (<i>r</i> = 0.54, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the nonlinear impact of multiple factors related to SES on the infections explains the complex relationships between SES and infections. SES affected infections mainly through medical resources, demographics and vaccination, and differed across the SES groups. Particularly, demographics could exert an impact on population mobility, subsequently influencing infections in LMSG, with an indirect effect of 0.01 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in Phase II. This study argues for greater attention to countries with middle SES and the need for future targeted measures to cope with infectious diseases.</p>","author":"Yelin Sun, \nWeihang Liu, \nGangfeng Zhang, \nPeijun Shi","siteTitle":"Wiley: GeoHealth: Table of Contents","siteHash":"018a2f8ee482f9683e9bc368088d60586256b9cdf0b21bf2031822bf8cde1d3a","entryHash":"64720c1b16bd716bbca819e31378ea2a14e223d90bd90d0a760f7d40e2385998","category":"Environment"}
