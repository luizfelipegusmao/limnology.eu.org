{"title":"Phage Anti-Pycsar Proteins Efficiently Degrade &beta;-Lactam Antibiotics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0921/v1","date":1720666361000,"content":"Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) are members of the structurally conserved but functionally diverse MBL-fold superfamily of metallohydrolases. MBLs are a major concern for global health care as they efficiently inactivate β-lactam antibiotics, including the “last-resort” carbapenems, and no clinically suitable inhibitors are currently available. Increasingly, promiscuous β-lactamase activity is also observed in other members of the superfamily, including from viruses, which represents an underexplored reservoir for future pathways to antibiotic resistance. Here, two such MBL-fold enzymes from Bacillus phages, the cyclic mononucleotide-degrading proteins ApycGoe3 and ApycGrass, are shown to efficiently degrade β-lactam substrates in vitro. In particular, ApycGrass displays a distinct preference for carbapenem substrates with a catalytic efficiency that is within one order of magnitude of that of the clinically relevant MBL NDM-1. Mutagenesis experiments also demonstrate that the loss of a metal-bridging aspartate residue reduces nuclease activity up to 35-fold, but improves carbapenemase activity. In addition, we propose that the oligomeric state significantly influences β-lactamase activity by modifying access to the active site pocket. Together, these observations hint at a possible new avenue of resistance via the spread of phage-borne MBL-fold enzymes with β-lactamase activity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d543568d415c10ab892be3b84ec19a9429e7ff7ecb9922380d646f4a139d13c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
