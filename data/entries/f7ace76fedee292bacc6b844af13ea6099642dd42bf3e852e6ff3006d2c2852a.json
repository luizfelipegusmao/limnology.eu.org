{"title":"Exploring the Prevalence of Hypomineralised Second Primary Molars (HSPM) and Molar Incisor Hypomineralisation (MIH) As Perceived by Northern Italian Dentists: A Comprehensive Survey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1817/v1","date":1711697495000,"content":"Aim: The purpose of this study was to collect prevalence data of Hypomineralized Second Primary Molars (HSPM) and Molar Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH) among pediatric patients treated by dental practitioners in Northern Italy and assess the practitionersâ€™ awareness of these conditions. Methods: A cross-sectional pilot study was conducted using a structured online questionnaire administered through Google Forms. The survey comprised 10 single-choice questions addressing the prevalence of opacities affecting molars and an index of HSPM and MIH in caries-free children aged 6-9 years, categorized by percentage. Results: A total of 315 dentists participated in the survey, yielding a response rate of 31.5%. The majority of respondents (59%) reported HSPM prevalence in 1-25% of their patients, while 18% observed no opacity in any of their patients. MIH was observed in HSPM patients in 1-25% and 25-50% of cases, as reported by 44% and 31% of respondents, respectively. Among non-HSPM patients, MIH was observed in 1-25% of children (reported by 74% of respondents). Conclusion: The findings from this pilot survey show substantial agreement with existing prevalence data on HSPM and MIH reported in the literature. The co-occurrence rate of HSPM and MIH defects supports the hypothesis of HSPM potentially serving as a predictor of MIH. The study underscores a significant need to enhance awareness of these defects for early diagnosis and effective management. Additionally, there is a call for the promotion of standardized diagnostic protocols to obtain more accurate epidemiological data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f7ace76fedee292bacc6b844af13ea6099642dd42bf3e852e6ff3006d2c2852a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
