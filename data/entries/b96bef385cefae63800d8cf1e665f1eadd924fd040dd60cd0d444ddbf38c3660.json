We re-evaluated these outcomes in the Tsepamo Study during the Omicron era. We assessed maternal mortality and adverse birth outcomes for all singleton pregnancies from mid-November 2021 (the start of the Omicron era) to mid-August 2022 at nine Tsepamo sites, among individuals with documented SARS-CoV-2 screening PCR or antigen tests and known HIV status. Of 9,705 women routinely screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection at delivery (64% of deliveries at these sites), 373 (3.8%) tested positive. Women with HIV were as likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 (77/1833, 4.2%) as women without HIV (293/6981, 4.2%) (p = 1.0). There were 5 recorded maternal deaths (0.03%), one occurring in a woman with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. In contrast, maternal mortality was 3.7% and 0.1% in those with and without SARS-CoV-2, respectively, during the pre-Omicron era. In the Omicron era, there were no differences among infants exposed or unexposed to SARS-CoV-2 in overall adverse birth outcomes (28.1% vs 29.6%; aRR 1.0, 95%CI 0.8–1.1), severe adverse birth outcomes (11.9 vs 10.6%; aRR 1.1, 95%CI 0.8–1.5), preterm delivery (15.1% vs 14.9%; aRR 1.0, 95%CI 0.8–1.3), or stillbirth (1.9% vs 2.3%; aRR 0.8, 95%CI 0.4–1.7). Adverse outcomes among those exposed to both HIV and SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those exposed to HIV alone (31.2% vs. 33.1%; aRR 0.9, 95%CI 0.6–1.3; p = 0.5). Maternal mortality was far lower in Botswana during the Omicron era than in the pre-Omicron era, and adverse birth outcomes were no longer significantly impacted by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 either overall or with HIV co-exposure. Increased population immunity to SARS-CoV-2, less stress on the hospital systems in the Omicron era, and possible differences in viral pathogenicity may combine to explain these findings.","author":"Jaspreet Banga","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b96bef385cefae63800d8cf1e665f1eadd924fd040dd60cd0d444ddbf38c3660","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
