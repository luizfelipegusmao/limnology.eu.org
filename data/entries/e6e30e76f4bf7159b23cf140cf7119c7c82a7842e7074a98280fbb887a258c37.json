{"title":"Carrier Frequency Offset Impact on Ufmc/NUCs Performance: A Dvb-T2 Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1656/v1","date":1729582000000,"content":"Digital terrestrial television is now implemented in many world wide countries and is \nnow mature. Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial, second generation (DVB-T2) is the European \nstandard adopted or deployed by European and African countries which uses Orthogonal Frequency \nDivision Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation to achieve a good throughput performance. However, \nits main particularity is the number of subcarriers operated for OFDM modulation which is high \n(up to 32768). Also, mobile reception is planned in DVB-T2 in addition to rooftop antenna and \nportable receptions planned in DVB-T. But, the main challenge of DVB-T2 for mobile reception is the \npresence of Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) which degrades the system performance by inducing \nan InterCarrier Interference (ICI) on DVB-T2 signal. This paper evaluates the system performance \nin the presence of the CFO when Gaussian noise and TU6 channel are applied. Universal Filtered \nMulticarrier (UFMC) and Non Uniform Constellations (NUCs) have previously demonstrated good \nperformances in comparison with OFDM and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) in DVB-T2. \nThe impact of CFO on the UFMC and NUCs based DVB-T2 system is additionally investigated in \nthis work. The results demonstrate that the penalties induced by CFO insertion in UFMC and NUCs \nbased DVB-T2 are highly reduced in comparison to those for the native DVB-T2. At a BER of 10âˆ’3, \nthe CFO penalties induced by the native DVB-T2 are respectively 0.96 dB and 4 dB when only AWGN \nis used and when TU6 is additionally considered. The penalties are equals to 0.84 dB and 0.2 dB for \nUFMC/NUCs based DVB-T2.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e6e30e76f4bf7159b23cf140cf7119c7c82a7842e7074a98280fbb887a258c37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
