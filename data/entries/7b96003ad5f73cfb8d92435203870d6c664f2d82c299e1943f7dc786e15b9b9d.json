{"title":"From Stand to Forest: Woody Plant Recruitment in an Andean Restoration Project","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1020/v1","date":1720766436000,"content":"The growing deforestation of tropical forests requires the implementation of restoration actions capable of assisting the recovery of biodiversity and functioning of these ecosystems. This research aimed to identify the environmental factors that influence woody plant recruitment abundance and diversity in an Andean forest restoration project in Medellin (Colombia). Data from all individuals taller than 80 cm was collected in 22 plots of 200 m2. The environmental factors selected were edaphic variables, plantation structure, slope, elevation, prior land use and landscape forest cover. A generalized linear model was adjusted for recruitment density, and linear mixed models were built for recruited species richness, diversity and dominance. Woody plant recruitment attributes in our study area were similar to a typical secondary succession in an Andean forest, but planted trees contributed little to these attributes. While recruitment density was affected by slope, canopy closure and landscape forest cover, recruitment diversity was influenced by physical (bulk density) and chemical (pH, aluminum, CEC) edaphic factors, planted trees diversity (species richness and composition), canopy closure and mortality rate of planted trees. We conclude that a good development of planted trees enhances both recruitment attributes, indicating a synergy between active restoration and passive regeneration processes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b96003ad5f73cfb8d92435203870d6c664f2d82c299e1943f7dc786e15b9b9d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
