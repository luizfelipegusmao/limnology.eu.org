{"title":"News media coverage of LGBT identities over 10 years in a 400-million-word corpus","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300385","date":1712757600000,"content":"<p>by Reuben Ng, Ting Yu Joanne Chow, Wenshu Yang</p>\r\nBackground <p>This study is the first to analyze LGBT portrayals in a news media dataset over a decade (2010–2020). We selected Singapore as a country of interest, emblematic of a nation grappling with state-encouraged heteronormativity and a remnant colonial law against homosexuality (377A), fraught with calls for its repeal that was only enacted in 2022. Our study is interested in this period bookended by challenge and change, particularly in newspaper portrayals of LGBT narratives. Newspapers are an important source of current information and have the power to shape societal perceptions. We lay the groundwork and provide a framework to analyze news media narratives of other Commonwealth nations with colonial pasts and inherited laws criminalizing LGBT communities.</p> Objectives <p>This study analyzes LGBT portrayals in a 400-million-word news media dataset over a decade (2010–2020). First, we aimed to track the volume of LGBT media coverage over time and elucidate differences in coverage of different identity markers. Second, we aimed to track sentiments on LGBT portrayals. Third, we aimed to track salient narratives circulated about LGBT stories.</p> Methods <p>The study leveraged a 400-million-word corpus from news media in Singapore, identifying the following target keywords: <i>LGBT</i>, <i>Lesbian</i>, <i>Gay</i>, <i>Bisexual</i>, <i>Transgender</i>, <i>Pink Dot</i> (a local Pride event), <i>377A</i>. First, coverage volume was tracked using annual changes in keyword mentions per million, elucidating differences in coverage of different sub-groups. Second, sentiment analysis on a valence scale was conducted on LGBT collocates. Third, we distilled salient narratives about LGBT identities using thematic labelling of top-frequency collocates.</p> Results <p>First, overall coverage of LGBT steadily increased over the decade, though Gay identities evidenced asymmetrical coverage—outstripping ‘Bisexual’ keywords by seven times, ‘Lesbian’ by four, ‘Transgender’ by two. Second, sentiment scores for <i>Pink Dot (a local pride event)</i> were most positive; <i>Lesbian</i>, <i>Gay</i>, <i>LGBT</i>, <i>Transgender</i> were neutral; <i>Bisexual</i> and <i>377A</i> dipped slightly negative. Third, topics differed across the four identities: uniquely, ‘Lesbian’ collocates related to sensationalized cinema; ‘Gay’ about hate crimes; ‘Bisexual’ about population surveys; ‘Transgender’ about challenges (transitioning, alienation, suicide).</p> Conclusions <p>Practically, we presented a decade-long barometer of LGBT sentiments and themes on a national level, providing a framework to analyze media for more effective communication strategies—applicable to Commonwealth countries with similar inherited colonial laws. Salient repetition through media association may unwittingly frame certain issues negatively; caution is prudent in representing each sub-group adequately, rather than portraying the LGBT identity as monolithic.</p>","author":"Reuben Ng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"67e1799a81088f3103331c2f10b697eadbb13ec6ee75811ea7ba356cdc640d3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
