In an age where information travels at the speed of light, ethical publishing is essential to maintain the credibility and quality of content. Academics, students and practitioners face challenges such as protecting copyright and ensuring transparency. Drawing on theoretical research and, in particular, qualitative analysis of theoretical sources, the research aim of this paper is to reflect on what practical recommendations and key principles can help deliver valuable content and avoid ethical pitfalls. Educating the academic community about the meaning and protection of copyright, licensing, transparency and moral responsibility of authors and peer-reviewed scientific publications seems crucial. The ethical aspects of publishing educational texts and publications are pillars for ensuring quality and credibility. Copyright protection and fair licensing form the basis that promotes transparency and fairness. The need for academics and students to be encouraged to reflect on ethical challenges and contribute to sustainable publishing seems essential. The findings of this theoretical research can serve as feedback for publishers of scholarly and educational texts and as insights for setting publishing standards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"74d4c83f6613f60a4d53d9ad3d8705dde9e0f386dc50d39b1c1eee842eafbe15","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
