{"title":"Confirming the Possible Occurrence of Cold Nuclear Fusion with Improved Strong and Electroweak Nuclear Binding Energy Formula","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1662/v1","date":1721634539000,"content":"Abstract: In our recent publications pertaining to 4G model of final unification and based on strong and electroweak interactions, we have developed a completely new formula for estimating nuclear binding energy. With reference to currently believed Semi Empirical Mass Formula (SEMF), we call our formula as ‘Strong and Electroweak Mass Formula’ (SEWMF). Our formula constitutes 4 simple terms and only one energy coefficient of magnitude 10.1 MeV. First term is a volume term, second term seems to be a representation of free nucleons associated with electroweak interaction, third term is a radial term and fourth one is an asymmetry term about the mean stable mass number. Considering this kind of approach, nuclear structure can be understood in terms of strong and weak interactions and cold nuclear fusion like complicated concepts can be understood in a theoretical approach positively. In this paper, by considering the accountability of  we are making an attempt to improve the applicability and effectiveness of SEWMF.  Number 0.00125 being a workable electroweak coefficient for Z=6 to 132 and A=2Z to 3.5Z, number of free nucleons assumed to be associated with electroweak interaction can be expressed as  Improved asymmetry term can be expressed as,   where   represents the light house like stable mass number. With reference to old version, our improved binding energy formula can be expressed as,   We are working on its possible modification for mass numbers less than the stable mass numbers. Following this approach, it is possible to show that nuclear binding energy scheme is associated with strong and weak interactions and is practically independent of Coulombic repulsions. Proceeding further, currently believed cold nuclear fusion assumed be associated with hydrated metals can be understood and can be confirmed with strong and weak interactions independent of coulombic repulsions. We are very confident to say that our approach will certainly motivate modern science community in this new direction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"21a58630c06ed97c1d1aaaddb53993a4ece71e645bc3a688fd1d169d0a1e677c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
