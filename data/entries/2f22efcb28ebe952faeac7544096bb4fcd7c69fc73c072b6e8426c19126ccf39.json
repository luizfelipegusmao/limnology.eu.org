{"title":"Flagellin Inhibits HIV Infection of Macrophages through Modulation of Viral Entry Receptors and CC Chemokines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1446/v1","date":1716375479000,"content":"Both bacteria product flagellin and macrophages are implicated in HIV infection/disease progression. However, the impact of their interaction on HIV infection and the associated mechanisms remain to be determined. We thus examined the effect of the flagellins on HIV infection of primary human macrophages. We observed that the pretreatment of macrophages with the flagellins from the different bacteria significantly inhibited HIV infection. The mechanistic investigation showed that the flagellin treatment of macrophages downregulated the major HIV entry receptors (CD4 and CCR5) and upregulated the CC chemokines (MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES), the ligands of CCR5. These effects of the flagellin could be compromised by a toll like receptor 5 (TLR5) antagonist. Given the important role of flagellin as a vaccine adjuvant in TLR5 activation-mediated immune regulation and in HIV infection of macrophages, future investigations are necessary to determine the in vivo impact of flagellin-TLR5 interaction on macrophage-mediated innate immunity against HIV infection and the effectiveness of flagellin adjuvant-based vaccines studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f22efcb28ebe952faeac7544096bb4fcd7c69fc73c072b6e8426c19126ccf39","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
