{"title":"BRAC1 &amp; BRCA2 Methylation as a Prognostic and Predictive Biomarker in Cancer: Implementation in Liquid Biopsy in the Era of Precision Medicine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1744/v1","date":1721712606000,"content":"BReast CAncer gene 1 (BRCA1) and BReast CAncer gene 2 (BRCA2) encode for tumor suppressor proteins which are critical regulators of the homologous recombination (HR) pathway, the most precise and important DNA damage response mechanism. Dysfunctional HR proteins cannot repair double-stranded DNA breaks in mammalian cells, a situation called HR deficiency. Since their identification, pathogenic variants and other alterations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been associated with an increased risk of developing mainly breast and ovarian cancer. Interestingly, HR deficiency is also detected in tumors not carrying BRCA1/2 mutations, a condition termed “BRCAness”. One of the main mechanisms causing the BRCAness phenotype is the methylation of the BRCA1/2 promoters and this epigenetic modification is associated with carcinogenesis and poor prognosis mainly among patients with breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 promoter methylation has been suggested as an emerging biomarker of great predictive significance, especially concerning Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase inhibitors (PARP inhibitor-PARPi) responsiveness, along with or beyond BRCA1/2 mutations. However, as its clinical exploitation is still insufficient, the impact of BRCA1/2 promoter methylation status needs to be further evaluated. The current review aims to gather the latest findings about the mechanisms that underline BRCA1/2 function as well as the molecular characteristics of tumors associated with BRCA1/2 defects, by focusing on DNA methylation. Furthermore, we critically analyze their translational meaning and the validity of BRCA methylation biomarkers in predicting treatment response and we suggest a diagnostic pipeline that could be implemented in liquid biopsy to aid precision pharmacotherapy in BRCA-associated tumors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e58f3081644bbf6c0029d9987dec3b6dd564e6a3781c7bdff273e6372dc8f905","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
