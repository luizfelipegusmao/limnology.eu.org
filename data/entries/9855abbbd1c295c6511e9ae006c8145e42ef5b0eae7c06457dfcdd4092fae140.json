{"title":"Synthesis of Carbon Dots Extracted from Black Mulberry Fruits for Photocatalytic Degradation.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0854/v1","date":1720609241000,"content":"The utilization of black mulberry fruit as a precursor for C-dot synthesis represents a novel ap-proach to biosynthesizing C-dots. Through the implementation of a hydrothermal autoclave, we successfully produced C-dots using the fruit extract. This environmentally conscious and sustain-able method of synthesis presents a promising avenue for C-dot production. Our findings demon-strate the remarkable photocatalytic activity of the C-dots, as evidenced by their effective degra-dation of pollutants under visible light irradiation. This discovery holds significant implications for addressing water contamination issues and promoting environmental remediation efforts. Fur-thermore, we conducted a thorough investigation to determine the optimal doping concentration of C-dots, ultimately identifying 0.2 M as the ideal concentration. At this specific concentration, the photo catalytic degradation of pollutants reached an impressive rate of 95.8%. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the increased electron trapping resulting from the presence of additional surface sites and the absorption of different wavelengths of light. In sum-mary, this research contributes to the sustainable synthesis of carbon dots using black mulberry fruits as a precursor, while also providing a comprehensive analysis of their optical and photo-catalytic properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9855abbbd1c295c6511e9ae006c8145e42ef5b0eae7c06457dfcdd4092fae140","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
