{"title":"Cost-effective analysis of hepatitis A vaccination in Kerala state, India","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306293","date":1719496800000,"content":"<p>by Yogesh Krishnarao Gurav, Bhavani Shankara Bagepally, Natthakan Chitpim, Abhasnee Sobhonslidsuk, Mohan Digambar Gupte, Usa Chaikledkaew, Ammarin Thakkinstian, Montarat Thavorncharoensap</p>\r\n\r\nSeveral hepatitis A outbreaks have recently been reported in Kerala state, India. To inform coverage decision of hepatitis A vaccine in Kerala, this study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of 1) hepatitis A vaccination among children aged 1 year and individuals aged 15 years, and 2) serological screening of individuals aged 15 years and vaccination of susceptible as compared to no vaccination or vaccination without serological screening. Both live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine and inactivated hepatitis A vaccine were considered in the analysis. A combination of decision tree and Markov models with a cycle length of one year was employed to estimate costs and benefits of different vaccination strategies. Analysis were based on both societal and payer perspectives. The lifetime costs and outcomes were discounted by 3%. Our findings indicated that all strategies were cost-saving for both societal and payer perspectives. Moreover, budget impact analysis revealed that vaccination without screening among individuals aged 15 years could save the governmentâ€™s budget by reducing treatment cost of hepatitis A. Our cost-effectiveness evidence supports the inclusion of hepatitis A vaccination into the vaccination program for children aged 1 year and individuals aged 15 years in Kerala state, India.","author":"Yogesh Krishnarao Gurav","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"aef4f122a7e99c7831d05632abe48b8666e48bb4957b480cce29f6e3a992c9fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
