{"title":"Exploring Bioinformatics Opportunities for Identification and Study of Medicinal Plants: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0752/v1","date":1715580429000,"content":"Medicinal plants have been a cornerstone of traditional medicine systems for centuries, offering a vast array of bioactive compounds with therapeutic potential. However, the identification, characterization, and elucidation of the pharmacological properties of these plants have often been challenging due to their complex chemical composition and diverse biological activities. Bioinformatics, with its interdisciplinary approach combining biology, computer science, and information technology, presents a powerful toolkit for the systematic study of medicinal plants. This review provides an overview of bioinformatics methodologies and resources that can facilitate the identification, phytochemical analysis, pharmacological investigation, and conservation of medicinal plants. It highlights the integration of omics technologies, computational algorithms, database resources, and molecular modeling techniques in advancing our understanding of medicinal plants' therapeutic potential and their applications in drug discovery and development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f704f939a5201751e5906bdb702b74474c6d6f1209188b0c7d6486eefe2d7401","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
