Lamango</p>\r\n\r\n<i>KRAS</i> mutations are the most common oncogenic mutations in lung adenocarcinoma in Black Americans. Polyisoprenylated Cysteinyl amide Inhibitors (PCAIs) constitute a group of potential cancer therapy agents that we designed to specifically disrupt and suppress hyperactive G-protein signaling, such as that caused by mutated RAS proteins. Here we determine the effects of PCAIs on the viability, G-protein levels, downstream mediators, and apoptosis-related proteins on the <i>KRAS</i>-mutated, Black American-derived lung adenocarcinoma cell line, NCI-H23. Of the 17 PCAIs tested, compounds NSL-YHJ-2-27 and NSL-YHJ-2-46 showed the most potency with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.7 and 3.3 μM, respectively. Western blotting was used to determine the effect of the PCAIs on the phosphorylation levels of MAPK pathway enzymes. After 48 h exposure to 5 μM of the PCAIs, NSL-YHJ-2-46, the MAPK proteins BRAF, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and p90RSK were activated through phosphorylation by 90, 190, 150 and 120%, respectively. However, CRAF/RAF1 phosphorylation decreased by 40%, suggesting significant changes in the KRAS/MAPK signaling patterns. Furthermore, 5 μM of NSL-YHJ-2-27 depleted the singly polyisoprenylated monomeric G-proteins RAC 1/2/3 and CDC42 by 77 and 76%, respectively. The depletion of these key cytoskeletal proteins may account for the observed inhibition of cell migration and invasion, and spheroid invasion observed on exposure to NSL-YHJ-2-27 and NSL-YHJ-2-46. Treatment with 5 μM of NSL-YHJ-2-27 suppressed full-length inactive caspase 3 and 7 levels by 72 and 91%, respectively. An analysis of cells treated with the fluorescently labeled active caspase 3/7 irreversible inhibitor, CaspaTag<sup>TM</sup> Caspase-3/7 <i>in situ</i> reagent revealed a 124% increase in active caspase at 3 μM over controls. These findings clearly show the direct effects of the PCAIs on the RAS signaling pathway. Given the profound increases observed in RPS6KA1/p90RSK phosphorylation, future work will involve a determination whether the proapoptotic isoforms of RPS6KA1/p90RSK are phosphorylated due to the PCAIs treatments. These results support the potential use of the PCAIs as targeted therapies against cancers with <i>KRAS</i> mutations.","author":"Matthew D.
