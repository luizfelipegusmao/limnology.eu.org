{"title":"Effects of Various Lipid Sources and L‐Carnitine Supplementation on the Growth Performance, Body Composition, and Antioxidants Enzyme Ability of Dog Conch Larvae, Laevistrombus canarium","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/5336474?af=R","date":1675756800000,"content":"<p>A feeding experiment was conducted to study the effects of dietary lipid sources and L-carnitine on the growth performance, body component, muscle fatty acid composition, and antioxidant enzyme ability of average weight of 0.28 g dog conch larvae, <i>Laevistrombus canarium</i>. Three sources of lipid: fish oil, soybean oil, and beef tallow were tested in combination with two levels (0 and 0.5%) of L-carnitine. The dog conch larvae fed diets containing fish oil with L-carnitine supplementation exhibited the highest weight gain. After air exposure challenge, the liver tissue of dog conch fed the diets containing soybean oil and beef tallow without supplemented L-carnitine had lower levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD, U min<sup>−1</sup>), phenoloxidase (PO, U min<sup>−1</sup>), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx, mU/mL) activity. The activity of SOD, PO, and GPx of dog conch larvae increased with increasing levels of dietary L-carnitine. In particular, dog conch larvae fed the diet containing fish oil supplemented with L-carnitine exhibited significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) enhanced antioxidant responses. The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the muscle tissue of dog conch larvae fed the diet containing fish oil without L-carnitine supplementation showed significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) higher activity. It was concluded that dietary administration of L-carnitine can enhance resistance against beta-oxidation, and the administration of fish oil in the diet was the best strategy to promote growth due to high nutritional availability.</p>","author":"Jen-Hong Chu, \nFemi Fawole","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"783b57cb95e28078c8f905c1e81d2089a1a082ba2c899d922b324fa4dee3d172","category":"Environment"}
