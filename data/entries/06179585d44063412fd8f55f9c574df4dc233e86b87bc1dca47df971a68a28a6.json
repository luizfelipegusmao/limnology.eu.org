{"title":"Epigenetics in Psychiatry: Implications for Genomics, Evolution, Inheritance Patterns, and Biomarker Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0418/v1","date":1725593422000,"content":"Epigenetics, the study of heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the DNA sequence, is revolutionizing our understanding of psychiatric disorders. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the role of epigenetics in psychiatry, discussing its implications for genomics, evolution, inheritance patterns, and the development of biomarkers. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, are explored in the context of psychiatric conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The discussion highlights how epigenetic modifications can influence brain dynamics, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), and how artificial intelligence (AI) can accelerate the development of treatment options. The potential for epigenetic biomarkers to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment is emphasized, along with the role of behavioral interventions in inducing beneficial epigenetic modifications. Future directions in epigenetic research, including the development of epigenetic therapies and the elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetic inheritance, are also discussed. This article underscores the transformative potential of epigenetics in advancing our understanding of mental health and disease, paving the way for novel therapeutic interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"06179585d44063412fd8f55f9c574df4dc233e86b87bc1dca47df971a68a28a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
