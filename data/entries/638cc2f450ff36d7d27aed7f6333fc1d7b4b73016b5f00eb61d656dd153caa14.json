{"title":"Gastrointestinal Myoelectrical Activity (GIMA) Biomarker for Noninvasive Diagnosis of Endometriosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0527/v1","date":1712563362000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Endometriosis represents substantial direct and indirect healthcare costs impacted by absent accurate, non-invasive uniformly diagnostic tools. We endeavored to demonstrate gastrointestinal myoelectrical activity (GIMA) biomarkers unique to endometriosis allow noninvasive, uniformly accurate diagnosis or exclusion of endometriosis. Methods: Prospective open-label comparative study of 154 patients, age &amp;gt;18, with or without diagnosed endometriosis. Population included 62 non-endometriosis controls (Cohort 1), 43 subjects with surgically histologically-confirmed endometriosis (Cohort 2), and 49 subjects with abdominal pain and negative imaging (Cohort 3). Electroviscerography (EVG) recorded GIMA biomarkers from three abdominal electrodes before and 30-minutes post water-load protocol. Cohort 2 had postoperative EVG and Cohort 3 had preoperative EVG. Calculated specificity, sensitivity, NPV, PPV and predictive probability or C-Statistic used univariate, multivariate, linear and logistical regression analyses of the area under the curve (AUC) at all frequency and time points, including age and pain covariants. Results: Non-endometriosis cohort differed significantly from endometriosis cohorts (p&amp;lt;0.001) for median (IQR), and AUC percent frequency distribution of power at baseline, 10-minute, 20-minute, and 30-minute post water-load at all frequency ranges 15-20cpm, 30-40cpm and 40-50cpm. Endometriosis cohorts were statistically similar (p&amp;gt;0.05). GIMA biomarker threshold scoring demonstrated 95%/91% sensitivity and PPV, 96%/95% specificity and NPV and C-statistic of &amp;gt;99%/98% respectively for age subsets. GIMA biomarkers in Cohort 3 predicted 47/49 subjects positive and 2/49 negative for endometriosis, confirmed surgically. Hormonal therapy, surgical stage, nor pain score affected diagnostic accuracy. Conclusions: Non-invasive electroviscerography with GIMA biomarker detection distinguished participants with and without endometriosis based upon endometriosis specific GIMA biomarkers threshold scoring.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"638cc2f450ff36d7d27aed7f6333fc1d7b4b73016b5f00eb61d656dd153caa14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
