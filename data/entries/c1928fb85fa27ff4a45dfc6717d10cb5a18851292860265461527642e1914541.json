We evaluated the effectiveness of triclopyr herbicide applied at different seasons and found that it caused &gt;98% mortality no matter when applied. Nontarget effects were also limited and did not differ among application seasons.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\n\nManagers tasked with controlling invasive species require effective methods that are quick and easy to use without inflicting extensive nontarget damage, while also being compatible with other scheduled management responsibilities. <i>Lonicera maackii</i> (Amur honeysuckle) is a non-native shrub that has invaded eastern and midwestern North American deciduous forests, altering ecosystem function and reducing biodiversity.\n\nThis study explores prescribed fire and seasonal basal applications of triclopyr ester as control methods and examines the extent of nontarget damage. We used paired-split plots to implement basal bark treatments in different seasons within burned and unburned units, and we tracked individual <i>L. maackii</i> to determine mortality and hyperlocal impacts of management.\n\nBasal bark treatments killed 98.4% of <i>L. maackii</i> across seasonal timings. Nontarget plant cover declined similarly for all herbicide application seasons, but there were some signs of recovery within 4â€‰years, and the early- and late spring treatments were less affected overall. Species richness showed biologically small but statistically different declines across treatment times. Prescribed fire did not impact <i>L. maackii</i> mortality or interact with herbicide efficacy.\n\nBasal bark applications of triclopyr are an effective means of <i>L. maackii</i> control regardless of application timing, which allows managers to implement it at their convenience to avoid interfering with other management tasks that have time constraints.\n</p>","author":"Katharine F.
