{"title":"The Nigerian Dietary Screening Tool: A Step Toward Improved Patient-Clinician Communication in Nigerian Hospitals: A Pilot Implementation Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1057/v1","date":1720779267000,"content":"Implementing dietary screening tools into clinical practice has been challenging, including in Nigeria. This study evaluated the impact of the Nigerian dietary screening tool (NiDST) on patient-clinician communication and barriers to and facilitators of implementation. Mixed methods approach was used to collect data from patients (n=151) and clinicians (n=20) from outpatient clinics in Nigeria. Patients completed the validated 25-item NiDST prior to outpatient consultations. Both patients and clinicians completed the Measurement Instrument for Determinants of Innovations (MIDI) questionnaire to assess implementation determinants post-consultation. Semi-structured interviews were conducted for in-depth feedback. Fidelity of implementation was 92% for NiDST-reported dietary discussion, with a mean completion time of &lt; 6 minutes and an accepted marginal increase in consultation time (&lt; 10 mins). For clinicians, 25% reported time constraints and their additional nutritional knowledge as barriers, while facilitators of NiDST implementation were the clarity and completeness of the NiDST, clinical relevance and improved patient-clinician communication, as reported by all the clinicians. Over 96% of patients reported the NiDST as quick to complete, with 90.7% reporting self-reflection on dietary intake. This study demonstrated the NiDST's potential to enhance patient-clinician communication and highlighted major facilitators of implementation in clinical practice to improve dietary discussion in Nigeria.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a084f1fc01c6bbd202c42e5b24fdd4aee2ba2f33d03ed9a9ded191cb2a1619aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
