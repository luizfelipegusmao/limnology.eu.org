{"title":"Phylogenomic perspectives on speciation and reproductive isolation in a North American biodiversity hotspot: an example using California sages (Salvia subgenus Audibertia: Lamiaceae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/134/2/295/7668802?rss=1","date":1715385600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>The California Floristic Province (CA-FP) is the most species-rich region of North America north of Mexico. One of several proposed hypotheses explaining the exceptional diversity of the region is that the CA-FP harbours myriad recently diverged lineages with nascent reproductive barriers. <span>Salvia</span> subgenus <span>Audibertia</span> is a conspicuous element of the CA-FP, with multiple sympatric and compatible species.<div>Methods</div>Using 305 nuclear loci and both organellar genomes, we reconstruct species trees, examine genomic discordance, conduct divergence-time estimation, and analyse contemporaneous patterns of gene flow and mechanical reproductive isolation.<div>Key Results</div>Despite strong genomic discordance, an underlying bifurcating tree is supported. Organellar genomes capture additional introgression events not detected in the nuclear genome. Most interfertility is found within clades, indicating that reproductive barriers arise with increasing genetic divergence. Species are generally not mechanically isolated, suggesting that it is unlikely to be the primary factor leading to reproductive isolation.<div>Conclusions</div>Rapid, recent speciation with some interspecific gene flow in conjunction with the onset of a Mediterranean-like climate is the underlying cause of extant diversity in <span>Salvia</span> subgenus <span>Audibertia</span>. Speciation has largely not been facilitated by gene flow. Its signal in the nuclear genome seems to mostly be erased by backcrossing, but organellar genomes each capture different instances of historical gene flow, probably characteristic of many CA-FP lineages. Mechanical reproductive isolation appears to be only part of a mosaic of factors limiting gene flow.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"2030b743070ba535cd2c09622d8ef4ef3c1568882e126b4428a08ce6b5beca7b","category":"Environment"}
