Our cameras use single electron detection based on hybrid-pixel technology, where the best readout chip is matched with the most suitable sensor material to provide the optimized sensitivity (DQE). Dedicated in-pixel electronics allow for single-electron counting, up to 10 million electrons/pixel/second, even at very high count rates. The sensor material can be adapted to the energy range of any electron microscopy application, SEM and TEM included.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"1a0329ef64e12d583f3e9c2a7dacc20adda976a215e73e3c87a94cc4200ac41c","category":"Environment"}
