We analyze available data resources today and discuss relevant points includingcharacter encoding, advanced tokenization methods and morphological complexity. This allows us tocontrast Nepalâ€™s unique language and technology ecosystem with Hindi and Thai in terms of NLPadvancements. Quantitative assessment of existing tools and resources is offered by this investigationwhich highlights immediate weaknesses as well as areas that need more effort. Various ethicalconcerns are addressed here while potential topics for future research as e-governance, healthcare oreducation with a focus on new domain-specific applications, and cross-lingual transfer learning aresuggested. The objective of this attempt is to enhance understanding of natural language processing(NLP) in Nepali language and beyond aimed at developing NLP technologies that are more efficient,inclusive, culturally appropriate across diverse linguistic communities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10fda721d9bed3a4c291e8e3db5a1d4e8a6777797a079f45069fb543cca1cd1d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
