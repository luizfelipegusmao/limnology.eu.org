{"title":"Point of Common Connection Voltage Modulated Direct Power Control with Disturbance Observer to Increase of Renewable Energy Acceptance in Power System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0578/v1","date":1725861622000,"content":"As the penetration of renewable energies increases, their acceptance of the power grid system is becoming an important issue. In the case of South Korea, a 22.9kV transformer is frequently utilized to reduce the power loss of the generated renewable energy transmission, so the power quality at the point of common connection (PCC) is inevitably influenced by the nonlinearity of the transformer and the uncertainty of the inductance and resistance of the transmission line. In this paper, we present a point of common connection voltage-modulated direct power control (PCCVM-DPC) system that enhances power quality at the PCC. First, we present the mathematical dynamics of active and reactive power at the PCC side, which contains the step-up transformerâ€™s nonlinearity, the grid voltage harmonics, and the parameter uncertainties. By analyzing the disturbance terms of the PCCVM-DPC system, we present the disturbance observer (DOB) for the PCCVM-DPC system. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we perform comparative studies of the PCCVM-DPC without DOB and PCCVM-DPC with DOB by constructing the simulation environment based on the commercial step-up transformer and ESS inverter datasheet. We have validated that the active and reactive power control performance of the PCCVM-DPC with DOB outperforms the PCCVM-DPC without DOB from the observation that the current total harmonic distortion reduced by more than 40% compared to the PCCVM-DPC without the DOB.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e82b1c4da86e99258411c96f2ad449eeb91bc40646908a449ddd1d355e3d30d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
