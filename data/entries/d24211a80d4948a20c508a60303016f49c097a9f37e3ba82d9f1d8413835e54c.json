This randomized control trial examined the effectiveness of an education program centered in an adult workforce agency that was specifically designed to meet the needs of student parents and their families. Family-centered supportive services included coordinated parent–child schedules and childcare in addition to peer cohorts led by coaches, tuition-free courses, and additional financial assistance. Two hundred seventy-seven parents responded to online survey questions about their education and career, wellbeing, and parenting at baseline and approximately 1 year later (treatment <i>n</i> = 191, control <i>n</i> = 86). The racially and ethnically diverse pool of parents consisted mostly of low-income mothers aged 29 years on average who had a high school diploma or completed a General Educational Development (GED) program. After 1 year, parents in the education program were more likely to obtain at least a certificate or associate degree compared to control parents. These findings suggest that a family-focused approach is key to improving the educational success of student parents.</p>","author":"Lauren A. Tighe, \nTeresa Eckrich Sommer, \nTerri J. Sabol, \nP.
