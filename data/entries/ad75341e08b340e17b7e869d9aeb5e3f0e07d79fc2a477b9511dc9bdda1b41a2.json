{"title":"Physical and chemical characterization of Ugandan honey and its comparison to Manuka honey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0965/v1","date":1718354783000,"content":"Honey is a very cost-efficient food source and a valuable export for the country of Uganda, but is commonly adulterated, resulting in consumers not being aware of the contents of their honey. As a result, it is important to be able to authenticate the honey that consumers are purchasing. This study evaluated the physicochemical properties (pH, free acidity, metal determination, moisture content, and FTIR spectra) of Ugandan and Manuka honey. Honey pH values ranged from 3.3 to 4.8 (±0.6) while free acidity values ranged from 34.87 to 62.22 (±8.69). The moisture content values of all honey samples were below 22%. The metal concentrations and functional groups present in Ugandan and Manuka honey were determined. Metal analysis by atomic absorption spectrometry detected five elements (Na, Ca, K, Cu, and Pb) in all honey samples in varying concentrations. The elemental concentrations were found in descending order as follows: sodium (Na) (9.38 ppm), calcium (Ca) (4.99 ppm), potassium (K) (2.48 ppm), copper (Cu) (1.87 ppm), lead (Pb) (0.28 ppm). FTIR analysis revealed similar patterns of spectral curve (O-H stretching and C-H stretching) across all honey samples analyzed, which is consistent with previously analyzed honey samples from other studies. Ugandan honey sample 7 collected in the Masaka Region was found to be most similar to the Manuka honey standard based on its observed physiochemical properties. All properties analyzed suggested Ugandan honey is of good quality and safe for consumption.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad75341e08b340e17b7e869d9aeb5e3f0e07d79fc2a477b9511dc9bdda1b41a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
