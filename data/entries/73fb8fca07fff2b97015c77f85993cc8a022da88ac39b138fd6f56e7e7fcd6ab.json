{"title":"The Relationship between Understanding Diversity and Brain Health, Focusing on the Triple Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1989/v1","date":1727257858000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Interest in diversity is growing worldwide. Today, understanding and social acceptance of diverse people is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between gray matter volume (GMV), which is thought to reflect brain health, and understanding of diversity (gender, LGBTQ, and race). Methods: GMV was the value of the Gray Matter Brain Healthcare Quotient (GM-BHQ) based on MRI image analysis. Meanwhile, diversity was calculated from the answers to the psychological questions included in the World Values Survey Wave 7 (WVS7). Results: As a result of the analysis, in the group of participants with the highest understanding of diversity (PHUD. n = 11), not only the GMV at the whole brain level but also the GMV of the central executive network (CEN) and saliency network (SN) were shown to be significantly higher than the theoretical value estimated from sex, age, and BMI at the 5% level. In addition, the GMV of the default mode network (DMN) was also shown to be higher than the theoretical value at the 10% level. Meanwhile, in the group of others (n = 10), there was no significant difference from the theoretical value. These differences between PHUD and others were also observed when comparing the two. Conclusions: These results suggest that understanding diversity requires a healthy brain, centered on three networks that govern rational judgment, emotion regulation, other-awareness, self-awareness, and the valuing of actions. This is the first study to show that brain structure is related to understanding and acceptance of diverse people.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73fb8fca07fff2b97015c77f85993cc8a022da88ac39b138fd6f56e7e7fcd6ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
