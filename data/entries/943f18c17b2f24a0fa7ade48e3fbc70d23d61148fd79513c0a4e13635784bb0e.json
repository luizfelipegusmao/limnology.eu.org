{"title":"Distinct types of selection and genetic architecture shape molecular variation during the domestication of vegetable crops","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2533/7660488?rss=1","date":1714435200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Humans select vegetable crops with desirable traits via a complex evolutionary process called domestication, generating a variety of cultivars worldwide. With advances in sequencing technologies, genomic scans for “signatures of selection” are widely used to identify target loci of selection. In the early phases of domestication, humans tended to favor similar sets of phenotypes in diverse crops, resulting in “domestication syndrome” and parallel evolution in multiple species. Subsequently, adaptation to distinct environments or different consumer preferences has diversified crop cultivars. Here, we review molecular and population genetic studies on genes affecting trait evolution during this complex process. We emphasize that, depending on interactions among different types of selection (directional selection within or divergent selection between groups), the genetic architecture of the target trait (Mendelian or polygenic), and the origin of the causal variant (new mutation or standing variation), the resulting molecular patterns of variation can be highly diverse. Situations in which the typical hard selective sweep model could be applied may be limited. Therefore, it is crucial to obtain a thorough understanding of the target species’ historical, environmental, and ecological contexts.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"943f18c17b2f24a0fa7ade48e3fbc70d23d61148fd79513c0a4e13635784bb0e","category":"Environment"}
