{"title":"Arecoline promotes Akt‐c‐Myc‐driven aerobic glycolysis in esophageal epithelial cells","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24159?af=R","date":1713272355000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Aerobic glycolysis is a typical metabolic rearrangement for tumorigenesis. Arecoline is of explicit carcinogenicity, numerous works demonstrate its mutagenicity, genotoxicity, and cytotoxicity. However, the effects of arecoline on aerobic glycolysis of esophageal epithelial cells remain unclear. In the present study, 5 μM arecoline efficiently increased HK2 expression to induce aerobic glycolysis in Het-1A-Are and NE2-Are cells. The mechanistic analysis showed that arecoline activated the Akt-c-Myc signaling pathway and reduced the GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of c-Myc on Thr58 to prevent its ubiquitination and destruction, subsequently promoting HK2 transcription and expression. Taken together, these results suggest that arecoline can induce aerobic glycolysis of esophageal epithelial cells and further confirm that arecoline is a carcinogen harmful to human health.</p>","author":"Shuangze Han, \nYingji Chen, \nYu Huang, \nLongyu Jin, \nYuchao Ma","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"35154ee84740b8caf2ea3217c37f8e757ec831fdbe891f1bd5ab5f685c785972","category":"Environment"}
