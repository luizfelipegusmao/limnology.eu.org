{"title":"The impact of AR online shopping experience on customer purchase intention: An empirical study based on the TAM model","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309468","date":1724680800000,"content":"<p>by Chunrong Guo, Xiaodong Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nAugmented Reality (AR) offers a rich business format, convenient applications, great industrial potential, and strong commercial benefits. The integration of AR technology with online shopping has brought tremendous changes to e-commerce. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is a mature model for assessing consumer acceptance of new technologies, and applying it to evaluate the impact of AR online shopping experiences on consumer purchase intention is an urgently needed area of research. Firstly, the typical applications of AR in online shopping were reviewed, and the connotations and experiences of AR online shopping were summarized. Secondly, using the five types of AR online shopping experiences as antecedent variables, and perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness as intermediate variables, a theoretical model was constructed to explore the impact of AR online shopping experiences on customer purchase intentions, followed by an empirical study. Finally, suggestions were proposed for optimizing the online shopping experience to enhance purchase intentions. The article expands the application scenarios of the Technology Acceptance Model and enriches the theory of consumer behavior in Metaverse e-commerce.","author":"Chunrong Guo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"548b7fbd236e6d63921be92f347de03ee4d2728c86882b51c20a6cce44a8784d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
