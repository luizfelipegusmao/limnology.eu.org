{"title":"Prospective Study to Evaluate Rectus Femoris Muscle Ultrasound for Body Composition Analysis in Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1891/v1","date":1716903683000,"content":"Background: Bariatric surgery (BS) has a significant impact on body composition (BC) and con-sequently may affect established sarcopenic obesity (SO) in candidate patients. The aim of this study is to assess the utility of muscle ultrasound (MUS) of rectus femoris thickness (RFT) for the evalua-tion of BC and skeletal muscle function in patients undergoing BS compared to bioimpedance analysis (BIA), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and dynamometry. On the other hand, we aim to demonstrate how MUS of RFT correlates better with the quality of life (Qol) in this population, likely because it enables the detection of regional quadriceps muscle sarcopenia, in comparison to the other mentioned methods. Methods: This is a prospective pilot study including 77 subjects (64.9% female, mean age: 53.2 ± 8.67 years) who underwent BS. Handgrip strength was measured using a dynamometer, fat-free mass index (iFFM) was assessed by BIA, appendicular muscle index (AMI) was calculated using DEXA and RFT was measured by MUS. Moreover, Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resintance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. All these measurements were conducted 1 month prior to BS and at the 12-month follow-up. QoL was as-sessed using the Moorehead-Ardelt questionnaire. Results: The mean BMI decreased by 12.95 ± 3.56 kg/m2 (p=0.001). Firstly, we observed positive correlation pre-surgery between HOMA and: RFT (r=0.27, p=0.02), iFFM (r=0.36, p=0.001), AMI (r=0.31, p=0.01) and dynamometer (r=0.26, p=0.02). In addition, we found correlation between RFT and iFFM (pre-surgical: r=0.31, p=0.01; post-surgical: r=0.25, p=0.05) and between RFT and lower extremities AMI post-surgical (r=0.27, p=0.04). Secondly, we observed significant reductions in iFFM, AMI and RFT (p=0.001), but not with dynamometer (p=0.94). Finally, a tendency to a positive correlation between QoL question-naire and RFT post-surgery (r=0.23, p=0.079) was observed. Conclusions: Our results suggest that RFT measured by MUS for the evaluation of SO and the follow-up after BS of these patients. Moreover, RFT can provide relevant information about regional sarcopenia and probably has an accurate correlation with QoL in comparison with the other methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d3805a193100b97a854009bfe8f57b622bde8e89bb7c0b9fea8f71c2e8edbb0b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
