{"title":"Mechanical Properties of Spunlace Non-Wovens with a Porous Structure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1418/v1","date":1729241789000,"content":"The paper describes the influence of the drum system construction of two modern carding machines on the porous structure of spunlace non-wovens composed of polyester and viscose. The non-woven fabric structure, including the number and size of the pores, determines the tensile strength of the composites obtained. The spunlace non-wovens were subjected to tensile strength tests in the machine, and cross directions and microscopic observations of their structure were made. The results of the experiments were used to determine the relationship between the strength of the material and the porosity of its structure. This knowledge was used to prepare recommendations for the manufacturer of wet wipes in order to enable the selection of a carding machine for the mass production of final products with strength properties that meet market requirements and satisfy the end customer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32f4ce2d1e7d19349ae8a39a8ff8117c53a8f3a365f19721bc3b2fe4a9afbc4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
