{"title":"The Weight of History: Brazil's Economic Paradox from Estado Novo to Neoliberalism (1930-2000)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1095/v1","date":1728912922000,"content":"This study examines Brazil's complex economic journey from 1930 to 2000, exploring the interplay between historical legacies, policy choices, and global economic forces in shaping the nation's development trajectory. It argues that Brazil's economic history during this period is characterized by a series of paradoxes: rapid industrialization alongside persistent inequality, economic miracles followed by devastating crises, and modernization efforts constrained by colonial-era structures. The analysis begins with the Estado Novo of Get√∫lio Vargas, tracing the evolution of Brazil's economy through state-led industrialization, the \"Economic Miracle\" of the military regime, the debt crisis and hyperinflation of the 1980s, and the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s. Special attention is given to the enduring impact of slavery and colonial land distribution on Brazil's social and economic structures. The study highlights how these historical factors have contributed to ongoing challenges such as regional disparities, income inequality, and the \"Brazil Cost.\" By examining these issues, the paper provides insights into the complexities of economic development in postcolonial societies and the challenges of overcoming historical constraints in the pursuit of equitable and sustainable growth.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fdb18ab51af010860dba1b12e5cc2aed1ec153539bf3a7e468ff918db1a3a91a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
