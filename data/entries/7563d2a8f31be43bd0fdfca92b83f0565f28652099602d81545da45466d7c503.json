However, to understand and optimize properties of these materials, it is highly desirable to determine the elemental composition at the microscale quantitatively. However, commonly used elemental analysis techniques in the scanning electron microscope (SEM), like X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), are unsuitable for quantitative analysis of lithium. However recently, an alternative approach for quantitative evaluation of the Li content has been described using a composition-by-difference technique based on comparison of quantification (of non-lithium elements) by EDS and quantitative backscattered electron (qBSE) microscopy. Researchers have demonstrated an accuracy significantly better than 1 wt. % in a range of material systems including LiAlMg alloys [<a href=\"#ozae044.085-B1\">1</a>], stoichiometric compounds [<a href=\"#ozae044.085-B2\">2</a>] and cathode materials e.g., lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) [<a href=\"#ozae044.085-B3\">3</a>].In this study, we used the Cipher<sup>®</sup> system (Gatan Inc.) attached to an FE-SEM to investigate the precision of lithium measurements performed using the EDS/qBSE composition by difference method. We performed a systematic investigation to understand the influence of the SEM settings and other parameters to identify a ‘Goldilocks’ set of experimental conditions including accelerating voltage, beam current, dwell time and working distance that minimized the variance in qBSE measurements. The precision of a lithium measurement that can be achieved using the Cipher system was investigated by analyzing the contribution of crystal orientation on the BSE signal. qBSE measurements were collected from 150 LiF crystals oriented randomly and cross sectioned with their surface normal to the electron beam direction. Optimized experimental conditions were determined achieving a variance in atomic number smaller than ± 0.11 atomic numbers (± 1.4 %); equivalent to a lithium fraction of 48.8 ± 2.4 at. %, Figure 1.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7563d2a8f31be43bd0fdfca92b83f0565f28652099602d81545da45466d7c503","category":"Environment"}
