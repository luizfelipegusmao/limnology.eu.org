{"title":"Evaluation of LoRa Network Performance for Water Quality Monitoring Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1699/v1","date":1716791947000,"content":"A smart water quality monitoring system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm was designed to protect water resources from pollution in real-time. Long-range (LoRa) application of the low-power, wide-area networking (LPWAN) concept has become a phenomenon in IoT smart monitoring applications. This study proposes the implementation of a LoRa network in a water quality monitoring system-based IoT approach. The LoRa nodes were embedded with measuring sensors pH, turbidity, temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), and dissolved oxygen (DO), in the designated water station. It operates at a transmission power of 14 dB and a bandwidth of 125 kHz. The network properties were tested with two different antenna gains of 2.1 dBi and 3 dBi with three different spread factors (SF) of 7, 9, and 12. The water stations were located at Sungai Pantai and Sungai Anak Air Batu, both rivers on the Universiti Malaya campus. Following a dashboard display and K-means analysis of the water quality data received by the LoRa gateway, it was determined that both rivers are Class II B rivers. The results from the evaluation of LoRa performance on the Received Strength Signal Indicator (RSSI), Signal Noise Ratio (SNR), loss packet, and path loss at best were -83 dBm, 7 dB, &amp;lt; 0%, and 64.41 dB, respectively, with a minimum received sensitivity of -129.1 dBm. LoRa has demonstrated its efficiency in an urban environment for smart river monitoring purposes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4b29f5b9386ab9edefeacd0adccebae6aa4ecc608767d800d0ec36e1f90372b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
