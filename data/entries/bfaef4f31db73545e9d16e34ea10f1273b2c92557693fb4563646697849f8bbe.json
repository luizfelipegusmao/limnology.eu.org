{"title":"A Rare Onset of T Lymphoid Blast Crisis in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia with Two Distinct Blast Populations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1619/v1","date":1711516864000,"content":"In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a clonal proliferative disorder of granulocytic lineage, the 90%‚Äê95% of cases are characterized by t(9;22) (q34.1;q11.2) translocation, leading to the Philadelphia chromosome (1). Rarely, CML patients directly present a blast crisis, mostly of myeloid origin (2, 3). Herein, we describe one rare CML case, showing an unusual early T lymphoid blastic crisis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bfaef4f31db73545e9d16e34ea10f1273b2c92557693fb4563646697849f8bbe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
