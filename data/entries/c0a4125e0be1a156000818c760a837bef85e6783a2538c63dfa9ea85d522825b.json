{"title":"Bacterial Adhesion Pili; Inhibition of Disease by Interaction with Salivary Peptides","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.340/7720442?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Adhesion pili, also called adhesion ‘fimbriae’, are expressed on the surface of many types of bacteria including those that cause traveler’s diarrhea, urinary tract infections, and respiratory infections. The pilin subunits share a common quaternary structure of mostly ß-strands, and the final macromolecular structure coils into a helical filament. As seen in Figure 1, the ß-strands are arranged with an empty groove that accommodates a ß-strand from the subsequently added subunit. Thus, an extremely strong chain of interlocking subunits forms the pilus filament, without covalent bonds.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c0a4125e0be1a156000818c760a837bef85e6783a2538c63dfa9ea85d522825b","category":"Environment"}
