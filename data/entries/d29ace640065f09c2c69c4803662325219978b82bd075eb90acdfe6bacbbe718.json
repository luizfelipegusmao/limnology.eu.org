{"title":"Impact of the delay in cryopreservation timing during biobanking procedures on human liver tissue metabolomics","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304405","date":1718028000000,"content":"<p>by Corentine Goossens, Vincent Tambay, Valérie-Ann Raymond, Louise Rousseau, Simon Turcotte, Marc Bilodeau</p>\r\n\r\nThe liver is a highly specialized organ involved in regulating systemic metabolism. Understanding metabolic reprogramming of liver disease is key in discovering clinical biomarkers, which relies on robust tissue biobanks. However, sample collection and storage procedures pose a threat to obtaining reliable results, as metabolic alterations may occur during sample handling. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of pre-analytical delay during liver resection surgery on liver tissue metabolomics. Patients were enrolled for liver resection during which normal tissue was collected and snap-frozen at three timepoints: before transection, after transection, and after analysis in Pathology. Metabolomics analyses were performed using <sup>1</sup>H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Time at cryopreservation was the principal variable contributing to differences between liver specimen metabolomes, which superseded even interindividual variability. NMR revealed global changes in the abundance of an array of metabolites, namely a decrease in most metabolites and an increase in β-glucose and lactate. LC-MS revealed that succinate, alanine, glutamine, arginine, leucine, glycerol-3-phosphate, lactate, AMP, glutathione, and NADP were enhanced during cryopreservation delay (all p&lt;0.05), whereas aspartate, iso(citrate), ADP, and ATP, decreased (all p&lt;0.05). Cryopreservation delays occurring during liver tissue biobanking significantly alter an array of metabolites. Indeed, such alterations compromise the integrity of metabolomic data from liver specimens, underlining the importance of standardized protocols for tissue biobanking in hepatology.","author":"Corentine Goossens","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d29ace640065f09c2c69c4803662325219978b82bd075eb90acdfe6bacbbe718","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
