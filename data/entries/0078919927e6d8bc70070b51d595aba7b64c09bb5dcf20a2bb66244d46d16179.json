{"title":"PSIV-A-7 Effects of late gestational nutrient restriction of beef heifers on small intestinal crypt depth in neonatal calves","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/357/7664932?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We hypothesized that late gestational nutrient restriction would impair small intestinal development in neonatal calves, including crypt cell depth and proliferation. Fall-calving crossbred beef heifers [body weight (BW) = 466 ± 30 (SD) kg; BCS: 5.4 ± 0.5] bred to a single sire were individually-fed 100% (control; n = 10) or 70% (nutrient restricted; n = 12) of NASEM metabolizable energy and metabolizable protein requirements for maintenance, pregnancy, and growth from d 160 of gestation to calving. Calves were removed from their dams immediately post-calving and fed artificial colostrum and milk replacer relative to body weight until euthanasia at 48.7 ± 0.4 h of age. The gastrointestinal tract was removed, and proximal jejunum samples were dissected from each calf and immersion-fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Tissues were embedded in paraffin blocks and cut into 5-µm sections that were mounted on glass slides. Slides were incubated with Ki-67 (marker of nuclear proliferation) and counterstained with Hematoxylin using an autostainer. Images were taken at 5× magnification using an upright microscope. QuPath software was used to measure crypt depth, starting at the base of the crypt region and ending at the furthest cluster of Ki-67 positive cells, perpendicular to the base of the mucosa. For each calf, 10 crypt depth measurements were taken from 4 images, resulting in 40 crypt depth measurements that were averaged. Nutritional plane was a fixed effect in the model, and maternal sire, date of study initiation, and calf sex (when <span>P</span> &lt; 0.25) were considered covariates. We previously reported that calves born to nutrient restricted dams weighed less (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05) at birth and 48 h than calves born to control dams. Small intestinal mass tended to be less (<span>P</span> = 0.11) in offspring of nutrient restricted dams but was not affected (<span>P</span> = 0.58) when expressed relative to body weight. Calves born to nutrient restricted dams also tended to have less (<span>P</span> = 0.11) small intestinal mass relative to brain weight. Maternal nutrient restriction did not affect (<span>P</span> = 0.95) jejunal crypt depth. Additionally, crypt depth relative to body weight was not affected (<span>P</span> = 0.20) by nutrient restriction. Although crypt depth was not affected, further analysis of proliferation and morphology will help to understand the relationship between maternal nutrient restriction and small intestine development in neonatal calves.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"0078919927e6d8bc70070b51d595aba7b64c09bb5dcf20a2bb66244d46d16179","category":"Environment"}
