{"title":"Equine Endothelial Cells Show Pro-angiogenic Behaviours in Response to FGF2 but Not VEGF-A","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202309.2006/v2","date":1710411157000,"content":"Understanding the factors which control endothelial cell (EC) function and angiogenesis is crucial for developing the horse as a disease model, but equine ECs remain poorly studied. In this study we have optimised methods for the isolation and culture of equine aortic endothelial cells (EA-oECs) and characterised their angiogenic functions in vitro. Mechanical dissociation, followed by magnetic purification using an anti-VE-cadherin antibody, resulted in EC-enriched cultures suitable for further study. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) increased EAoEC proliferation rate and stimulated scratch wound closure and tube formation by EAoECs on extracellular matrix. Pharmacological inhibitors of FGFR1 (SU5402) or MEK (PD184352) blocked FGF2-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and functional responses, suggesting that these are dependent on FGFR1/MEK-ERK signalling. In marked contrast, VEGF-A had no effect on EAoEC proliferation, migration or tubulogenesis and did not promote ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating a lack of sensitivity to this classical pro-angiogenic growth factor. Gene expression analysis showed that, unlike human ECs, FGFR1 is expressed by EAoECs at a much higher level than both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. These results suggest a predominant role for FGF2 versus VEGF-A in controlling the angiogenic functions of equine ECs. Collectively, our novel data provide a sound basis for stud-ying angiogenic processes in the horse and lay the foundations for comparative studies of EC biology in horses versus humans.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3554a5259dee79e240cf3dfd3c2e402374dc10c58d567840ca4264b593b77f88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
