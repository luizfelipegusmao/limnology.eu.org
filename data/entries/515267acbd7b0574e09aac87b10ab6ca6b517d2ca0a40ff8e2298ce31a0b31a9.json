{"title":"Impact of Walk, Transit, and Bike Scores on the &ldquo;Alternative Transportation&rdquo; Credit (LTc1) in LEED‐EB Version 4 (v4)‐Certified Projects in the United States","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0547/v1","date":1723112406000,"content":"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the built environment (i.e., walk, transit, and bike scores) on the location and transportation or “alternative transportation” credit (LTc1) in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Existing Buildings version 4 (LEED-EB-v4) Platinum (n1 = 24), Gold (n2 = 112), Silver (n3 = 46), and Certified (n4 = 34) office buildings in the USA. Spearman’s test was used to estimate the correlation between built environment scores and LTc1 scores for each certification level. The Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test was used to estimate pairwise comparison between unpaired Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Certified groups. The Platinum, Gold, and Silver certification levels showed positive and significant correlations between the built environment and LTc1 (0.44 ≤ r ≤ 0.74, p ≤ 0.0312). By contrast, Certified certification levels showed a non-significant correlation (0.18 ≤ r ≤ 0.33, p ≥ 0.0579). Pairwise comparison showed that Platinum and Gold groups outperformed Certified groups in terms of built environment and LTc1 scores (Cliff’s δ ≥ 0.37, p ≤ 0.0099). Thus, for LEED-EBv4-certified projects located in downtown areas, LTc1 can be seen as a significant lever to achieve high levels of LEED certification.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"515267acbd7b0574e09aac87b10ab6ca6b517d2ca0a40ff8e2298ce31a0b31a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
