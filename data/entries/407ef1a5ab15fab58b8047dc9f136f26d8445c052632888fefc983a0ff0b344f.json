An innovative control method for managing this weed in faba bean is induced resistance through inoculation by rhizobia strains. In this study, we explored the biochemical dynamics in <i>V</i>. <i>faba</i> L. minor inoculated by rhizobia in response to <i>O</i>. <i>foetida</i> parasitism. A systemic induced resistant reaction was evaluated through an assay of peroxidase (POX), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and phenyl alanine ammonialyase (PAL) activity and phenolic compound and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2)</sub> accumulation in faba bean plants infested with <i>O</i>. <i>foetida</i> and inoculated with rhizobia. Two rhizobia strains (Mat, Bj1) and a susceptible variety of cultivar Badi were used in a co-culture Petri dish experiment. We found that Mat inoculation significantly decreased <i>O</i>. <i>foetida</i> germination and the number of tubercles on the faba bean roots by 87% and 88%, respectively. Following Bj1 inoculation, significant decreases were only observed in <i>O</i>. <i>foetida</i> germination (62%). In addition, Mat and Bj1 inoculation induced a delay in tubercle formation (two weeks) and necrosis in the attached tubercles (12.50% and 4.16%, respectively) compared to the infested control. The resistance of <i>V</i>. <i>faba</i> to <i>O</i>. <i>foetida</i> following Mat strain inoculation was mainly associated with a relatively more efficient enzymatic antioxidative response. The antioxidant enzyme activity was enhanced following Mat inoculation of the infected faba bean plant. Indeed, increases of 45%, 67% and 86% were recorded in the POX, PPO and PAL activity, respectively. Improvements of 56% and 12% were also observed in the soluble phenolic and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents. Regarding inoculation with the Bj1 strain, significant increases were only observed in soluble phenolic and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents and PPO activity (especially at 45 days after inoculation) compared to the infested control. These results imply that inoculation with the rhizobia strains (especially Mat) induced resistance and could bio-protect <i>V</i>. <i>faba</i> against <i>O</i>. <i>foetida</i> parasitism by inducing systemic resistance, although complete protectionwas not achieved by rhizobia inoculation. The Mat strain could be used as a potential candidate for the development of an integrated method for controlling <i>O</i>. <i>foetida</i> parasitism in faba bean.","author":"Manel Bouraoui","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"407ef1a5ab15fab58b8047dc9f136f26d8445c052632888fefc983a0ff0b344f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
