{"title":"The potential of historical spy-satellite imagery to support research in ecology and conservation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/3/159/7607000?rss=1","date":1708300800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Remote sensing data are important for assessing ecological change, but their value is often restricted by their limited temporal coverage. Major historical events that affected the environment, such as those associated with colonial history, World War II, or the Green Revolution are not captured by modern remote sensing. In the present article, we highlight the potential of globally available black-and-white satellite photographs to expand ecological and conservation assessments back to the 1960s and to illuminate ecological concepts such as shifting baselines, time-lag responses, and legacy effects. This historical satellite photography can be used to monitor ecosystem extent and structure, speciesâ€™ populations and habitats, and human pressures on the environment. Even though the data were declassified decades ago, their use in ecology and conservation remains limited. But recent advances in image processing and analysis can now unlock this research resource. We encourage the use of this opportunity to address important ecological and conservation questions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"BioScience Current Issue","siteHash":"b284d132cf96f029686596d0a1781780964c795fe639c624cd504e01b404d8ff","entryHash":"6b13cdde11565fdd647a971137a15676076a1254f4739234d1c5e4ac83757544","category":"Environment"}
