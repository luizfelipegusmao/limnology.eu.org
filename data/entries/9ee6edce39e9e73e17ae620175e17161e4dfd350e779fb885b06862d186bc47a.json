To achieve the objective of this study, major game factors were explored by analyzing descriptive statistics in each year regarding the latest trend of sport class composition and playing time of each sport class and conducting the difference test between the groups. To analyze performance details of international wheelchair basketball games, this study selected official records of 209 games of 24 teams that participated in major international wheelchair basketball games. A test for difference also was conducted to examine the sport class composition, playing time, and game details of each group. First, scoring factors directly affecting the game results were compared between the groups. The result of this difference test shows that the success rate of 2-point and 3-point shots was significantly different except for the free throw success rate. The numbers of assists, defense rebounds, and steals were significantly different. Second, the medal group was compared with the other group, the average class of the other group's participation in quarters was higher than that of the medal group and the difference was significant. Regarding the difference between groups in terms of game performance, the difference in playing time between the medal group and the other group was in the order of 2.5 points, 4.0 points, 3.0 points, and 1.5 points.
