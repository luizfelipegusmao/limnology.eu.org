{"title":"Younger and rural children are more likely to be hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infections","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308221","date":1727877600000,"content":"<p>by Rebecca M.

Kennedy</p>\r\nPurpose <p>To identify characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection that are associated with hospitalization in children initially evaluated in a Pediatric Emergency Department (ED).</p> Methods <p>We identified cases of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients seen in the Arkansas Children’s Hospital (ACH) ED or hospitalized between May 27, 2020, and April 28, 2022, using ICD-10 codes within the Pediatric Hospital Information System (PHIS) Database. We compared infection waves for differences in patient characteristics and used logistic regressions to examine which features led to a higher chance of hospitalization.</p> Findings <p>We included 681 pre-Delta cases, 673 Delta cases, and 970 Omicron cases. Almost 17% of patients were admitted to the hospital. Compared to Omicron-infected children, pre-Delta and Delta-infected children were twice as likely hospitalized (OR = 2.2 and 2.0, respectively; <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001). Infants under one year were &gt;3 times as likely to be hospitalized than children ages 5–14 years regardless of wave (OR = 3.42; 95%CI = 2.36–4.94). Rural children were almost three times as likely than urban children to be hospitalized across all waves (OR = 2.73; 95%CI = 1.97–3.78). Finally, those with a complex condition had nearly a 15-fold increase in odds of admission (OR = 14.6; 95%CI = 10.6–20.0).</p> Conclusions <p>Children diagnosed during the pre-Delta or Delta waves were more likely to be hospitalized than those diagnosed during the Omicron wave. Younger and rural patients were more likely to be hospitalized regardless of the wave. We suspect lower vaccination rates and larger distances from medical care influenced higher hospitalization rates.</p>","author":"Rebecca M.
