{"title":"Modelling the effects of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for the management of factor Xa-associated bleeding","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310883","date":1727445600000,"content":"<p>by Ineke Muir, Eva Herzog, Markus Brechmann, Oliver Ghobrial, Alireza Rezvani Sharif, Maureane Hoffman</p>\r\n\r\nThe management of factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor-associated bleeding remains a clinical challenge. Massive bleeding is often associated with complex coagulopathy and, thus, the sole reversal of FXa inhibitors might not be sufficient to restore hemostasis, requiring instead a multimodal approach. Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) is widely recognized as a viable treatment option for FXa inhibitor-associated bleeding. Here, we applied computational models to explore the effect 4F-PCC has on the coagulation cascade and restoration of thrombin generation in a system that simulates a patient that has received a FXa inhibitor. The coagulation model is largely based on a previously developed model with modifications incorporated from various other published sources. The model was calibrated and validated using data from a phase 3 clinical trial of vitamin K antagonist reversal with 4F-PCC. Using the parameters and initial conditions determined during the calibration and validation process, the prothrombin time (PT) test simulations predicted a PT of 11.4 seconds. The model successfully simulated the effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban on total thrombin concentration and showed that 4F-PCC increased thrombin generation in the presence of rivaroxaban or apixaban.","author":"Ineke Muir","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"edb3f810757c799377763f1235bbdaf30a9619f1c9e2dc146b73495497ed582f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
