The task of equipment improvement is especially challenging in sports including advanced manoeuvres such as ice hockey and requires a holistic approach guiding the researcher’s attention toward the <i>right</i> variables. The purposes of this study were (a) to quantify the effects of protective equipment in ice hockey on player’s performance and (b) to identify the restrictions incurred by it. Twenty male hockey players performed four different drills with and without protective equipment while their performance was quantified. A neural network accompanied by layer-wise relevance propagation was applied to the 3D kinematic data to identify variables and time points that were most relevant for the neural network to distinguish between the equipment and no equipment condition, and therefore presumable result from restrictions incurred by the protective equipment. The study indicated that wearing the protective equipment, significantly reduced performance. Further, using the 3D kinematics, an artificial neural network could accurately distinguish between the movements performed with and without the equipment. The variables contributing the most to distinguishing between the equipment conditions were related to the upper extremities and movements in the sagittal plane. The presented methodology consisting of artificial neural networks and layer-wise relevance propagation contributed to insights without prior knowledge of how and to which extent joint angles are affected in complex maneuvers in ice hockey in the presence of protective equipment. It was shown that changes to the equipment should support the flexion movements of the knee and hip and should allow players to keep their upper extremities closer to the torso.","author":"Rebecca Lennartz","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2e95d1b59a20e24c78d3eaad875596eaa9497431be803aa44e8583c1eaa7ad03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
