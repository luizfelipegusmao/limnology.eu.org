{"title":"Sexual attraction with pollination during feeding behaviour: implications for transitions between specialized strategies","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/133/2/273/7420303?rss=1","date":1699920000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>Understanding the origin of pollination by sexual deception has proven challenging, as sexually deceptive flowers are often highly modified, making it hard to resolve how any intermediate forms between sexual deception and an ancestral strategy might have functioned. Here, we report the discovery in <span>Caladenia</span> (Orchidaceae) of sexual attraction with pollination during feeding behaviour, which may offer important clues for understanding shifts in pollination strategy.<div>Methods</div>For <span>Caladenia robinsonii</span>, we observed the behaviour of its male wasp pollinator, <span>Phymatothynnus</span> aff. <span>nitidus</span> (Thynnidae), determined the site of release of the sexual attractant, and experimentally evaluated if the position of the attractant influences rates of attempted copulation and feeding behaviour. We applied GC-MS to test for surface sugar on the labellum. To establish if this pollination strategy is widespread in <span>Caladenia</span>, we conducted similar observations and experiments for four other <span>Caladenia</span> species.<div>Key Results</div>In <span>C. robinsonii</span>, long-range sexual attraction of the pollinator is via semiochemicals emitted from the glandular sepal tips. Of the wasps landing on the flower, 57 % attempted copulation with the sepal tips, while 27 % attempted to feed from the base of the labellum, the behaviour associated with pollen transfer. A similar proportion of wasps exhibited feeding behaviour when the site of odour release was manipulated. A comparable pollination strategy occurs in another phylogenetically distinct clade of <span>Caladenia</span>.<div>Conclusions</div>We document a previously overlooked type of sexual deception for orchids involving long-distance sexual attraction, but with pollination occurring during feeding behaviour at the labellum. We show this type of sexual deception operates in other <span>Caladenia</span> species and predict that it is widespread across the genus. Our findings may offer clues about how an intermediate transitional strategy from a food-rewarding or food-deceptive ancestor operated during the evolution of sexual deception.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"dfb5f53c215519c3afe0814fa3aaf3ba678d914ae9656b8e2185e33d99860a4c","category":"Environment"}
