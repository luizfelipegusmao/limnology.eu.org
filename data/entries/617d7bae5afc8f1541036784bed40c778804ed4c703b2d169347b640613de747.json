{"title":"Variability of cnidae within a small clonal sea anemone (Isactinia sp.)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ivb.12413?af=R","date":1703326520000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The cnidom and intraspecific variability of cnidae within the small sea anemone <i>Isactinia</i> sp. were verified. The specific cnidae within the cnidom of four discrete morphological structures (tentacle, actinopharynx, mesenterial filaments, and body column) within <i>Isactinia</i> sp. was investigated. Microbasic <i>b</i>-mastigophores, microbasic <i>p</i>-mastigophores, basitrichs, microbasic <i>p</i>-amastigophores, and spirocysts were found in this species. In addition, two morphologically distinct basitrich forms, distinguishable only in a discharged state, were also found, of which basitrichs with the distinctly shorter thread were found predominately only on the body column. The distribution and abundance of cnidae types differed significantly around the body in the sea anemones, as did the length of basitrichs and spirocysts among tissue types. Cnidae length also differed significantly among individuals. Correlations between cnidae length and sea anemone size were variable, whereby cnidae size was significantly negatively correlated to sea anemone size in seven cnidae–tissue combinations, positively correlated in one, and not correlated in two. Linear regression revealed that sea anemone size was able to explain 33%–68% of variation in size of <i>b</i>-mastigophores, <i>p</i>-amastigophores, and small basitrichs from within the mesenterial filaments. Correlations were negligible or not significant in remaining cnidae–tissue combinations, however. While providing key taxonomic cnidae information, this study also highlights the variability of cnidae that may occur within a species of <i>Isactinia</i>.</p>","author":"Katrina L.
