However, a bottleneck arises in the characterization, often necessitating a comprehensive study of various electric, mechanical, chemical, and structural properties. This complexity makes the characterization process time-consuming, creating a significant gap between the rates of synthesis and exploration. Among the pioneering examples of such high-throughput synthesis are combinatorial libraries. The characterization of combinatorial libraries involves the exploration of various aspects of their structures and functionalities by a broad spectrum of local investigative methods, including SPM, electron microscopy, Raman microscopy, and more.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9af7ed8c95661867a03be448bdfc4c1c3c483fed5fbb075ffd6c2ec2d89f34cc","category":"Environment"}
