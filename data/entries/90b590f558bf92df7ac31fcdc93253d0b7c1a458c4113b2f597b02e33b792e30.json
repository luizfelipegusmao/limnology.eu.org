{"title":"A PrEP decision aid for women survivors of intimate partner violence: Task-shifting implementation to domestic violence service settings","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310837","date":1726581600000,"content":"<p>by Jaimie P.

Willie</p>\r\nBackground <p>Women exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) experience multiple social and structural barriers to accessing HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), despite being at increased risk for HIV. In addition, few existing HIV prevention interventions address IPV. A recently developed PrEP decision aid for women has the potential to reach IPV survivors at risk for HIV if it could be integrated into existing domestic violence agencies that prioritize trust and rapport with female IPV survivors. Leveraging non-traditional service delivery mechanisms in the community could expand reach to women who are IPV survivors for PrEP.</p> Methods <p>We conducted qualitative interviews and online qualitative surveys with 33 IPV survivors and 9 domestic violence agency staff at two agencies in Connecticut. We applied the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to understand barriers and facilitators to delivering a novel PrEP decision aid to IPV survivors in the context of domestic violence service agencies.</p> Results <p>Most IPV survivors and agency staff thought the PrEP decision aid intervention could be compatible with agenciesâ€™ existing practices, especially if adapted to be trauma-responsive and delivered by trusted counselors and staff members. PrEP conversations could be packaged into already well-developed safety planning and wellness practices. Agency staff noted some concerns about prioritizing urgent safety needs over longer-term preventive health needs during crisis periods and expressed interest in receiving further training on PrEP to provide resources for their clients.</p> Conclusions <p>IPV survivors and agency staff identified key intervention characteristics of a PrEP decision aid and inner setting factors of the service agencies that are compatible. Any HIV prevention intervention in this setting would need to be adapted to be trauma-responsive and staff would need to be equipped with proper training to be successful.</p>","author":"Jaimie P.
