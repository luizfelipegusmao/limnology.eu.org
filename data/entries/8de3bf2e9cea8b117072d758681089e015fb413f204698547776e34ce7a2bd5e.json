{"title":"Illuminating Intercellular Autophagy: A Comprehensive Review of Cell Non-Autonomous Autophagy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0828/v1","date":1710510002000,"content":"Macro-autophagy (autophagy hereafter) is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process that has long been recognized as an intracellular mechanism for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It involves the formation of a membraned structure called the autophagosome, which carries cargo that includes toxic protein aggregates and dysfunctional organelles to the lysosome for degradation and recycling. Autophagy is primarily considered and studied as a cell-autonomous mechanism. However, recent studies have illuminated an underappreciated facet of autophagy, i.e., non-autonomously regulated autophagy. Non- autonomously regulated autophagy involves the degradation of autophagic components, including organelles, cargo, and signaling molecules, and is induced in neighboring cells by signals from primary adjacent or distant cells/tissues/organs. This review provides insight into the complex molecular mechanisms governing non-autonomously regulated autophagy, highlighting the dynamic interplay between cells within tissue/organ or distinct cell types in different tissues/organs. Emphasis is placed on modes of intercellular communication that include secreted molecules, including microRNAs, and their regulatory roles in orchestrating this phenomenon. Furthermore, we explore the multidimensional roles of non-autonomously regulated autophagy in various physiological contexts, spanning tissue development and aging, as well as its importance in diverse pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegeneration. By studying the complexities of non-autonomously regulated autophagy, we hope to gain insights into the sophisticated intercellular dynamics within multicellular organisms, including mammals. These studies will uncover novel avenues for therapeutic intervention to modulate intercellular autophagic pathways in altered human physiology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8de3bf2e9cea8b117072d758681089e015fb413f204698547776e34ce7a2bd5e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
