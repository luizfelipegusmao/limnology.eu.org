{"title":"Finite Element Analysis of the Alternate Cyclic Forging Process for 6061-Ð¢4 Aluminum Alloy Billets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2070/v1","date":1721962015000,"content":"One of the relevant goals in forging technologies is simplifying the existing process and developing new processes that can retain the original or very close to the original dimensions and billet shape after the end of the deformation cycle. This study attempts to develop a forging equipment design that provides alternating cyclic loading; the alternate cyclic forging (ACF) method is proposed. To preliminary evaluate the ACF and study the plastic deformation behavior, numerical simulation via finite element modeling (FEM) was conducted using DEFORM-3D. The main attention was paid to the metal flow characteristics, effective strain and stress distribution, and the forging load. The ACF results in non-uniform metal flow with the formation of diagonal and vortex flows were demonstrated. Maximum effective strains and stresses zones are localized at two points of the billet contact with the surface of the tooling container and at two points of the interface between the punches. It was also assumed that reducing the contact area between the punch and the billet using separate semi-cylindrical punches can reduce the forging load. Preliminary finite element analysis (FEA) results of the proposed process after four successive steps of the deformation cycle confirmed the feasibility of its general implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0fcb2f8c47cf256281d172613d6692ae83390a2595f76e7a2cbef27b225813f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
