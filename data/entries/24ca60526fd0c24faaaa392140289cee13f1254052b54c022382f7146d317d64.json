The goal is to identify key researchers, institutions, and collaboration patterns that have shaped the field over the past two decades. Method: This study utilized network analysis techniques to evaluate 484 publications related to IBD research indexed in the WoS Core Collection between 2000 and 2023. The analysis was conducted using Python (Version 3.10.5) in the PyCharm development environment (Software Version 2022.1.3). The co-authorship networks were assessed using macro-level indicators such as network density (the ratio of actual to possible connections), clustering coefficient (degree of node clustering), number of components (distinct connected subgroups), and average path length (average distance between nodes). Micro-level indicators including degree centrality (importance based on the number of connections), closeness centrality (proximity to other nodes), and betweenness centrality (frequency of a node on the shortest paths between others) were also analyzed.Result: From 2000 to 2009, the co-authorship network was highly fragmented with a low network density of 0.0114 and 84 distinct components, indicating limited collaboration. Key contributors during this period included Kim, Won Ho, and Cheon, Jae Hee (South Korea), who played central roles in connecting disparate research clusters. In the following decade (2010-2019), network density decreased slightly to 0.0086, and the number of components increased to 113, reflecting continued fragmentation despite growing research output. However, from 2020 to 2023, network density increased to 0.0171, and the number of components decreased to 73, indicating a trend towards greater integration and collaboration. Notable researchers in this period included Emmi, Giacomo (Italy), and Hatemi, Gulen (Turkey), who emerged as central figures, highlighting a shift in research leadership from Asia to Europe..Conclusion: The co-authorship network analysis of IBD research reveals an evolving collaborative landscape with increasing network density and decreasing fragmentation over time, particularly in the most recent period. From 2000 to 2019, Japanese and Korean researchers were prominent contributors, highlighting the significance of Asia in the global research arena. However, since 2020, researchers from Italy and Turkey have gained significant international prominence, suggesting a shift in the research focus from Asia to Europe. This transition may be attributed to changes in the incidence rates of IBD, where rapid increases were observed in Asian countries like Japan, Korea, and China until 2020, followed by stabilization or decline, while incidence rates have been increasing in European countries such as Italy and Turkey. These findings underscore the importance of expanding international collaborations to enhance the understanding of IBD. Fostering global partnerships could further advance the field, promoting more integrated and innovative research efforts, and addressing the shifting dynamics of IBD prevalence across regions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24ca60526fd0c24faaaa392140289cee13f1254052b54c022382f7146d317d64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
