{"title":"Taxonomy and nomenclature of Oophila amblystomatis (Chlorophyceae, Chlamydomonadales)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13430?af=R","date":1705337337000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The unicellular green alga <i>Oophila amblystomatis</i> was named by Lambert in 1905 based upon its association with egg masses of the spotted salamander <i>Ambystoma maculatum</i>. We collected algal cells from Lambert's original egg capsule preparations that were contributed to <i>Phycotheca Boreali-Americana</i> (PBA) in 1905 and subjected them to DNA extraction and PCR with <i>O. amblystomatis</i>-specific 18S rRNA gene primers. DNA amplified from these preparations was cloned and nine clones were sequenced. Along with representative sequences from the <i>Oophila</i> clade and Chlorophyceae, a phylogenetic tree was inferred. Seven sequences clustered within the <i>Oophila</i> clade and two clustered with <i>Chlamydomonas moewusii</i>, which is included in a sister clade to <i>Oophila</i>. By sequencing algal material from the egg capsules of representative type material we can unambiguously characterize <i>O. amblystomatis</i> and define a monophyletic clade centered on this type material. Accordingly, we reject a recent proposal that this species be transferred to <i>Chlorococcum</i>.</p>","author":"Cory D. Bishop, \nDavid J.
