{"title":"Patient Knowledge, Medication Adherence, and Influencing Factors: A Cross-Sectional Study among Hypertensive Patients in Greece","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1190/v1","date":1710933555000,"content":"This study aimed to investigate the knowledge of patients with hypertension about their condition, adherence to antihypertensive medication, and the factors influencing it. A cross-sectional study was conducted in two cardiology outpatient clinics of two tertiary hospitals, in Greece. The study included 188 patients diagnosed with hypertension. The patientâ€™s knowledge about their disease and adherence to medication were assessed by using the HK-LS and A-14 scales, respectively. Patients had sufficient knowledge levels about their disease, but significantly low levels of adherence to medication. Patients with higher knowledge levels were more adherent to medications [r(188) = 0.885, p &amp;lt; 0.001]. By using multivariate analysis, higher age (p = 0.018), residence in a more populous area (p = 0.041), more years with the disease (p = 0.012), and a lower number of medications (p = 0.03) were associated with higher levels of knowledge. Conversely, younger age (p = 0.036), lower educational levels (p = 0.048), fewer years with the disease (p = 0.001), and a higher number of medications (p = 0.003) were associated with lower adherence to medication. The Greek patients' hypertension knowledge was sufficient, however, adherence to medication was significantly low. Healthcare managers could utilize our findings to design targeted interventions for improving adherence to medication for these patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"14ebbb90288761d21e9e6730c4a98cdf4fe8640baf2fabdf9e5c1802bcd76ec6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
