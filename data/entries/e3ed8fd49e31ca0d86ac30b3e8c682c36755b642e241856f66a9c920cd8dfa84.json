{"title":"Investigation into the Energy Consumption Characteristics of the Pump Control System for Electric Excavator Arms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1463/v1","date":1729253944000,"content":"The conventional hydraulic system of excavators suffers from significant valve throttling losses and inadequate matching between the hydraulic power source and the load, which substantially impacts the overall energy consumption of the system and severely impedes the trends toward electrification and energy efficiency in construction machinery. To address this issue, a pump-controlled hydraulic cylinder system has been implemented to replace the original valve-controlled hydraulic system that utilizes a single pump with multiple actuators. Focusing on a specific model of electric-driven excavator arm as the research subject, we completed parameter matching design for the pump-controlled hydraulic cylinder system. Based on typical operating conditions of the boom, experimental results revealed how energy conversion efficiency and hydraulic pump speed are influenced by varying load power.Furthermore, control over hydraulic cylinder position was achieved by adjusting pump displacement. A combined control strategy involving both displacement adjustment and motor speed modulation to align with load power is applied within this boom's pump-controlled hydraulic cylinder system. Research findings indicate that this combined control approach enhances efficiency by approximately 18.9% compared to traditional variable speed pump-controlled hydraulic cylinder system, while the energy consumption is reduced by about 39% compared with the traditional valve-controlled hydraulic system. under the hydraulic pump pressure of p=16 MPa and a working flow demand of Q=85 L/min, the efficiency of the hydraulic pump increases first and then decreases, that is, the efficiency spaceΔη=26.7% can be improved in the speed range.This study holds both theoretical and practical significance for enhancing energy utilization efficiency across entire excavator systems as well as optimizing their configurations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3ed8fd49e31ca0d86ac30b3e8c682c36755b642e241856f66a9c920cd8dfa84","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
