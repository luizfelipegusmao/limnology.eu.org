{"title":"On the Exploitation of Lignin Slow Pyrolysis Products","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2435/v1","date":1727765195000,"content":"The potential of technical lignins slow pyrolysis is briefly summarized. The pyrolysis process, which can be self-sustained by burning the co-produced gas, can primarily produce high-quality biochar in significant amounts, to be used as a fuel and as a reductant in metallurgy. Together, significant amounts of bio-oil can be produced, rich in guaiacols, which are commercial and expensive chemicals produced today via petrochemical routes and used in pharmacology, food chemistry, polymer chemistry, etc. Such compounds or bio-oil itself can also be converted by hydrodeoxygenation into biofuels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbe86e0a1ffaab5bdc37f7fcf80b1d8904861244a2c4aa1b3ed7c9fcf1e84463","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
