{"title":"Characteristics and treatment of pediatric nasal foreign bodies with button batteries-A retrospective analysis of 176 cases","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309261","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Shang Yan, Guowei Chen, Nan Zeng, Chaobing Gao</p>\r\nPurpose <p>Button battery nasal impactions pose serious risks due to complications and the need for prompt removal, yet research on interventions remains limited due to its rare occurrence. To delineate the clinical manifestations of nasal foreign bodies associated with button batteries and to explore treatment approaches focused on minimizing the reliance on general anesthesia and surgical interventions.</p> Methods <p>This study focuses on 176 cases of children who received treatment for nasal cavity button battery impactions. It encompasses various factors including age, gender, battery location, impaction duration, methods of extraction, and associated complications.</p> Results <p>The incidence of nasal button battery cases among nasal foreign body instances was 1.16%, with a majority being males (60.23%) aged 1â€“5 years (98.29%). Utilizing a specially designed nasal foreign body hook and following established treatment protocols enabled the successful outpatient management of the majority of cases. Only 12 cases (6.82%) necessitated removal under general anesthesia due to management challenges in an outpatient setting. Furthermore, our findings indicated no linear correlation between the duration of battery retention and the risk of nasal septal perforation, which was observed in 31 cases (17.61%).</p> Conclusion <p>Nasal foreign bodies caused by button batteries in children demand urgent attention due to their potentially grave outcomes. Our research is directed towards enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to bolster the success rates of outpatient removal, curtail the duration of foreign body retention, and diminish the reliance on general anesthesia.</p>","author":"Shang Yan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d45e380c724d9205c0a885218ffac25106548daadeba8dcb9ba0920d6ca1d24f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
