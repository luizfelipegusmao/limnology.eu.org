{"title":"Spatio-temporal plant hormonomics: from tissue to subcellular resolution","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/17/5295/7700915?rss=1","date":1719532800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Due to technological advances in mass spectrometry, significant progress has been achieved recently in plant hormone research. Nowadays, plant hormonomics is well established as a fully integrated scientific field focused on the analysis of phytohormones, mainly on their isolation, identification, and spatiotemporal quantification in plants. This review represents a comprehensive meta-study of the advances in the phytohormone analysis by mass spectrometry over the past decade. To address current trends and future perspectives, Web of Science data were systematically collected and key features such as mass spectrometry-based analyses were evaluated using multivariate data analysis methods. Our findings showed that plant hormonomics is currently divided into targeted and untargeted approaches. Both aim to miniaturize the sample, allowing high-resolution quantification to be covered in plant organs as well as subcellular compartments. Therefore, we can study plant hormone biosynthesis, metabolism, and signalling at a spatio-temporal resolution. Moreover, this trend has recently been accelerated by technological advances such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting or mass spectrometry imaging.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"17268ab611c775232e1a6e0a71e977e1de0bb24623b4ca8ef3305373ea9def75","category":"Environment"}
