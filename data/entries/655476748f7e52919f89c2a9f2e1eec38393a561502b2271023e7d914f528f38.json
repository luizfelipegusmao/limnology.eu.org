{"title":"What to Deconstruct in a Literary Text?: Illustrations from Ira Trivedi&#039;s The Great Indian Love Story and India in Love","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0845/v1","date":1723529100000,"content":"The research paper examines ‘aporia,’ ‘Différance,’ ‘binary oppositions’ in Ira Trivedi's \"The Great Indian Love Story,\" and India in Love focusing on the characters Riya, Serena, and Permeet's experiences. Derrida’s deconstructive approach is applied to trace out ‘binaries’, ‘aporia’, and ‘Différance’ of sexuality and stigma in literary texts and real human life. It highlights how these characters seem/likely to challenge Indian societal norms and values, societal prejudices and discrimination that lead them to experiences of marginalization and exclusion of the self from other selves. It is observed that deconstruction is an apt approach to literature not a destructive approach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"655476748f7e52919f89c2a9f2e1eec38393a561502b2271023e7d914f528f38","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
