{"title":"Primary, seminal and lateral roots of maize show type-specific growth and hydraulic responses to water deficit","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2564/7529179?rss=1","date":1705104000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The water uptake capacity of a root system is determined by its architecture and hydraulic properties, which together shape the root hydraulic architecture. Here, we investigated root responses to water deficit (WD) in seedlings of a maize (<span>Zea mays</span>) hybrid line (B73H) grown in hydroponic conditions, taking into account the primary root (PR), the seminal roots (SR), and their respective lateral roots. WD was induced by various polyethylene glycol concentrations and resulted in dose-dependent inhibitions of axial and lateral root growth, lateral root formation, and hydraulic conductivity (<span>L</span>p<sub>r</sub>), with slightly distinct sensitivities to WD between PR and SR. Inhibition of <span>L</span>p<sub>r</sub> by WD showed a half-time of 5 to 6 min and was fully (SR) or partially (PR) reversible within 40 min. In the two root types, WD resulted in reduced aquaporin expression and activity, as monitored by mRNA abundance of 13 plasma membrane intrinsic protein (ZmPIP) isoforms and inhibition of <span>L</span>p<sub>r</sub> by sodium azide, respectively. An enhanced suberization/lignification of the epi- and exodermis was observed under WD in axial roots and in lateral roots of the PR but not in those of SR. Inverse modeling revealed a steep increase in axial conductance in root tips of PR and SR grown under WD that may be due to the decreased growth rate of axial roots in these conditions. Overall, our work reveals that these root types show quantitative differences in their anatomical, architectural, and hydraulic responses to WD, in terms of sensitivity, amplitude and reversibility. This distinct functionalization may contribute to integrative acclimation responses of whole root systems to soil WD.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"74a6e2206f067f54f3f1095aae3c9b20e50c61f16e8d3c733069152e4ee0fcc7","category":"Environment"}
