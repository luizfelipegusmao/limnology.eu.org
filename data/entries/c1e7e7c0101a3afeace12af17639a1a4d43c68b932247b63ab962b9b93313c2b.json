{"title":"Formulation and Evaluation of Bivalent Swine and Avian Lipid Nanoparticles mRNA Vaccine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0217/v1","date":1717589023000,"content":"Background:\n Worldwide, Swine and Avian influenza, or the H1N1 and H5N1 serotypes of the Influenza A virus, is a highly contagious illness. In recent years, the global incidence of mortality rate has surpassed 284,000 fatalities.\nAim of the study:\nThe production of mRNA vaccine lipid nanoparticles (LNP) to combat the deadly strains of Avian and Swine influenza (H1N1 and H5N1 of the influenza A serotype).\nMethodology:\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to clone genes of interest encoding Haemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) of Influenza A virus strains (H5N1 and H1N1) known as Avian flu and Swine flu, respectively. The genes were then inusing the EcoR1, BAM Hind II restriction endonuclease type II, and Ligase enzyme into the pET-21(+) transcription vector plasmid. On the other hand, the hybrid transcription vectors were mixed with T7 RNA polymerase and ribonucleotides within a test tube after being linearized using EcoR II. Following their purification via reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), the mRNAs of the HA and NA were encased in 70 nm LNPs and subjected to reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Lastly, immunogenicity studies were performed in stages 1/2 of randomized human and preclinical clinical trials.\nResults:\nThe bivalent vaccination had around 63% efficacy in preclinical studies and approximately 60% in randomized human clinical trials. The ELISA test showed strong neutralizing antibodies against HA were prevalent.\nConclusion:\nThe current study is a promising effort because of the development of the novel LNP-mRNA vaccine, which could lower the incidence of Avian and Swine flu infectious disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c1e7e7c0101a3afeace12af17639a1a4d43c68b932247b63ab962b9b93313c2b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
