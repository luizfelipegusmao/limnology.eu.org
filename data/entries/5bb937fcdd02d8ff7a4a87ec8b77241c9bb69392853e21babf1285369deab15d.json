{"title":"Statistics and Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence to Explore Coping Strategies and Adaptation in Myasthenia Gravis Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2015/v1","date":1719633669000,"content":"Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, which can significantly impact various facets of daily life, including physical capabilities, emotional well-being, and social interactions. The prognosis, when supported by optimal symptomatic, immunosuppressive, and supportive treatment, is generally favorable. However, compelling evidence underscores the presence of diminished quality of life among patients with MG. Notably, cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, and sleep disorders emerge as clinically pertinent dimensions in affected individuals, warranting careful scrutiny and investigation. Individuals with this condition often encounter challenges stemming from a lack of knowledge about effective coping strategies. The core objective of our research is to delve into the coping strategies adopted by patients with MG. To this end, we conducted an extensive inquiry, administering a series of personalized questions and utilizing the short version of the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced questionnaire, (COPE-NVI-25) survey. Generative Artificial Intelligence was also employed to gain a better understanding of patient responses. The outcomes of our study hold the potential to steer the development of targeted interventions, strategic approaches, and valuable resources designed to assist patients with MG in proficiently managing their condition and enhancing their overall well-being.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5bb937fcdd02d8ff7a4a87ec8b77241c9bb69392853e21babf1285369deab15d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
