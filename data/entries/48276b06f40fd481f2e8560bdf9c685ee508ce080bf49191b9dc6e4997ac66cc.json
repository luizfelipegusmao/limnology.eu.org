{"title":"Real-World Efficacy and Safety of Paclitaxel-Gemcitabine in Relapsed Small-Cell Lung Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0845/v1","date":1715599784000,"content":"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a cancer with poor prognosis. For relapsed extensive-stage (ES) SCLC, second-line treatment options are scarce. Topotecan was the only approved treatment in this setting until 2020. Since topotecan induces significant toxicities, alternative off-label regimens are being used. This study evaluated real-world efficacy and safety of Paclitaxel Gemcitabine chemotherapy in patients with relapsed ES-SCLC. We retrospectively reviewed data from all consecutive patients with relapsed ES-SCLC who received Paclitaxel Gemcitabine chemotherapy from september 2008 to january 2022 in two centers. Patient characteristics (n=188) were: PS≥2: 24.5%; brain metastasis: 42%; platinum-sensitive disease: 41%. Patients received Paclitaxel Gemcitabine as second- (77%) third (18%) or fourth (6%) line of therapy. Median progression-free and overall survival were 2.1 (95CI 1.8–2.4) and 3.8 (95CI 3.3–4.8) months in the overall population, respectively, with 17% response rate (RR) and 28% disease-control rate. PS, history of brain radiation, platinum-sensitive disease, liver, and adrenal gland metastasis were associated with longer survival in univariate analysis. PS was the only prognostic factor in multivariate analysis, with 21% RR and 4.1 months median DOR in PS 0-1 patients.\nPaclitaxel Gemcitabine chemotherapy may represent a treatment option in PS0-1 relapsed SCLC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"48276b06f40fd481f2e8560bdf9c685ee508ce080bf49191b9dc6e4997ac66cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
