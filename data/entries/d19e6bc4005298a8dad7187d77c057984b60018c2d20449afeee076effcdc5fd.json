Meagre forms large spawning aggregations in estuaries, yet details of its spawning grounds remain elusive. We tagged 41 individuals and monitored their movements throughout several spawning seasons. Detections inside estuaries were limited. Fish detected inside the Tejo estuary during the spawning season performed regular movements toward coastal areas, suggesting potential spawning outside estuaries. Our findings underscore the significance of understanding meagre's migratory patterns for effective fisheries management and conservation strategies, supporting the establishment of spatial and seasonal closures during the spawning season.</p>","author":"David Abecasis, \nLucas Martínez‐Ramírez, \nMiguel Gandra, \nAlexander C.
