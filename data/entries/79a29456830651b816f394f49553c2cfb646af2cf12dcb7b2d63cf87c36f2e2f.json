{"title":"Co-optimisation of mechanical properties and radiopacity through radiopaque filler incorporation for medical tubing applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0604/v1","date":1725863282000,"content":"The objective of this research project was to evaluate the effects of the addition of inorganic fillers into PEBA at various loading levels on the processing, mechanical, thermal and physical properties of the polymer. The composites investigated in this study were PebaxÂ® 6333 SA01 MED (PEBA100) with 10 wt.%, 20 wt.% and 30 wt.% Barium Sulphate (PEBA/BaSO4) and Bismuth Oxychloride (PEBA/BiOCl) respectively. Composites were prepared using twin screw extrusion and injection moulding. Post-processing, composite samples were analysed for their mechanical properties (via tensile, impact and flexural analysis), thermal properties (via differential scanning calorimetry), rheological performance (via melt flow index) and physical properties (via density analysis and ash content testing). The results of which reveal how filler type and concentration influence PEBA composites. The results of the study suggest that BiOCl filler enhances the aesthetic properties, increases the stiffness, while maintaining some level of flexibility with minimal adverse effects on the tensile and impact strength. When comparing BiOCl to BaSO4 filled composites, it was clear that depending on the application of the polymer composite, BiOCl may provide more desirable properties. The study highlights the importance of optimising filler concentration and processing conditions to achieve desired composite properties for specific medical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"79a29456830651b816f394f49553c2cfb646af2cf12dcb7b2d63cf87c36f2e2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
