{"title":"Optimisation of Windmill Power Plant Epicyclic Gearbox","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2020/v1","date":1727259701000,"content":"Humanity is shifting its power generation to renewable energy, notably wind power. As more and more wind power plants are built, it has become important to improve the efficiency of wind power generation and reduce the manufacturing costs of wind power equipment. The mechanical multiplier gearbox is one of the most important parts of the wind power turbine, and it is now being built as a planetary gear train as these gearboxes offer a compact build capable of high power ratings in a relatively small package with coaxial input and output shafts. It is very important to select the right kinematic scheme and the other relevant parameters in the early design stages as the wrong kinematic scheme will result in a suboptimal solution. This article deals with the selection of the optimal gearbox solution for a 700 kW wind turbine application, taking into account both two-carrier and three-carrier gearbox solutions. As the optimal solution may be deducted only by systematic analysis, the proprietary 2-SPEED software has been developed for this purpose. The results of the analysis have been presented in this article, and optimal gear train solutions have been suggested for both two-carrier and three-carrier multiplier configurations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c0ff373d97e744b97d64e240fa0d90753409a70c0a601436fa597958cafad3ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
