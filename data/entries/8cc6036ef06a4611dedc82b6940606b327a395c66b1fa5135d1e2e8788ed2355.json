Necessary and sufficient condition for the Ulam stability of second order periodic linear differential equations is obtained by giving an Ulam stability theorem and an Ulam instability theorem. These results extend the conclusions in relevant literature. In addition, for the situation of constant coefficients, the minimum Ulam constant is given.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8cc6036ef06a4611dedc82b6940606b327a395c66b1fa5135d1e2e8788ed2355","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
