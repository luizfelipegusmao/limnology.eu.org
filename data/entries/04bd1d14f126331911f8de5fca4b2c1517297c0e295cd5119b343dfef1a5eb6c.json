{"title":"Factors affecting onion production: An empirical study in the Raya Kobo district, Amhara regional state, Ethiopia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305134","date":1718373600000,"content":"<p>by Mesele Belay Zegeye, Tesfahun Ayanaw Alemu, Moges Asmare Sisay, Sisay Genanu Mulaw, Tadesse Wudu Abate</p>\r\n\r\nOnion is a vital vegetable crop in Ethiopia, with significant economic and health benefits. However, its production trend is not consistent, with periods of increase and decrease; and its productivity in the country falls far below its potential. As a result, farmers are not yet fully benefited from onion production. Thus, this study was initiated to identify the factors influencing onion production in the Raya Kobo District of Amhara Regional State of Ethiopia. Data was collected from 189 onion-producing farmers through household surveys, and both descriptive and econometric techniques were used for analysis. The study found significant variation in onion production among farmers, with lower levels compared to national and international averages. Factors such as gender, education level, experience, labor force, land size, access to extension services, irrigation water, land plough frequency, and fertilizer availability positively impact onion production. However, excessive fertilizer use was found to have a negative effect. The study also identified challenges faced by farmers, including input shortages, high costs, diseases, labor issues, soil infertility, and storage knowledge gaps. The study recommends policymakers and stakeholders to utilize these findings to develop effective policies and interventions that can enhance onion production, benefiting farmers and improving the overall onion production.","author":"Mesele Belay Zegeye","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"04bd1d14f126331911f8de5fca4b2c1517297c0e295cd5119b343dfef1a5eb6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
