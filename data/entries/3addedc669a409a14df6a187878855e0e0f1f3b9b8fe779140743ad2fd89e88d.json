{"title":"AtIAR1 is a Zn transporter that regulates auxin metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/5/1437/7439810?rss=1","date":1700524800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Root growth in Arabidopsis is inhibited by exogenous auxin–amino acid conjugates, and mutants resistant to one such conjugate [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)–Ala] map to a gene (<span>AtIAR1</span>) that is a member of a metal transporter family. Here, we test the hypothesis that AtIAR1 controls the hydrolysis of stored conjugated auxin to free auxin through zinc transport. <span>AtIAR1</span> complements a yeast mutant sensitive to zinc, but not manganese- or iron-sensitive mutants, and the transporter is predicted to be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi in plants. A previously identified <span>Atiar1</span> mutant and a non-expressed T-DNA mutant both exhibit altered auxin metabolism, including decreased IAA–glucose conjugate levels in zinc-deficient conditions and insensitivity to the growth effect of exogenous IAA–Ala conjugates. At a high concentration of zinc, wild-type plants show a novel enhanced response to root growth inhibition by exogenous IAA–Ala which is disrupted in both <span>Atiar1</span> mutants. Furthermore, both <span>Atiar1</span> mutants show changes in auxin-related phenotypes, including lateral root density and hypocotyl length. The findings therefore suggest a role for AtIAR1 in controlling zinc release from the secretory system, where zinc homeostasis plays a key role in regulation of auxin metabolism and plant growth regulation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"3addedc669a409a14df6a187878855e0e0f1f3b9b8fe779140743ad2fd89e88d","category":"Environment"}
