{"title":"Ultrasonic high‐yield extraction of non‐toxic fucose‐containing Abroma augusta polysaccharide bearing emulsifying properties","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13712?af=R","date":1720683856000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The stem of <i>Abroma augusta</i> contains mucilaginous polysaccharides having numerous ethnomedicinal properties. The present work aimed to develop a scalable ultrasonic-assisted aqueous <i>Abroma augusta</i> mucilage (AAM) extraction (UAE) method and further explores its emulsifying property and toxicity concern.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The combination of ultrasonic power (750 W), solid-to-liquid ratio (1:15) and temperature (348 K) gave the highest extraction yield of 2.28% with a diffusivity value of 3.85 × 10<sup>−9</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, which was higher than aqueous extraction method using a kinetic model based on Fick's second law of diffusion. The extracted polysaccharide showed no toxicity as measured through 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay on RAW cell line. Additionally, the polysaccharide over its critical micelle concentration (400, 500, 600 and 700 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>) offered emulsifying properties with 0.5%, 1% and 5% oil (v/v). The emulsion with a polysaccharide concentration of 600 μg mL<sup>−1</sup> with 5% oil (v/v) provides stability against coalescence for 3 days.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The overall findings indicated that UAE of AAM polysaccharide can be used for an efficient extraction method, and the obtained polysaccharide is nontoxic in nature and bears emulsifying properties. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Shubhajit Sarkhel, \nMrinmoy Mondal, \nDeepanwita Datta, \nBijendra Sahoo, \nAnkanksha Kumari, \nSreyajit Saha, \nSandipan Bera, \nMalabendu Jana, \nAmit Tiwari, \nAnupam Roy","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"df1f5d5c555e9e150f6d17b11c264224adeeccbdd1200db47a0954d32b14dc27","category":"Environment"}
