{"title":"Study on a Proposed Non-Destructive Method Based on Sphere Launching and Piezoelectric Diaphragm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0958/v1","date":1723587835000,"content":"This work presents the study of a reproducible acoustic emission method based on the launching of a metallic sphere and low-cost piezoelectric diaphragm. For this purpose, tests were first conducted on a carbon fiber-reinforced polymer structure, and then on an aluminum structure for comparative analysis. The Pencil Lead Break (PLB) tests were also conducted for comparisons with the proposed method. Different launching heights and elastic deformations of the structures were investigated. The results show higher repeatability for the sphere impact method, as the PLB is more affected by human inaccuracy, and it was also effective in damage detection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a43433cc733e05296921d3797642089737f3838a1e896927df80e5eebe4d3749","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
