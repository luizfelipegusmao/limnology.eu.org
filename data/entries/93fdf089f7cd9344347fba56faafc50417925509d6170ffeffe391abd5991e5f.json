{"title":"Does the Presence of Matted Nodes in Colon Adenocarcinoma Influence 5-Year Overall Survival?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0731/v1","date":1718107225000,"content":"Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is prevalent globally, constituting 11.9% of cases in Mexico. Lymph node metastases are established prognostic indicators, with extracapsular lymph node extension (ENE) playing a crucial role in modifying prognosis. While ENE is associated with adverse factors, certain aspects, like lymph node conglomerates, are underexplored. Matted nodes, clusters of lymph nodes infiltrated by cancer cells, are recognized as an independent prognostic factor in other cancers. This study investigates the prognostic implications of lymph node conglomerates, particularly matted nodes, in colon cancer. Methods: A retrospective analy-sis of 502 colon cancer cases (2005â€“2018) identified 255 with lymph node metastasis. Cases were categorized into two groups: 1) lymph node metastasis alone (n=208), and 2) lymph node metas-tasis with matted nodes (n=47). A comparative survival analysis was performed. Results: Of the 255 patients, 38% had lymph node metastasis. Patients with matted nodes (18.4%) showed an association with higher pN stage and lymphovascular invasion. The 5-year survival rate for pa-tients with matted nodes was 47.7%, compared to 60% without; however, this association demonstrated only a statistical tendency. Multivariate analysis identified clinical stage and ad-juvant chemotherapy use as independent factors contributing to survival. Conclusion: This study underscores matted nodes as potential prognostic indicators in colon cancer, emphasizing their association with higher pN stage and reduced survival. Further research is essential for validat-ing these findings and integrating matted nodes into the broader context of colorectal cancer management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93fdf089f7cd9344347fba56faafc50417925509d6170ffeffe391abd5991e5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
