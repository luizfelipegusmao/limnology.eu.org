{"title":"The Hidden Secrets of Psylloidea: Biology, Behavior, Symbionts, and Ecology","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ento-120120-114738?TRACK=RSS","date":1706140800000,"content":"<div><p>Psyllids constitute a diverse group of sap-feeding Sternorrhyncha that were relatively obscure until it was discovered that a handful of species transmit bacterial plant pathogens. Yet the superfamily Psylloidea is much richer than the sum of its crop-associated vectors, with over 4,000 described species exhibiting diverse life histories and host exploitation strategies. A growing body of research is uncovering fascinating insights into psyllid evolution, biology, behavior, and species interactions. This work has revealed commonalities and differences with better-studied Sternorrhyncha, as well as unique evolutionary patterns of lineage divergence and host use. We are also learning how psyllid evolution and foraging ecology underlie life history traits and the roles of psyllids in communities. At finer scales, we are untangling the web of symbionts across the psyllid family tree, linking symbiont and psyllid lineages, and revealing mechanisms underlying reciprocal exchange between symbiont and host. In this review, we synthesize and summarize key advances within these areas with a focus on free-living (nongalling) Psylloidea.</p></div>","author":"Kerry E. Mauck, Marco Gebiola and Diana M.
