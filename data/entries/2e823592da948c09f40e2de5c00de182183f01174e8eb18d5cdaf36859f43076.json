{"title":"A New MATLAB-Based Simulation Interface for Serial Robots","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1962/v1","date":1719506772000,"content":"The development of virtual models has recently been generalized in the field of complex mechatronic product design. Virtual models have various advantages such as: the systemic design approach, most often parametric, the implementation of extreme, expensive, and perhaps risky scenarios for the operation of the designed product, the testing of a large number of variants, etc.\nThe main contribution of the paper consists of the development of an interface family called DeSeRoI (Dedicated Serial Robot Interface). Each member of the interface family integrates Simulink libraries and is created by the programmer in accordance with user requests. It follows that the interfaces composing the DeSeRoI family can have different levels of complexity depending on user needs and constraints. \nWe are implementing a MATLAB-based application with user-provided configuration for serial robots in order to automatically visualize the kinematics data and simulation. Within MATLAB, two scripts are created responsible for generating Simulink models that compute the kinematics problem. One of the scripts (Main) saves information about the configuration of the robot and the other one (Generates_Simulink_Models) computes the kinematics problem. Different types of functions (software module) have been developed. Using these functions, the Simulink models result as modular entities. The automated approach eases user’s interaction and understanding of serial robots’ kinematics by performing the simulation procedure in a shorter amount of time and with higher efficiency, assuring a precise outcome despite the chosen parameters.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2e823592da948c09f40e2de5c00de182183f01174e8eb18d5cdaf36859f43076","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
