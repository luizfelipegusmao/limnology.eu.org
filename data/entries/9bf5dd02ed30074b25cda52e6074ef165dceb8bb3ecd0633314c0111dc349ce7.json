{"title":"Urban Ecology of Red-Whiskered Bulbul: Feeding Behavior, Breeding Success and Behavioural Patterns in New Barrackpore, West Bengal, India","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1105/v1","date":1726285141000,"content":"This study investigates the urban ecology of the Red-Whiskered Bulbul (Pycnonotus jocosus) in New Barrackpore, West Bengal, India. We examined the feeding behavior, breeding success, and behavioral patterns of the species in urban habitats. Our results show that the Red-Whiskered Bulbul is adapting to urban environments, with a moderate breeding success rate (64%) and specific behavioral patterns. The species exhibits a significant preference for urban habitats, particularly mango and bamboo trees, and a significant increase in singing activity during the breeding season. Our findings highlight the importance of urban ecology in understanding the behavior and conservation of this species. We suggest that urban green spaces with native tree species and sustainable urban planning practices can support the conservation of the Red-Whiskered Bulbul and other urban-adapted species. This study contributes to our understanding of urban wildlife ecology and conservation in India and has implications for urban planning and biodiversity conservation globally.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9bf5dd02ed30074b25cda52e6074ef165dceb8bb3ecd0633314c0111dc349ce7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
