{"title":"Rainbow Step Barrier Options","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1530/v1","date":1718967211000,"content":"This article provides exact analytical formulae for various kinds of rainbow step barrier options. These are highly flexible and sophisticated multi-asset barrier options based on the following principle : the option life is divided into several time intervals on which different barriers are monitored w.r.t. different underlying assets. From a mathematical point of view, new formulae are provided for the first passage time of a multidimensional geometric Brownian motion to a boundary defined as a step function. The article shows how to implement the obtained valuation formulae in a simple and very efficient manner. Numerical results highlight a strong sensitivity of rainbow step barrier options to the correlations between the underlying assets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9fed67e0dcb4f63ba8404c91eb156659cebe954d802eaecb5b4e84fdd3124fda","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
