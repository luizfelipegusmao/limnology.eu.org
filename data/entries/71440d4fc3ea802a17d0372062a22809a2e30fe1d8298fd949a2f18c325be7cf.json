How far into the new year is acceptable to skip the ‘Happy New Year!’ formalities? Well, I’ve said it now. No going back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m only slightly jealous of the peloton as they make their way to Australia for the Tour Down Under races. The women will kick start their season from the 12th-14th January with the men’s race following from 16th-21st January.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let’s get back into pro cycling news.

Last week it was announced Red Bull will take over a 51% stake of the Bora-Hansgrohe team following their purchase of shares in RD Pro Cycling KG and RD Beteiligungs. Both companies are owned by Bora-Hansgrohe founder Ralph Denk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Red Bull previously collaborated in the ‘Red Bull Junior Brothers’ programme last year, which awarded Patrick Casey and Anatol Friedl contracts to Bora-Hansgrohe’s U-19 squad, Team Auto Eder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the signing of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> during the off-season, the Bora-Hansgrohe team is eyeing more success in the upcoming year, specifically, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a>, though Lennard Kåmna will undoubtably win another Grand Tour stage too. But with the might of Red Bull in charge, expect bigger budgets. What that means for Red Bull sponsored riders on others teams, such as Wout van Aert, is currently unknown.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Australian National Championships results</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ruby-Roseman-Gannon-wins-Australian-Road-Race-National-Championship-2024-970x646.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ruby-Roseman-Gannon-wins-Australian-Road-Race-National-Championship-2024-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ruby-Roseman-Gannon-wins-Australian-Road-Race-National-Championship-2024-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ruby-Roseman-Gannon-wins-Australian-Road-Race-National-Championship-2024-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ruby-Roseman-Gannon-wins-Australian-Road-Race-National-Championship-2024-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ruby-Roseman-Gannon-wins-Australian-Road-Race-National-Championship-2024-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ruby-Roseman-Gannon-wins-Australian-Road-Race-National-Championship-2024-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ruby-Roseman-Gannon-wins-Australian-Road-Race-National-Championship-2024-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ruby-Roseman-Gannon-wins-Australian-Road-Race-National-Championship-2024-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ruby-Roseman-Gannon-wins-Australian-Road-Race-National-Championship-2024-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Ruby-Roseman-Gannon-wins-Australian-Road-Race-National-Championship-2024.jpeg 1843w\" /><figcaption>Con Chronis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Always a precursor to the Tour Down Under, the Australian National Championships were held from the 3rd January and history dictates they’re dominated by those in the Jayco-AlUla and Liv-AlUla-Jayco teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla) had a perfect start to the season, doubling up with wins in the men’s elite individual time-trial and road race, his second victory in the former and third consecutive in the latter.
