{"title":"154 Forage intake, digestibility, and ruminal fermentation characteristics of beef cows supplemented with a Bacillus-based probiotic","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/388/7757131?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of a <span>Bacillus</span>-based probiotic supplementation on intake, digestibility, and ruminal fermentation parameters of beef cows consuming a low-quality forage diet (7.0% CP, 60% NDF, 39% ADF, DM basis). Ruminally fistulated Angus × Hereford cows [n = 15; age = 6.1 ± 1 yr; body weight (BW) = 655 ± 57] were used in two identical complete randomized designs, housed in individual pens with water, and forage intake monitored daily. Treatments consisted of 1) 500 g of protein supplement (dry distillers grain + mineral mix) without probiotic (CON n = 15), and 2) 500 g of protein supplement + 3 g of a probiotic containing <span>Bacillus licheniformis</span> and <span>B. subtilis</span> (BOV; n = 15; 2.2 ×10<sup>9</sup> CFU of the mixture/g<span>; Bovacillus</span>, <span>Novonesis</span>, Hørsholm, Denmark). Each experimental period lasted 33 d, consisting of 21 d of adaptation, 12 d of collection, and 30 d of wash-out between periods. From d 22 to 26, fecal samples were collected to determine intake and nutrient digestibility using titanium dioxide as an indigestible marker. On d 27, ruminal fluid was collected at h 0 (before feeding), 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 post-feeding to evaluate short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and N-NH3 concentration. From d 28 to 32, hay samples (4 g) were fitted in Dracon bags and incubated in the rumen for 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h to determine nutrient digestibility. Cows receiving BOV had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) dry matter intake compared with the CON group (Table 1). Also, cows supplemented with BOV had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.02) dry matter and protein digestibility and a tendency (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.07) for greater NDF and ADF forage digestibility compared with CON. A tendency was also detected (<span>P</span> = 0.09) for the degradability of forage dry matter, which was improved in BOV vs. CON. No effects were observed on rumen fermentation characteristics (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.14; Table 2).). In conclusion, adding bacillus-based probiotics enhanced the intake, nutritional digestibility, and degradability of beef cows fed medium-quality forage diets.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"9be7dd8e9910128d204b32729639b740ba2d2c80e6788a7169c910c63fe704a4","category":"Environment"}
