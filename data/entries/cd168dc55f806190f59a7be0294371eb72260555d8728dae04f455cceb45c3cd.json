{"title":"Emerging Role of Natriuretic Peptides in Diabetes Care: A Brief Review of Pertinent Recent Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1550/v1","date":1726750285000,"content":"Diabetes markedly increases susceptibility to adverse cardiovascular events, including heart failure (HF), leading to heightened morbidity and mortality rates. Elevated levels of natriuretic peptides (NPs), notably B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal-proBNP (NT-proBNP), correlate with cardiac structural and functional abnormalities, aiding in risk stratification and treatment strategies in individuals with diabetes. This article reviews the intricate relationship between diabetes and HF, emphasizing the role of NPs in risk assessment and guiding therapeutic strategies, particularly in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It also explores the challenges and prospects of natriuretic peptide-guided therapy in managing cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd168dc55f806190f59a7be0294371eb72260555d8728dae04f455cceb45c3cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
