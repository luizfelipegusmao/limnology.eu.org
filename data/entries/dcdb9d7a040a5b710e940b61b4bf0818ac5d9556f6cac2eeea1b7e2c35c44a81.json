Using the Fan-KKM theorem and Aumann's measurable selection theorem, we are able to prove the existence and uniqueness of random solution sets under the conditions of monotonicity and convexity. Additionally, we use Minty's lemma to demonstrate the compactness and convexity of the random solution sets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dcdb9d7a040a5b710e940b61b4bf0818ac5d9556f6cac2eeea1b7e2c35c44a81","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
