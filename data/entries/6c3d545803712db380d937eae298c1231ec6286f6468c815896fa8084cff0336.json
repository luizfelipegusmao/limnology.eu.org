{"title":"Farmers’ perceptions on stock theft in some districts of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310881","date":1727445600000,"content":"<p>by Kanya Ndzungu, Ishmael Festus Jaja</p>\r\n\r\nStock theft is a persistent and widespread problem affecting farmers in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. This study aimed to explore farmers’ perceptions of stock theft in the region. A mixed methods approach was used to collect data. 192 pre-tested questionnaires were collected from a sample of farmers in three districts in the province. The descriptive and chi-square test was used to test the associations between demographic profile statistically, knowledge of stock theft, reported stock theft cases, the economic impact of stock theft, and stock theft control. According to the findings, stock theft is significantly more likely to occur during the winter season (P &lt; 0.05). About 94.8% of farmers are in the communal farming sector in the three districts visited. Furthermore, 81.2% of the respondents believe that the government needs to do more to combat the spread of stock theft. This study also revealed that most respondents (88.6%) agree that branding and tattooing should be made available to all registered farmers, while 53.1% believe that forensic deoxyribonucleic acid should not be used to control stock theft at crime scenes. This study highlights farmers’ perceptions and knowledge of stock theft to enable policymakers to develop targeted interventions and strategies. Policing strategy must be adaptive and technology-driven to fast-track detection, prevention, and reduction of stuck theft crime.","author":"Kanya Ndzungu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6c3d545803712db380d937eae298c1231ec6286f6468c815896fa8084cff0336","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
