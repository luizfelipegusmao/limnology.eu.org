{"title":"The circadian clock and thermal regulation in plants: novel insights into the role of positive circadian clock regulators in temperature responses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/2809/7610776?rss=1","date":1708300800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The impact of rising global temperatures on crop yields is a serious concern, and the development of heat-resistant crop varieties is crucial for mitigating the effects of climate change on agriculture. To achieve this, a better understanding of the molecular basis of the thermal responses of plants is necessary. The circadian clock plays a central role in modulating plant biology in synchrony with environmental changes, including temperature fluctuations. Recent studies have uncovered the role of transcriptional activators of the core circadian network in plant temperature responses. This expert view highlights key novel findings regarding the role of the <span>RVE</span> and <span>LNK</span> gene families in controlling gene expression patterns and plant growth under different temperature conditions, ranging from regular diurnal oscillations to extreme stress temperatures. These findings reinforce the essential role of the circadian clock in plant adaptation to changing temperatures and provide a basis for future studies on crop improvement.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"5075b4d1be56c2785493d53e6878babad12c3fa1f2d1429bc979269ac4494704","category":"Environment"}
