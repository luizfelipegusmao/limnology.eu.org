{"title":"Artificial Vision System on Digital Devices for Real-Time Head Tilt Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2005/v1","date":1714489547000,"content":"In the last decades we have experienced great social, cultural, and educational changes, spending more time performing tasks in near vision and less hours in outdoor activities, having more overexposure to digital screens, especially the youngest and increasingly from younger ages. It is common to see cases when performing tasks in near vision the posture or position of the head is not adequate, especially the youngest, being essential to have a correct posture of the head to avoid visual, muscular, or articular problems. We present a procedure to try to control the correct position of the head in real time when performing close-up activities. The aim is to detect the inclination of the head and to know if a bad position is adopted due to a visual problem or simply to inadequate visio-postural habits, warning us of the postural anomaly to correct it.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2bb7a0ec0d8652c22f6e30385bbaf2006ab1653bf34d28912c1e0c3f55b30a20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
