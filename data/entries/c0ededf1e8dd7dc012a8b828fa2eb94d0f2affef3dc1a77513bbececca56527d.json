{"title":"Addressing Generation Z Anxiety: Electroacupuncture Therapy Modulates Oxidative Stress and Microglial Activity in the Basolateral Amygdala of Socially Isolated Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1032/v1","date":1728893086000,"content":"Anxiety is a prevalent mental health disorder that significantly impairs daily functioning and social interactions. While pharmacological treatments can be effective, they are often limited by challenges such as treatment resistance, side effects, and relapse. Electroacupuncture (EA) has emerged as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for anxiety, though its mechanisms of action remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the role of microglial cells in anxiety and examines how EA influences microglial morphology and function in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in a model of social isolation-induced anxiety. Using a socially isolated mouse model, we assessed anxiety-like behaviors through the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and Open Field Test (OFT), and conducted biochemical analyses and immunofluorescence imaging to evaluate NOX2 expression, microglial activation, and oxidative stress markers. Our results show that EA significantly alleviates anxiety-like behaviors, reduces NOX2 expression in BLA microglia, lowers reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and enhances microglial morphology. These findings suggest that EA exerts its anxiolytic effects by modulating oxidative stress and microglial activity in the BLA, offering new insights into the cellular mechanisms by which EA may aid in anxiety management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c0ededf1e8dd7dc012a8b828fa2eb94d0f2affef3dc1a77513bbececca56527d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
