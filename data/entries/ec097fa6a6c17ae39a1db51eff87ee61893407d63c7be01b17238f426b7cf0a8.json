{"title":"IL-6 Polymorphism as a Predisposing Genetic Factor for Gestational Diabetes or Preeclampsia Development in Pregnancy with Obesity: VEGF and VEGFF Receptor Related Gene Expression Modalities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0356/v1","date":1715069981000,"content":"The increased prevalence of obesity worldwide has been implicated for the alarming rise of the incidence of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia as well, both considered as threatening conditions for both mother and fetus. We studied gene polymorphisms of the proinflammatory cytokine Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and the gene expression levels of VEGF and VEGF-receptor all known to be involved in pregnancy complications aiming to identify possible predisposing risk factors in pregnancies with obesity. G allele of IL-6 was found to correspond with an increased risk for gestational diabetes and preeclampsia occurrence. Furthermore, in obese pregnant mothers with either gestational diabetes or pre-existing type 2 diabetes and to those developed preeclampsia it was confirmed that gene expression levels of VEGF were reduced while they were increased for VEGF receptor. We conclude that the genetic profile of the obese pregnant woman shares a common background with that of a pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus and therefore predisposes to complications in pregnancy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec097fa6a6c17ae39a1db51eff87ee61893407d63c7be01b17238f426b7cf0a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
