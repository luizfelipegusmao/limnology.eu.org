{"title":"Effects of foliar application of methyl jasmonate and/or urea, conventional or via nanoparticles, on grape volatile composition","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13660?af=R","date":1718958485000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Viticulture has adapted foliar applications of biostimulants as a tool to improve crop quality. Recently, nanotechnology has been incorporated as a strategy to reduce the loss of biostimulants and treat nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of foliar applications of amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles (ACP) doped with methyl jasmonate (ACP-MeJA) and urea (ACP-Ur), individually or together (ACP-MeJA+Ur), on the content of volatile compounds in ‘Tempranillo’ grapes, compared to the conventional application of MeJA and Ur, individually or in combination (MeJA+Ur).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that nanoparticle treatments reduced the total C6 compounds and some carbonyl compounds in the grape musts. This is of novel interest because their presence at high levels is undesirable to quality. In addition, some aroma-positive compounds such as nerol, neral, geranyl acetone, <i>β</i>-cyclocitral, <i>β</i>-ionone, 2-phenylethanal and 2-phenylethanol increased, despite applying MeJA and Ur at a lower dose.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Consequently, although few differences in grape volatile composition were detected, nanotechnology could be an option for improving the aromatic quality of grapes, at the same time as reducing the required doses of biostimulants and generating more sustainable agricultural practices. © 2024 The Author(s).
