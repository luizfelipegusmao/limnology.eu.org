{"title":"The Impact of Nursing Interventions on Postoperative Complications Following Pediatric Bronchoscopy: A Meta-Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0730/v1","date":1728541027000,"content":"ediatric bronchoscopy is a widely used diagnostic and therapeutic procedure; however, it is frequently associated with postoperative complications, including laryngeal edema, hypoxemia, and respiratory distress【1】【2】. Nursing interventions have the potential to mitigate these complications; however, their overall effectiveness in pediatric populations remains under-investigated. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of nursing interventions on the incidence of postoperative complications following pediatric bronchoscopy. A random-effects model was applied to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), estimating the effect of nursing interventions on postoperative complications. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic, and publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger’s test. Nursing interventions were associated with a significant reduction in postoperative complications, with a pooled OR of 0.22 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.37; p &lt; 0.0001). The heterogeneity across studies was low (I² = 0%), indicating consistent results across the included studies【1】【3】【6】. Funnel plot analysis revealed slight asymmetry; however, Egger’s test did not indicate significant publication bias (p = 0.1213)【7】. Given the consistency of these findings, integrating structured nursing protocols into postoperative care has the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes. Further research is warranted to explore the long-term impacts and cost-effectiveness of these interventions【9】【10】","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb8b8169c25fcfd8508f7a3c8ac253917b765628b407b3804d0fb807c42a4766","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
