{"title":"PSIV-25 Utilization of rumen protected lysine and methionine in beef feedlot diets: Impacts on steer performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/732/7757884?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Our objective was to compare intake, gain, and feed efficiency of steers fed rumen protected lysine and/or methionine in 10% crude protein diet relative to performance of steers fed a diet with 13% crude protein without added amino acids. Beef steers [n = 161; body weight (BW) = 429.7 ± 44.5kg] were used in this experiment. Calves were randomly assigned to treatments consisting of 1) positive control diet (POS), formulated to contain 13.0 to 13.5% CP, 2) negative control (NEG) diet containing 10.2% CP, which also forms the basal diet for the remaining treatments, 3) rumen protected methionine (RPMet) 10.2% CP basal diet and 7.2 g/d supplemental methionine, 4) rumen protected lysine (RPLys) 10.2% CP basal diet and 18.5 g/d supplemental lysine, and 5) the combination of rumen protected lysine and methionine (RPMet+Lys) 10.2% basal diet with 7.2 and 18.5 g/d supplemental methionine and lysine, respectively. Initial and final BW were unaffected by treatment (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.24). Average daily gain for POS (1.93 kg/d <span>P</span> ≤ 0.02) was greater than those of NEG, RPLYS, and RPMET+LYS, but was similar to RPMET (1.86 kg/d; <span>P</span> = 0.17). Dry matter intake was greater in RPMET (12.1kg/d; <span>P</span> ≤ 0.10) compared with all other treatments. Gain-to-feed ratio was greatest in POS (0.170 kg gain:kg DMI; <span>P</span> ≤ 0.04). The impacts of rumen-protected amino acids on performance (intake, gain, and efficiency) of beef steers fed high-concentrate diets were inconsistent. Evaluating both lysine and methionine supplied independent of each other in various concentrations is critical before moving forward with recommendations for beef cattle.
