{"title":"Adjustments and Challenges of Rural Inter-Urban Mobility: Post-COVID Public Transport Trends in Sparsely Populated Regions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2199/v1","date":1727424906000,"content":"The aim of this research work consisted of assessing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the interurban public transport system in a rural region with a sparse population density, considering the number of tickets sold and passengers in each locality, as well as the different connecting lines. From a methodological point of view and with the intention of identifying patterns to explain the behaviour of both routes and passengers, a series of variables were selected, becoming determining factors that sought to offer a solution to the search for a common trend. Additionally, data processing by means of statistical analysis and the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools complemented the procedure. The results obtained in the investigation were provided both by municipality and by interurban route. An interesting finding of the research was the uneven recovery of the municipalities. The localities closest to the attractor nucleus have recovered more quickly to pre-pandemic mobility levels due to their geographical proximity, larger population, higher income per household and the need to access certain public services. In terms of routes, all lines showed significant decreases in ticket sales, although with variations. Although passenger numbers have shown a gradual recovery, the initial loss was considerable, and pre-pandemic normality has not been completely achieved. The authors consider that future research should include other alternative means of transport in these interurban areas, incorporating variables to characterise passengers, such as age, gender...etc.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"894cc76e8f44a50742e9bc4741c9957dab2a749c4ae5cdfb48cd57881c85ef4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
