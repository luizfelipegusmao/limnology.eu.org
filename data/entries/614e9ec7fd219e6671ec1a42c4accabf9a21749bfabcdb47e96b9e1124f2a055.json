Spatially sub-sampled STEM measurements allow for a reduction in the electron fluence necessary to recover a fully sampled image of a sample [<a href=\"#ozae044.205-B4\">4</a>], and the increased spatio-temporal distance between adjacent measurements reduces the overlap of the beam diffusion processes [<a href=\"#ozae044.205-B5\">5</a>].
