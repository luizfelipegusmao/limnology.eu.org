{"title":"Grains in a Modern Time; A Comprehensive Review on Compositions and Understanding their Role in Type 2 Diabetes and Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0502/v1","date":1717765947000,"content":"Globally, Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Cancer are the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and is considered to be one of the most significant public health concerns of the 21st century. Over the next two decades, the global burden is expected to increase by approximately 60%. Several observational studies as well as clinical trials have demonstrated the health benefits of consuming whole grains and lower the risk of several chronic non communicable diseases including T2D and cancer. Cereals grains are the primary source of energy in the human diet. The most widely consumed pseudo cereals include (quinoa, amaranth and buckwheat) and cereals (wheat, rice and corn). From a nutritional perspective, both pseudo cereals and cereals are recognized for their complete protein, essential amino acids, dietary fibres and phenolic acids. The bran layer of the seed contains the majority of these components. Greater intake of whole grains than refined grains has been consistently linked to a lower risk of T2D and cancer. Due to their superior nutritional compositions, whole grains make them a preferred choice over refined grains. The modulatory effects of whole grains on T2D and cancer are also likely to be influenced by several mechanisms, some of these effects may be direct; while others involve altering the composition of gut microbiota, increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria, and lowering harmful bacteria, increasing insulin sensitivity, lowering solubility of free bile acids, protein broken down into peptides and amino acids, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other beneficial metabolites that promote the proliferation in the colon which modulate the anti-diabetic and anti-cancer pathway. Thus the present review are two folded; first summarizes the recent knowledge about the nutritional composition and bioactive acids in pseudo cereals (quinoa, amaranth and buckwheat) and cereals (wheat, rice and corn); the second section summarizes and discusses the progress in recent human studies, such as observational (cross-sectional studies, case-control studies and cohort studies) and intervention studies in understanding their role in T2D and cancer including the potential mechanism. Overall according to the scientific data, whole grain consumption may reduce the incidence of T2D and cancer. Future studies should carry out randomized controlled trials to validate observational results and establish causality; in addition the current manuscript encourages to investigate the specific mechanisms by which whole grains exert their beneficial effects on health by examining the effects of different types of specific protein, dietary fibres and phenolic acids that might help to prevent or treat T2D and cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0da77c226cec95e940b3b73c1209a184ffdd833bebf976809c17819ef5994448","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
