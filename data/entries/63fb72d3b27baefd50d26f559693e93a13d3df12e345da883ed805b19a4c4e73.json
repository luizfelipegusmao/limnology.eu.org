{"title":"Understanding Landowner Education Needs for Invasive Disease Prevention and Restoration Planting in Southern Oregon","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jof/article/122/3/223/7577465?rss=1","date":1705536000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Understanding the knowledge and behavior of nonindustrial private forest landowners towards Port-Orford cedar (POC) root disease (<span>Phytophthora lateralis</span>), sudden oak death (<span>Phytophthora ramorum</span>), and disease-resistant seedlings can help target effective education and outreach programs. We surveyed two counties in Southern Oregon to gain knowledge about these pathogens, disease-resistant seedlings, landowner behavior, and landowner preferences regarding planting disease-resistant seedlings. Amenity-based management objectives were more associated with planting disease-resistant POC. Respondents were more likely to plant disease-resistant conifers than hardwoods. Disease-resistant planting preferences were associated with years owned and acres of ownership. Designing targeted education and outreach programs will be necessary to achieve broad scale adoption of disease management and restoration practices.<strong>Study implications:</strong> We present results from a survey of nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) landowners in two counties in Southern Oregon to determine general landowner characteristics and knowledge of two nonnative diseases, Port-Orford cedar root disease, caused by <span>Phytophthora lateralis</span>, and sudden oak death, caused by <span>Phytophthora ramorum</span>. NIPF landowners play meaningful roles in invasive disease management: recognizing and reporting symptoms of nonnative plant diseases with the objective of early detection and control, implementing management actions to help mitigate disease spread, and planting disease-resistant seedlings during restoration efforts. Understanding landowner knowledge about diseases is important for engaging them in insect and disease mitigation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Forestry Current Issue","siteHash":"f325018648ab04fba35e6e1191e9c9d953f9458bd233a7a41545c2e465328e3b","entryHash":"63fb72d3b27baefd50d26f559693e93a13d3df12e345da883ed805b19a4c4e73","category":"Environment"}
