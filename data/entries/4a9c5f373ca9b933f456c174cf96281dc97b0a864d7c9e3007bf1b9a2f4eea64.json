{"title":"Replies to Queries in Gynecologic Oncology by Bard, Bing and the Google Assistant","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0522/v1","date":1709905370000,"content":"Abstract: 1) Background: When women receive a diagnosis of a gynecologic malignancy, they can have questions about their diagnosis or treatment that can result in voice queries to virtual assistants. Recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the landscape of medical information accessibility. The Google virtual assistant (VA) outperformed Siri, Alexa, and Cortana in voice queries presented prior to the explosive implementation of AI in early 2023. The efforts presented here focus on determining if advances in AI in the last 12 months improved the accuracy of Google VA responses related to gynecologic oncology. (2) Methods: Previous questions were utilized to form a common basis for queries prior to 2023 and responses in 2024. Correct answers were obtained from the UpToDate medical resource. Responses related to gynecologic oncology were obtained using Google VA, as well as the generative AI chatbots Google Bard/Gemini and Microsoft Bing-Copilot. (3) Results: The AI narrative responses varied in length and positioning of answers within the response. Google Bard/Gemini achieved an 87.5% accuracy rate, while Microsoft Bing-Copilot reached 83.3%. In contrast, the Google VAâ€™s accuracy in audible responses improved from 18% prior to 2023 to 63% in 2024. (4) Conclusion: While the accuracy of the Google VA has improved in the last year, it underperformed Google Bard/Gemini and Microsoft Bing-Copilot so that there is considerable room for further improved accuracy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a9c5f373ca9b933f456c174cf96281dc97b0a864d7c9e3007bf1b9a2f4eea64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
