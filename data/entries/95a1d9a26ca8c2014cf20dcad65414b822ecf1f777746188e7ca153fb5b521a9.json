{"title":"The Impact and Mechanism Analysis of Diatomite on the Sag Resistance of Geopolymer Coatings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1251/v1","date":1713431992000,"content":"The reduction in rheological parameters and dissolution rate of precursors in geopolymer coatings during early hydration significantly contributes to sagging. This study aims to improve the sag resistance of these coatings by incorporating diatomite filler. Rheological testing was conducted to assess the impact of diatomite and its concentration on yield stress, plastic viscosity, and thixotropy of the geopolymer coatings. The results indicated that diatomite's large specific surface area and high reactivity have a significant influence on the rheological parameters and early dissolution rate of precursors. With a diatomite concentration of 1.1%, the coating exhibited a yield stress of 2.749 Pa and a plastic viscosity of 0.921 Pa·s, maintaining stability, homogeneity, and no sagging at a thickness of 600 μm. Furthermore, the highly active SiO2 in diatomite participates in the secondary hydration reaction of the geopolymer materials, leading to the formation of substantial C-(A)-S-H gel. This gel enhances internal interconnectivity within the coating, thereby improving its rheological and mechanical properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95a1d9a26ca8c2014cf20dcad65414b822ecf1f777746188e7ca153fb5b521a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
