{"title":"Integrating deep learning with non‐destructive thermal imaging for precision guava ripeness determination","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13614?af=R","date":1725860041000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>To mitigate post-harvest losses and inform harvesting decisions at the same time as ensuring fruit quality, precise ripeness determination is essential. The complexity arises in assessing guava ripeness as a result of subtle alterations in some varieties during the ripening process, making visual assessment less reliable. The present study proposes a non-destructive method employing thermal imaging for guava ripeness assessment, involving obtaining thermal images of guava samples at different ripeness stages, followed by data pre-processing. Five deep learning models (AlexNet, Inception-v3, GoogLeNet, ResNet-50 and VGGNet-16) were applied, and their performances were systematically evaluated and compared.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>VGGNet-16 demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving average precision of 0.92, average sensitivity of 0.93, average specificity of 0.96, average F1-score of 0.92 and accuracy of 0.92 within a training duration of 484 s.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study presents a scalable and non-destructive approach for guava ripeness determination, contributing to waste reduction and enhancing efficiency in supply chains and fruit production. These initiatives align with environmentally friendly practices in agriculture. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ee Soong Low, \nPauline Ong, \nJia Qing Sim, \nChee Kiong Sia, \nMaznan Ismon","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"d6734c4edaf22ad89a3138a3624522aef2cb927a644df5410263f23d98e806ab","category":"Environment"}
