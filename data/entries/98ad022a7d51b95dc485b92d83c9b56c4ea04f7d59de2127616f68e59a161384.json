At the same time, the veritable proliferation of open software packages to make use of this data has made such analyses widely accessible, and due to a convergence to the Python programming language, easy to compare in terms of computational efficiency and reconstruction quality.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"98ad022a7d51b95dc485b92d83c9b56c4ea04f7d59de2127616f68e59a161384","category":"Environment"}
