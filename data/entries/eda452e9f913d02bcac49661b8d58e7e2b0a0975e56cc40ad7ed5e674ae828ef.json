{"title":"Materials and Methods for All-cellulose 3D Printing in Sustainable Additive Manufacturing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0618/v1","date":1712645511000,"content":"Additive manufacturing, commonly referred to as 3D printing, is an exciting and versatile manufacturing technology that is gaining traction and interest in both academic and industrial settings. Polymeric materials are essential components in a majority of the “inks” used across the various 3D printing technologies. As the environmental ramifications of sole or primary reliance on petrochemicals as a resource for industrial polymers continue to manifest themselves at a global scale, a transition to more sustainable bioderived alternatives could offer solutions. In particular, cellulose is promising due to its global abundance, biodegradability, excellent thermal and mechanical properties, and ability to be chemically modified to suit various applications. Thus far, cellulose has typically been incorporated in additive manufacturing applications as a substrate, filler, or reinforcement for other materials. However, due to its versatility and desirable properties, the exploration of all-cellulose 3D printing materials and associated methodologies is increasing. This review will discuss the progress and status of all-cellulose 3D printing approaches, associated challenges, and their potential as a key player in a more sustainable industrial future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eda452e9f913d02bcac49661b8d58e7e2b0a0975e56cc40ad7ed5e674ae828ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
